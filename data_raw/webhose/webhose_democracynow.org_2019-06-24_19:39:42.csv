By Amy Goodman & Denis Moynihan
“Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech or of the press,” reads the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Yet, for the first time ever, a publisher is being prosecuted under the World War I-era Espionage Act. Julian Assange, co-founder of the whistleblower website WikiLeaks, is facing 170 years in prison if he is extradited to the U.S. from the United Kingdom. The case could deal a monumental blow to the free press in the United States.
The U.S. first charged Assange in April with attempting to help a U.S. Army whistleblower break into a military computer system, for which Assange would face up to five years in prison. Then, on May 23, the Justice Department released a superseding indictment, adding 17 espionage charges. The new charges, The New York Times editorial board wrote on the day they were announced, “could have a chilling effect on American journalism as it has been practiced for generations. It is aimed straight at the heart of the First Amendment.”
The New York Times was one of many news organizations that partnered with WikiLeaks in publishing material that it was provided anonymously. From its launch in 2007, WikiLeaks proved to be a reliable source for critical, documentary evidence of corporate and government malfeasance.
In 2007, WikiLeaks released a secret manual from the Guantanamo Bay prison, written in 2003, that instructed guards to deny prisoners access to the Quran and bar Red Cross visits in order to “exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee” — a violation of international human rights law. Not long after, the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Center produced a secret document — subsequently leaked to and released by WikiLeaks — that called WikiLeaks “a potential force protection, counterintelligence, operational security, and information security threat to the US Army.”
In April 2010, WikiLeaks made international headlines when it released a video showing the indiscriminate targeting and killing of civilians in Baghdad. The video was recorded July 12, 2007, by a U.S. military Apache helicopter gunship, and includes audio of military radio transmissions.
Two Reuters employees — Iraqi journalist Namir Noor-Eldeen and driver Saeed Chmagh — were killed in the attack, along with at least eight other people. Two children were critically injured. The radio transmissions show not only the utter callousness of the soldiers, laughing and swearing as they kill, but also the strict procedure they follow, ensuring that all of their attacks are clearly authorized by their chain of command.
Reuters had repeatedly requested information from the Pentagon related to the death of its two employees, but had received nothing. It took one brave whistleblower and WikiLeaks to reveal the horror of that helicopter attack, clear video evidence of a possible war crime.
The whistleblower was eventually identified as Pvt. Bradley Manning. Manning was jailed in solitary confinement in conditions that the United Nations described as tantamount to torture, then prosecuted and convicted. Immediately after being sentenced to 35 years in prison, Manning announced a gender transition, changing her name to Chelsea. President Barack Obama eventually commuted her sentence, and she was released from prison in May 2017.
Her ordeal was not over, however. In February 2019, she was called before a grand jury to testify about WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. She said that she had testified fully during her 2013 court-martial, and so refused to testify. For that, she was jailed for two months. She was then called before a second grand jury. Refusing to testify again, she has been imprisoned since May 16.
As for Julian Assange, he had been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, where he had been given political asylum. He fled to the embassy, fearful that he would be extradited to the United States. On April 11, British authorities entered the embassy and forcibly arrested him. He is now serving a 50-week sentence for violating the terms of his bail in a separate case.
Nils Melzer, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, said after visiting Assange in the British prison where he is being held that he “shows all the symptoms of a person who has been exposed to psychological torture for a prolonged period of time.” Assange was unable to appear in his most recent court hearing due to failing health.
Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said of the new indictment: “For the first time in the history of our country, the government has brought criminal charges against a publisher for the publication of truthful information. This is an extraordinary escalation of the Trump administration’s attacks on journalism, and a direct assault on the First Amendment.” This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today.

"""Advocate"": Israeli Attorney Lea Tsemel Reflects on Defending Palestinians Who Resist Occupation",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/14/lea_tsemel_advocate_documentary_israel_palestine,"longtime Israeli human rights lawyer. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. Attorney Lea Tsemel has defended Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli courts for nearly half a century, insisting on their humanity and their right to a fair trial. Her work has earned her the scorn and reprobation of many Israelis, as well as death threats. A staunch critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestine, Tsemel has long argued Palestinians who carry out politically motivated violence are freedom fighters, not “terrorists.” In 1999, Lea Tsemel won a landmark case in the Israeli Supreme Court, making it illegal for Israeli officials to torture detained Palestinians during interrogations. The documentary titled Advocate tells the remarkable story of Lea Tsemel’s life. This is the film’s trailer.
INTERVIEWER : [translated] My next guest is no doubt very controversial, right?
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] So they say!
INTERVIEWER : [translated] Good morning, attorney Lea Tsemel.
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] How do we reach the detention cells? With the elevator. Is it going down?
MAN IN ELEVATOR 1: [translated] Lea, what will become of you?
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] What do you think?
MAN IN ELEVATOR 1: [translated] When will you mend your ways?
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] Who? Me? I’m a lost cause.
MAN IN ELEVATOR 2: [translated] A rebel with a lost cause.
MAN IN ELEVATOR 1: [translated] A rebel with a lost cause.
INTERVIEWER : [translated] You defend terrorists and their families. I imagined you differently, taller and tougher.
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] I left my devil’s tail at home this time.
INTERVIEWER : [translated] You’ve been called that, no?
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] Yeah. “Devil” and stuff like that. I’ve been called every name in the book.
INTERVIEWER : [translated] Like what else?
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] “Traitor,”“leftist,”“devil’s advocate.” The usual.
INTERVIEWER : [translated] Does it hurt you?
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] No. There are times when being called those things is a compliment. I always took it as a compliment.
AMY GOODMAN : Advocate premiered at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. The documentary screened for the first time in New York City last night as the opening of the Human Rights Watch Film Festival. The film was recently named best picture in Tel Aviv’s annual Docaviv Film Festival. The Israeli cultural minister, Miri Regev, condemned the decision to honor the film.
Well, for more, we’re joined by Lea Tsemel herself, as well as the film’s director, Rachel Leah Jones.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! It’s wonderful to have you with us. Rachel, why don’t we begin with you, why you made this film?
RACHEL LEAH JONES : Why? Why do we make any film? Lea is the kind of Israeli I wanted to be. I mean, I grew up in Israel. I left. I came back as a young adult after the First Intifada. I had heard about her. I wanted to meet her. She was one of the first people I met when I went back as a young adult. And she modeled for me the kind of Israeli I wanted to be, somebody completely critical and completely, at the same time, not thinking of going anywhere else, just thinking: How do you—how do you get people to live together in that space, with full equality, and with, obviously, human rights, civil rights, it goes without saying, but just with a basic understanding that the place has to be shared in complete and full equality?
AMY GOODMAN : Lea Tsemel, talk about being an Israeli, how you grew up and what made you decide to represent Palestinians.
LEA TSEMEL : I would see myself as a typical Israeli, Sabra, if you want. I was born there in 1945 and then grew up with the state. And I was studying law in 1967 when the war broke. Until then, I would say, I was a normal, regular Israeli. And once the war broke, I realized that we were—we, the students, the people, were misled before the war to believe that this is a war for peace. Israel didn’t think of creating peace. And I found myself having to decide whether my humanity prevails, when I saw what happened to the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, or my Israeli loyalty would prevail.
And I chose my humanity. Therefore, when I became a lawyer, it was only natural that I will try to defend the underdogs, the Palestinians, while thinking all the time of a possible—the only possible solution to the conflict there: one, equality; two or one state—it doesn’t make a difference, really—but freedom for the Palestinians; a recognition of what we have caused to them; and ability to continue together with equality, which is the most important, equality, and freedom, of course, for both people.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to turn to a clip from the film Advocate that features Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, the longtime Palestinian diplomat and scholar.
HANAN ASHRAWI : And I was arrested. I was looking for a lawyer. And from that day on, I mean, Lea was really part of our experience of struggle at Birzeit University. During, you know, all these closures, during all these military incursions, the shootings, the arrests and so on, it was Lea who was there all the time.
PROTESTERS : Open Birzeit! Open Birzeit! Open Birzeit! Open Birzeit!
HANAN ASHRAWI : To us, being a prisoner is a fact of life. Every home, every family, has had at least one prisoner, if not more. And many families have had “martyrs.” Many families have had people, you know, deported. Many families have had their homes destroyed. But every family can tell you, “I have prisoners in my midst. The Israelis reached into my home and extracted my son, my daughter, my husband, my brother, and took him or her away.” And it was Lea who was there saying, “I will try to bring him or her back.”
Lea went to court to help our students. And I was nursing; I was breastfeeding Zeina. And Talila got hungry, so I breastfed her, as well. And so, now we have—they’re milk sisters. You see, in our tradition, when two babies are fed the same mother’s milk, they become sisters. And this is a very strong bond.
LEA TSEMEL : I really don’t feel the gap of a Palestinian, a Jew. I don’t think we ever had it between us.
HANAN ASHRAWI : She was very human. She was the only one, really, who recognized us, in the Greek sense of anagnorisis—you know, I recognize your humanity and what you’re going through. If you are fighting against injustice, and you don’t have any other tools, you adopt the tools that are available. You manufacture your own tools. Some people turn their bodies into tools. They don’t have warplanes. They don’t have tanks. They have bodies. And it doesn’t mean she condoned this or she thought it was right, but she said you have to understand it in the context within which this happened. This is a very difficult and rare situation, where you could look at the victim, cum violent person, and understand the motives for violence and understand that this is a response to a greater form of violence. You are not abstract labeled “terrorists.”
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, the longtime Palestinian diplomat and scholar. She was just on Democracy Now! a few weeks ago. Lea Tsemel, continue along the lines of what Dr. Hanan Ashrawi was talking about, who you come to represent—people who have been accused of violence, Palestinians who have been accused of violence, and those who simply have been arrested.
LEA TSEMEL : I think most of the people that I represent are Palestinians who are acting against the occupation, in this way or another, or that have been tackled with problems that the occupation created. Like, if we talk about Jerusalem, the Jerusalemite Palestinians have difficulties in getting a position, in getting their rights, in getting their identification cards, in getting family reunification, for instance. So, these are the civil aspects of the occupation that I’m also dealing with, beside, of course, people who have committed security offenses, as they call it. And I believe that I’m obliged to defend them. I believe they have the right to act against the occupation, like every person on this Earth has a right to act against any occupation. And I don’t try to condemn them. I try to be near them and have the—my ability as a lawyer and recruit the Israeli law to defend them.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s go to another clip from Advocate . Lea Tsemel, along with a team of human rights lawyers, argued before Israel’s Supreme Court against torture carried out by the Israeli security forces. In 1999, 20 years ago, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled the practice is illegal.
NARRATOR : [translated] After a decade of legal battles, they posed for a victory photo.
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] We made history today! What a moving decision, a just ruling, a warranted ruling. Too bad we didn’t conduct this struggle 30 years ago.
NARRATOR : [translated] Nine years, nine justices and one Supreme Court bottom line: “All interrogation methods that entail physical pressure are illegal.”
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] As soon as the Supreme Court handed down its decision, I knew that, for once, we’d won! The security service had been exposed. It was a wonderful feeling. I wanted to burst into song.
AMY GOODMAN : That was 20 years ago, Lea Tsemel. You won. You’re not used to winning. All of these years, 50 years, how many cases have you won?
LEA TSEMEL : First of all, it’s not my personal win. We were a group of lawyers, we were a group of human rights organizations, that have appealed for many, many years on this subject of torture. And it was a big victory. It’s true. The victory was somehow eaten away during the years. The security services found other ways, that some are also illegal. And the—
AMY GOODMAN : You’re saying that the security forces are continuing to torture Palestinians in prisons?
LEA TSEMEL : In this way or another, yeah, with permission, with authorization sometimes. But the situation continues. And the struggle continues. We know it very, very well. So, it was a highlight in the career, undoubtedly. There are not too many winnings we can talk about. There are many failures. And altogether, I think that the Israeli society has failed to rebut and fight against the occupation as we should.
AMY GOODMAN : Early in your career, talk about the Arab-Israeli Alliance, the group of young men who you represented, that are portrayed in Advocate .
LEA TSEMEL : You know, we all started as young, ambitious, hopeful revolutionaries, believing that we can change, here and now, the situation. And some of our leftist groups then even went further on to join a Palestinian leading group. And then they were, of course, detained and sentenced, with a lot of scandalous reactions, to 17 years in prison, like Udi Adiv, a kibbutznik who was the head of that group, and others. And since then, we didn’t see the repetitive of that phenomenon. We do see cooperation at times. You know, there is now BDS , so it’s more difficult to cooperate. But I still carry the dream of a common future that we share with the Palestinians, and I don’t see ourselves living there without this cooperation.
AMY GOODMAN : You also represented your own husband, Michel Warschawski—
LEA TSEMEL : Yeah, right.
AMY GOODMAN : —famous peace activist—
LEA TSEMEL : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : —when he was jailed as head of the Alternative Information Center.
LEA TSEMEL : Yes. He was charged with publishing, in his office, a booklet of how to sustain torture by the security forces and what are the security services’ methods of torture. And, of course, this was shoo-shoo. You cannot talk about it. You should not expose it. Especially, it was—they intended to write it in Arabic. So, of course, you cannot tell it to the Arabs. They would know what they are anticipating in the interrogation rooms. So, he was detained. And later on, very little came out of it, but he spent some time in prison. And—
AMY GOODMAN : So, you won, to a certain extent. At least you won your husband back.
LEA TSEMEL : Yeah, yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s go to a new clip of the documentary Advocate , featuring our guest, the pioneering Israeli attorney Lea Tsemel.
LEA TSEMEL : [translated] When I ask myself about red lines, I ask it in reverse. I don’t have a moral conflict with saying “yes,” but with saying “no.” That’s my contemplation. When am I allowed to say “no”? So I set the following “framework” for myself: I’m an Israeli occupier, no matter what I do. I “enjoy” the fruits of occupation, both bitter and sweet. And I didn’t manage, despite my moral obligation as an Israeli, to change the regime and its policies. On what moral grounds should I judge the people who resist my occupation? And hand out grades—”That’s good. That’s bad. If you’re a nonviolent demonstrator and they shoot you dead, you’re good. But if you have a knife and they shoot you dead, you’re bad.” Who gave me that right? So, in that sense, if the act is intended to resist the occupation, as such, I’ll take it on.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s another clip from Advocate , and that is Lea Tsemel speaking in Hebrew, translated. Advocate was just named best picture in Tel Aviv’s annual Docaviv Film Festival. The Israeli cultural minister, Miri Regev, condemned the decision to honor the film. Rachel Leah Jones, you’re the filmmaker. Your response to this?
RACHEL LEAH JONES : Docaviv was a huge surprise. We had five sold-out screenings. Roughly 1,800 Israeli Jews came to see the film in over the course of a week, and not a single person complained. On the contrary, people were crying, laughing, hugging, elated. It was beyond my wildest dreams or expectations for how a film like this could be received in this day and age in Israel. And we—
AMY GOODMAN : We have 10 seconds.
RACHEL LEAH JONES : And we won first prize. Miri Regev, the culture minister, has been condemning films like this since she came into power.
AMY GOODMAN : And the film is Oscar-qualified. That does it for this segment. We’ll do Part 2 , post it online at democracynow.org. Israeli human rights advocate Lea Tsemel, Rachel Leah Jones, director of Advocate .
That does it for our show. Welcome to the world, Ryan Joseph Crosby-Wallach. Congratulations to our colleagues. I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.

AMY GOODMAN : In London, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared before a magistrates’ court today, saying his life was “effectively at stake” if the U.K. honors an extradition request from the United States, where he faces 17 counts of espionage. Assange is the first journalist or publisher to be indicted under the World War I-era law.
While Assange’s case has dominated international headlines, far less attention has been paid to a friend of Julian Assange who’s been jailed in Ecuador since April 11th, the same day Assange was taken by force by British authorities from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. Ola Bini is a Swedish programmer and data privacy activist who lives in Ecuador. He has not yet been charged with any crimes, has not been permitted to post bail for his release. The U.S. Justice Department has now said they want to question Ola Bini. Critics say Bini is being targeted because he knew and had visited Assange multiple times at the embassy in London, as well as for his own activism. This is a statement from his lawyers, Carlos Soria speaking last month.
CARLOS SORIA : [translated] This is an embarrassment. Our client is somebody who is innocent and who has contributed to the entire world the development of information privacy. And now, just because he is a friend to Julian Assange or because he travels, they put him in prison. There are no words for this, and we will denounce it both nationally and internationally. … We cannot allow Ecuador to look like this, like a state that persecutes people for the books they read, for the technology they use or for the simple reason of having a friend who is currently being reproached by the world. Before, Assange was appreciated for letting the world know the atrocities committed in other parts of the world.
AMY GOODMAN : Still with us is Vijay Prashad, the director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research. Earlier this week, he published a piece about Ola Bini in the Daily Hampshire Gazette titled “My friend is in a prison in Ecuador.”
Why is he there? Why was he picked up, Vijay Prashad? Why was Ola Bini picked up and jailed in Ecuador the same day Julian Assange was forcibly removed from the Ecuadorean Embassy and put in the Belmarsh Prison in London?
VIJAY PRASHAD : You know, Amy, this is a difficult story for me. I have known Ola Bini for many years. It is still perplexing to myself and to the friends of Ola of why he’s in prison, the El Inca prison in Quito, Ecuador. We don’t know why he’s in prison. There’s no charge against him. There has been some allegations made about his friendship to Julian Assange, but, you know, Amy, if that’s a crime, you and I should be in jail, as well. We have also met him. We have, you know, understood that meeting him is itself not a criminal activity.
Ola Bini is a programmer who spent most of his life trying to create tools to help human rights activists create a shield against surveillance by governments. People who are in the tech world might know the programs called the Tor Browser or Enigmail. These things were developed by Ola. He moved to Ecuador partly because he felt that with the government of Rafael Correa, it would be a good place to do the kind of work he was doing—precisely the opposite of what people are alleging of him, that he broke into this, that and the other government materials. In fact, the opposite: He would create shields to prevent governments from breaking into the kind of databases held by human rights defenders. You’ve got to remember that in the Snowden—Edward Snowden’s revelations, he said that the NSA had been routinely attacking the servers of human rights and other civil society organizations. It was precisely Ola’s mission in life to protect those organizations.
He was picked up on April 11th at Quito airport, while he was on his way to an advertised martial arts training course in Japan. He’s been held in prison for two months. There have been two hearings. No bail has been allowed. And no charge has been put forward. The prosecution in Ecuador has made it seem like a sinister thing that Ola has many computers and Zip drives and so on. You know, when I travel to places, I carry about 10 to 12 Zip drives. That’s because I keep a Zip drive for each story. It’s got nothing in it to seem to be something, you know, sinister or bizarre. These are things that software developers have. They tried to make him seem like a sinister character.
I was even told by another reporter that people were asking if Ola was the code cracker for Julian Assange, which he of course was not, and could not have been the code cracker at all when the materials passed on by Chelsea Manning came to the WikiLeaks organization. You know, that was one of the allegations that was floating around, not put on paper. Ola only met Julian when he was already in the Ecuadorean Embassy, long after the revelations of—very important, crucial revelations that came from Chelsea Manning, also now in prison.
I personally feel that the U.S. government, in trying to make a case against Julian Assange, has sort of swept up people that it thinks might have some evidence against Julian, for instance, having Chelsea Manning once more in prison, having Ola sit in a prison in Ecuador, squeezing them to see if they can either provide evidence against Julian—in Chelsea’s case, she has said she will not do so; in Ola’s case, he says, “I don’t have any evidence”—or that they will point the investigators in a direction to get Julian. I mean, we’ve got to understand that there is a vendetta by the American state against Julian Assange. That’s very clear. And I think there’s a lot of collateral damage around the world in the U.S. state’s attempt to put Julian either in prison for the full length of his life or near that.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Ola Bini speaking last month to CNN en Español, CNN in Spanish.
OLA BINI : They will find nothing, because I haven’t done anything. The only thing I’ve done is being the friend of Julian Assange. … The minister of the interior, María Paula Romo, goes on TV, the same day as I’m detained at the airport, and talks, five hours before my detention order is written—says on TV that I’m detained. That feels to me like the government is out to get me.
REPORTER : Why do you have the impression that Moreno hates you?
OLA BINI : I don’t say in my letter that he hates me. I wonder if he hates me, because subjecting me to something like this, this kind of process where I’m put in prison without any evidence, when I know that I’m innocent because I haven’t done anything, that feels personal to me.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Ola Bini, again, speaking with CNN from jail. He was also asked by CNN about his relationship with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
OLA BINI : Just as me, he believes very strongly in the right to privacy. So, the first time I went, I actually went to talk to him about these kind of things. … I kept coming back because I like him, because he’s a friend of mine, and I kept coming back because more and more people abandoned him. … I felt that it was my responsibility to do it. But also, it was my pleasure as a friend.
AMY GOODMAN : So, Vijay Prashad, if you could comment further? Again, he’s speaking from jail to CNN . In the case of Julian Assange, we understand that Ecuador was handing over all of his electronic equipment, his hard drives, etc., to the British government. What’s happening with Ola Bini’s electronic equipment, his phones, his computers? Has the U.S. requested that equipment?
VIJAY PRASHAD : Well, the United States has been giving the Ecuadorean officials so-called, you know, expertise and help in breaking some of the barriers that Ola–you know, Ola is a very clever person. He has put all kinds of protections to his materials. These are basically off-the-shelf protections called OTR , Off the Record, and so on. So, the Americans initially said that they were going to just assist the Ecuadoreans. Now it seems that the U.S. government has asked for this material to be handed over to the United States directly.
I just want to say something about Ecuador. You know, Ola was asked in that interview if Lenín Moreno hates him. That’s the president of Ecuador. It’s very important to remember that shortly before the Ecuadorean government handed over Julian Assange to the British police, the International Monetary Fund provided Ecuador with a loan of $4.2 billion, and there was also a commercial package of about $6 billion, so a total of $10 billion was transferred to the Ecuadorean government by the auspices of the IMF . This happened just before Julian Assange was handed over to the British authorities, just before Ola was arrested. I mean, we’ve got to understand the position. When you look at these things in sequence, it looks like there must have been a deal. This big, huge package was given to the Ecuadoreans.
At the same time, you know, there’s been an enormous leak of private information from the phone and Gmail account of President Moreno. This information, called the I-N-A or INA Papers, shows direct corruption by Mr. Moreno, including an apartment in Madrid, Spain, and so on. He’s been deeply embarrassed by this and has been lashing out, saying that there are Russian hackers inside Ecuador. In fact, the first arrest of Ola at the airport, the piece of paper he was shown had a Russian name on it, and it was said that it’s a Russian person. When Ola said, “That’s not me. I’m not Russian,” they took the paper away, went back, made a new document with Ola’s name on it and saying he was Swedish, and picked him up.
So, there’s a very strange story here, Amy. We don’t know all the parts of it yet, but we need to put the IMF into the picture. I think we need to put the fact that there’s pressure from the United States on Ecuador now, first, of course, to hand over Julian Assange, and now to, you know, in a sense, do something—we don’t know what—to Ola Bini.
AMY GOODMAN : And very quickly, have you spoken to him in jail? What are the conditions like there?
VIJAY PRASHAD : The conditions are very difficult for Ola. Ola is a vegetarian. He has had a hard time there. And as he said very early into his arrest, that the conditions in Ecuador are bad for all prisoners, Ecuadorean and himself, who is a Swedish person living in Ecuador. He is a very decent and upstanding person. He refused to allow this to become merely about himself, saying the conditions for Ola Bini are bad; he said directly, they’re bad for everybody.
AMY GOODMAN : And Sweden—
VIJAY PRASHAD : But it’s been very difficult—
AMY GOODMAN : Is Sweden doing anything about getting him out?
VIJAY PRASHAD : The Swedish government called in the Ecuadorean ambassador, but Sweden has very little leverage on Ecuador. In fact, it doesn’t have an ambassador in Ecuador, just a counsel. We are hoping that pressure from the U.N. special rapporteur, David Kaye, who has called this an arbitrary detention, will have some impact on other European countries. Even the OAS special rapporteur has said that this is a very arbitrary, dangerous situation, should not be allowed. But, you know, the ability of these U.N. rapporteurs to move an agenda is very limited. And I’m afraid that the pressure from the United States government on Ecuador has basically invalidated the moral standing of European countries and even the United Nations.
AMY GOODMAN : Vijay Prashad, I want to thank you very much for being with us, director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research. We will continue to follow Ola Bini’s case, as well as the case of Julian Assange, both picked up more than two months ago.

Vijay Prashad: U.S. Rushes to Blame Iran for Tanker Attacks as Much of World Pushes for Diplomacy,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/14/us_blames_iran_oil_tankers_attack,"director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research and author of The Poorer Nations: A Possible History of the Global South .

AMY GOODMAN : Tensions between the U.S. and Iran are again ratcheting up as the U.S. accused Iran of orchestrating an attack Thursday on Japanese and Norwegian oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Iran denied any involvement and accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage diplomacy. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo directly accused Iran of attacking the oil tankers, just hours after the incident.
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO : It is the assessment of the United States government that the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the attacks that occurred in the Gulf of Oman today. This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.
AMY GOODMAN : On Thursday night, the United States also released video of which it claimed was Iran’s Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded mine from the side of the Japanese oil tanker attacked. However, the president of the Japanese company that owns the ship said it was not attacked by mines but two flying objects. He also said he does not believe any objects were attached to the side of the ship. Iranian ships did approach the oil tankers after the attack, but, according to multiple news accounts, the Iranians helped rescue dozens of crew members from the tankers.
The timing of the incident also raised many questions as it came as the Japanese prime minister was visiting Iran in an attempt to bring Iran and the United States to the negotiating table. Iranian-American Trita Parsi said, quote, “Sounds like some are afraid Japan may succeed in starting diplomacy. The message appears to be: Don’t you dare stand in the way of my war plans,” Trita Parsi said. Last month, the U.S. blamed Iran for attacking four other oil tankers in the Persian Gulf but offered no evidence.
Well, for more, we’re joined now by Vijay Prashad, director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, chief editor of LeftWord Books. He’s also the chief correspondent of Globetrotter . He is the author of several books, including The Poorer Nations: A Possible History of the Global South .
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Vijay Prashad. Respond to what’s happening right now in the Gulf of Oman.
VIJAY PRASHAD : Hello, Amy. It’s, I think, important to pay attention to the words you just used. You said that only hours after the attack or the bombings in the Norwegian and Japanese tanker, the U.S. Secretary of State went out there and blamed Iran—hours after. You know, it’s very interesting. There’s a kind of rush to blame Iran for anything that’s been happening around the Gulf of Hormuz.
People who look closely at the oil business understand that 50% of the world’s oil goes through the Gulf of Hormuz. They understand that, you know, carrying oil is a dangerous activity. All kinds of things happen. There are accidents. There’s piracy. There are a series of quite common risks faced by oil tankers. Iran is not one of those high on the list as far as risk assessors are concerned. And yet, of course, this is the first thing the United States government has said, as you said, without any evidence. So, within a few hours and without any evidence, the United States government once more provoking some sort of response from Iran, perhaps, or at least to try to galvanize public opinion to believe that Iran is a threat to the world.
What’s really important here is, yes, the fact that Shinzo Abe, the first Japanese prime minister to visit Iran in 41 years, he goes to Iran shortly after the Iranian foreign minister visited him in Japan. In fact, Mr. Zarif visited Shinzo Abe in his home. They had a very important conversation, where Shinzo Abe said that the Iranian nuclear deal is a factor of stability for West Asia. You know, this goes directly opposed to the Trump administration’s view. And what’s very important here is we’re not talking about a country that’s far from the American orbit. This is Japan, a reliable ally of the United States, which is not only reliant upon Iranian oil but understands that the warmongering in West Asia is going to be very bad, not only for Eurasia, but for the world. And I think we need to understand that as Shinzo Abe is in Japan [ sic ], this attack or this, you know, sabotage, or whatever it is—
AMY GOODMAN : Is in Iran.
VIJAY PRASHAD : —took place on the Norwegian and Japanese tankers.
AMY GOODMAN : Again, as Shinzo Abe is in Iran.
VIJAY PRASHAD : That’s right. He was in Tehran, the first time in 41 years. And he has been saying, actually—interestingly, this is a right-wing prime minister; this is not a person of the left. He has been saying that there needs to be a return to the table.
It’s not only Japan saying this, Amy; it’s also the Europeans. The Europeans are very keen that the U.S. not break fully from this Iran deal. The Germans, in fact, have been looking for an alternative mechanism for payments. You know, India, which was one of the largest purchasers of Iranian oil, had to back off because of these new, very tight sanctions put in place by the U.S. government. But the Indians are also not that interested in this new approach by the Trump administration. They would like to continue to buy oil.
In fact, it’s a kind of isolation that the United States is facing. It’s isolated alongside the Israelis, the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates. Nobody else wants war. Nobody else wants this deal to end. And so, I think it’s really out of frustration that you see the United States jump the gun, come in very quickly and say that, you know, “Iran is doing this, Iran is doing that, and therefore we have to retaliate.”
It’s important to remember that in 2017 the CIA created a special unit called the Iran Mission Center, run by Michael D’Andrea. And this is an important outfit, because its entire mandate has been to ratchet up pressure on Iran. Now, I don’t know what happened to the Norwegian oil tanker or the Japanese oil tanker, but I’d be very interested to hear what the Iran Mission Center at the CIA has been up to since 2017.
AMY GOODMAN : Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted Thursday, “Reported attacks on Japan-related tankers occurred while PM @AbeShinzo was meeting with Ayatollah @Khamenei_ir for extensive and friendly talks. Suspicious doesn’t begin to describe what likely transpired this morning. Iran’s proposed Regional Dialogue Forum is imperative,” he said. Vijay Prashad?
VIJAY PRASHAD : You know, Mr. Zarif is a very capable diplomat, a very reasonable person. He has been leading Iranian diplomacy and has opened many doors to a diplomatic solution for the standoff around Iran. And I think we need to take seriously what Mr. Zarif is saying here. When he uses the word “suspicious,” I think we should underline that word. Again, I’m not saying what happened in the Gulf of Hormuz is very clear, that there are alternative explanations. We don’t know what happened. We should be suspicious of the narrative put forward by the U.S. State Department, but we should also be suspicious about what happened. We need to ask more questions.
I mean, consider this from a regional standpoint. The United States, the Russians and others are in the middle of a very serious diplomatic effort in Afghanistan. There are meetings that the U.S. has held in Doha, Qatar, there are meetings that the Russians have held in Moscow, to dial down the almost 19-year war that has been taking place in Afghanistan. Imagine if the United States strikes against Iran right now. It would bring catastrophe further to Afghanistan. It would open up the wounds in Iraq and in Syria. Mr. Zarif has made it very clear that an attack on Iran is not merely an attack on Iran, it’s going to create even more catastrophe in that region. That’s one of the main reasons, Amy, why the Chinese are very interested in not allowing any kind of war in that region. They have a lot at stake, especially in terms of their Belt and Road Initiative, which cuts right through this region, goes through Iran. Nobody wants a war here.
It’s important for Americans to understand that the U.S. government is deeply isolated on this issue of Iran and on the way that the U.S. government portrays Iran. In the rest of the world, Iran is seen as a stabilizing force in that region. For some strange reason, the U.S. government believes that Iran is an interloper. In other words, there are almost 80 million Iranians who live in West Asia, and they somehow are seen to be out of place, whereas the United States, which is, you know, thousands of miles away, portrays itself as a regional actor. This is very bizarre for people around the world. And I think Americans need to understand that.
AMY GOODMAN : On Thursday, members of the House Armed Services Committee from both parties said Pompeo told them in a classified briefing that the United States could use the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, or AUMF , to attack Iran without congressional approval. This is the Michigan Democrat Elissa Slotkin.
REP . ELISSA SLOTKIN : We were absolutely presented with a full formal presentation on how the 2001 AUMF might authorize war on Iran. Yes, I’m sorry, sir, Secretary Pompeo said it with his own words.
AMY GOODMAN : The AUMF was passed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and authorizes the president to take military action against those responsible, along with any, quote, “associated forces.” Your response to that, Vijay Prashad? And what role do you think Saudi Arabia is playing in all of this?
VIJAY PRASHAD : I mean, look, this is very chilling, very disturbing. You know, they are marching us directly into a war. In other words, they are marching the world into war. They are pushing Iran. The sanctions have had a catastrophic impact on Iran’s external revenues, its ability to earn money. There is, you know, a serious medical crisis inside the country. I think focus should be on that. You know, we’ve already seen how sanctions destroy countries, how they put a lot of stress on the country. But that’s not the focus of anybody’s attention. You know, we’re allowing people like Mr. Pompeo, John Bolton and others to set the agenda here. They are being allowed to say that Iran is a criminal country and must be therefore attacked. I think this is very disturbing.
Saudi Arabia, of course, is playing a lead role in this. I mentioned the Iran Mission Center. Mr. Michael [D’Andrea] is very close to the Saudis, in fact has played an important role in the CIA’s drone program and is likely to have had some role in the Saudi war on Yemen. So, I mean, this is something for people to consider.
This very quick march to war must be stopped. I mean, the reason I’m saying this, it’s not just about Iran; it’s about the region, it’s about Eurasia. And the Trump administration, I think, is playing fast and loose with the facts and is being very reckless with world affairs on this. You know, we see the Trump administration behaving recklessly, mercurially perhaps, in other parts of the world. That’s true. But with Iran, I think their finger is right on the trigger. And the very fact that Pompeo gave this briefing should suggest to people that this is not the time to be cynical, to sit back and say, “I don’t think they’re going to do it.” It’s very likely that the United States is going to make some strike on Iran, and that strike is going to open further the gates of hell for the region.
AMY GOODMAN : Vijay Prashad, director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, chief editor of LeftWord [Books], we are going to break right now, and when we come back, I want to ask you about the extradition proceedings that have begun against Julian Assange, who’s in the Belmarsh Prison in London, and look at why one of his friends, the internet activist Ola Bini, has been jailed in Ecuador for over two months, picked up the same day as Julian Assange.

The head of the Federal Elections Commission warned Thursday that candidates for public office are prohibited by law from receiving help from a foreign government. The warning was a clear rebuke to Donald Trump after the president told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos this week that he might accept “dirt” on political rivals from foreign actors in the 2020 election.
George Stephanopoulos : “Your campaign this time around, if foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on opponents, should they accept it, or should they call the FBI ?”
President Donald Trump : “I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don’t—there’s nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country—Norway—’We have information on your opponent.’ Oh. I think I’d want to hear it.”
George Stephanopoulos : “You want that kind of interference in our elections?”
President Donald Trump : “It’s not an interference. They have information. I think I’d take it.”
In a statement posted online one day after Trump’s remarks aired on ABC , FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub said, “Let me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office. It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. This is not a novel concept.” Topics:"

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We continue our discussion about press freedom in Australia, where Federal Police swept into the headquarters of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Sydney on Wednesday. Officers reviewed thousands of documents for information about a 2017 report that found Australian special forces soldiers may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan. Wednesday’s raid on ABC came one day after police in Melbourne raided the home of Annika Smethurst, a reporter with the Herald Sun newspaper.
AMY GOODMAN : Still with us from Brisbane, Australia, is Peter Greste, UNESCO chair in journalism and communications at the University of Queensland. He’s a founding director of Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom. And Peter Greste was imprisoned for over a year, for 400 days, in 2013 and 2014, in Egypt, while covering the political crisis there, along with his two Al Jazeera colleagues. In Perth, Australia, we’re joined by Joseph Fernandez, media law academic at Curtin University and Australia’s correspondent for Reporters Without Borders.
Joseph Fernandez, in Part 1 , you described more in detail the story that Annika Smethurst was investigating. Can you now go into what it was that ABC was investigating around special forces in Australia?
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : The ABC story led to a publication called “The Afghan Files,” which was an investigative piece that spoke about serious allegations against Australian soldiers, that they may have committed unlawful killings during Australia’s longest war. And allegations were made that unarmed civilians were killed. And they quoted a whistleblower, who subsequently identified himself, and he claimed to have witnessed the killing of innocent people. And the strange thing about this was, when we talk about a breach of national security, that event occurred a few years ago, and the soldiers concerned were no longer in the conflict zone, so it’s hard to envisage what kind of danger they might have been placed in or what really the national security justifications were to prevent this information from reaching the public domain.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But the actual report by Australian Broadcasting was about a year ago, wasn’t it?
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : Yes.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And so, why the raids now?
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : Yes. That was a question on many people’s minds, and particularly why the raids so soon after the new government had been returned to power. There were some speculations and some suggestion that the police did not wish this event to clutter up the election politicking, that this was now a safe period during which to launch this action. We don’t know the real answers to these questions, but they are being asked by many people.
AMY GOODMAN : Joseph, how did the media establishment, of which ABC is a core, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation—how did it respond to these raids?
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : Oh, there has been a near-unanimous outrage across the media. And interestingly, two establishments who are often on different sides of the fence, so to speak, were quite united in condemning this. And I’m referring to News Corp, with which Annika Smethurst works, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The different media entities, players, activists have all unanimously come together to defend press freedom, freedom of expression, and to stand up against this sort of intimidatory, bullying behavior on the part of government agencies.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Peter Greste, could you talk about whether Australia is alone in this kind of activity? I mean, we’re seeing, obviously, in many countries across the world, leaders coming to power who will either beat up on the press or see the press as a state security threat. Could you talk about the international context here?
PETER GRESTE : Yeah, sure. Look, and there are a couple of people who’ve suggested that Australia is one of the most—is one of, if not the most, restrictive environments, democratic environments, in the Western world. And that might be overstating it a little bit, but there’s a very well-known law professor, George Williams, who’s been keeping track of national security legislation, and he’s counted more than 70 pieces of national security legislation that were passed in Australian Parliament since 9/11. And that is an absolutely extraordinary number. And a lot of them really do intrude on press freedom and freedom of speech in all sorts of insidious ways.
Now, as I said earlier, I think this is—it’s too much to suggest that Australia is about to become an authoritarian state. But the kinds of things that we’ve seen take place here in Australia, I think, is a fair way down the spectrum, the same spectrum that we’re seeing taking place in all sorts of other corners of the world, including places like Turkey, which is the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, and Egypt and elsewhere, where national security legislation is being used as an excuse to both clamp down on the press and lock up pesky journalists who are reporting things that are deeply politically embarrassing, politically uncomfortable to governments.
I mean, if you look at the CPJ’s, the Committee to Protect Journalists’ statistics, their analysis of the journalists in prison show that, of the 250-odd that are behind bars, more than two-thirds of them are there on what the CPJ calls anti-state charges. Those are state charges like treason, sedition, terrorism and so on—national security charges, which is precisely the kinds of things that we saw being used here. Now, they weren’t exactly being—they weren’t being charged with terrorism, of course, but these were national security laws that were being used to effectively shut down stories that weren’t threatening national security but were politically embarrassing. What happened to me in Egypt, I think, was a pretty extreme example of that, but I think it is on the same spectrum as what happened to us in Australia last week and what we’re seeing in all sorts of places around the world.
AMY GOODMAN : You know, the image of you and your Al Jazeera colleagues, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, the two other journalists who you were arrested with in Egypt as you were covering the Arab Spring—the images of you in the cage in court, I’m just wondering, as you went through what you did, not being given information about why you were being held on trumped-up charges, being held for over a year—you know, that image of a journalist in a cage, as we’re showing right now, very much aligns with what the president of the United States—how he talks about journalists, as the enemy of the people. And I’m wondering if you think what President Trump says empowers other governments, democracies and non-democracies, to go after journalists. Does it scare you when he talks about journalists in this way?
PETER GRESTE : Look, without a doubt, there is no question that President Trump’s remarks have empowered other authoritarian states to take these kinds of draconian measures. I remember there was a fantastic editorial in a newspaper in Africa that said that, look, if an African government was going to be using these kinds of remarks, then the United States and the Western world would have condemned them as being anti-democratic, as outrageously authoritarian. And to see those kinds of remarks coming out of the United States, which for the rest of the world for so long has been seen as a bastion of freedom of the press and free speech, is not only deeply troubling, but it does allow other governments to—or it’s a nod and a wink, I guess, a dog whistle, to other governments to say that you’re free to go ahead with these kinds of actions, you’re free to imprison journalists.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And are there any expectations of new legislation being able to be passed in Australia, especially given the new government, in terms of greater protections for journalists in the future?
PETER GRESTE : You know, a few weeks ago, before the raid, my organization, the Alliance for Journalists’ Freedom, published a white paper that included seven recommendations for legislative reform. We proposed a Media Freedom Act, to do pretty much the job of the First Amendment in the United States, and a number of other legislative reforms that we think will help protect both journalists and their sources. And curiously enough, the idea of—or, not surprising, I guess, is the idea of a Press Freedom Act has really taken a very high-profile position in the debate around this particular—after these particular raids. And I think that there’s a pretty good chance that it will stay on the agenda now. I mean, these raids have really fired up the public. It’s unified the press in ways I don’t think anyone in the Federal Police or in government ever really anticipated. And I think it’s incumbent on us journalists and anybody who really cares about the health of democracy to line up behind us and really push the government to see some kind of legislative reform.
Now, of course, we’ve seen these kinds of situations before, where opportunities have come and gone and we haven’t seen any kind of substantive change. So I wouldn’t—I’m not going to put—I’m not going to bet the farm on this. But I reckon that we are in a better position now than we’ve been for many years to really push legislation, because I think Australians recognize that even if they don’t necessarily love the press, they certainly don’t trust politicians to—or they don’t trust—they don’t necessarily think that relying on politicians’ Facebook posts and Twitter feeds is really an effective way to run government, that we really do need a free press to hold government to account.
AMY GOODMAN : And, Joseph Fernandez, what are you calling for right now in Australia? What do you think has to happen?
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : I think, as Peter has just mentioned, this event, these raids that just happened, has shown a very bright light on the perilous state of the protection of rights and freedoms in this country. And chances are it will not stop at merely press freedom but all other sorts of freedoms.
Once again, we are hearing people raise the prospect of a bill of rights. A bill of rights, as you would be aware, covers a whole range of things, not just press freedom. And it has been spoken of in more strong terms these days. But whether we will get something as comprehensive and as deep and far-reaching as we would like is another question. Having said that, in three Australian jurisdictions, we already have some kind of instrument, a bill of rights, a charter of rights and responsibilities, so this is not an alien concept to Australian society. There are differences of opinion whether a bill of rights on its own would resolve the problem.
As far as journalists are concerned, I think there’s no getting away from the fact that if journalists’ sources are not assured of confidentiality when they seek that confidentiality, then we are in deep trouble. And this is why most Australian jurisdictions in recent years have enacted laws providing a qualified privilege for the protection of journalists’ confidential sources. But what has happened is, something else has happened totally separately from the passage of these laws that have collided with the protections that politicians agreed on should be given to journalists. And I think now is a good time to review the entire state of laws that impact on rights and freedoms, including for journalists, and to put our house in order.
AMY GOODMAN : Professor Fernandez, just one last question. Unfortunately, we’ve lost Peter Greste now from the satellite. But the U.S. has submitted its formal extradition request for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, according to media reports. The indictment, filed in May, charges him with one count of conspiring to hack into a government computer and 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act, the first-ever case of a journalist or publisher being indicted under the World War I-era U.S. law. Assange currently being held behind bars at London’s Belmarsh Prison for skipping bail in 2012, after he’s being forcefully removed from the Ecuadorean Embassy by British police in April. His lawyers and the U.N. rapporteur on torture have warned of his deteriorating health due to his ongoing detention and years of what the rapporteur described as “psychological torture.” He is a fellow Australian. I’m wondering your thoughts on the significance of this really global case, with the U.S. now calling for his extradition and charging him with espionage.
JOSEPH FERNANDEZ : Yeah. Thank you for the question. There is no doubt that what’s happening to journalism in the world today is quite heavily influenced by what the whistleblowers and whistleblower organizations, such as WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, have done in the past. And so, it appears to me that Julian Assange is being made a scapegoat, even though there are, among journalists themselves, those who are not that prepared to consider him a journalist. I will leave that debate for another occasion; it’s a very complex one. But if you look at what information comes out of the act of whistleblowing, I think that’s where our focus should be, whether the information that is being leaked through whistleblowing activities is information that the public is not entitled to know. And I think, in most cases, the answer to that question will be, there is no justification to keep that kind of information under wraps.
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you so much for being with us, Joseph Fernandez, media law academic at Curtin University, Australia’s correspondent for Reporters Without Borders. He was speaking to us from Perth. Peter Greste, UNESCO chair in journalism and communications at the University of Queensland, was held by Egyptian authorities in prison for over a year with two of his Al Jazeera colleagues, speaking to us from Brisbane, Australia.

The study’s author, professor Neta Crawford, said, “Climate change is not a potential risk. It has begun, with real consequences to the United States. Failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will make the nightmare scenarios strategists warn against—perhaps even 'climate wars'—more likely.” Topics:"

Human rights groups are condemning Saudi Arabia’s mass execution of 37 prisoners accused of terrorism and espionage. Amnesty International says 11 of the men put to death were convicted of spying for Iran after what it called a “grossly unfair trial.” Amnesty says least 14 others were convicted for participating in anti-government protests between 2011 and 2012. Amnesty says the 14 men were tortured in order to have “confessions” extracted from them. One prisoner’s body and severed head were put on display in a public crucifixion. In response, Maya Foa, director of the British legal charity Reprieve, said, “That the Saudi regime believes it has impunity to carry out such patently illegal executions, without notice, should shock its international partners into action.” Topics: Human Rights The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

Julian Assange Says His Life Is at Stake as U.S. Seeks His Extradition | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,Democracy Now,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/14/headlines/julian_assange_says_his_life_is_at_stake_as_us_seeks_his_extradition,"Julian Assange Says His Life Is at Stake as U.S. Seeks His Extradition Headline Jun 14, 2019
In London, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared before a magistrates’ court today, saying his life was “effectively at stake” if the U.K. honors a U.S. request for his extradition. Assange appeared by videolink from the high-security Belmarsh Prison, where he’s serving a 50-week sentence for skipping bail in 2012 when he took refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. U.S. prosecutors have indicted Assange on 18 counts, including 17 violations of the Espionage Act, in the first-ever case of a journalist or publisher being indicted under the World War I-era law. Later in the broadcast, we’ll look at why one of Assange’s friends, the internet activist Ola Bini, has been jailed in Ecuador for over two months. They were arrested on the same day. Topics: "

In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian medic Mohammed Sobhi al-Judeili succumbed to his wounds and died in a hospital Monday, after he was shot in the head by Israeli snipers while serving with the Red Crescent at a protest near Israel’s separation barrier. He was the fourth medic killed by Israeli forces since weekly nonviolent protests began last year under the banner “Great March of Return.” In February, a panel of U.N. investigators found Israeli forces may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity by targeting the protesters with lethal force—including children, journalists and the disabled. This comes as Israel says it will indefinitely bar Palestinian fishing boats from the Mediterranean. Since 2006, Israel has increasingly restricted Gaza fishing vessels from sailing far beyond shore, severely limiting their catch in a territory where more than 10% of children are chronically malnourished. Later in the broadcast, we’ll speak with attorney Lea Tsemel, who has defended Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli courts for nearly half a century, as well as with the director of a new film about her titled “Advocate.” Topics:"

In Texas, authorities have recovered the bodies of seven migrants from waterways near the U.S.-Mexico border within the last week. All seven appear to have drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande, which is swollen from spring snowmelt and heavy rains. Elsewhere in Texas, attorneys visiting a migrant processing center in McAllen discovered the U.S. Border Patrol holding a 17-year-old Guatemalan mother and her prematurely born 1-month-old girl, who was described as tiny, lethargic, cold to the touch and not eating. The mother was in a wheelchair and still recovering from a cesarean section and had barely slept. Immigrant rights attorney Hope Frye said the baby belonged in a hospital neonatal unit, adding, “You look at this baby and there is no question that this baby should be in a tube with a heart monitor.” Both the infant and her 17-year-old mother are considered unaccompanied minors. Under federal law, they should have been released to the Office of Refugee Resettlement within 72 hours but had been held by the Border Patrol since June 4 until they were reportedly released on Thursday.

In Michigan, state prosecutors dropped all criminal charges Thursday against eight government officials blamed for poisoning the water supply of Flint with toxic lead, pledging to start over and expand their investigation into the Flint water crisis. The move drew alarm from Flint residents—but also hope that more people might ultimately be held accountable. The crisis began in 2014 when Flint’s unelected emergency manager, appointed by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, switched the source of the city’s drinking water in order to save money. The move has been linked to at least 12 deaths from an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, as well as widespread lead poisoning in residents, including children. Earlier this month, the AP reported authorities used search warrants to seize the state-owned mobile devices of former Governor Snyder and 66 other current or former officials, raising the prospect of a far wider criminal probe under Michigan’s newly elected Attorney General Dana Nessel. Prosecutors said they won’t answer questions about the revamped probe until after a public meeting in Flint planned for June 28.

Iran’s atomic energy agency has announced it is just 10 days away from exceeding the limit of enriched uranium stockpile permitted under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Iran started rolling back its compliance with the landmark agreement last month, following the U.S. withdrawal and the reimposition of sanctions last year. On Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reiterated his ultimatum to European nations and other signatories that they must show “positive signals” in upholding the pact for Iran to maintain its commitment, as well. This comes as the United States continues to blame Iran for attacking two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman Thursday without offering any new evidence. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. is considering a full range of options. Some of the U.S. claims have been directly contradicted by the Japanese owner of one of the tankers. Iran has denied any involvement and accused the Trump administration of trying to sabotage diplomacy. Topics:"
"""16 Shots"": Chicago Police Killing of Laquan McDonald Exposed a System Built on Lies",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/17/16_shots_rick_rowley_showtime_documentary,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we turn to a remarkable new documentary that just premiered on Showtime. The film is called 16 Shots . It examines the 2014 murder of African-American teenager Laquan McDonald in Chicago. This is the trailer.
UNIDENTIFIED : Chicago Police Department averages maybe 30 police shootings a year.
WILLIAM CALLOWAY : I think it’s a level of people being desensitized from the violence.
JEFFREY NESLUND : When you look at the police reports that were signed off, it’s a justified shooting.
GARRY McCARTHY: If somebody gets near you with an open knife, I’m sorry, but that’s a threat.
PASTOR MARVIN HUNTER : What the local news put out there—
PAT CAMDEN : An individual with a knife coming at the officer.
PASTOR MARVIN HUNTER : —that is not the story. This boy been shot, and it’s a lot of bullet holes in him.
JAMIE KALVEN : There is police dash cam video that contradicts the official story.
JEFFREY NESLUND : What we saw was, in our opinion, first-degree murder.
CHARLENE CARRUTHERS : There is an escalation of involvement from people across the city.
PASTOR MARVIN HUNTER : Justice for us is Jason Van Dyke being convicted of the murder of Laquan McDonald.
WILLIAM CALLOWAY : He was their son. He was their brother. He was them.
KIM FOXX : Chicago has not had to reckon with what happens when you don’t hold folks in law enforcement accountable.
JAMIE KALVEN : Almost overnight, the power and legitimacy of city institutions cratered.
UNIDENTIFIED : There’s 86 minutes that are missing.
GARRY McCARTHY: The Laquan case was not a cover-up.
PROTESTERS : Sixteen shots!
JAMIE KALVEN : It’s a story of our racial nightmare in this country.
PROTESTERS : Sixteen shots!
PROTESTER : If he is acquitted?
PROTESTERS : Shut it down!
AMY GOODMAN : The trailer to 16 Shots , the new documentary on Showtime. Former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was found guilty in 2018 of second-degree murder, sentenced to six years and nine months in prison for McDonald’s murder. Van Dyke was also found guilty on 16 counts of aggravated battery—one count for each of the 16 bullets he fired at McDonald.
Well, Democracy Now! recently spoke with Rick Rowley, director of 16 Shots . I began by asking him to lay out how this film chronicles this case, beginning with the day Laquan McDonald was murdered.
RICK ROWLEY : We show the moment that every single actor along this process kind of steps in, from the beat cops who initially respond. The first thing they do is they erase—it seems very clear, they destroy evidence. They erase this surveillance video that’s from a Burger King that’s across the street. Eighty minutes are just erased off the machine. They shoo away witnesses. They take some civilian witnesses back to City Hall. And those witnesses described to us—you know, for the first time on camera, in this film, they described being threatened by officers and being coerced into trying to say that they didn’t see what they saw.
Then, you know, immediately what happens is the spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police, the police union in Chicago, comes out, and he creates the first version of this story. And that’s the story that goes out to the press everywhere. You know, and that is almost always the first and last story. I mean, there are 30 to 60 police shootings a year in Chicago, every week or every other week. You know, in the course of my lifetime, that’s thousands of people who have been shot. And the cases all end in the same way: a small like note in the end of the press, and then we turn the page.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to Burger King—
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : —where the police come into the Burger King, that has closed-circuit TV. They don’t have a warrant. What do they do?
RICK ROWLEY : They demand access to the surveillance system. They don’t have a warrant. They don’t have any legal rights to go in and seize the equipment, but they do anyway. They get the night manager to give them the password in there. We can see them on the surveillance footage, you know, messing around with the computer system. And the next day, 87 minutes, from all of the cameras, is just missing. And we know—you know, we actually did a bunch of research. We contacted the engineers who install these systems. And this just doesn’t ever happen. Not only is it missing, but there’s multiple redundant backups on that machine that are all also missing. So, you know, it seems evident that the officers on the scene there erased that footage and just made it disappear.
AMY GOODMAN : Rick, there were witnesses, nonpolice witnesses, at this late-night killing. These are the witnesses, in your film, to the shooting: Alma Benitez, but first, Xavier and José Torres.
JOSÉ TORRES : I don’t want to talk bad about all police officers, because they’re not all bad. I have a lot of friends that are police officers. But, you know, after seeing this, I lost pretty much the trust in the police. We were traveling northbound on Pulaski. I was actually the first car that pulled up at the scene.
ALMA BENITEZ : I had just barely come off from work. I was headed to Burger King. I see a guy running next on my window. He was getting chased by the cops. They were chasing him.
XAVIER TORRES : We had the streetlights. We were able to, you know, get a good view of what was going on. There were a lot of police officers. And it just seemed like he was just trying to get away from what was going on.
JOSÉ TORRES : The first shots came in, and he dropped.
ALMA BENITEZ : Shots, and saw him drop. He literally dropped.
JOSÉ TORRES : And there was a small pulse. I see Laquan McDonald move. It didn’t seem like he was getting up; it just seemed like he was in pain. But that’s when all the shots started coming in.
XAVIER TORRES : He was on the ground, and still more shots came in.
ALMA BENITEZ : While the gunshots were going in, his just body kept jumping. You could tell it was—he didn’t have no life in there no more. And next thing I remember is yelling, “Stop shooting! He’s dead already!”
JOSÉ TORRES : I was kind of upset. And I said, “Why the [bleep] are they still shooting him? He’s on the ground.”
XAVIER TORRES : From what we’ve seen, he wasn’t posing any type of threat.
ALMA BENITEZ : The detectives call me over. And they took us to the precinct. They separated us in three different rooms.
JOSÉ TORRES : They brought me to a small office, and they started questioning me and asking me what happened.
ALMA BENITEZ : I talked to several detectives, not one. And they kept asking me the same questions over and over again: What did you see? How many gunshots did you hear? The more I kept telling them of what I saw, they were trying to make me—they were telling me stuff like, “Well, we’re watching the video, and your story does not match.” And I said, “Well, if it doesn’t match, then—and you have a video, what am I doing here?” And they said, “Well, you know, it’s not good to lie.” They really wanted me to change the story about how many shots I had heard. If I didn’t tell them what they wanted to hear, I definitely thought I was going to go to jail.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Alma Benitez, talking about what she saw, and José and Xavier Torres before her. Now, compare these eyewitness reports to the spokesperson and the head of the Fraternal Order of Police.
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah, clearly, I mean, Pat Camden arrives on the scene, and he immediately packages for the press the official police response, which is that this was a violent offender who was waving a knife in a menacing way and had to be shot. You know, the stunning thing is that even after the video is released, even after Pat Camden, Dean Angelo—who’s the spokesman for the FOP ; Dean Angelo, the former head of the FOP at the time; and Garry McCarthy, the police chief—even after they saw the video, they were able—they looked at it and said that this looks like a justified shooting.
AMY GOODMAN : But Van Dyke was not the first officer on the scene.
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah. One of the interesting, sort of poignant parts of this story is that the first responding officers, they’re responding to a 911 call saying that there’s a kid who might be breaking into trucks in a truck yard. They show up. It’s Officer Gaffney and Officer McElligott. And they do everything kind of by the book, as you would expect law enforcement officers to deal with it. They don’t provoke McDonald. They see he has a knife. They follow behind him, 10 paces back, with their lights on, and they call in and ask for a Taser, for the only kind of nonlethal enforcement they have. They follow him for a significant amount of time. More and more officers are arriving. The Taser is on its way. And then, suddenly, Van Dyke’s car pulls up. He jumps out of his car. And in under six seconds, he’s unloading his clip into Laquan McDonald.
And so, these officers have now just witnessed an atrocity. And they go, and they all have to make their statements. So, the statements from—there are nine other officers on the scene. Most of the statements say that—you know, tell a completely unfactual account of what happened, that Laquan was waving the knife, advancing on Officer Van Dyke, which obviously is just a lie. Several of the officers say, “I didn’t see anything.” The officer who’s driving the car that has the dash cam in it claims that they didn’t see anything happen.
So, that was, you know, the greatest act of resistance probably that was imaginable for an officer at that time, knowing that even if you tell the truth, nothing is going to happen to this officer, because nothing ever has in the 180-year history of the Chicago Police Department, and that the only outcome is going to be that you’re going to end your career, potentially, and put yourself in danger. So, anyway, all of the officers’ statements kind of corroborate this completely untrue story that Laquan was the aggressor.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s go to the clip. It begins with the FOP spokesperson—mind you, none of these guys are in power, in office, right now—Pat Camden, and then to the head of the Fraternal Order of Police, also not there, and, ultimately, the police chief, Garry McCarthy, was fired, as well.
PAT CAMDEN : As you look at something frame by frame, again, without the emotions that are involved, you can draw a conclusion. My conclusion was, you know, the officer did what he had to do to protect himself.
DEAN ANGELO : I see a situation that is gotten away. I don’t know where everybody’s head is at in that situation.
GARRY McCARTHY: There’s a knife. I’m sorry, but that’s a threat. If somebody gets near you, within 21 feet of you, with an open knife, you could die.
PASTOR MARVIN HUNTER : As you saw and I’ve seen, Laquan McDonald was murdered. This family wants justice to be served. And justice for us is Jason Van Dyke being convicted of the murder of Laquan McDonald.
AMY GOODMAN : Which of these people is not like the other? Which of these people just doesn’t belong? And that’s Pastor Marvin Hunter at the end, the granduncle of Laquan McDonald.
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah. It is one of the—one of the remarkable things is that in spite of all the facts that we have about this case, in spite of the video, in spite of all of the evidence that’s come forward, those facts are not enough to secure the narrative. Even in the face of those facts, there is another story, a competing story, that is very powerful in this country and that’s built on racial fear. And that is what was being mobilized on the other side of this sort of discourse.
So you see that unfold in the trial. The defense invokes it constantly. There are these amazing moments where Dan Herbert, the defense attorney for Officer Van Dyke, talks about this as a “horror film.” He says, “Imagine you’re watching a horror film, and the monster suddenly turns and looks at you, and then the music starts to play. That’s what happened here.” So, he’s casting Laquan McDonald as a monster.
Dean Angelo says—you know, the former head of the FOP—says to Jacquie Soohen, the producer and interviewer, “You know, people need to recognize, no one is accepting the fact that what we need to do is go after that monster, who doesn’t belong in the street with you or my wife or my daughter”—basically, with white women, like invoking the oldest nightmare, American racial nightmare, there is.
AMY GOODMAN : So, October 20th, 2014, is the day Laquan McDonald is gunned down by Jason Van Dyke. Again, Van Dyke then controls the narrative, or the FOP does, by saying that he felt his life was threatened. No one saw otherwise, so this was just par for the course. Talk about then how this case developed, how it changed from that night.
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah. So, that would have been the end of it, ordinarily, in any one of these thousands of other cases where this has happened. But two things happened that weren’t expected. First, a whistleblower in law enforcement got in touch with investigative journalist Jamie Kalven and told him, “There’s a video out there. There’s a video, and it’s horrific.” And he was worried that it might be destroyed if no one started asking for it.
The other parallel thing that happened was the family began to ask questions. So, Pastor Marvin Hunter, the great-uncle of Laquan McDonald, he—when Laquan’s body was delivered to the funeral home, the funeral home called him up and told him, “You know, in the news, they were saying he was shot once in the chest, but he’s full of bullet holes.” So they took pictures, and they took those to an attorney, and they began the process of exploring civil litigation around the case, which ended up opening a separate kind of line of inquiry that helped rip the case open.
AMY GOODMAN : Rick Rowley, director of the new documentary 16 Shots . We’ll be back with him in 30 seconds.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : “Change” by Mavis Staples. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue our discussion with Rick Rowley, director of 16 Shots . It just premiered on Showtime.
AMY GOODMAN : This isn’t about just public officials changing their minds or video coming out from an insider in the police department. This is about people on the ground who couldn’t take it anymore. Explain how that movement built. Who is Will Calloway?
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah, absolutely. No, that’s definitely true, that one of the essential processes through this is that everyone inside the system is playing by the rules of a game that’s existed for over a hundred years. And they know that they’re going to win, because they’ve always won. But what they don’t realize is that outside, in the street and in culture, the rules of that whole game are changing. They live in a different world by the end of this case than they did at the beginning. And they live in a different world because there’s a social movement out there that changed that world. And Charlene Carruthers, the former head of BYP100, and Will Calloway, an activist who became involved with this case from the very beginning, are responsible in a large way for those changes that happened.
So, Will was an activist working on police issues, on the Rekia Boyd shooting, which happened in Chicago a year earlier. When he read Jamie Kalven’s piece that revealed that there was a video out there, he FOIAed for the video, along with a bunch of other media outlets. Like a couple dozen media outlets FOIAed for the video. All the FOIAs were denied—ongoing investigation. You know, it’s a typical logic that is deployed whenever people want to keep things hidden. No one—everyone else dropped it. Will didn’t drop it. He sued the city. Everyone—you know, he sued the city, and he won. It was another unprecedented moment for transparency in the city.
AMY GOODMAN : And so, talk about what happened next. The judge ruled it would have to be released within a few days.
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah. So, suddenly, the city realizes that this entire machine, that they had had faith in would continue to function, had fallen apart. It had just exploded. And so, the state’s attorney, Anita Alvarez, immediately brings murder charges against Officer Van Dyke—this is the first time an officer has ever been charged for murdering a black citizen—a day before the video is released.
Then the video is released, and it sends shockwaves through the city, because this video is—you know, there are a lot of videos of these shootings that are circulating now. Most of them are, you know, shaky cellphone videos, partial recordings—the recording begins partway through the encounter. This video is unparalleled in its clarity. It’s a locked-off shot from the dash cam of a police car, and you see every second of Officer Van Dyke’s interactions with Laquan McDonald. You see his car pull up, him jump out of it and begin to fire. There isn’t a second before the video starts; you see everything. And because it’s happening on a street with the lane lines painted, it might as well have been taking place on graph paper. You can see that Laquan is moving away. You can see that he’s no threat. It has—and you can see his body lying on the ground while Van Dyke continues to shoot into him. It’s unprecedented in its clarity and in the horror you see in it.
AMY GOODMAN : All of this is playing out, before the video is released, in the mayoral re-election of Rahm Emanuel. And explain what happened exactly when the video dropped in the process of his campaign, and also a settlement the family made that people did not know about for quite some time.
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah. So, the city—we know from internal email and communications that have been—you know, that journalists sued for and have been released, that the city was obsessed with this case. All of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s senior staff were discussing it. They were circulating stories about it. They were talking about the video. But there was no lawsuit filed about it yet.
So, Rahm Emanuel is in a very tight runoff with—and he didn’t win a majority, an outright majority, in the first election. It’s in a runoff. It’s very close. It looks like he might lose. And this video could be released at any moment by the family, if they decide to bring charges. So, the lawyer for the city—the Mayor’s Office sends their lawyer to make a $5 million settlement with Laquan McDonald’s family—before any charges have been filed. There’s no lawsuit. It’s a preemptive settlement, $5 million to delay the release of the video ’til after the election is over.
AMY GOODMAN : So, Anita Alvarez, you and Jacquie Soohen interview several times, the state’s attorney, who does not bring charges against Jason Van Dyke, even though she clearly has seen this video. What did she have to gain by not bringing charges?
RICK ROWLEY : Well, it was great, because when heads really started to roll around this case and the institutions inside the city split, turned against each other, people began briefing against each other. And so we were able to get much more candid interviews from everyone around. It’s a great moment to be a documentary filmmaker when that happens.
But we interviewed Anita Alvarez while she was still state’s attorney. And she makes it very clear. She admits that she saw the video right away, but she says, “It’s very hard to prosecute police officers. And, you know, we didn’t—we thought we would lose.” But once the video is about ready to be—is going to be released, and they know it’s going to be released, she’s worried about civil unrest in the city. She’s worried there will be riots. So she charges Van Dyke with murder the day before the video is released, to try to preempt the anger that everyone knows is going to roll out into the street.
AMY GOODMAN : So, Rick Rowley, set up this next clip.
RICK ROWLEY : So, charges have been brought against Van Dyke the day before this video is released. The whole city is expecting—doesn’t know what to expect, expects civil unrest. The police are on high alert. People are talking about riots. And the movement—well, the whole city clusters around their phones and their computers to watch the video the moment it is released. And when they see it, it is shocking, it is graphic, it is horrific. And the protesters pour out into the streets on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year. And they shut down the—
AMY GOODMAN : The day after Thanksgiving.
RICK ROWLEY : The day after Thanksgiving. And they shut down the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago.
AMY GOODMAN : This clip begins with Charlene Carruthers.
CHARLENE CARRUTHERS : He was shot 16 times—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. He was shot 16 times.
PROTESTERS : Sixteen shots! Shut it down! Sixteen shots! Shut it down! Sixteen shots! Shut it down!
WILLIAM CALLOWAY : They saw him. He was their son. He was their brother. He was them.
PROTESTERS : Sixteen shots! Sixteen shots!
WILLIAM CALLOWAY : Know how many times I ran from the police, growing up in the city? How many times I was put in a position where Chicago police pull guns on me? So, when I saw Laquan, I saw me.
AMY GOODMAN : Will Calloway. “So, when I saw Laquan, I saw me.”
RICK ROWLEY : Yeah, that’s a sentiment that was felt throughout the kind of movement out there. Will has described it, at different times, as a kind of divine justice or divine poetry, that Laquan McDonald, a figure who was so marginalized in the city that he was practically invisible up until the moment of his death, ended up taking down the most powerful people in the city of Chicago.
AMY GOODMAN : So the trial takes place September of 2018. Describe the moment of the verdict.
RICK ROWLEY : The trial has been this amazing kind of public spectacle in Chicago, the focal point of the city’s attention for the weeks that it happens. And as the jury is—as the case is given to the jury and they go in to deliberate, the city is on the edge of its seat. I mean, the people, again, are fearing riots if there’s an acquittal.
When everyone is called back, because there’s—a verdict is ready, I’m filming in front of City Hall, because 100 or 200 activists have gathered in front of City Hall, and their plan is—they’re certain it’s going to be a “not guilty” verdict. It’s unimaginable that a police officer will be found guilty of murdering a black citizen. And so their plan is to go inside City Hall and shut it down—shut it down, if it comes back “not guilty,” and be arrested. So we’re standing outside. The whole group is leaning into their cellphones, playing the video over megaphones—or, the audio over megaphones. It is this incredible moment.
And as the verdict is read, first, guilty of second-degree murder, and then the 16 counts, one for every shot—shot one, guilty; shot two, guilty; shot three, guilty—as those shots are being read out, people are weeping. They’re in tears. Something unimaginable has happened to them. It’s like a tear has opened in the fabric of political reality, and something else is visible on the other side of it. I have seldom seen moments of that kind of intense public intimacy. And I was incredibly grateful to be able to be there and see it. But there was a feeling amongst everyone there that a page had been turned and that something—we were in a new moment, a new moment that we were going to all have to find out what it meant.
AMY GOODMAN : Ultimately, though, while he was found guilty of each of those 16 shots, while Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, his sentence?
RICK ROWLEY : So, months later, in January of this year, two things happened, days apart. First, there was a conspiracy trial for the other officers on the scene, where they were charged with conspiring to cover up this murder. All of them were acquitted. The next day, Van Dyke was sentenced, and the judge, Judge Gaughan, decided not to consider the 16 counts of aggravated battery, one for each shot, only consider the second-degree murder, and gave him six-and-a-half years, eligible for release in three years.
And, you know, we talked to the jurors, who felt betrayed. I mean, they went in there—so, each count of aggravated battery carries 6 to 30 years per count. They thought that they were giving a verdict that was going to mean Van Dyke was going to jail for the rest of his life. And instead, it was shortened to, you know, less time than—I mean, there are hundreds of people in Cook County Jail right now awaiting trial for more than three years because they can’t afford the 500 bucks it would take to make bail.
AMY GOODMAN : And so, what do you think is the lesson today, as the activists continue in the streets of Chicago, and what this means for the country, as Showtime broadcasts your documentary?
RICK ROWLEY : I mean, there’s two things that cut through this for me. The first is, you know, the scale, the massive scale of the cover-up. I mean, this is not a scandal. This is not aberrant behavior. This isn’t three people in a room deciding that they’re going to clear this one bad officer. This is every institution in the city being complicit in this in some way or another, in small or large ways.
The other lesson is that for all of the strengths of this machine, it broke down. That wall of silence was shattered in this case. And it was shattered because dozens of people, at crucial moments, came forward and took brave stands and broke it, and also because of the sustained attention and pressure of movements. I mean, this is a story arc that’s four years long. People stayed on this. They stayed in the street. They stayed active, and they kept pushing this. And so, that—I’m in awe of the people of Chicago and of the journalists and the social movements there who maintained the pressure throughout and managed to win victories that have been elusive in every other city in this country.

Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : We begin today’s show in Hong Kong, where as many as 2 million people took to the streets Sunday calling for the withdrawal of a bill to allow the extradition of Hong Kong residents to mainland China. Protesters also called for the resignation of Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and other top officials who pushed for the extradition bill. Facing mounting protests, Lam has apologized for her handling of the legislation and has indefinitely delayed a vote on the bill, but the bill has not been fully withdrawn. Sunday’s protest came days after riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and pepper spray at tens of thousands of demonstrators.
The recent protests are the largest Hong Kong has seen since before Britain’s handover of Hong Kong in China in 1997. Since then, Hong Kong has operated under a different legal and political system as mainland China, a setup known as “one country, two systems.” Critics of the extradition bill say it would infringe on Hong Kong’s independence and the legal and human rights of Hong Kong residents, as well as the people visiting Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, one of the most prominent pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, 22-year-old Joshua Wong, was released after a month behind bars. In 2014, he helped lead the Umbrella Movement, which organized protests in Hong Kong. Wong vowed today to join the protest movement.
JOSHUA WONG : Hong Kong people will not keep silent under the suppression of President Xi and the Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Carrie Lam must step down; otherwise, I believe in next few weeks, before the 22 anniversary of Hong Kong transfer of sovereignty, more and more Hong Kong people, not only 1 million or 2 million people, will come and join our fight, until the day we get back our basic human rights and freedom.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re joined now by two guests. In Hong Kong, Nathan Law is with us, pro-democracy activist who also helped lead the Umbrella Movement. He and Joshua Wong have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for their activism. He was with Joshua just after his release today. And here in New York, Minky Worden, director of Global Initiatives at Human Rights Watch. Worden lived and worked in Hong Kong in the 1990s.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Nathan, let’s begin with you. Can you just describe what took place this weekend, what your demands are and whether you feel they have been met?
NATHAN LAW : Well, I think after the 2 million people marching down last Sunday, Carrie Lam indeed issued an apology, but it is definitely not enough. Our demand is very clear and sound. She has to retreat the proposal. She has to investigate the police brutality. And she has to step down. So, I think if these demands are not met in the future, then there will be more and more protests and rallies.
AMY GOODMAN : Nathan, can you explain what the law is and why protesters will not accept it?
NATHAN LAW : Well, Hong Kong’s “one country, two system” with China, one of the most important features, is that we have a separated legal system. In Hong Kong, we have independent judges, fair trial and also rule of law. These are not found in China. And if this law is passed, then it allows China to extradite people in Hong Kong with fabricated cases, and they have to be extradited back to China to face unfair trial. So it imposes dangers to all of us.
AMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about the police response to these massive protests? Protesters are putting the numbers at somewhere this weekend around 2 million people in the streets of Hong Kong.
NATHAN LAW : Well, the most brutal repression to the protesters happened on last Wednesday, when we have gathering outside the legislative complex, where the general meeting of our lawmaking body take place. And the police tried to disperse people with tear gas and rubber bullets. And these are unprecedented forces and definitely unproportional. We could see that police there were out of control. They were beating people who were lying down on the ground without any resistance. They were firing their gunfire to the heads of the protesters. These are violating every ordinance or every rule that they have to obey in order to protect the safety of the citizens.
AMY GOODMAN : On Saturday, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam addressed the people of Hong Kong. This is what she said.
CARRIE LAM : I feel deep sorrow and regret that the deficiencies in our work and various other factors have stirred up substantial controversies and disputes in society following the relatively calm periods of the past two years, disappointing many people. We will adopt the most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements, so that we can continue to connect with the people of Hong Kong.
AMY GOODMAN : Nathan Law, your response to the chief executive of Hong Kong?
NATHAN LAW : Well, I do believe that this press conference, the performance of Carrie Lam, made lots more people coming down to the street. Even though she said she will pause the bill, but she also said that the bill was with good intention, with good purpose; it’s just people don’t listen to her, don’t understand the bill. So, this kind of reframing or rhetoric, rhetoric lies, that Carrie Lam said during the press conference indeed made a lot of people more angry. And she also defended the police brutality, saying that the protest on Wednesday was also a riot, so that it could legitimize the suppression or the police brutality they have been taking. And these things also really upset all the citizens, so that our number of people marching down to the streets increased from a million to 2 million within a week. So, Carrie Lam must be the one who made all this happen.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about China’s overall role in this? Xi Jinping was in Tajikistan on Saturday celebrating his 66th birthday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Beijing won’t let Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, step down even if she wants to, some say. Your thoughts on this, Nathan Law, and what this means for the mainland, as well?
NATHAN LAW : Well, for Carrie Lam and for the Beijing government, they always said that it’s not the initiative from Beijing; it’s the initiative from Carrie. And we can—well, as the information I got from different sources, we also know that it was an initiative from Carrie, and she tried to push forward the proposal so that the Beijing’s power in Hong Kong could be more centralized and strengthen its grip to Hong Kong, about money and also arresting political dissidents and so on. But she misjudged how public would react. And the public anger is way more larger—way much larger than she expected. So, I think even though the Beijing government is backing her, but there is possibility that the Beijing government, if they wanted to preserve their reputation or show that they are lenient and they are rational, they may sacrifice Carrie Lam, if needed.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, who was just released from jail today. As he spoke, Nathan, you were standing right there next to him.
JOSHUA WONG : It’s time for us to urge Carrie Lam to withdraw the extradition law proposal, and it’s her responsibility to step down and to face how 2 million people already joined the fight and urge her to bear the political responsibility. In the future, I will join the fight, and I hope more people can join our protest.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you comment on what Joshua Wong’s—his release, just released earlier today, and the significance of this, why he was imprisoned and what it means for the whole movement?
NATHAN LAW : Well, Joshua was locked in jail because of his participation in the Umbrella Movement. So, after almost a month jail sentence, he came out, and he immediately went to the Admiralty and also the protest site to see what’s going on, because in the prison you’ve got very limited resources of information. So, I think he has to like keep up the pace and know more about things in order to make a good judgment on the strategy of the movement. But in the end of the day, he is very concerned. And like, we [inaudible] will continue to fight. And with this participation, our fight will be more stronger and more firm.
AMY GOODMAN : And why is it called the Umbrella Movement? And can you describe your intentions in founding it?
NATHAN LAW : Yeah, the Umbrella Movement happened five years ago. And it is named because people were very peaceful, and when they faced police using the pepper spray, they only blocked it with umbrella. So, you could see a scene of a list or a line of umbrellas facing the police, and the police were spraying pepper spray. So, the name of Umbrella Movement started from this scene, very iconic one.
AMY GOODMAN : And overall, where you think—the G20 is happening later this month. President Trump will be meeting with Xi Jinping. What do you want to see come out of that? And can you comment on the U.S.-China relationship and how it affects what’s happening in Hong Kong?
NATHAN LAW : Well, Secretary Pompeo just said that President Trump will discuss Hong Kong issue with Xi Jinping Monday, meet at G20. So, I think it is a good opportunity for the U.S. to state that they have massive interest in Hong Kong and they share the same liberal and universal values with Hong Kong people, so that we want China to really treasure the demands of Hong Kong people and stop suppressing them. I think it is a very important message, because it is not only about Hong Kong’s interests, but the interests of the whole free world and the interests of America. So, I think if President Trump indeed meets President Xi in G20, it’s not only about economy, it’s not only about trade, but is about something that’s way much more important.
AMY GOODMAN : Nathan Law is a pro-democracy activist who has also helped lead the Umbrella Movement. Both he and Joshua Wong have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for their activism. Nathan, I want you to stay with us, but I also want to bring in Minky Worden of Human Rights Watch. You have been following this movement in detail. You lived in Hong Kong. If you, too, can talk about the significance of a movement that was—some described it as a failed movement, until now?
MINKY WORDEN : Well, first of all, I’d like to say that Joshua Wong getting out of prison today is a very significant moment. He published an article that had echoes of the Letter from the Birmingham Jail. And I think that helps put this movement in the context of protest movements worldwide, but also through history. And the Umbrella Movement, when it happened in 2014, was a landmark movement of especially young people who weren’t even born at the time of the Hong Kong handover standing up and saying, “We understand what makes Hong Kong special. We understand that only in Hong Kong, with our rule of law, press freedom, religious freedom, our ability to protest freely—that we understand these rights and freedoms are very precious, and we’re prepared to stand up and defend them.”
The Umbrella Movement itself, Nathan Law was actually elected to the Legislature in a landslide. He was the youngest legislator, when elected. And yet, within a year, he was thrown out of the Legislature. And that was a series of moves that have been made by the Hong Kong government to assert control of the Legislature—right?—throwing out elected leaders. And I think the—there’s been a question of whether there was a legacy from the Umbrella Movement. And last Sunday, with a million people turning out into the streets peacefully, and yesterday, with as many as 2 million people turning out, I think you can see that the Umbrella Movement has had an enduring legacy that continues to this day.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the extradition law, more about it, what seems to be the latest in a blurring of lines between mainland China and Hong Kong? And how much control, for people to understand, does China exert over Hong Kong, and where you see this all headed?
MINKY WORDEN : Yes. So, the extradition law is the latest in a series of moves from China to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy and human rights. And I think if you were to look at all of the things that distinguish Hong Kong from China—religious freedom, a functioning rule of law, a judicial system that is largely independent, a free press is absolutely essential, and the ability to protest—all of these rights and freedoms have been under steady assault from China, but in a way that the international community really wasn’t paying a lot of attention. Certainly, it caused enormous fear and concern in Hong Kong. But in the 22 years since the handover from Britain to China, the defense of human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong has largely been left to Hong Kong people. And every time there has been a crisis like this, they have stood up. What the extradition law does that is so pernicious is that it would actually legalize kidnapping. It would—I think in recent years we’ve seen the abduction of publishers and businessmen. There was a businessman who was abducted from the Four Seasons. So—
AMY GOODMAN : Hotel.
MINKY WORDEN : The Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong, yes. A businessman was abducted, and five publishers, and then several of them made forced confessions. So, I think, for Hong Kong people, they see this as a fundamental assault to the values, their core values, where you have the right of due process, for example, in the courts. So, the extradition law itself could legalize kidnapping.
AMY GOODMAN : Why does China—why is China pushing this at this time? And what does this mean for Xi Jinping?
MINKY WORDEN : Well, I don’t know that there’s evidence that this is coming from China. Hong Kong is supposed to be an autonomous system. It has an enormous bureaucracy. There’s a big question of whether this was the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, who was not elected by Hong Kong people, moving a piece of legislation where she could show Beijing how much she was in control. As Nathan Law said, it’s backfired spectacularly.
And I think the important question is: What’s going to happen next? Carrie Lam has said that they will suspend the law but not withdraw it. There are parallels in recent Hong Kong history where the previous chief executive moved a piece of legislation on subversion that would have undermined human rights in Hong Kong. In that situation, half a million people took to the street. The law was withdrawn, and ultimately the chief executive was tossed out of office. So I think there’s a parallel in recent Hong Kong history, but the concern is now Xi Jinping is in China.
AMY GOODMAN : Your final thoughts, Nathan Law?
NATHAN LAW : Well, definitely, this kind of legalizing kidnapping indeed imposes a lot of threat to Hong Kong people, and that is why we have 2 million people marching down to the street on Sunday. And we hope that by continuing our pressure to the government, they could really listen to it, even though they are not democratically elected. But the power of people must be shown, and the power of people must be respected.
AMY GOODMAN : Nathan Law, we want to thank you for being with us, pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong who’s been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. And Minky Worden, director of Global Initiatives at Human Rights Watch.

In Guatemala, voters headed to the polls Sunday in highly contested presidential and congressional elections. As votes continue to be tallied, former first lady Sandra Torres is leading in the presidential race with around a quarter of the votes, but a runoff is expected in August between the two leading candidates. Torres has been plagued by accusations of money laundering and ties to drug traffickers. Critics have warned of widespread corruption leading up to the elections. Thelma Aldana, a former attorney general who helped prosecute hundreds of cases against Guatemala’s political and business elite, was believed to be a favorite to win, before being banned from the elections over what many believe are trumped-up allegations of embezzlement and tax fraud, which she denies. Aldana has left the country after facing death threats and a warrant for her arrest. Topics: Sudanese Ex-Leader al-Bashir Charged with Corruption in 1st Appearance Since Ouster Jun 17, 2019
In Sudan, ousted former President Omar al-Bashir made his first public appearance Sunday since his overthrow in April. He was taken to the prosecutor’s office, where he was charged on several counts of corruption, including accepting illegal gifts and hoarding foreign money. Al-Bashir was charged in May for his involvement in the killing of anti-government demonstrators during the months-long popular uprising that led to his ouster. Protesters are continuing to demand the country’s ruling military hand over power to a civilian authority. Topics:"

In Maryland, police are investigating the death of Zoe Spears, a 23-year-old black transgender woman, who is at least the 10th known case of deadly violence against trans women this year—all of them black. Spears’s body was found on the street with several gunshot wounds last Thursday in Fairmount Heights, just outside of Washington, D.C.—only a few blocks away from the site of another fatal shooting, in March, of a black trans woman named Ashanti Carmon. The two women were friends, and the police are trying to determine if their murders are connected. Ruby Corado, executive director of LGBTQ community center Casa Ruby and a close friend of Zoe Spears, said that Spears moved out of her apartment, fearing for her safety following Ashanti Carmon’s murder.

And in Arizona, Phoenix’s mayor and police chief have both apologized after a video was released showing officers pointing guns and yelling at a black family outside a Family Dollar store, after they say a 4-year-old girl took a doll from the store. The video caused widespread outrage over the weekend. The officers say they were responding to a report of shoplifting when they drew their firearms and started screaming orders, using profane language, at a father, a pregnant woman carrying a baby, and the young girl, who left the store with a doll which was unpaid for.
Police officer : “Get out of the [bleep] car!”
Father : “OK. I’m not doing anything.”
Witness 1 : “You recording it?”
Witness 2 : “Yeah, I’m recording it.”
Police officer : “Put your hands up.”
Pregnant mother : “I don’t have nothing, officer.”
Police officer : “I don’t give a [bleep]. Put your hands up! Hands up.”
Pregnant mother : “I can’t put my hands up. I have a [bleep] baby in my hands. I can’t. I’m pregnant.”
The woman can be heard saying she is unable to hold her hands up because she is holding a child, and that she is pregnant. The parents say the police officers violated their civil rights, and are filing a $10 million lawsuit. Topics: "

The move, announced in March, reverses decades of U.S. policy and is in defiance of international law. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 after capturing the territory from Syria during the 1967 war.

And Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau approved Tuesday the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which the Canadian government purchased from Kinder Morgan last year, despite major concerns by environmental and indigenous rights groups and multiple legal challenges against the pipeline. Construction on the pipeline, which carries crude oil from Alberta’s tar sands to British Columbia’s Pacific coast, is set to resume this year. First Nations groups have said they will continue to challenge the expansion, which was previously halted by the courts in 2016. This is Khelsilem of the Squamish Nation Council.
Khelsilem : “It’s unfortunate this government, that ran on a promise of doing things differently, decides to behave this way. But our interests as a people is to protect our community, our territory, the livelihood of our generations living today and the ones to come. And we are committed to fighting this climate emergency and the climate crisis, but we have a government that does not seem to want to be leaders when it comes to fighting the climate emergency. Climate leaders do not build pipelines.” Topics:"

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, it’s been nearly a year since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won the 2018 Democratic primary, toppling Joe Crowley—one of the most powerful Democrats in the House of Representatives—and upending the political machine here in New York City overnight. Since that historic win, Ocasio-Cortez has gone from outsider to one of the most influential politicians on Capitol Hill.
Now another young Queens candidate is trying to pull off a historic upset. Tiffany Cabán, a 31-year-old queer Latina public defender is running for district attorney in Queens. She’s running to end cash bail, to stop prosecuting low-level offenses, to decriminalize sex work and to go after bad landlords, cops and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Her election would mark a major shift in the Queens criminal justice system and yet again set an example for the country. To win, Cabán will have to beat out a crowded field of seven candidates who are all claiming they’ll reform the system, including Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, who is backed by the Queens Democratic Party establishment. This is Tiffany Cabán’s campaign ad.
TIFFANY CABÁN: If you have money, if you know how to game the system, you can do whatever you want in the city. If you’re a person of color, you’re poor, you’re an immigrant, no one’s on your side. My family is from Puerto Rico, and my parents worked hard to make ends meet. But no matter how hard they worked, the system cared more about protecting the wealthy. I’m a queer Latina from a working-class family. People like us are exactly who the system is trying to keep down. That’s why I became a public defender, to defend my community. I have defended over a thousand clients, who couldn’t afford to defend themselves, who were thrown on Rikers because they didn’t have money for bail, they jumped a turnstile, they struggle with mental health or substance use disorder. I am running for district attorney of Queens to bring justice to working people, to stop criminalizing poverty, to reduce recidivism, to decriminalize sex work, to end cash bail. But the corrupt Queens political machine doesn’t want me to win, because they get rich off of foreclosures, have taken millions from developers, and I can’t be bought and controlled.
AMY GOODMAN : Since announcing her campaign in January, Tiffany Cabán has gone from long-shot outsider to key contender in a race that’s garnered national attention. Progressive district attorneys Larry Krasner of Philadelphia and Rachael Rollins of Boston have endorsed Cabán. The New York Times just endorsed her, writing, “The success of any prosecutor, and of the city itself, depends on keeping people safe. Ms. Cabán is the Democrat best poised to become one of a growing number of prosecutors to show that can be done without infringing on civil liberties, criminalizing black and Hispanic Americans and mistaking punishment for the only form of justice,” the Times wrote. The Democratic primary is June 25th.
For more, we’re joined here in the studio by Tiffany Cabán.
Welcome to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us.
TIFFANY CABÁN: Good morning.
AMY GOODMAN : So, you have taken Queens by storm. Queens, really the most diverse borough in the world. You are the youngest in the crowded race for district attorney. You’re the only public defender. Talk about why you chose to run for district attorney, and give us your history.
TIFFANY CABÁN: Sure, absolutely. And thank you for having me. But, you know, one, I never thought it was something that I would be doing. When I talk about being a public defender, it’s just so tied to my identity. It’s just, I say—it’s the same way that I say, like, I’m a queer woman, I am a Latina: I am a public defender. And I think that’s what a lot of public defenders feel like. But, for me, we’re in a moment of time where running for district attorney, becoming the district attorney, very much so feels like a continuation of the work that I have always done.
And it’s certainly been informed by my personal experiences growing up. I grew up here in Queens. I grew up in South Richmond Hill, Queens. My parents grew up in the Woodside housing projects, in NYCHA housing. And so, certainly, my experiences in overpoliced, overcriminalized, resource-starved communities, you know, that has very much so shaped the work that I do and what I’ve been fighting for my entire career. It’s why I became a public defender. It’s why I’m running now.
But, certainly, every day in court was just a constant reminder that our justice system is the single most powerful driver of the continued oppression of our black and brown, our low-income, our immigrant, our LGBTQIA+ communities. But one thing that’s also glaringly obvious is that if you have money, if you have the right political ties, if you pad the right pockets, you can get away with doing a lot of harm in our communities.
So, you know, for me, one of the drivers for running also was we’re in this like third cycle of these so-called progressive prosecutor races. So the playbook is out there, right? And folks know the right things to say. And I’ve been practicing criminal law in Manhattan and seeing District Attorney Cy Vance sort of come out with these so-called progressive policies, and recognizing that, you know, there’s a big fat asterisk next to those policies. And my clients, who were the exception to the rule before, continue to be the exception to the rule afterwards. One of the things that stands out to me, or I’ve told a lot during this campaign, is, when he said he wasn’t going to prosecute turnstile jumps. You know, a week later, I picked up a turnstile jump that we litigated for a year and went to trial on. And it was a perfect example of what’s wrong with our justice system, that we’re making decisions that overcriminalizes our black and brown and poor communities, that doesn’t serve public safety. And so, for me, you know, this felt incredibly important to do.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Tiffany, I wanted to ask you about the race for district attorney. In New York, there’s been a sort of a tradition that people get into the district attorney’s position in—whether it’s Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan or the Bronx, and they stay for decades, whether it was Hynes in Brooklyn or Morgenthau in Manhattan. And Richard Brown, who died last year, was—or, this year, right? And he was there for over 25 years. I remember when he was appointed by Mario Cuomo. He was actually appointed to fill a vacancy. And the first act that he did was to vacate the charges against a group of police officers who had choked to death a young Puerto Rican, Federico Pereira, in Queens in an attempted arrest, the stepson of a famous singer, Tito Nieves, the salsa singer. And Federico Pereira was killed. And his first act—Richard Brown—was to vacate the charges against those cops, because he wanted the support of the police union when he was going to run for election, because he was only in an appointed position at first. So, this whole issue of district attorney’s relationships to the police, which they depend on so much, I’m wondering how you see that, and, if you’re elected, what you will be able to do to change the historic relationship between DAs and cops.
TIFFANY CABÁN: Absolutely. Again, I think that we’re in this really special moment in time where we’re seeing decarceral prosecutors, committed to keeping people rooted in their communities with access to resources and supports, be elected all around the country. We’re seeing defense attorneys being elected into these positions all around the country, and also being able to navigate relationships with police departments that, you know, coming in, were sort of adversarial, just based on the things that they were talking about.
But there’s a lot of common ground to be had. So, you know, we can say that we’re going to hold police officers accountable through having independent prosecutors, making sure that our assistant district attorneys, that are expected to work every day with the police, aren’t the people that are then prosecuting them when they step over the line, and then saying also we’re going to make it untenable for bad officers to stay employed, saying that if you have a long history of misconduct and a case is relying on your testimony, that we’re not going to take those cases, but then also finding ways to work in partnership, right? I mean, there is a real opportunity, which hasn’t been taken advantage of, where the DA’s Office can be keeping data and disseminating, sharing it not with just the community but with the police departments, to say, actually, when you make these kinds of arrests, they better serve public safety. You get better public safety and public health outcomes.
One of the things that I would love to work, because—understanding this is a system within which we’re working in—right?—that has its own constraints, we can talk about how our system of prosecuting and our system of policing is—has, again, historically, worked to oppress certain communities, namely, our black and brown and low-income communities, but recognizing that there are ways where we can start to dismantle that and do some better work. So, the idea that we could be partnering and working on LEAD initiatives, Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, things that we’re seeing in Seattle, up in Albany, that are working, that give police officers the opportunity to make the decision not to make an arrest and just to provide support. And in places where they’re doing these things, they’re seeing violence between officers and civilians go down exponentially. So, there are places for partnership, and there are places for accountability.
AMY GOODMAN : Earlier this month, WNYC hosted a debate between the seven Queens district attorney candidates. Queens Borough President Melinda Katz said she is the best candidate to pursue meaningful criminal justice reform.
MELINDA KATZ : It is so crucial to have a balance of criminal justice reform and safety. I’m the only candidate in this race that has worked top to bottom, east to west, in the borough of Queens with all of the Cure Violence groups, with the mental health clinics, with the drug abuse clinics, and gone borough by—neighborhood by neighborhood to make sure that we are actually keeping people out of the system before they get into the system. You can have justice for defendants, but the real secret here is to make sure that we are stopping anyone from going into the system.
AMY GOODMAN : Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, who you are running against. Can you respond to what she says, and also the endorsement of AOC , of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? You’ve said she has inspired you to run, coming from the same borough, and, of course, the powerhouse that she has become. And, you know, you said you thought of yourself proudly as a public defender. Crossing over, becoming the chief prosecutor, the district attorney, what made you decide you could do that? And what does it mean without the managerial—managerial experience that someone like Melinda Katz has?
TIFFANY CABÁN: Sure. So, a lot to unpack there. But, you know, even just to respond directly to Melinda Katz’s messaging, you know, I think when we talk about experience, what is the most important type of experience to have? In being on the ground in the court every day to see how these things play out. When we talk about our justice system being broken in so many ways, it also includes our approaches to alternatives to incarceration, to diversion programs.
I mean, Layleen Polanco’s story is a perfect example of that. She is somebody who died in custody, a death that was completely avoidable, where we were criminalizing the very things that made her just already so vulnerable. And she was somebody that was participating in an alternative incarceration or diversion. And when you’re on the ground in court every day, you recognize that some of these programs and the way that they are put into place do more to destabilize rather than stabilize and heal. And so, being able to kind of pinpoint those things and say sometimes it’s even better just to have people out of the system, period, so that we’re not criminalizing poverty, mental health, substance use, or criminalizing already marginalized communities, like our queer communities of color.
AMY GOODMAN : Polanco, a black trans woman.
TIFFANY CABÁN: Exactly, exactly. And so, having those experiences are incredibly important.
And then, just personally, being endorsed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, you know, folks like her, like Senator Jessica Ramos, Senator Julia Salazar, for me, it moved me in a way that said, “Well, I can do this. I can enter this space and have an impact.” Because, you know, as a 31-year-old queer Latina from a working-class family, never in a million years did I think that I would be entering a space like this. But I feel not only that I have the right experience, but that we are so well equipped to get the job done.
I mean, I’ve talked about this before, the fact that this literally started with four women sitting around a table saying, “We are going to change the system.” And six months later, we have built something massive, and not just on a—I mean, not on a local level, right? Like, we’re doing a lot in Queens, but this is part of a bigger national conversation. We’ve grown to hundreds and hundreds of volunteers and just have such a beautiful—like, there’s such beautiful intersectionality when you talk about the folks that are supporting our campaign. A really powerful moment for me was we were doing this rally, and this was, you know, over a month ago, but formerly incarcerated folks and sex workers coming together, saying, “Hey, I’m going to support a district attorney candidate,” because we’re doing things so differently. But then, beyond that, you know, having the support of community-based organizations, having the support of elected officials, like Senator Ramos and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but, you know, also just national criminal justice advocates and progressive prosecutors.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, we’ll continue to follow all of this.
TIFFANY CABÁN: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN : Tiffany Cabán, we want to thank you for being with us, public defender, outsider candidate running for Queens district attorney, has just gotten the endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and The New York Times . We’ll cover that race next Tuesday.

Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We go now to Phoenix, Arizona, where an African-American family is suing the city after police held them at gunpoint because their 4-year-old daughter had allegedly taken a doll from a Family Dollar store. Shocking video shows officers pointing guns and yelling at the family outside the store. One officer even threatened to shoot the girl’s father in the face.
POLICE OFFICER : Get out of the [bleep] car!
DRAVON AMES : OK. I’m not doing anything.
WITNESS 1: You recording it?
WITNESS 2: Yeah, I’m recording it.
POLICE OFFICER : Put your hands up.
IESHA HARPER : I don’t have nothing, officer.
POLICE OFFICER : I don’t give a [bleep]. Put your hands up!
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: The 4-year-old girl’s mother, Iesha Harper, is heard saying she’s unable to hold her hands up because she’s holding a child, and that she is pregnant. On Monday, Iesha Harper and her fiancé, Dravon Ames, spoke about what happened.
DRAVON AMES : I was very much so in fear for my family’s life and my life. I thought we were all going to be executed. And by the luck of God or by graces, someone was there to video this. You know what I mean?Even if we were going to be executed that day, someone would have had it on film. And honestly, I don’t think that it would have helped or anything.
IESHA HARPER : Yeah, it’s very traumatizing, you know, because, like, with all of this going on, I still have to see the video. You know, it’s very sad. You know, it shouldn’t have happened over a baby doll, or whatever the case might be they want to say. Like, it still doesn’t justify their action.
AMY GOODMAN : Phoenix’s mayor and police chief have both apologized for what happened, and criticized how the police officers handled the situation. Activists in Phoenix say this is just the latest incident in a police department plagued by issues of police violence and killings. Last year, the city had 44 police shootings, nearly double that of the previous year, led the nation in police shootings among cities of its size.
Well, for more, we are joined by the family, Dravon Ames and Iesha Harper, along with their family spokesperson, Reverend Jarrett Maupin of the National Action Network. On Monday, the couple filed a $10 million lawsuit against the city.
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! This is just an astounding story. Iesha, if we could start with you? Talk about when this happened—the video just came out for the public to see, but when this happened—and the police officers surrounding you all, explain what they told you to do. You have a 4-year-old, who they say took a doll from the dollar store, and your 1-year-old. You were holding your 1-year-old in the car?
IESHA HARPER : Yeah. Well, she was in her car seat. And as I’m getting her out of her car seat, that’s when the officer runs to the driver’s side door and was like being very aggressive. And at that moment, I didn’t know what was going on. I already had her in my hands. And he’s screaming and yelling. My other daughter jumps on me, like she didn’t know what was going on. So, it all started like that, before everything else escalated.
AMY GOODMAN : And they’re telling you to put your hands up when you’re holding your child, and you’re telling them—I don’t know if everyone could hear it in the video—”You’re overdoing this. You’re overdoing this.”
IESHA HARPER : Yes, because I just thought that, like I didn’t know what were they doing and if we was the right people.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And Dravon, when they approached Iesha, where were you, specifically, and what was their interaction with you?
DRAVON AMES : I was in the driver’s seat. And his interaction with me was, he first came to my door. He opened the door, no problem. He’s telling me to put my hands up. I do that instantly, because he had the gun drawn. We don’t know who he is. I’m just taking commands from anyone, unidentified person at this point. I don’t know if I’m being mugged, robbed or anything. I’m just hands up. I’m not trying not to die with my family, so…
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, and in the video at one point, an officer is seen kicking your legs out from under you. Could you talk about what happened subsequently?
DRAVON AMES : Yeah. So, he yanks me out the car while I have a gun drawn on me in front of me, and then he throws me to the ground, cuffed me. No resistance. I’m fully compliant. Then he hits my head against the car door. Then he throws me against the car, and then he says, “Spread your legs.” And in the video, you see me open my legs or spread them. And then he just kicks me and blows my leg out. So, at that point, I’m just—I’m still complying, like, “I’m complying with you, sir.” Even though he does that, I’m just like, OK, he wants to get—he’s trying to provoke me to do something so he can justify this all. And I’m just showing him that I can at least just hold my composure a little bit more to show that he’s fully wrong.
AMY GOODMAN : And, Iesha, what happened to your children, your 4-year old and your 1-year-old? You were holding the 1-year-old. What did you do with her?
IESHA HARPER : I had to give her to a complete stranger, because the officer was being so aggressive and loud and yelling. And he like tried to grab her out of my arms, which I did not want to give her to that aggressive officer. So I gave her to a complete stranger. And then—
AMY GOODMAN : A stranger who came up. We see—
IESHA HARPER : —from there, I just didn’t know what was going on.
AMY GOODMAN : We see the bystander footage, and one of the people who’s behind filming is saying, “I’ll take the child. I’ll take the child.” So you handed her to a stranger. How is your 4-year-old processing this?
IESHA HARPER : I mean, she—like, all she kept doing was like trying to watch me. And she didn’t know what was going on. And, like, she had no clue. Like, it’s all about her taking that Barbie doll. Like, she was just so shocked and shooked.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Reverend Jarrett Maupin, put this in a broader context, with the Phoenix Police Department, what the African-American and Latino communities there have experienced at the hands of the police department, and what this case signifies for you.
REV . JARRETT MAUPIN : Well, extreme violations and a complete disregard for their inherent worth and dignity as human beings. You know, 44 shootings and killings last year, 15 more this year, more than 60 substantiated complaints of brutality and excessive force, but nothing as shocking as what we saw on this videotape with this family. That was a complete failure to respect any of their rights.
You know, if you listen to the beginning of the tape, when the officers approach the car with guns drawn, they tell Dravon to—you know, one says, “Put your hands up.” And the other one says, “Open the door.” Well, you know, that’s a perfect combination for an execution. These officers were intent on violating this family.
Meyer, the officer who was sort of the lead thug in this, has a terrible track record. In fact, at the rally last night, a young man came forward to say that he has a videotape, and shared it, of Officer Meyer abusing him. So you have police with records of abuse that continue to be employed by the department.
Phoenix has the highest number of police on the Brady list than any other city, five times more police violence against people of color in Phoenix than cities of comparable size. It’s the fifth-largest city in America, larger than Philadelphia. It’s systemic and institutional, the violence, the racism. The police department is 73% white. No diversity training, no sensitivity training, no body cameras. No hope. We must have something change. And it takes advocacy and litigation, but intervention. You know, if we had been under President Obama and Attorney General Holder, this police department would be in receivership of the Department of Justice.
AMY GOODMAN : On Saturday, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego issued a statement saying, “I, like many others, am sick over what I have seen in the video depicting Phoenix police interacting with family and young children. It was completely inappropriate and clearly unprofessional. There is no situation in which this behavior is ever close to acceptable. As a mother myself, seeing these children placed in such a terrifying situation is beyond upsetting. I am deeply sorry for what this family went through, and I apologize to our community. This is not who we are, and I refuse to allow this type of behavior to go unchallenged.” So, Reverend, what’s happened to the police officers? Are they all off—have they all been taken off the streets?
REV . JARRETT MAUPIN : They have not been fired. They’ve been suspended with pay, which is an insult to the family.
The mayor, her apology is lacking all substance, and it’s been rejected by not only this family, but the entire community, and especially the civil rights community. She lied to the national media. She said, by August, that all precincts in the city would have body cameras. That’s very misleading. There’s a difference between all precincts having a handful of cameras and all patrol officers having a body camera that they’re required to use. Who cares if a precinct has 15 cameras and 60 officers? There were 10 officers that responded, including a lieutenant. Not one had a body camera, even though they came from a precinct that was a “test” precinct for body cameras in this city.
We have a police union that exercises tremendous control over the City Council. It’s easier to fire the police chief or the city manager than it is to fire a rank-and-file officer. Something is wrong—policies, procedures, employment contracts. That’s what the city needs to look at. But the mayor and the chief have seen fit to come to our community again and ask us for answers. You know, we are—after 44 shootings, 15 more just this year, umpteen rallies, marches, lawsuits, they know what we want. The mayor represented South Phoenix, District 8, for six years, before she was elected mayor. That’s the highest concentration of black residents in the city. She was estranged to us then. But she knows what we’re demanding.
So, this is the politics of placation and smoke and mirrors, the finest we’re seeing played on poor, urban residents anywhere in the country. And it’s a shame. You know, the police’s—the chief, she’s a black woman. She said the other day that she gets how people feel. I would hope so. But that doesn’t mean she’s doing anything about it. Sometimes a black chief can be the best window dressing in prevention of bringing in needed reforms. The proof is in the dead bodies and the broken bodies.
AMY GOODMAN : We want to get into more details, but we’ll have to do that in Part 2 and post it online at democracynow.org. Dravon Ames and Iesha Harper, we want to thank you for being with us, suing the city of Phoenix, Arizona, for $10 million, after being stopped and held at gunpoint by police because their 4-year-old daughter allegedly took a doll from a Family Dollar store. And, Reverend Jarrett Maupin, thanks so much for being with us, family spokesperson. That does it for our broadcast. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González. Thanks so much for joining us.

The House Judiciary panel will hold a hearing today on reparations for slavery—the first hearing in over a decade on the subject. Among others, writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and actor and activist Danny Glover are set to testify. The question of reparations is expected to be a key issue for black voters as the 2020 presidential campaign rolls out. Ahead of today’s hearing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked by reporter Eva McKend whether the government should issue a public apology for slavery.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell : “I don’t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea.”
Today’s hearing coincides with Juneteenth, the day that commemorates June 19, 1865, when slaves in Galveston, Texas, finally learned that the Emancipation Proclamation had abolished slavery. Topics: Trump Refuses to Admit He Was Wrong in 1989 “Central Park 5” Case Jun 19, 2019
As the fallout mounts over the handling of the “Central Park 5” case, President Trump refused Tuesday to apologize for his actions at the time. Trump ran full-page newspaper ads during the 1989 case, calling for the death penalty for the five teenage boys of color who were wrongfully accused and convicted of raping a white woman in Central Park. They were eventually exonerated, and the case has been brought back into the spotlight following the release of Ava DuVernay’s Netflix miniseries “When They See Us.” Longtime White House correspondent April Ryan, who is African-American, asked Trump if he would apologize for his actions.
President Donald Trump : “You have people on both sides of that. They admitted their guilt. If you look at Linda Fairstein and if you look at some of the prosecutors, they think that the city should never have settled that case. So, we’ll leave it at that.”
Former prosecutor Linda Fairstein was dropped by her publisher and forced to step down from several nonprofit and education boards in recent weeks. Meanwhile, New York Public Advocate Jumaane Williams has backed a call from activists to reopen other cases tried by Fairstein and prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has so far refused. Topics:"
Big Tech's War for Your Wallet: Facebook Sparks Outrage After Announcing Plans for Digital Currency,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/19/big_techs_war_for_your_wallet,"executive editor of The American Prospect .

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: In a move that could reshape the world’s financial system, Facebook has unveiled plans to launch a new global digital currency called Libra. Facebook announced its plans Tuesday after secretly working on the cryptocurrency for more than a year. It plans to launch Libra next year in partnership with other large companies—among them, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber. Facebook said it wants to create, quote, “a simple global currency and infrastructure that empowers billions of people.” David Marcus, Facebook’s cryptocurrency chief, appeared on CNBC on Tuesday.
DAVID MARCUS : If you want to compare Libra with traditional cryptocurrencies, the first thing and the first big difference is that typically cryptocurrencies are investment vehicles or, you know, investment assets rather than being great medium of exchange. And this is really designed, from the ground up, to be a great medium of exchange, a very high-quality form of digital money that you can use for everyday payments and cross-border payments, microtransactions and all kinds of different things.
AMY GOODMAN : Facebook’s plan has already come under fierce criticism from financial regulators and lawmakers. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Libra must not become a sovereign currency. In Washington, the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Congressmember Maxine Waters, called on Facebook to pause its development of Libra until lawmakers and regulators have an opportunity to examine these issues and take action. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown tweeted, quote, “Facebook is already too big and too powerful, and it has used that power to exploit users’ data without protecting their privacy. We cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight,” Brown said.
To talk more about Facebook’s plans for a new digital currency, we’re joined by David Dayen. He is executive editor of The American Prospect , recently wrote a piece for The New Republic headlined “The Final Battle in Big Tech’s War to Dominate Your World.”
Welcome to Democracy Now! Talk about these major developments, David Dayen. Explain exactly what Libra is and what Facebook is trying to do.
DAVID DAYEN : So, Libra, as Facebook describes it, is a currency, a cryptocurrency. When you talk about that, you kind of think of something like bitcoin. But this would actually have reserves, so they call it sort of a stable coin. It is backed by actual money that is various international currencies and also government securities. And so, that should prevent volatility from the unit of exchange, Libra, going up or down very much. It will fluctuate a little, but not in the ways that, you know, we think of when we think of bitcoin. So, according to Facebook, that is the way that this can be used to purchase goods on the Facebook app or on any other app or website that offers payment in Libra. It’s a way to transfer money to other people on the Facebook app. Obviously, you know, we have, what, over 2 billion people that use Facebook. It’s a way to transfer something of value between those users. And because it’s backed by international currencies and can be used across borders, it’s really supplanting the need to exchange money. You don’t have to go from dollars to euros, necessarily; you can just pay in Libra. So, that’s sort of the pitch that Facebook would make.
The other side of this is that there’s no real regulatory setup. It’s displacing global currencies in some ways. There are serious monetary policy concerns, serious regulatory concerns. Could this be used to facilitate money laundering or tax evasion? There are a whole host of unanswered questions around this.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, David Dayen, this whole issue of a bunch of private companies, because we’re not talking just about Facebook. They initiated it, but they’ve gotten a buy-in from credit card companies, from PayPal, from Uber, from a variety of very powerful companies, mostly American companies. And you’re, in essence, creating a private organization to run a money system that would stretch across borders. I spent a couple of hours going on their website yesterday, trying to understand even the governance situation of this, and it’s very detailed. They’ve been working on this, obviously, for quite some time in secret. And they talk about creating a Libra Association Council, where if you were going to be a founding member, you have to invest at least $10 million, and supposedly no one company could control this council, because you’d be limited to a 1% voting share, no matter how much money you invested. But if you invest a lot of money, you can designate universities or nonprofits to vote for you on this council. So, in effect, the more money you invest, even though you may not have direct power over how the association functions, you can still have enormous influence on the voting blocs of what would in essence be a new international currency. I’m wondering what—
DAVID DAYEN : Yeah, I mean—
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: What are regulators going to say about this?
DAVID DAYEN : Yeah, there are serious governance questions around it. There are also, you know, financial questions. I mean, the way that this works, as I understand it, is there’s this investment of $10 million from up to a hundred companies, so you’re talking about a billion dollars. And also, all the money—so, if somebody buys Libra, they’re paying that money into this reserve, and they get Libra back. That money can be used to be invested, these reserves, Facebook says, in very low-risk securities, but that money is not returned to the individual. So, if you think about a bank, you get interest on your money that you deposit with the bank, that the bank can use for any purpose that they wish. In this case, the interest stays with these companies. So, you know, there’s a financial incentive for these companies to get involved in this.
And if you think about the scale, the potential scale of something like this, where you’re talking about 2 billion users, any—this is almost an operating system for money. Any other organization can build something to create payment services in this fashion. The possibilities are really endless, and so, you know, the financial possibilities are also endless. And as you correctly cite, Juan, I mean, the governance questions of how this currency will be managed, how capital flows will be understood and facilitated, if you have a country that is experiencing an economic downturn and—Libra is an excellent way for capital flight, which is something we don’t really want when a country is in financial trouble. How is that going to be mitigated or managed? There are just, as I said, just way too many unanswered questions with this.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what about the issue, for instance, of countries that may be in conflict with each other—the United States and Iran right now or the United States and Venezuela? The impact of this kind of a currency on the geopolitical conflicts and the ability of nations to control their own currencies?
DAVID DAYEN : Yeah, I mean, it’s hard to know how sanctions would work under this setup. It’s hard to know how any kind of anti-money-laundering—usually a bank would have to create some suspicious activity report. Will Libra be able to do that? You know, you could use this for ways to harm other countries through removing that currency into Libra. I mean, that would obviously be done at the individual level. But, you know, usually, as you say, countries are in control of their own fiat currency. And if they have this sort of safety valve, this global currency that would displace them in some ways, which an individual could use to make all the purchases that it needs to make, and not use the currency denominated in that particular country, it’s almost unknown. I mean, we’d have no precedent for this. So, it’s hard to say what some of the implications would be. And I think that’s why regulators and politicians are asking to really slow down, so this can sort of be studied.
AMY GOODMAN : On Tuesday, Facebook released a promotional video highlighting what the company sees as possible benefits of the new currency.
>> What if everyone was invited to the global economy with access to the same financial opportunities? Introducing Libra, a new global currency, designed for the digital world, backed by the belief that money should be fast for Ope in Lagos, simple for Saul’s family business in Manila, and secure for Betsabé when sending money home to Mexico City. It’s powered by blockchain, making it safe and accessible, no matter who you are or where you’re from.
AMY GOODMAN : So, David Dayen, executive editor of The American Prospect , if you can respond to this, and also why Libra will be based in Switzerland? Does it have to do with it being a banking center, a tax haven?
DAVID DAYEN : Yeah. So, I mean, the truth is, is that if you were able to create some sort of digital wallet that could be used in any country and purchase and make microtransfers and things like that, it would be convenient. I mean, that’s really what Facebook is banking on, right? I mean, right now the U.S. payment system is pretty clunky, particularly with international transfers, that take several days to clear. There would be a convenience angle here.
And, of course, Facebook believes that if they can get you on their website and using their digital wallet, which they control directly—I mean, there’s this Libra Association that’s based in Switzerland, as you say, probably for tax purposes, that is controlling the governance of the currency. But Calibra, which is what David Marcus, who we heard from at the top, is running, is a digital wallet that’s run by a subsidiary that’s wholly owned by Facebook. So, if Calibra becomes ubiquitous, if it becomes this thing that you really need to make purchases, then you have something like WeChat. And WeChat is the app in China that has become so much a part of people’s lives that it’s very hard to use paper money in China. I mean, this is a social media app, it’s a chat tool, and also it’s a purchase app. It’s something that you can use in that fashion.
And that’s Facebook’s, I think, end goal. If you add payments onto this social media application that is incredibly dominant, you’ve basically locked people into Facebook. And if you’ve done that, then, you know, whether you’re taking a little bit out of every transaction that 2 billion people make on a daily basis, or whether you are just locking people onto the site, knowing what purchases they’ve made and then selling very data-rich ads based on that, you have a prospect of real domination. And, you know, I really think that either this thing is going to not get off the ground, because too many regulators and politicians will have uneasiness about it, or we’ll look back in 20 years, and this will be the week where this thing was announced that created this dominant global company that is, you know, an indispensable digital partner kind of walking you through life.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, David Dayen, the whole issue of security. Facebook is currently a poster child for the violations of privacy data rights of individuals. They’re insisting that they’re going to build a—this Calibra will be a separate subsidiary, that it won’t share the user information of Facebook itself with this payment system that they set up. Could you talk about this issue? Because it almost seems like—or, it does seem like Facebook is basically transferring its monopoly position in social media to then enter the financial transactions world.
DAVID DAYEN : Yeah. I mean, first of all, do you trust Mark Zuckerberg with anything around privacy at this point, after years and years of these revelations? And second of all, it’s a bit of a red herring. So, it’s entirely possible—let’s take Facebook at their word—that the financial data and the social data will be separate. Well, in order to access purchases on Libra, you’re still going to have to make a click within the Facebook app or within WhatsApp or wherever, to find your purchase or to search for a business that you want to solicit or things like that. And that information is certainly going to be available to Facebook. So, the idea that there’s no, you know, extra data that you’d be grabbing here, if you’re Facebook, is really not true. I mean, if you’re spending more time on the app, if you’re clicking around to find things to buy on the app, which is not typically at this point what people do on Facebook, then that’s just much more data that Facebook is going to be able to use to target ads at you and do whatever else it wants.
AMY GOODMAN : So, finally, again, the title of your piece , “The Final Battle in Big Tech’s War to Dominate Your World,” fill that out.
DAVID DAYEN : Sure. So, we’ve been seeing, over the last several months, the big tech companies—Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook—try to figure out how to become that sort of one partner. I mean, you have Apple, that put out this thing that’s a credit card, called the Apple Card. You have Amazon partnering with other global payment systems on what they call World Pay—or, what they call Amazon Pay, I should say. Google has its own digital wallet. And now you have Facebook with this thing that is—who knows what it is? Is it a bank? Is it a prepaid card? Is it a digital wallet? Is it a global currency? So you have all these companies, that were kind of competing separately, are now all moving into the payment space and also moving into other spaces that are overlapping, like entertainment, to become that thing that is sort of the only kind of digital tool that you will need. So you can make all of your purchases, you can talk to all your friends, you can access all your entertainment, you can do everything that you wish inside this world, whether it’s Facebook, Google, Amazon or Apple.
And that’s really their intention. And that’s why I call it sort of the war of all against all. This is like the final battle for global domination here. And, you know, how that shakes out is sort of indeterminate at this point, but what we know is that if you’re creating this—we already have these companies that are monopolies in their own sort of personal spaces—if they combine sort of together a lot of different options for you as an individual, then you have just this absolute dominant behemoth. And, you know, there are serious concerns around giving that much power to one company.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, of course, we’ll continue to follow this, David Dayen, executive editor of The American Prospect . We’ll link to your piece in The New Republic , “The Final Battle in Big Tech’s War to Dominate Your World.”
Coming up, we go to Arizona to speak with an African-American family held at gunpoint by police because their 4-year-old daughter allegedly took a doll from a Family Dollar store.

Nearly 26 million refugees were recorded in 2018, over half of them under the age of 18. Of those, less than 100,000 were resettled. Over 41 million people worldwide were internally displaced, and 3.5 million were registered as asylum seekers. Syria represents the highest number of refugees at 6.7 million, while Ethiopians represented the largest newly displaced population last year, the vast majority internally displaced due to intercommunal conflict. The annual report by the U.N. Refugee Agency was released to coincide with World Refugee Day, which is today. Topics:"

And that’s the way it needs to be described in the history books.” Newsom also announced the creation of a Truth and Healing Council.
In 1850, California passed a law allowing for the separation of Native American families, their removal from tribal territories, and the creation of a system of indentured servitude. The Los Angeles Times reports California’s Native American population declined from about 150,000 to 30,000 between 1846 and 1879.

Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we turn to Guatemala, where the Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced Thursday it will hold a recount amidst fraud allegations following last Sunday’s presidential and legislative elections. Former first lady Sandra Torres of the party UNE currently leads the presidential race with nearly 26% of the vote. Before the recount was announced, a runoff was expected between Torres and Alejandro Giammattei, the candidate for the ultraconservative Vamos. Both of them have been accused of money laundering and ties to drug traffickers.
Guatemala’s former Attorney General Thelma Aldana, a leading presidential candidate, was barred from participating in the race and was forced to flee Guatemala after receiving death threats. During her time as Guatemala’s top prosecutor, Thelma Aldana helped investigate hundreds of politicians and businessmen on corruption charges, including former President Otto Pérez Molina, who was forced to resign in 2015, is now in jail as he awaits trial. In March, shortly before Aldana announced her candidacy for president with the center-left political party Movimiento Semilla, she was barred from the race after criminal charges and an arrest warrant were issued against her. She says the accusations are retaliation for her work with Guatemala’s anti-corruption movement. Last year, she was awarded the 2018 Right Livelihood Honorary Award.
Well, I spoke with Thelma Aldana earlier this week, shortly after Guatemalans headed to the polls. I began by asking her about the outcome of the election.
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] In Guatemala, there is a captured state. This is something which I have verified with Iván Velásquez, who is the commissioner of the International Commission Against Impunity and Corruption. In the investigations we carried out, we found out that there were illicit economic and political networks encrusted in the Guatemalan state. The institutions, particularly the institutions of justice or key institutions in the country that are part of the Guatemalan state, have been captured.
In that context, the elections recently held in Guatemala lack any legitimacy. It is an election which has no possibility of being democratic, because the state has been captured, and everything that emanates from dark institutions, institutions that lend themselves to manipulation, cannot yield a transparent process. I am referring to the Office of General Accounts, the Supreme Court of Justice, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the Constitutional Court. All of these institutions have persons within who answer to the interests of any number of sectors, but not the national interest.
I was a victim of those institutions, which, for no reason and for no basis, left me outside of the election contest, because I represented some disturbance to that corrupt and captured system. And I was a bother, because I fought corruption. Now I am accuse of absolutely false—facing absolutely false accusations and I’m suffering death threats, merely because I fought against corruption. I believe that in Guatemala the conditions do not exist to be able to speak of a legitimate election.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about who the pacto de corruptos is, what some call the “corrupt wolf pack”?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] The pact of the corrupt, or corrupt wolf pack, is a criminal and perverse alliance that has been operating in Guatemala for many years, especially through the old traditional politics whereby every four years we are made to choose among the same. And the people go to the polls with hopes that everything will change, and nothing changes, because that criminal pact exists, that criminal alliance.
This pact of the corrupt came about, in particular, of an action by the Congress of the Republic, which was legislating and indeed adopted laws that favored impunity and that favored themselves, the very legislators who were indicated by the CICIG , the international commission, and the Attorney General’s Office. They were accused of several anomalous acts. So, there is alliance among several legislators in the national Congress, President Jimmy Morales, an important sector of the political class, and various interests, who have all formed this corrupt wolf pack that has brought Guatemalan democracy to its knees at this time.
AMY GOODMAN : Thelma Aldana, do you believe they are responsible for driving you out of the country? Are they responsible, including the president, Jimmy Morales, for the death threats against you?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] They are the ones who are responsible for having brought the work of the International Commission Against Impunity to a halt. They are responsible for having expelled Commissioner Iván Velásquez. And, of course, they are responsible for what I am experiencing at this time outside of Guatemala. They are responsible for having captured the Guatemalan state and having left me out of the electoral contest and favoring several sectors. They are also responsible for the whole manipulation and everything that was done in this election process. There are complaints in Guatemala that many people were brought to vote through illicit payments and any number of manipulative actions, this corrupt wolf pack.
AMY GOODMAN : So, can you describe who Sandra Torres is, the front-runner in the presidential race, in the runoff, as well as Alejandro Giammattei?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] I know the history of Sandra Torres to some extent. I have met her personally, perhaps once. But we, the majority of Guatemalans, know that since she was first lady, wife of former President Álvaro Colom, she exercised a strong de facto power in the country. She had a clientelistic agenda. And according to one case that was brought by the International Commission Against Impunity, she has been involved in illegal campaign financing. But she’s been protected by the attorney general, by the Supreme Court of Justice, by the Constitutional Court. And also, through her, several institutions of the state have been manipulated. It would be nefarious for the country for her to become the president of Guatemala, because her antecedents don’t really speak of transparent work; rather, there are indications that there’s been corruption around her political movement and her activity in the government in Guatemala.
Now, in terms of Mr. Giammattei, I don’t know him. I just came to learn, because this was known nationally and internationally, that there was an incident involving extrajudicial executions in a prison of Guatemala, but he was acquitted of those charges. He is a person who has run for president of the republic four times, I believe.
AMY GOODMAN : Once you were unfairly tossed out, barred from running, do you think the progressives in Guatemala made a mistake in not uniting behind Thelma Cabrera, the indigenous presidential candidate, who shocked many by coming in fourth? If the left and progressive parties had joined together, including you, once you were pushed out, might she have won the presidency or at least entered the runoff?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] I think that the way to defeat the traditional politics, the old politics, and the pact of the corrupt in Guatemala was precisely to achieve unity of those parties with a progressive ideology. It was necessary for them to come together and to come to agreement on a single candidate. It could have been Thelma Cabrera. It could have been Mr. Villacorta. It could have been another progressive candidate not implicated in corruption cases and illegal campaign financing cases.
It seems to me that it is unfortunate that the progressive sectors in Guatemala have been unable to unite. The problem in Guatemala is not of left or right; it is a problem of corruption and impunity. And around that struggle against corruption and impunity, several sectors—progressive sectors, right-wing sectors, transparent sectors—should have come together to struggle for a better country.
AMY GOODMAN : For our audience, who is not familiar with Thelma Cabrera, she ran for president with the leftist political party Movement for the Liberation of the People, known as the MLP . The party seeks to declare Guatemala a plurinational state to recognize its more than 20 indigenous and Afro-Guatemalan groups, wants to nationalize Guatemala’s natural resources, and runs on a platform of inclusion and diversity. This is Thelma Cabrera speaking to hundreds of supporters in Guatemala City’s Constitutional Plaza for MLP’s campaign closing right before the election.
THELMA CABRERA : [translated] We have been governed by businessmen, military men, academics and, most recently, by a comedian. We bring a struggle from within the social movements, from our territories, and we say we are going to fight for progress of the popular constitutional assembly and a plurinational state. It is urgent to create a plurinational state, to replace a failed state, a putrid state. We have to build a new state through the participation of the Mayan people, Garífunas, Xincas and Mestizos.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that’s Thelma Cabrera, who came in fourth in the presidential race and did not make the runoff. But she got 11% of the vote, shocking many. I mean, she was the second indigenous woman to run for president. Rigoberta Menchú, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, ran. She didn’t receive anything like this. Thelma Aldana, did it also surprise you, the level of support she got across the country, across Guatemala?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] Yes, it did surprise me, because Guatemala, unfortunately, is a patriarchal country where discrimination is constant, discrediting, as well, and the political space is closed to women, particularly us women who act transparently and are progressive. All the more so, the political space is closed for an indigenous woman, a woman like Thelma Cabrera, who was trained as a leader in her community and who is fully familiar with the reality of the indigenous peoples, their reality of poverty, extreme poverty, lack of opportunity, and which has spurred migration. It’s spurred millions of Guatemalans to migrate, especially to the United States. So, Thelma Cabrera today has emerged as a leader, a leader on the left who certainly will have quite a future in Guatemala.
AMY GOODMAN : Thelma Aldana, would you have won if you had been allowed to run for presidency?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] I think that right now I would have made it to the second round.
AMY GOODMAN : What do you believe Guatemala needs? If you had not been barred from running, what was your platform? And talk about the Movimiento Semilla, your party.
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] Yes, the Movimiento Semilla is a citizen platform, a progressive movement, ready and willing to fight poverty, hunger, extreme poverty, that Guatemala experiences. We want to open up opportunities for indigenous peoples, for women, for the peasant population, for children, for youths. And we need to create that space for inclusion that is so badly needed in Guatemala. No doubt, had we participated, we’d be in the second round and with a good possibility of reaching the presidency. And our most important goal was to rescue the Guatemalan state from the criminal structures that have captured it at this time and to put in place a government at the service of the people.
AMY GOODMAN : Thelma Aldana, the former attorney general of Guatemala, leader in the country’s anti-corruption movement, former presidential candidate in this year’s election until she was barred, now has fled the country, facing death threats. Back with her in a minute.
[break]
AMY GOODMAN : Guatemalan hip-hop artist Rebecca Lane. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue our conversation with Thelma Aldana, the former attorney general of Guatemala, leader in the country’s anti-corruption movement, former presidential candidate, who was barred from running in last Sunday’s Guatemalan elections, fled the country, facing death threats. In this exclusive interview, I asked her about the factors leading Guatemalans to flee the country for the U.S.-Mexico border in record numbers.
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] In a country where 27% of the population is living in extreme poverty—that’s 3.8 million Guatemalans who today don’t have enough to eat—in a country where 60% of the population is living in poverty, in a country that is governed by a pact of the corrupt, where there is a criminal alliance, there are no opportunities, there is no security, and there are no opportunities for leading a life with dignity. And this forces people to migrate, to leave to look for better living conditions in the United States. And the migration will never be brought to a halt until the underlying problem of Guatemala is resolved. And El Salvador and Honduras find themselves in the same situation. The problem is structural. The problem is one of lack of opportunity, discrimination, racism and corruption. The rule for governing in Guatemala is corruption. It’s no exception. They steal everything, and the people are left hungry.
AMY GOODMAN : What about the role of the United States? President Trump recently announced that he was cutting off all aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of the outflow of migrants into the United States. How will that affect Guatemala?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] Guatemala has had a lot of support from the international community, including the United States. The setting up of the International Commission Against Impunity, the CICIG , is an effort by the United Nations. Nonetheless, it is not appreciated in Guatemala. I think that beyond U.S. policy and beyond the support of the international community, which is extremely valuable, our problem is in Guatemala, and it needs to be resolved democratically in Guatemala.
AMY GOODMAN : So, talk about what the CICIG did and what you did as attorney general, as well as after in working with CICIG . Talk about the threats faced by the investigators, who was held accountable for corruption, and what it means for CICIG to be ending in Guatemala right now.
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] In my view, the establishment of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala is the best contribution that the United Nations has made to my country. It is the greatest effort, and it is a successful mechanism, a mechanism that does work. I can tell you that I worked hand in hand with the International Commission Against Impunity. It does work. And that is why the criminal alliance in Guatemala is bothered by this, and perhaps there might be some other countries that don’t want a similar mechanism for the same reason. If a president of the republic, if a national Congress sector is committed to transparency, if this is what we had, then they’d be supporting the work of the CICIG and the work of Commissioner Iván Velásquez.
During our joint effort, we were able to dismantle hundreds of criminal structures. And we showed the population the face of those who have directed the clandestine security apparatuses and those that have been in the Guatemalan state. We showed the Guatemalan population how these structures became illicit political and economic structures, and those are the ones that have captured the Guatemalan state.
The cases that we investigated are a sample, a show of how we could make a contribution to the Guatemalan justice system in these conditions. We understand that a people with a solid justice system can think about democracy and can think about making progress in human rights and in serving the neediest persons. If a justice system like that in Guatemala suffers backsliding, which is indeed what is happening, then, at the end of the day, the people will pay the consequences, and the criminal alliance will continue with its status quo , with its illicit financing, and with worse living conditions in Guatemala.
AMY GOODMAN : So, at this point, Thelma Aldana, what happens to you? You are outside of Guatemala. Can you talk about why and what your plans are for the future? What about these charges that have been brought against you, of embezzlement and crimes around taxes? What do you say about them?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] I am suffering this vengeful harassment by the criminal structures of Guatemala because of the work that we did with the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. So, what I hope now is for the country to give me the security conditions to make it possible for me to return to Guatemala. It would be very easy for them to take me into a prison and murder me, because I’ve gone after gangs. I’ve gone after all kinds of crime in the country. And if I go back to the country, it’s most likely that the next day I would show up dead.

AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the significance of the election of Lucrecia Hernández Mack, the daughter of the murdered Guatemalan anthropologist Myrna Mack, September 11, 1990, murdered by Guatemalan paramilitary forces, sadly, backed by the United States?
THELMA ALDANA : [translated] Yes, Lucrecia Hernández Mack and the seven legislators who were elected by the Movimiento Semilla political party will no doubt be a light of hope in the national Congress. Lucrecia has done important work. She has brought a message of hope to Guatemalans. Nonetheless, I must recognize that they are a minority and that they’re going to have to make a major effort to get their proposals adopted in the national Congress.
AMY GOODMAN : That was Thelma Aldana, the former attorney general of Guatemala, a leader in Guatemala’s anti-corruption movement, former presidential candidate in this year’s election until she was barred from running and left Guatemala, facing death threats.
At the end of the interview, she was speaking about Lucrecia Hernández Mack, a newly elected legislator in the Guatemalan Congress with Aldana’s political party, although there will now be a recount for all of Guatemala’s elections. Lucrecia Mack is the daughter of the renowned Guatemalan anthropologist Myrna Mack, who was murdered by U.S.-backed Guatemalan security forces on another September 11th—September 11, 1990. We got in touch with Lucrecia Hernández Mack in Guatemala City earlier this week, and I asked her about her mother’s legacy.
LUCRECIA HERNÁNDEZ MACK : In Guatemala, we had a 36-year armed internal conflict, between 1960 and 1996, which was the year that we signed our last and final peace accord. During these years of conflict, the military would come into the rural communities and massacre them. So we would have a lot of survivors fleeing into the mountains and going as refugees to Mexico.
And my mother, as a social anthropologist, would do research on the internally displaced population. So she would publish, along with certain U.S. universities. And because of these publications she did, she was—she became an enemy of the state. So she was a target of an intelligence operation of the Estado Mayor Presidencial, which is the major office for the security of the president and that worked as an intelligence squad, a death squad. So, in 1990, on September 11 of 1990, she was murdered, stabbed 27 times, just when she was coming out of her work.
After that, my aunt, Helen Mack, started looking for justice. She was able to prosecute and have a sentence against one of the material authors and one of the intellectual authors. They were both part of the military. And the intellectual author was a colonel, who is currently—has escaped justice. He was never—he was prosecuted. He was sentenced. But he was never—we were never able to put him in prison.
My mother was the victim of a state that would repress and generate death. And many of us are just trying to convert and change that government into a government that gives well-being and life and health, basically. So, that’s maybe the major reason why I’ve gone into politics, and now I’m an elected congresswoman. And I’m in a political party that is trying to, you know, combine ethics with politics and to have a government that is not working for the military or for the oppression or for the corrupt, but finally we will start working for the people.
AMY GOODMAN : Lucrecia Hernández Mack, former minister of health in Guatemala, now newly elected legislator in the Guatemalan Congress with the political party Movimiento Semilla, the political party of Thelma Aldana. The Guatemalan Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced Thursday it will hold a recount amidst fraud allegations following last Sunday’s presidential and legislative elections.

AMY GOODMAN : We begin today’s show with news that President Trump approved, then abruptly called off, U.S. preparations for a military strike against Iran. The move came after the operation was already underway in its initial stages, with warships and planes already being put into position. The New York Times reports President Trump approved the strikes in retaliation for Iran shooting down an unmanned U.S. military surveillance drone with a surface-to-air missile, but then called off the attacks at the last minute last night. U.S. officials said targets would have included radars and missile batteries in Iran, and that strikes were scheduled for just before dawn this morning in order to minimize the risk to civilians and the Iranian military. It remains unclear if attacks on Iran might go ahead later.
Iran says the U.S. drone it shot down was on a spy mission over Iranian airspace, but Washington says it was shot down over international airspace in the Strait of Hormuz. The Associated Press reports the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard’s aerospace division says Iran had warned the drone several times before launching a missile at it. General Amir Ali Hajizadeh told Iranian state television on Friday, quote, “Unfortunately they did not answer.” Trump spoke to reporters about the downed drone Thursday in the Oval Office when he was meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Iran made a big mistake. This drone was in international waters, clearly. We have it all documented. It’s documented scientifically, not just words. And they made a very bad mistake.
REPORTER : How will you respond, Mr. President? How will you respond?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : You’ll find out.
REPORTER : Are you going to go to war with Iran?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : You’ll find out. You’ll find out. I mean, obviously—obviously—obviously, you know, we’re not going to be talking too much about it. You’re going to find out. They made a very big mistake.
AMY GOODMAN : Amidst tensions over the downing of the U.S. drone, the Federal Aviation Administration has now barred American aircraft from flying over Iranian-administered airspace in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Other airlines have also changed the routing of their planes.
All of this comes after Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran last year and has imposed economic sanctions on Iran. On Tuesday, the U.S. announced it was sending a thousand more troops to the region. In May, it also announced a 1,500-troop increase after attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Iran has denied being involved in the attacks and has repeatedly said it’s not seeking war with the United States.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top Trump officials have reportedly been linking Iran to al-Qaeda and the Taliban during closed-door briefings with congressional lawmakers, in what Democrats fear could be part of a plan to invoke the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force to attack Iran.
For more, we’re going to Tehran, Iran, where we’re joined via Democracy Now! video stream by Mohammad Marandi, professor of English literature and Orientalism at the University of Tehran. He was part of the nuclear deal negotiations in 2015. Here in New York, we’re joined by Ervand Abrahamian. He is a retired professor of history at City University of New York. He’s the author of several books, including The Coup: 1953, the CIA , and the Roots of Modern U.S.-Iranian Relations .
We welcome you both to Democracy Now!
MOHAMMAD MARANDI : Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s start in Tehran with professor Mohammad Marandi. Can you talk about the response on ground to hearing this New York Times report, which the Trump administration has not denied and other now news outlets have confirmed, that they were in the midst of a strike; right before the attack happened, with the planes in the air, they called it off?
MOHAMMAD MARANDI : Well, people are viewing the whole story with a significant amount of skepticism. And the reason is that the whole affair, this whole saga, began with the U.S. leaving the nuclear deal, and then, subsequently, Trump imposing economic warfare against Iranians, something which he said specifically—also said that these were brutal sanctions. So the escalation began on the American side.
And then the tankers that were struck also were suspicious to the Iranians, because the tankers that were struck a month ago off the coast of the United Arab Emirates were attacked almost immediately after Bolton said the Israelis gave him information about an imminent Iranian attack, which made them suspicious. And then, just recently, right off the Iranian coast, two other tankers were struck, linked to Japan, the tankers, while the Japanese prime minister was in Tehran, the first prime minister from Japan in Tehran for 41 years. And right before he was supposed to meet the Iranian leader, these tankers were struck. And the Americans said they were mines. The company that owned the tanker said they were not mines, they were projectiles coming from the air. All of this makes everything that’s going on over the past few days seem very suspicious in the eyes of ordinary Iranians.
And with regards to this particular drone, this is not the first drone that belongs to the United States military that the Iranians have downed. They have downed a number of drones in the past. The United States never denied that. They’ve recovered the parts. And they’ve brought down another drone by hacking the computer and landing it safely. And in this particular case, the Iranian foreign minister gave the precise details of where it was hit, and the Iranians also recovered parts of the drone itself. So, the American government narrative here seems suspicious, as well, and therefore, in the eyes of Iranians, everything that comes out of Washington right now has to be looked at with a great deal of skepticism.
AMY GOODMAN : Hossein Salami said Iran shot down the drone to send a clear message to the U.S. that Iran does “not have any intention for war with any country, but we are ready for war.” Can you explain the significance of his comments, Professor Marandi?
MOHAMMAD MARANDI : Well, when President Trump says that he can annihilate and destroy Iran, in a tweet, then the Iranians are going to take any move by the U.S. military seriously. When the U.S. president and people in the White House constantly speak about “all options are on the table” and Republican senators calling for strikes on Iran, then that makes the Iranian military much more sensitive. The Iranians are already engaged in defensive actions against the United States. They have to constantly monitor American fighter jets and American ships that are constantly moving close to the Iranian border. And when a drone like this violates Iranian airspace, that basically means that they are looking for places to strike. That’s how the Iranians interpret it. So the Iranian military had no option but to shoot down the drone. And the fact that the Americans don’t want to wait to see the evidence in the U.N. Security Council also makes this more suspicious.
So, the Iranians have said repeatedly, “We don’t want war.” That is why we remained within the framework of the nuclear deal. Even one year after the Americans have exited the deal, and the Europeans are in clear violation because they are intimidated by Trump, and the deal is basically a one-sided deal, the Iranians are still abiding by the deal, because they want to decrease sanctions. If the Iranians wanted to increase tensions, they would have left the nuclear deal a year ago.
AMY GOODMAN : Ervand Abrahamian, I want to bring you into this conversation. You’re a historian. You wrote a book about the history of Iran, so you have—and you’re from Iran. You know extensively what U.S. involvement with Iran is, back to the U.S. overthrow of the democratically elected leader in 1953, Mohammad Mosaddegh. As you watch what’s taking place now, and even if President Trump called off this attack, that was supposedly about to take place Thursday night, it doesn’t mean it is not imminent.
ERVAND ABRAHAMIAN : Exactly. I think the long-term agenda in the White House—maybe not Trump himself, but Bolton, Pompeo—it’s clear what their record is on Iran. They want basically the destruction of the Islamic Republic, maybe even destruction of the state, maybe even the destruction of Iran. So, they have a long record on this. They haven’t kept it hidden. And I think they were basically putting into implementation this program.
But, of course, Trump has started, basically, his presidential campaign, and it’s not good sense to go into an electoral campaign talking about war. So, I think he has—as a presidential candidate, he has a vested interest in keeping the, quote, “war issue” basically as low as possible. I wouldn’t be surprised that in a few days he comes up and says that he has a secret plan to resolve all the differences with Iran. He’ll reveal the secret plan after the election. We’ve heard all these secret plans before. But whether he himself wants war or not, I don’t think that’s that important. The people driving policy, making policy, are, in fact, very determined to, from their point of view, solve the problem of Iran.
And this new crisis, we can talk endlessly about the drones, the tankers. As you said, the recent crisis really starts with Trump saying that the nuclear deal was not just a bad deal, but it was the worst deal ever United States has made, and that we need a new deal. Now, if he wanted a new deal, you usually leave a door open for negotiations for a new deal. But after he said that, right away, Pompeo actually had slammed the door. He came up with the 12 commandments to Iran, that Iran had to basically submit to the 12 demands.
Well, we know the 10 lord’s demands are quite hard to meet. These 12 demands are actually quite absurd. There’s no way Iran could meet these 12 demands. I mean, it would be equivalent to the supreme leader in Iran telling Trump, “Oh, we’ll be happy to meet and discuss with you, but you have to meet 12 demands. The first is, you need to sit down and negotiate seriously with Black Lives Matter. If you deal that one, we could discuss. Or that, you know, your democracy is defective because very low percentage of the electorate votes. You have to do something about increasing your electorate participation, then we’ll participate in negotiations.” Well, these sort of demands would be considered absurd. Similarly, the demands that Pompeo put on Iran were absurd. They weren’t really negotiating demands; they were basically saying, “Surrender, submit to everything we demand, and, basically, commit suicide.” And this obviously is not acceptable to any regime that wants to survive.
So, from then on, basically, I would say, some sort of military confrontation between U.S. and Iran was inevitable. Now, whether it happens next week or the week after or after the election, if Trump is elected, I think that’s basically in the books. There’s no way we can avoid, basically, some sort of military confrontation.
AMY GOODMAN : Mohammad Marandi, can you talk about the role of Jared Kushner in supposedly shaping a Middle East peace plan? And what does this have to do with Iran?
MOHAMMAD MARANDI : I think the objective—one of the objectives of the Trump administration is to sideline Iran, to put so much pressure on Iran so that Iran discontinues its support for the Palestinian people. The Iranian position, of course, on Israel is that Israel, like apartheid South Africa, is an apartheid regime and that it is morally illegitimate and that it has to change fundamentally, like South Africa, until Iran recognizes such a state. In other words, Palestinians have to have equal rights and self-determination throughout the land. But the United States, because of Iran’s support for the Palestinian cause, wants to sideline Iran, to weaken Iran so much, or, as the esteemed professor points out, perhaps even further—the United States wants to go further than that and destroy Iran. But they are doing this, or they want to do this, basically to strengthen the hand of the Israeli regime and allow them to finish off the whole issue of Palestine. Of course, I don’t think that is possible. I don’t think it’s going to happen. The “deal of the century,” I think, is going to fail.
But also, I’d like to point one other thing out. And that is, if indeed a military conflict is inevitable between the United States and Iran, I think there are two important things that have to be kept in mind. First, if there is a war, then, in my opinion, all of the oil and gas facilities, as well as the tankers in the Persian Gulf region, will be destroyed. This will not be just the issue of closing the Strait of Hormuz. This will be something very long-term. And that will lead to a global economic catastrophe unlike anything we’ve seen in contemporary history. In addition to that, Iranian allies across the region will engage U.S. forces and U.S. allies militarily, in Iraq, in Afghanistan and elsewhere. And then you would have the Saudi and Emirati regimes collapse immediately, because they’re completely dependent on oil. And millions of people will be on the move. So, that’s a scenario that is just something that people should not even contemplate.
The second is that the United States may carry out a small strike. Here, I think, is almost equally dangerous, because I think that there are some so-called Iran experts in the United States that are telling the U.S. government that if you carry out a limited strike, Iran will do nothing in response, or there will be just some token response. That is a major miscalculation. The Iranians will be relentless in their response. They will probably be very disproportionate, as well. And they will also strike those regional countries that are allowing—that would allow the Americans to attack. And the reason why the Iranians would respond so severely is that they want to make sure that the United States does not come to any conclusion that they could repeatedly attack Iran. And this, of course, could lead to further and further escalation. So, it would be against the interests of the whole of the international community, as well as the people of the United States, to even contemplate any strike, even limited.
AMY GOODMAN : And, Mohammad Marandi, we just have 20 seconds with you left in Tehran. The effects of the sanctions on the ground in Iran?
MOHAMMAD MARANDI : Well, the U.S. government is trying to make people suffer. And people have died. Certain medicines are not available. The U.S. government is trying to prevent Iran from importing medicine, among other things. And so sometimes some medicines are not available. And for people who have serious issues, they could die. And many people have died as a result over the past few months.
AMY GOODMAN : And finally, Ervand Abrahamian, the U.S. media coverage, so often the media used to beat the drums for war, your analysis of it?
ERVAND ABRAHAMIAN : Well, I think—I’m not expert on the media, but The New York Times , so far, has been actually much more cautious as compared to in the Iraqi situation. I would imagine the other press, you know, Fox News and stuff, basically repeats the official line about Iran as being the cause of all the problems the U.S. has. But on the whole, I would say the quality of press has been quite down-to-earth with it.
AMY GOODMAN : And, of course, we will continue to cover this. Ervand Abrahamian, retired professor at the City University of New York, speaking to us here in New York. And Mohammad Marandi, professor of English literature and Orientalism at the University of Tehran, part of the nuclear deal negotiations in 2015, speaking to us from Iran.

As the world focuses on Tuesday’s historic handshake between President Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro, we look back at the pivotal role Cuba played in ending apartheid and why Castro was one of only five world leaders invited to speak at Nelson Mandela’s memorial. In the words of Mandela, the Cubans 'destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the white oppressor … [and] inspired the fighting masses of South Africa.' Historian Piero Gleijeses argues that it was Cuba’s victory in Angola in 1988 that forced Pretoria to set Namibia free and helped break the back of apartheid South Africa. We speak to Gleijeses about his new book, “Visions of Freedom: Havana, Washington, Pretoria, and the Struggle for Southern Africa, 1976-1991,” and play archival footage of Mandela meeting Fidel Castro in Cuba.

NERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to the historic moment Tuesday when President Barack Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raúl Castro as both men participated in the memorial service for anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in South Africa. The White House said the handshake was unscripted. It marked the first time a U.S. president has shaken hands with a Cuban leader since 2000. In Washington, Republicans expressed outrage over the exchange. During a hearing in the House, Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida sparred with Secretary of State John Kerry, who said it did not represent any change in U.S. policy toward Cuba.
REP . ILEANA ROS - LEHTINEN : Mr. Secretary, sometimes a handshake is just a handshake. But when the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like Raúl Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant. Raúl Castro uses that hand to sign the orders to repress and jail democracy advocates. In fact, right now, as we speak, Cuban opposition leaders are being detained, and they’re being beaten while trying to commemorate today, which is International Human Rights Day. They will feel disheartened when they see these photos. Could you please tell the Cuban people living under that repressive regime that a handshake nonwithstanding, the U.S. policy toward the cruel and sadistic Cuban dictatorship has not weakened? Thank you.
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY : Ladies and gentlemen, today is about honoring Nelson Mandela. And the president is at an international funeral with leaders from all over the world. He didn’t choose who’s there. They’re there to honor Mandela. And we appreciate that people from all over the world and from all different beliefs and walks of life who appreciated Nelson Mandela and/or were friends of his came to honor him. And I think, as the president said—I urge you to go read his speech, or if you didn’t see it or haven’t read it, because the president said in his speech today honoring Nelson Mandela, he said, “We urge leaders to honor Mandela’s struggle for freedom by upholding the basic human rights of their people”—
REP . ILEANA ROS - LEHTINEN : And would you say Raúl Castro is upholding their basic human rights?
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY : No, absolutely not.
AMY GOODMAN : The uproar over President Obama’s handshake with President Raúl Castro has drawn attention to the close relationship between the South African anti-apartheid movement and Cuba. In 1991, Nelson Mandela visited Cuba with then-President Fidel Castro. This is a clip when they first met.
NELSON MANDELA : Before we say anything, you must tell me when you are coming to South Africa. You see—no, just a moment, just a moment, just a moment.
PRESIDENT FIDEL CASTRO : [translated] The sooner the better.
NELSON MANDELA : And we have had a visit from a wide variety of people. And our friend, Cuba, which had helped us in training our people, gave us resources to keep current with our struggle, trained our people as doctors, and SWAPO , you have not come to our country. When are you coming?
PRESIDENT FIDEL CASTRO : [translated] I haven’t visited my South African homeland yet. I want it, I love it as a homeland. I love it as a homeland as I love you and the South African people.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, for more on Cuba’s key role in the struggle to end apartheid in South Africa, we’re joined now in Washington, D.C., by Piero Gleijeses, professor of American foreign policy at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. He uses archival sources from the United States, South Africa and Cuba to provide an unprecedented look at the history in his latest book, Visions of Freedom: Havana, Washington, Pretoria, and the Struggle for Southern Africa, 1976-1991_. You can read the book’s prologue pretoria on our website at democracynow.org.
Professor Gleijeses, welcome to Democracy Now! Talk about this key relationship, why Cuba was so seminal to the anti-apartheid movement.
PIERO GLEIJESES : Cuba is the only country in the world that sent its soldiers to confront the army of apartheid and defeated the army of apartheid, the South African army, twice—in 1975, 1976, and in 1988. And in Havana, when he visited Havana in July 1991—I won’t to be able to repeat exactly the words of Nelson Mandela, but Nelson Mandela said, “The Cuban victory,” referring to the Cuban victory over the South Africans in Angola in 1988, “destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the white oppressor and inspired the fighting masses of South Africa. Cuito Cuanavale,” which is a victory of the Cubans in Angola, “is the turning point in the liberation of our continent and of my people from the scourge of apartheid.” So, in—
AMY GOODMAN : For a country that knows very little, Professor Gleijeses, about the Cuban experience, its military intervention in Angola, can you step back for a moment and explain what President Castro—what Fidel Castro and these Cuban soldiers did?
PIERO GLEIJESES : Sure. In 1975, you have the decolonization of Angola, Portuguese colony slated to become independent on November 11, 1975. There is a civil war between three movements: one supported by the Cubans, the Cubans that supported over the years in its struggle against the Portuguese; the other two supported by South Africa and the United States. And the movement supported by the Cubans, the MPLA , which is in power in Angola today, having won free election, was on the verge of winning the civil war. And it was on the verge of winning the civil war—a paraphrase from what the CIA station chief in Angola at the time told me—because it was the most committed movement with the best leaders, the best program. And in order to prevent their victory, the victory of the MPLA , in October 1975, urged by Washington, South Africa invaded. And the South African troops advanced on Luanda, and they would have taken Luanda and crushed the MPLA if Fidel Castro had not decided to intervene. And between November 1975 and April 1976, 3,6000 Cuban soldiers poured into Angola and pushed the South Africans back into Namibia, which South Africa ruled at the time.
And this had an immense psychological impact—talking of South Africa—in South Africa, both among whites and among blacks. And the major black South African newspaper, The World , wrote in an editorial in February 1976, at a moment in which the South African troops were still in Angola, but the Cubans were pushing them back—they had evacuated central Angola. They were in southern Angola. The writing was on the wall. And this newspaper, The World , wrote, “Black Africa is riding the crest of a wave generated by the Cuban victory in Angola. Black Africa is tasting the heady wine of the possibility of achieving total liberation.” And Mandela wrote that he was in jail in 1975 when he learned about the arrival of the Cuban troops in Angola, and it was the first time then a country had come from another continent not to take something away, but to help Africans to achieve their freedom.
This was the first real contribution of Cuba to the liberation of South Africa. It was the first time in living memory that the White Giants, the army of apartheid, had been forced to retreat. And they had retreated because of a non-white army. And in a situation of internal colonialism, this is extremely important. And after that, the Cubans remained in Angola to protect Angola from the South African army. Even the CIA acknowledged that the Cubans were the guarantee for the independence of Angola. And in Angola, they trained the ANC , the African National Congress, of Mandela. And very close relations developed between the two. I don’t know if you want me to go on and talk about the next moment, or you want to interrupt me with some questions.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Yes, Professor Piero Gleijeses, if you could speak specifically about the role of Che Guevara in Africa?
PIERO GLEIJESES : Yeah, Che Guevara had nothing to do with South Africa. The role—
NERMEEN SHAIKH : In Africa, though, in the Congo and Angola.
PIERO GLEIJESES : Yes, I understand. The role of Che Guevara in 1964, 1965—in late 1964, Che Guevara was sent by Fidel Castro as Fidel Castro’s top representative to Sub-Saharan Africa—it was the first visit by a top Cuban leader to Sub-Saharan Africa—because the Cubans believed that there was a revolutionary situation in central Africa, and they wanted to help. And Che Guevara established relations with a number of revolutionary movements. One of them, the MPLA , the Movement for the Liberation of Angola, that was based in Congo-Brazzaville. And in 1965, the first Cubans fought in Angolan territory together with the MPLA . But the major role played by Che Guevara is that he led a group of Cubans into Congo, the former Belgian Congo, where there was a revolt by the followers of the late Lumumba against the central government enforced by the United States. And the United States had created an army of white mercenaries, the White Giants, mainly South African and Rhodesians and then Europeans, to crush this revolt. And the Cubans went at the request of the rebels, at the request of the government of Egypt, Algeria and Tanzania to help the rebels.
AMY GOODMAN : Uh—
AMY GOODMAN : Professor, I wanted to go back to Angola—
PIERO GLEIJESES : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —and this time bring in former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. This is Kissinger explaining why the U.S. was concerned about the Cuban troops that Fidel Castro had sent to fight in Angola. After Kissinger, you’ll hear Fidel Castro himself.
SECRETARY OF STATE HENRY KISSINGER : We thought, with respect to Angola, that if the Soviet Union could intervene at such distances, from areas that were far from the traditional Russian security concerns, and when Cuban forces could be introduced into distant trouble spots, and if the West could not find a counter to that, that then the whole international system could be destabilized.
PRESIDENT FIDEL CASTRO : [translated] It was a question of globalizing our struggle vis-à-vis the globalized pressures and harassment of the U.S. In this respect, it did not coincide with the Soviet viewpoint. We acted, but without their cooperation. Quite the opposite.
AMY GOODMAN : That was President Fidel Castro and, before that, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger from the film CIA & Angolan Revolution . Professor Gleijeses?
PIERO GLEIJESES : OK, two points. One, Kissinger didn’t mention that the Cubans intervened in response to the South African invasion and that the United States had connived with the South Africans and urged the South Africans to invade. So here, there is a rather important issue of chronology.
The second point is that in the last volume of his memoirs, Kissinger, who in general is a very arrogant person, acknowledges that he made a mistake. And the mistake he made was in saying that the Cubans had intervened as proxies of the Soviet Union. And he writes in his memoirs that actually it had been a Cuban decision and that the Cubans had intervened and confronted the Soviets with a fait accompli . And then he asks a question in his memoirs: Why did Castro take this decision? And Kissinger’s answer is that Fidel Castro was probably—I’m quoting—”was probably the most genuine revolutionary leader then in power.” So, there are two Kissingers, if you want, and there is the Kissinger of his memoirs, where he says a few things that actually are true.
AMY GOODMAN : Piero Gleijeses, what do you make of the furor right now? You just heard Congressmember Lehtinen from Florida attacking John Kerry, you know, the significance of the handshake between President Obama and President Raúl Castro right there at the Soweto stadium at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela.
PIERO GLEIJESES : I think it’s pathetic and reflects the ethics of the United States and the policy of the United States. Obama, President Obama, was received with applause in South Africa when he spoke, etc., because he is the first black president of the United States. But the role of the United States as a country, as a government, past governments, in the struggle for liberation of South Africa is a shameful role. In general, we were on the side of the apartheid government. And the role of Cuba is a splendid role in favor of the liberation. This handshake—going beyond this particular issue, the handshake was long overdue. The embargo is absurd, is immoral. And we have here a president who bowed to the king of South Africa—of Saudi Arabia, I’m sorry, which certainly is no democracy. I mean, even Obama should know it. So it’s an absurd situation. The problem with Obama is that his speeches are good, his gestures are good, but there is no follow-up. So, unfortunately, it is just a gesture, a long-overdue gesture that does not change a shameful U.S. policy.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Professor Piero Gleijeses, before we conclude, let’s turn to Fidel Castro speaking in South Africa on his visit in 1998.
PRESIDENT FIDEL CASTRO : [translated] Let South Africa be a model of a more just and more humane future. If you can do it, we will all be able to do it.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : That was Fidel Castro speaking in 1998 in South Africa, with former president, who just passed away, Nelson Mandela applauding him. Piero Gleijeses, we just have a minute. Could you talk about what most surprised you in your research in the Cuban archives about this history?
PIERO GLEIJESES : Well, there are a lot of things. One is the independence of Cuban policy vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. There are clashes between Fidel Castro and Gorbachev. There are clashes between the leaders of the Cuban military mission in Angola and the Soviet leaders, which I quote actually in my book and which make really fascinating reading. This is one thing.
But another thing that impressed me very much is the respect with which the Cubans treated the Angolan government. This is very important, because the Angolan government really depended on Cuba for its survival, the presence of the Cuban troops as a shield against South African invasion, which was a constant threat, and the very large and generous technical assistance that Cuba was providing to Angola. And the tendency would be to treat a government that’s so dependent with some kind of superiority. And this is something I’ve never found in international relations, this kind of respect with which Cuba treated what, by all objective counts, should have been a client government. And it’s particularly striking for someone who studies the United States and lives in the United States, because seriously the United States government does not treat government that depends on Washington with much respect.
AMY GOODMAN : Piero Gleijeses, thank you so much for being with us.
PIERO GLEIJESES : My pleasure.

The Kochs & the Nazis: Book Reveals Billionaires’ Father Built Key Oil Refinery for the Third Reich | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2016/1/20/the_kochs_the_nazis_book_reveals,"Jane Mayer staff writer for The New Yorker and author of the new book, Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right . She is also author of The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals . Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: This year’s election season is set to be the most expensive ever, with some estimates topping $10 billion. Three groups will each spend about a billion dollars on behalf of a presidential nominee. The first two are who you’d expect: Democrats and Republicans, the country’s dominant political parties. But the third group is not a political party and does not have a single candidate running for office. Instead, it’s a network of right-wing advocacy groups backed by the billionaire energy tycoons, Charles and David Koch.
According to its own estimates, the Koch network aims to spend nearly $900 million on the 2016 presidential and congressional races, more than doubling its amount in 2012. The Kochs’ political machine now eclipses the official Republican Party in key areas, with about three-and-a-half times as many employees as the Republican National Committee. Charles and David Koch’s 2016 spending comes as part of an effort to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to conservative candidates and causes over the last four decades. Their net worth is a combined $82 billion, placing them fifth on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans.
The Kochs’ political operations have exploded in the six years since the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which removed limits on campaign spending by ruling that donor money is a form of free speech. Citizens United has allowed the Kochs and others to spend millions in dark money—political donations where the source is kept secret.
AMY GOODMAN : The story of the Koch brothers and an allied group of billionaire donors is told in a new book by The New Yorker magazine reporter Jane Mayer. It’s called Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right . Jane Mayer traces how the Kochs and other billionaires, including Mellon banking and Gulf Oil heir Richard Mellon Scaife, chemical tycoon John M. Olin, electronics magnates Harry and Lynde Bradley, have leveraged their business empires to create a political machine with unprecedented influence over politics at the national, state and local level.
Beyond elections, these billionaires have also influenced the political sphere by using their money to create right-wing think tanks, endow university positions, fund research favorable to their right-wing agenda, including climate change denial, opposing healthcare reform and thwarting government regulation. The Kochs’ political empire is so vast, it’s been dubbed “The Kochtopus,” the organizations including Americans for Prosperity, Citizens for a Sound Economy.
Mayer’s book contains a number of revelations and new details. She begins with the Kochs’ father, industrialist Fred Koch. Mayer reveals that Fred Koch helped build an oil refinery in Nazi Germany—a project approved personally by Adolf Hitler. The refinery was critical to the Nazi war effort. Its oil fueled German warplanes. Before that, Fred Koch built a refinery for Joseph Stalin’s Russia. Fred Koch went on to become an original leader of the right-wing John Birch Society. Charles Koch was a member when the group campaigned against the civil rights movement in the ’60s.
Jane Mayer also uncovers evidence confirming rumors the Koch brothers tried to blackmail their own brother, Frederick, into giving up his share of the family company by threatening to out him as gay. It also emerges that the EPA has named the Kochs’ company, Koch Industries, the single biggest U.S. producer of toxic waste. Mayer recounts her own potential brush with the Koch’s empire. After she profiled the brothers in a 2010 piece for The New Yorker , a private firm was hired to discredit her reporting. Although there’s no definite proof, Mayer says that clues leading back to the Kochs were everywhere. And she explores the Kochs’ multiyear effort to undermine President Obama, starting with a secretive meeting of right-wing donors the week of his inauguration.
Jane Mayer joins us now, a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. Again, her book is called Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right .
Welcome to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you, Jane.
JANE MAYER : Great to be with you. Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, let’s start with this explosive revelation about the Koch brothers’ father, Fred Koch. Talk about his business and his involvement with Nazi Germany.
JANE MAYER : Well, he built what became the third-largest refinery in Germany during the buildup to World War II. And it was a refinery that, from the start, was meant to help the military effort of the Third Reich. It was clear that Hitler was looking for ways to refine their own oil so that they could fuel the war machine that he was building up at that point. The refinery was begun, the contract was begun in ’34—that is, 1934—and was finished in 1935. And one of the things that the father Koch was especially good at—he was apparently a brilliant engineer himself—was refining oil in a really high-octane fuel that would be good for the Luftwaffe, for the warplanes. It had to be done in a special way.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Jane, interestingly, the Kochs obviously are critical of your work, but they only actually responded to two of the allegations in the book. And earlier this month, they released a statement specifically on this area. They say, “Mayer falsely implies that Fred Koch was working to aid and abet Germany’s tyrannical regime during World War II, and further implies that two of his sons, Charles and David Koch could somehow share these fictional sympathies. … It is a sad commentary on today’s media environment that we have to respond to such irresponsible and reckless attacks.” They claim that many companies, like Ford and General Electric and others, also were involved in Germany before the war.
JANE MAYER : Well, there were other American companies that worked there, too. Ford, especially, has been singled out. It’s true, though, what they’re saying, if facts are facts. They’ve basically confirmed their father built the refinery, he designed the cracking unit, which is what refined the fuel, and that became a key asset for the Nazi war machine.
AMY GOODMAN : And what was—
JANE MAYER : So—
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Also, one of the things, as you note in your book, that this is the part of the biography of the father that’s not included in official company accounts.
JANE MAYER : Well, this is the thing. I mean, it’s not to say—and what they’re kind of knocking down is a straw dog. The book does not say that Fred Koch or the sons were Nazis. And that would be a ridiculous statement. It says, specifically, Fred Koch’s views of the Nazis are unknown, but he worked with them, he made money from them, and this chapter was kept hidden from the Koch Industries history that’s up online.
AMY GOODMAN : Why was Hitler—
JANE MAYER : It’s one of—one of many secrets about the Kochs. I mean, the truth is, this book, it grew out of a 2010 story I did for The New Yorker , which turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg. There’s so much that was not known, that took—it took five years to document all of this.
AMY GOODMAN : Why was Hitler personally involved with improving this refinery?
JANE MAYER : Well, his underlings were not going to approve it. And there was—the partner in this is a man named William Rhodes Davis, who was working with Fred Koch. He was a Nazi sympathizer. The U.S. considered him a Nazi agent, actually. And he was the partner in this project, and he needed an OK from Hitler. And to get it, he had to go speak with Hitler himself. Hitler greenlighted the project. It was—and then gave him an autographed copy of Mein Kampf .
AMY GOODMAN : And then you talk about the governess that Fred Koch hired to raise the children.
JANE MAYER : Right. So, actually, Fred Koch was back and forth to Germany a lot. One of the things that—he almost went on the Hindenburg , and he was, at the last minute, detained—the dirigible that blew up in New Jersey in, you know, the pre—right before the war started. He imported, or somehow the family wound up with, a German nanny, who brought up the two oldest boys, Frederick and Charles—Charles who’s known today as one of the two Koch brothers. And the nanny herself was a Nazi sympathizer of such fervor that when Hitler invaded France in 1940, she had been with the Koch family for five years, but she said she needed to leave. She wanted to go back to be with the Führer to celebrate. It was strange. It was a strange—you know, it’s a fascinating family. It was a strange upbringing. I’m not saying that they were Nazis, but what I am saying is that this family was politically, from the start, filled with very strange influences.
AMY GOODMAN : And Fred Koch’s involvement in the founding of the John Birch Society, and what that is?
JANE MAYER : Well, so, what happens is, the father then also worked for Stalin and built the oil refineries there in Stalin’s first five-year plan. And he comes back to the U.S., and he’s horrified by what he’s seen of Stalin, and he becomes just an absolutely—a sort of vitriolic anti-communist. And that leads to him being a founding member of the John Birch Society. And he passes those views on to his sons. And both David Koch and Charles Koch, the two that are known as the Koch brothers, were members of the John Birch Society, which was—kind of defined the anti-communist, right-wing fringe in America in the ’50s, ’60s.

"Rising Temperatures Precipitating Arctic Ice Melt, Threatening Sea Rise and Permafrost",www.democracynow.org,,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/18/headlines/rising_temperatures_precipitating_arctic_ice_melt_threatening_sea_rise_and_permafrost,"In climate news, Arctic monitors found that over 40% of Greenland experienced melting over a single day last week, with temperatures soaring 40 degrees higher than normal. Scientists say the extent of the melting is unusual for this time of year and will contribute to the worsening global sea level rise.
Meanwhile, a new study shows that climate change has led to the thawing of permafrost in the Canadian Arctic over 70 years earlier than expected. Thawing of the permafrost releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing temperatures to further rise.

Trump's EPA Rolls Back Coal Restrictions,www.democracynow.org,,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/20/headlines/trumps_epa_rolls_back_coal_restrictions,"In environmental news, the Trump administration has replaced an Obama-era energy rule which was designed to close older coal plants and tighten emissions restrictions. The new rules announced by the Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday allow states to set regulations for emissions and decide whether coal-fired plants should make improvements. Obama’s Clean Power Plan sought to lower carbon emissions through federal regulations, but the plan never took effect due to multiple legal challenges from energy companies and some states.
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club said,”Trump and [ EPA Administrator] Wheeler are pushing a plan that will lead to thousands of deaths while ignoring the public’s demands for aggressive climate action, just so a handful of wealthy coal executives can make a little more money. This is an immoral and an illegal attack on clean air, clean energy, and the health of the public.” Legal challenges from at least six states and multiple environmental groups are expected.
On Tuesday, Trump touted his energy policies during his first 2020 campaign rally in Florida.
President Donald Trump : “We are creating a future of American energy independence, and yet our air and water are the cleanest they’ve ever been by far.”
Research by the American Lung Association refutes Trump’s lies. The group found that over 4 in 10 Americans live with unhealthy air due to high levels of pollution and dangerous, climate change-induced ozone levels. The poor air quality can cause “premature death and other serious health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage, and developmental and reproductive harm,” according to the American Lung Association.

Extinction Rebellion Activists Call on New York Times to Improve and Increase Climate Crisis Reporting,www.democracynow.org,,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/24/headlines/extinction_rebellion_activists_call_on_new_york_times_to_improve_and_increase_climate_crisis_reporting,"In New York City, police arrested 70 climate activists from the group Extinction Rebellion Saturday as they called on The New York Times to up their coverage of the climate crisis and start using terms like “climate emergency” instead of “climate change.” Activists stopped traffic in the busy midtown neighborhood, with some scaling The New York Times building and the Port Authority bus terminal to unfurl banners. The New York chapter of Extinction Rebellion recently shared a “Climate Media Standards” guide, which includes changes to language, banning ads from fossil fuel companies and linking weather-related stories to the climate crisis.

1000s of Climate Activists Block German Coal Mining Operation,www.democracynow.org,,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/6/24/headlines/1000s_of_climate_activists_block_german_coal_mining_operation,"Hundreds of activists entered and occupied an open-pit coal mine in the western Rhineland region of Germany Saturday to protest Europe’s dependency on fossil fuels amid the mounting climate crisis. The protest ended on Sunday after police repeatedly ordered them to leave, citing life-threatening danger. Some of the protesters were pulled out by authorities.
The group was part of a larger gathering of an estimated 6,000 people who held several actions as part of the protest effort. Another group camped out on rail tracks leading to a coal-fired power station, blocking trains from entering or leaving the area. This is Kathrin Henneberger, a member of the environmental justice group Ende Gelände, which coordinated the actions.
Kathrin Henneberger : “More than 6,000 climate activists from across Europe were here in the Rhineland this weekend. We shut down the entire Rhineland region’s lignite production. … We are fighting for the immediate stop of coal production, but we have to do a lot more. We demand a different economic system, one that is socially fair and respects our planet’s limits.”"
