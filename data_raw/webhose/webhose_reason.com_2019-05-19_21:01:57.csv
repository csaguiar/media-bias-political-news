Because (some? or all but only sometimes?) people are presumed to make sub-optimal choices for themselves, they should be “nudged” towards making better choices.
Presumably, “the best and the brightest” should be the ones to do the nudging.
It is demonstrably true that just who counts as “the best and the brightest” is not intuitively, nor deductively, obvious.
So how are we, including perforce those who make sub-optimal choices, to select the ‘nudgers’?
At which point, the whole charade falls apart and descends into a battle over who gets to decide. Advocating for “nudge-ism” is a sub-optimal choice."

There’s a pretty good review of the essential ideas in the NYRB from back in 2014, here:
“Resetting the default position this way is what Thaler and Sunstein call a “nudge.” It exploits the structure of the choice to encourage a more desirable option. The decision is not taken entirely out of the employee’s hands. She can still change it and revert to a strategy of no contributions or diminished contributions to her retirement funds. But in that case she has to make an effort; this is where she has to overcome her inertia.”

P.S. We’re still talking about experts making qualitative decisions for other people about what is desirable, and that is still its fundamental flaw.

Presuming to understand other people’s desires is a fundamental flaw, never mind nudging people to make the right choices to achieve them.
I prefer to ride motorcycles to work every day. It sparks joy. A panel of experts might decide that it is incompatible with my own desire for safety. I choose to wear a jacket with armor, to ride defensively, and to do other things to make myself safer while I’m riding, so no one can say that I don’t care about safety. Riding a motorcycle through traffic in southern California, however, is fundamentally dangerous. How can a panel of progressive experts presume to gauge my own qualitative preference for safety against my own qualitative preference for joy–until they see my choices?
If they can’t accurately approximate preferences that are as universally valued as safety vs. other universal values like joy, how can they hope to do so with other qualitative preferences that aren’t as universally valued? I don’t believe there is any accurate way to approximate other people’s preferences about such things before they make choices–without projecting our own qualitative preferences on others. People often don’t even understand their own qualitative preferences until after they make such choices.
Counseling depressed and anxious people after a divorce is successful when it helps them come to terms with the choices they made. People may come to realize that if they didn’t desire the outcome of their wife leaving them, they wouldn’t have made the choices that contributed and led to that outcome. No, we often don’t understand what it is that we want, but that doesn’t mean a panel of experts understand what we want better than we do. We still have authentic desires of our own that can’t be approximated by anyone else until after we make those qualitative choices for ourselves."

Meanwhile, there are qualitative aspects to every choice.
Again, you can’t even account for the qualitative aspect of other people’s choices about something universally valued by sane people like safety. There are people who value safety above everything else–that’s paranoid agoraphobia. Those people lock themselves in their homes for years at a time without leaving. The rest of us make qualitative choices that compromise our safety in pursuit of other desires that also have qualitative components. Some people may be better at thinking, but how could that possibly translate into understanding other people’s qualitative preferences for things like safety, risk, etc–better than they do?
Do you imagine there’s an expert out there whose expertise is so profound that he can tell me whether I prefer strawberry ice cream to chocolate chip at any given moment? That is a qualitative distinction that no one is better at making on my behalf than I am–even if I a room temperature IQ. Translate that to other qualitative questions about different people’s appetites for safety, risk, etc.–I dare you.

Without getting into the question of what constitutes “good” and “bad”, I’m going to take a bold and possibly controversial stand and make the plain argument that people should do good things and not do bad things.

It’d be an interesting challenge to structure government to favor that. It can’t be democratic. But it can’t be autocratic either.

One example might be . . .
If you were willing to do the things that were necessary to maintain your marriage, you would have chosen to do them–especially once it became clear that your marriage would end if you didn’t do them.
The option where you don’t get a job, don’t stop drinking so much, don’t get along with the in-laws, don’t spend time listening to your wife, etc. but still stay married may not have been a real option.
Some people have a hard time taking responsibility for their own choices that way–especially when they feel like they got the short end of the stick. No, you didn’t choose for your wife to go off and start a relationship with some guy at her work, but you weren’t willing to do the things that were necessary to maintain your marriage either. Does that guy know he wants a divorce? No. But if he looks at the choices he made in retrospect, he may often come to the conclusion that the choices he made were consistent with that outcome. It can be hard to look at yourself in the mirror that way.
Lots of us don’t want to take responsibility for our choices, especially when the outcome is bad and especially when the choice is forced on us.
“Victim of collision on the open sea
Nobody ever said life was free
Sink?
Swim?
Go down with the ship?
Use your freedom of choice!”
—-Devo
It’s true that people often don’t really know what they want–until they accept the responsibility for their choices. And it’s hard to do that. There’s this thing called “existential panic”.
“‘existential crisis’ specifically relates to the crisis of the individual when they realize that they must always define their own lives through the choices they make. The existential crisis occurs when one recognizes that even the decision to either refrain from action or withhold assent to a particular choice is, in itself, a choice. In other words, humankind is “condemned” to freedom.”

People are often loathe to accept their personal autonomy, and that’s what we’re talking about. They may be so reluctant to accept their own autonomy that what they want isn’t clear to them at all–unless they look at the choices they make. How do you tell if a person really cares about children starving to death in Somalia if they choose to do nothing to help them? Nobody wants to say they don’t care, but if you look at their actions, . . ."

One of his notions of nudge is that the government would determine default choices for everyone, not preventing them from choosing otherwise.
It all sounds a bit naive to me. When people don’t respond to nudges adequately, certainly the Department of Nudges will advocate nudging a little harder, will they not?
The food pyramid is a good example of how this gets out of hand. The suggestion to eat garbage carbs went from bad advice to a requirement baked in to government policy. Even with all the evidence against it, the Dept of Agriculture is still pushing a fattening heart disease lifestyle.
Instead of inventing new nudges, it would be better for Sunstein to focus on removing the existing nudges that lead to perverse unintended outcomes."

That is, the Georgists were good because they’d get rid of all other taxes, were for free trade, etc., but the residue that was left, a tax, was the bad thing. Similarly, nudging is much better than hitting people over the head, but not as good as leaving them alone entirely, so the only problem with nudging is nudging."

A nudge might not be harmful, but a hundred nudges from a hundred different do-gooders becomes a withering attack.
And an increasing number of the government actors seem to be motivated by contempt or hatred, some form of green or SJW puritanical mania, or some other evil these days.
So the individual nudges might be intend as an attack, the aggregate total of nudging is a de facto attack, and the nudgers won’t take no for an answer.
Tell your friend Cass Sunstein that government lost its legitimacy to decide questions and take actions long ago. If government busybodies want to help, they need to adopt an attitude of humble service to all and maintain that attitude for a very, very long time to earn our trust back."

I absolutely agree, despite not liking it myself, that legislative prayer is perfectly constitutional. But as Marsh made clear it reserved the question about what would happen if improper motives were at play. I think that is the case here. That is there is a big difference with allowing religious and sectarian prayer and denying all that is not religious.
I say this in regards to what the legislative body allows. I do think it would be allowed to hire a congressional chaplain and only he can do the prayer. There is nothing requiring guest chaplains. And that it is therefore religious and sectarian is incidental. But by allowing guest prayer I think it violates the Establishment Clause to limit it in a way that discriminates among religions (ones that don’t have ordained clergy) or between religion and non religion (not allowing atheist/agnostic/humanist etc.)."

Unlike the GPS case, there are trivial low tech ways for parking enforcement to accomplish the same thing as chalking. They could, for example, put small strips of chalk with a weak (environmentally friendly and water soluble) glue holding them to the pavement in front of and behind one of the tires but just 1mm away from the tire — if one or both of these are not crushed, the car hasn’t moved.
