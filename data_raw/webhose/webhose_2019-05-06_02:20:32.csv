Bombshell: House Intelligence Is Going After 'Intelligence Leakers' And Conspiracy Pushers,townhall.com,Beth Baumann,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bethbaumann/2019/04/07/nunes-criminal-referrals-for-leaked-info-n2544385,"Bombshell: House Intelligence Is Going After 'Intelligence Leakers' And Conspiracy Pushers Share Share Tweet Source: AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File
House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-CA) on Sunday told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that the Committee plans to submit eight criminal referrals to Attorney General William Barr.
""We're prepared this week to notify the attorney general that we're prepared to send those referrals over and brief him if he wishes to be briefed,"" Nunes said.
Nunes said there are eight referrals but that might not be all of them.
""So you've got eight referrals you're going to send over the AG this week. Go through those referrals. These are criminal referrals. Two of them I know are about conspiracy,"" Bartiromo said. ""What can you tell us? Tell us as much as you can, in terms of breaking this news this morning, that you are prepared to send over eight criminal referrals ext week. What are they, Congressman?""
According to Nunes, all of the information is classified and sensitive.
""Five of them are what I would call straight up referrals so just referrals that are, that name someone and name the specific crimes. Those crimes are lying to Congress, misleading Congress, leaking classified information,"" Nunes said.
""There are three that I think are more complicated. So you mentioned conspiracy. So the question on conspiracy is what, there's the conspiracy statute, and then what do they need to look at under that statute. So on the first one, is FISA abuse and other matters we believe there is a conspiracy to lie to the FISA Court, mislead the FISA court by numerous individuals that all need to be investigated and looked at,"" Nunes said. ""The second conspiracy one is involving manipulation of intelligence. That also could [involve] many Americans and we are, so that's kind of the second one. As you know, we've had a lot of concerns with the way intelligence was used.""
""The third is what I would call a 'global leak referral.' There are about a dozen highly sensitive classified information leaks that were given to only a few reporters over the last two and a half-plus years, so we don't know if there's actually been any leak investigations that have been open, but we do believe that we've got pretty good information and a pretty good idea of who could be behind these leaks,"" Nunes said. ""Doesn't mean we know all the people behind the leaks because when you read these, a lot of these, they're always anonymous sources and they always say something to the effect of 'current and former senior officials.'"" Recommended Reparations For Slavery: Be Careful What You Wish For Arthur Schaper
Nunes said he believes they have a pretty good idea of who are behind the sources. Although he wouldn't divulge the names of those being referred he did say that anyone who has followed the Russia probe for any significant amount of time would know who they were.
When everything is said and done, criminal referrals could continue to grow.
""We think there's only a few people behind these leaks but there could be multiple people, so on the global leak referral, there could be several individuals. When you look at the conspiracy that could get up to a dozen, two dozen people,"" Nunes said. "
"WAR: DCCC Freezes Out 'Progressive' Campaign Consultants, So They've Started Their Own 'Blacklist' | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45658/war-dccc-freezes-out-progressive-campaign-emily-zanotti,"April 7, 2019 views
The campaign consultants behind Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) meteoric rise to national prominence want to extend their ""progressive primary"" crusade to every Democratic House race in the country, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is standing in their way.
But Justice Democrats, the controversial operation behind Ocasio-Cortez's win -- the same group that has now been hit with several FEC complaints over how it mixed its money with Cortez's campaign coffers -- is fighting back, and threatening to declare open war within the Democratic party if they aren't allowed to take on existing, moderate candidates.
This week, Roll Call reports , the DCCC voted to ""freeze out"" Justice Democrats from getting lucrative contracts with Democratic House contenders across the country. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the D.C. based outlet says, has a ""newly stated policy that it will not grant contracts to pollsters, strategists and communications specialists working with primary challengers.""
""Still, the new policy moves millions of expenditures by the DCCC off the table for firms that work with candidates who challenge Democratic incumbents,"" Roll Call adds.
Justice Democrats exists largely to primary moderate and, in many cases, older Democrats who they feel are standing in the way of real progressive progress. Initially, before Ocasio-Cortez won office, they seemed like an outlier company, standing behind a number of campaigns that all, inevitably, lost. But with Ocasio-Cortez's success, the Justice Democrats are in demand (aside from their teeny-tiny issues with the Federal Election Commission, of course).
In response, the Justice Democrats have created the ""DCCC Blacklist ,"" a website that chronicles all of the progressive-owned ""pollsters, strategists and communications specialists"" as well as ""political vendors, political action committees, and advocacy groups"" who are willing to provide their services to specifically progressive candidates, including those looking to launch primary challenges to other Democrats.
The DCCC Blacklist is apparently bankrolled by the Indivisible Project, the most recent, ""resistance""-based spinoff of MoveOn.org, financed almost exclusively by progressive billionaire George Soros.
Indivisible's political director, Maria Urbina made the official announcement for the DCCC Blacklist.
âWe reject the DCCCâs attempt to hoard power, which will only serve to keep that talent pool â and Congress itself â disproportionately white and male,âshe told media in a statement. âIncumbents who engage fully with their constituents shouldnât fear primaries and shouldnât rely on the national institutions like the DCCC to suppress challenges before voters ever have a say.â
If all this seems to demonstrate that the coalition between leftist and moderate Democrats is cracking at the seams, that's because it is. Aside from the obvious -- that any Democrat engaged in a House or Senate race in 2020 needs to watch their back, lest they be ousted in a primary by a progressive candidate -- it's clear Soros and other major leftist donors are not waiting around for the Democratic establishment to welcome far-left progressive with open arms.
They're simply going to force recognition of progressive candidates themselves, and bankroll progressive campaigns without regard for traditional Democratic institutions.
There is one flaw in the DCCC Blacklist, and that is constituents. Although Ocasio-Cortez is much beloved by the national far-left, isn't beloved at home in her own district , where her constituents are convinced they've been left behind by a Representative seeking a national -- not a local -- stage."

Annual Investment Meeting 2019 to host strategic sessions to draw foreign direct investments,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/middle-east/annual-investment-meeting-2019-to-host-strate-588427.html,"Annual Investment Meeting 2019 To Host Strategic Sessions To Draw Foreign Direct Investments Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) 5 minutes 11:15 PM
DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 07th Apr, 2019) The Organising Committee of the Annual Investment Meeting 2019 has completed the preparations for the upcoming event, which will be held from 8th to 10th of April in Dubai. More than 20,000+ corporate leaders, policy makers, businessmen, regional and international investors, entrepreneurs, leading academics, experts, and stakeholders from over 140+ countries from Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, middle East, and Asia are participating in the three-day event.
Some of the heads of states coming to the event are Evo Morales, President, Plurinational State of Bolivia; Muhammadu Buhari, President, Federal Republic of Nigeria; Rustam Minnikhanov, President of Tatarstan, Russian Federation; Ramzan Kadyrov, Head of Chechen Republic, Russian Federation; and Huchiev Muslim, Deputy Chairman of Chechen Republic, Russian Federation.
More than 60 high level officials including heads of state, government ministers, and other top public officials will join prominent global business figures, over 1,000 FDI experts, and representatives of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and business councils. They are set to tackle the most pressing challenges and key opportunities in the midst of exponential digital innovations, technological developments, and influential global trends.
Fareedon Hartoqa, the Secretary General of the Jordan Investment Commission, JIC, said, ""We in Jordan, and at the Jordan Investment Commission, JIC, are committed to working with investors and businesses to facilitate their work in Jordan and maintain strong mutually beneficial relationships with those entities. JIC continues its determination on leveraging Jordanâs strengths. Our position in the heart of the Levant makes us a strategic platform to the GCC and MENA region. It also makes us an ideal global East-West hub. Our Free Trade agreements give us access to over one billion consumers. Jordan offers the ideal destination when looking for a manufacturing base, outsourcing center, distribution and back office operations. Jordan also could serve as a base for infrastructure and reconstruction projects in our region.""
A delegation from Bolivia will also participate at AIM. Widely regarded as the country's first president to come from the indigenous population, this is the first time any president from Bolivia has made it to the UAE. Evo Morales, President, Plurinational State of Bolivia, stated that Plurinational State of Bolivia intends to promote greater FDI such that at least 40 percent of Foreign Direct Investment contributes to diversify the productive matrix of the country and generates added value (productive industrial complexes, services and tourism) through partnerships in mixed state companies, in alliance with the central level of the State and Autonomous Territorial Entities. The Bolivian perspective aims to encourage foreign investors in a way that they become strategic partners and not owners of natural resources and surpluses. The countryâs goal is that FDI should respect the countryâs sovereignty, mother earth and the profits in the territory should be converted to strengthen the model of living well.
In addition, a delegation from Kingdom of Bhutan will also participate at the event. According to Lyonpo Loknath Sharma, Minister of Economic Affairs, Kingdom of Bhutan, the number of FDI projects approved in the year 2018 has more than doubled from the number in 2017. A total of 16 projects were approved in 2018 against just seven in 2017.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has just recently formulated an open economy policy, gains a strategic move participating at AIM 2019. ""We saw growth in both FDI inflows, which were 127 percent higher in 2018 than in 2017, and in the number of new licenses awarded. 739 new licenses were awarded in 2018, an increase of 96 percent on the previous year. This momentum has continued in 2019, with broad based growth across all sectors and geographies. The Saudi Arabian economy is undergoing a period of rapid transformation, and this is creating new opportunities for the private sector and international investors. Through Vision 2030, we have been able to introduce a number of new policies and reforms that are allowing investors to tap into these opportunities in an unprecedented way,"" Majid bin Abdullah Al Qasabi Minister of Commerce and Investment, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Further, with the participation of Brunei Darussalam, AIM 2019 provides an ideal platform to push their economic agenda, specifically on attracting higher FDI this year. ""As one of the biggest events on the global FDI Calendar , AIM 2019 will provide the perfect platform for Brunei Darussalam to showcase the direct investment and collaboration opportunities, as well as the world class products and services we have to offer. As per revised 2017 figures, Brunei Darussalam recorded a Foreign Direct Investment net inflow of BND635.3 million, equivalent to USD 470.37 million. This positive momentum continued into 2018, where a further number of FDI projects came online, particularly in the food sector. We are confident that the global conference will provide useful insights into the latest trends & challenges to enable us to deep dive and further refine our investment promotion strategy,"" said H.E. Dr. Mohd Amin Liew Abdullah, Minister of Finance, Brunei Darussalam.
To be held under the theme âMapping the Future of FDI: Enriching World Economies through Digital Globalization,â the 9th edition will feature a series of conferences focusing on game-changing technologies that have been dramatically reshaping the nature of industries and business models of investors. It will tackle the profound impact of industry technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, and blockchain, smart city solutions, sustainable economic practices, clean and renewable energy, and startups on international investments and trade.
""Trends towards sustainable development are transforming business and societies. This shift provides opportunities to target quality investment in those areas with greatest capacity to foster diversification and support sustainable development. The conversion towards renewable sources of electrical power generation is just one example where FDI and the public policies framework have played a key role,"" said Mario Cimoli, Deputy Executive Secretary, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean,ECLAC, a United Nations regional commission based in Chile.
For his part, UNCTAD Secretary General Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, said, ""Digital development and other technological advances are largely seen as positive factors that will buoy investment. The adoption of digital technologies has the potential to transform the international operations of multinational enterprises,MNEs, and the impact of foreign affiliates on host countries. The impact of digital MNEs on host countries is less directly visible in physical investment and job creation, however, their investments can have important indirect and productivity effects, and contribute to digital development.""
This yearâs edition will hold the âGlobal Leaders Debateâ session to tackle the overall theme and deliberate the best practices that warrant the creation of inclusive growth as well as evaluate governmentsâ legal frameworks and market-friendly policies favoring FDIs and the private sector. The Global Leaders Debate will host sessions titled 'Blockchain, Big Data & AI: Foreseeing the Impact of Digital Economies'; 'Countering the Global Rise of Protectionism Policies for Sustainable Growth'; and 'Investment Promotion Agency Roundtable: Attracting Investments in the 4.0 World'.
An Investors Debate will be staged on the second day along with plenary sessions on 'Family Office Roundtable: Investing in the Future'; 'Small and Medium Enterprise Focus: Strengthening SMEs in a Digitalized World'; 'FDI and Human Capital: The Evolution of Workforce in a Digitally Globalized World'; and 'Regional Focus: Withstanding Headwinds in the Foreign Direct Investment Market'. A special presentation on 'The Future of Work' will be hosted on the same day.
AIM 2019's 'Invest In' series will be held on the third day, focusing on Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. The 'Invest In: Africa' session will talk about the benefits of the continent's digital transformation, while the 'Invest In: Latin America and the Caribbean' will shed light on how FDI can accelerate the digital transformation of the Latin American production system.
A three-day exhibition will simultaneously be held alongside the conferences. Over 500 exhibitors and co-exhibitors will be part of the exhibition to network, promote industry projects and services, and attract investors to various participating countries. It will also serve as an opportunity for governments and private organizations to launch and promote their projects to a vastly diverse audience.
Additionally, the AIM exhibition will provide participating countries with an opportunity to meet and connect with over 20,000 visitors and 1,000 conference delegates, including industry leaders and key stakeholders from the regional and international community through various networking functions. Some exhibitors include the Hong Kong Trade Development Council; Abu Dhabi Investment Office; ICEX SPAIN; Enterprise Georgia; Croatian Chamber of Economy; Botswana Investment & Trade Centre; and ANAPI - National Investment Promotion Agency.
AIM 2019 will also hold the Country Presentations feature to give participating states a direct access to key decision-makers, government leaders, and investors. Taking part in this feature are 10 countries/investment destinations, including UAE, South Africa, China, Georgia, Italy, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Botswana, Sierra Leone, Cameroon and Indonesia. During the session, they can emphasise important economic features of and investment environment in their respective countries.
Moreover, a special zone called Investorsâ Hub will be set up during the meeting for top investment houses and investment corporations, development banks, and Sovereign Wealth Funds. This feature will allow investors to meet with official government representatives as well as project developers to discuss the possibility of new ventures and potential partnerships.
As part of AIMâs onsite networking functions, bilateral G2G, G2B, and B2B meetings will be staged for government officials, private sector executives, businessmen, and investors to network, collaborate, and discuss among themselves investment projects and prospective partnerships from different regions. Additionally, the event will hold a rapid networking session for investors to meet with potential partners and introduce business opportunities. This feature is a dedicated platform for exclusive, quick one-on-one meetings offering a networking opportunity through a secured platform.
During the scheduled gala dinner, the AIM Investment Awards will take place to recognise the best FDI projects from each region of the world. Besides the winning countries, the Awards will honor their Investment Promotion Agencies as well for their successful investment promotion strategies and exceptional investment projects.
""The Annual Investment Meeting will be held at a time when we need to ramp up investment activities worldwide as we strive to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development for all nations. Additionally, it is taking place against the backdrop of impressive digital transformation that is clearly influencing the latest FDI trends and developments. All these factors make Dubai the ideal host of AIM 2019 as the emirate and the entire UAE have been at the forefront of digitalization in the region as part of their bid to become one of the worldâs preferred investment destinations,"" Dawood Al Shezawi, CEO of Annual Investment Organising Committee.
The UAE - as an FDI destination - remains ahead of other nations in the Arab region thanks to its strategic location, business-friendly environment, advanced infrastructure, ability to attract highly skilled human resources, and commitment to implement the best industry practices. In 2017, it received 40 percent of the total FDI flows to the Arab world and Western Asian nations. Additionally, in spite of the global FDI slowdown, the countryâs FDI flows grew 7.8 percent to reach USD 10.4 billion during the same period."

""The meeting... dealt with a probe into all those involved in the attack on several Libyan cities... They also discussed the monitoring and documentation of crimes... and human rights violations,"" the statement read.
Gen. Khalifa Haftar on Thursday ordered the Libyan National Army to march on Tripoli to wrestle it from what he described as terrorists. The Government of National Accord announced a counteroffensive over the weekend, called the Volcano of Rage, to repel the rival army ."

TRIPOLI (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Libyan conflicting sides have refused to follow the UN request to organize a two-hour ceasefire for evacuation of those injured during the armed clashes in Tripoli , a spokesman for the local ambulance service Osama Ali told Sputnik.
Earlier in the day, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) demanded from the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), headed by Fayez Sarraj, to organize a two-hour humanitarian truce between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. local time for evacuation of those injured during the LNA operation in Tripoli .
""The conflicting sides did not adhere to the humanitarian pause requested by the United Nations ,"" Ali said.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday after Haftar ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli . The LNA has captured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while the GNA's Sarraj has ordered his troops to use force if necessary.
On Sunday , a spokesman for the army loyal to the GNA announced a counteroffensive against the advancing troops of Haftar. The multi-pronged operation, dubbed Burkan Al-Ghadab (Volcano of Rage), has already led to the capture of many military vehicles of Haftar's LNA. At least 21 people died and 27 others were wounded on Sunday in the armed clashes on the outskirts of Tripoli , according to the Health Ministry of the GNA."

""I know the UK doesnât want it, and Europe doesnât want it either.â At the same time, as the second deadline approaches (March 29 has already been and gone), Varadkar was adamant that ""we donât want to have a rolling cliff-edge"" with extension after extension. Read more toggle Go deeper 377 Words Brexit has already cost the U.K. 2.5% of GDP since the referendum, or about $40 billion per year, according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs, and that's while the nation was still part of the EU. The cost to the rest of the EU has been significant too, largely driven by uncertainty. While almost no one wants the U.K. to leave the EU, Europe's willingness to tolerate the deafening chaos from across the channel is shrinking to zero, especially in France. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May did give Remainers a glimmer of hope on Friday. Writing an official letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, she for the first time admitted that she was willing and able to hold European Parliament elections on May 23. Her party hates the idea of contesting European elections, but her government is now making all necessary preparations for that vote. May added that she would prefer to leave the EU before that date and cancel the election, but Parliament has repeatedly voted down all her attempts to do so. Tusk's preferred outcome is a ""flextension"" that gives the U.K. as long as a year to come up with an exit deal. Under such a deal, Britain's EU membership could be cut short if and when an exit agreement is finalized. Tusk's proposal would need to receive unanimous approval from all 27 EU states at a summit meeting on Wednesday, which won't be easy. And even May hasn't signed on to the flextension idea yet, since rolling cliff-edges have to date been her only negotiating leverage. How it works: The EU wants to see May making visible progress on cobbling together cross-party support for a deal. So far, there's little evidence of that. The bottom line: If Tusk can't get unanimous approval for another extension on Wednesday, Britain's prime minister will be faced with a stark choice. Either she drives her country off a cliff by letting it crash out without a deal or she destroys her party by repealing Article 50, keeping the U.K. in the EU after all. Her words and actions to date indicate that she would probably end up choosing her party over her country â unless the U.K. Parliament somehow takes the decision out of her hands. "

NEW DELHI (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) The Pakistani Foreign Ministry summoned on Sunday the deputy head of the Indian embassy in Islamabad and warned the Indian side against possible provocations in the disputed region of Kashmir, the ministry's spokesman, Mohammad Faisal, said.
Earlier in the day, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that Pakistan had ""reliable intelligence"" that India was planning to conduct an act of aggression against the country between April 16 and April 20. The minister also urged the international community to take notice of ""India's irresponsible behaviour.""
"" Indian DHC [deputy high commissioner] was summoned for demarche in line with FM's briefing of today & Warned against any misadventure,"" Faisal said on Twitter .
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated in February , after the Pakistani military shot down two Indian warplanes in the disputed region of Kashmir, responding to an earlier airstrike by Indian aircraft against what New Delhi said was a camp of Jaish-e-Mohammad group, considered terrorists by India and located on the Pakistani soil across the so-called Line of Control, separating India- and Pakistan- controlled areas of Kashmir.
The Indian airstrike came after a deadly attack by Jaish-e-Mohammad on the Indian paramilitary police force in Pulwama, Kashmir on February 14, leaving 45 victims. While India has accused Pakistan of supporting the militants and having a ""direct hand"" in the incident, Pakistan , in turn, has rejected the allegations."

Kris Kobach To Trump: You Do Not Need Congress To Immediately Solve Immigration Crisis - Tea Party News,www.teaparty.org,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.teaparty.org/kris-kobach-trump-not-need-congress-immediately-solve-immigration-crisis-355475/,"Politics
(Breitbart) â Former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach says that despite claims by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, President Trump does not need Congress to stem the tide of booming levels of illegal immigration at the United States-Mexico border.
In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriotâs Breitbart News Tonight, Kobach said there is much the Trump administration and DHS officials can do to mitigate the soaring levels of illegal immigration in recent months where now about 1.5 million illegal aliens are projected to enter the country this year.
LISTEN:
Contrary to claims by Nielsen, Kobach said Trump does not need Congress to take action to stop illegal immigration.
âItâs not like weâre powerless and itâs not like we have to wait for Congress to do something,â Kobach said. âItâs sort of frustrating we see the Secretary of Homeland Security [Kirstjen Nielsen] saying âWell, we need Congress to help us before we solve this problem.â No, we can actually solve the immediate crisis without Congress acting.â
Kobach detailed three steps DHS and the Trump administration can take, immediately, to not only lower illegal immigration levels, but unilaterally end the expanded policy of Catch and Release â where more than 17,000 border crossers and illegal aliens were released into the interior of the U.S. over the last 12 days.
Kobach explained:
Thereâs basically three steps. The first one is finalize a regulation that DHS proposed back in September. They could have finalized the regulation, made it go into effect in December, four months ago, but theyâve been dragging their feet â¦ what the regulation would do is basically supersede the Flores Settlement. The Flores Settlement is that 20-year-old settlement that limits the amount of time that a minor can be detained and effectively limits the amount of time that a family can be detained together. Once this regulation is published, we can detain the whole family, keep them together, and that reduces the incentive to bring these minors north and using them as âGet out of jail freeâ cards.
The second [step] is because of the lack of traditional detention space, the Border Patrol is saying âWell we have to let these people go.â Now I have some â¦ disagreements with the terms on which theyâre letting them go. Letâs back up, we can create detention space. The federal government right now owns thousands, multiple thousands, of trailers and mobile homes that we use for hurricane disasters and theyâre selling them at bargain prices right now â¦ we should be using those to create basically processing centers where people â¦ you put a fence around a park or a parking lot, you park a hundred of those trailers there and you can have people have their immigration hearings, have their asylum and credible fear hearing, have everything right there. Deploy dozens of immigration judges down to these centers. Donât let them go, have a fleet of commercial planes ready to fly them back to their home countries.
The third thing we could do is we absolutely have to put pressure on Mexico. But I donât think threatening to close the border is necessarily the best way to do it because Mexico knows that hurts us as well. What we should be doing is threatening to pass a Treasury [Department] regulation prohibiting illegal aliens from sending home remittances through Western Union and the like. Then tell Mexico, weâll finalize that regulation and weâll cut off $20 billion a year in capital â¦ unless you give us a safe third country agreement like we have with Canada. And what a safe third country agreement is, basically whenever an asylum seeker steps foot in one country or another, he doesnât have the ability to pass through that country and then claim asylum in the second country. With Mexico and the United States, people coming from Central America would have to claim asylum where they step first, thatâs Mexico, and not go all the way through Mexico to claim asylum in the United States. Demand that Mexico sign that agreement, itâs very simple, itâs working great with Canada â¦ and get them to throw in some [border] wall money as well.
Kobach said the three executive actions would deliver immediate results for the American people and the nationâs sovereignty.
âIf we did all those three things, weâd solve the crisis,â Kobach said. âYou would see a dramatic drop in the number of people coming north and youâd see these caravans coming to an end.â
Currently, DHS is operating an expanded Catch and Release policy where the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency releases tens of thousands of border crossers and illegal aliens into the country.
The Catch and Release process often entails federal immigration officials busing border crossers into nearby border cities and dropping them off with the promise that they will show up for their immigration and asylum hearings, sometimes years later. The overwhelming majority of border crossers and illegal aliens are never deported from the country once they are released into the U.S.
Since December 21, 2018, Trumpâs DHS has released more than 125,000 border crossers and illegal aliens into the country. In the San Antonio, Texas area, alone, more than 53,000 border crossers and illegal aliens have been released since the end of 2018.
The Catch and Release policy has strained ICE resources, forcing fewer arrests of illegal aliens living in the interior of the country in recent months. At current rates, DHS is on track to release about 500,000 border crossers and illegal aliens into the interior of the U.S. by the end of this year.
