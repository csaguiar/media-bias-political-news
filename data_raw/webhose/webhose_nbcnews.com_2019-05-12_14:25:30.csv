Brinley Bruton The deputy leader of the Islamic State group in Somalia was killed in an American airstrike, the U.S. military confirmed Monday. ""In coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia's continued efforts to degrade violent extremist organizations, U.S. Africa Command conducted an airstrike in the vicinity of Xiriiro, Bari Region, Somalia, on April 14, 2019, killing Abdulhakim Dhuqub, a high ranking ISIS-Somalia official,"" said spokesperson for the command said in a statement. A witness told Reuters that a vehicle was hit by several missiles around 2 miles outside the village of Xiriiro in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland. ""Today's airstrike killed Abdulhakim Dhuqub, the deputy leader of Islamic State,"" Puntland's security minister, Abdisamad Mohamed Galan, told Reuters on Sunday. According to the U.N., Dhuqub helped set up the first cell of al-Ittihad al-Islamiya, an ideological predecessor of al-Shabab, a militant group that seeks to establish its own version of repressive Shariah law and has been fighting the government in the Horn of Africa nation for over a decade. He later defected to ISIS. Related Life under ISIS led these Muslims to Christianity There are thought to be up to 250 ISIS members in Somalia, along with 3,000 to 7,000 al-Shabab fighters. Matt Bryden, head of the Nairobi-based think tank Sahan Research, played down the significance of the killing because ISIS in Somalia is believed to have only a comparatively small force of militants. ""(If) you take into account that they've never done a large terror attack in several years of operation, you basically have a gang stuck out in the desert,"" he told Reuters. ""Just because they are called ISIS, it doesn't make them an existential threat."" U.S. military involvement in Somalia has grown since President Donald Trump approved expanded operations against al-Shabab early in his term. Dozens of drone strikes followed. US airstrike in Somalia targets al-Shabab Sept. 2, 2014 01:52 Late in 2017, the military also carried out its first airstrike against a small presence of fighters linked to ISIS in northern Somalia. Al-Shabab militants once controlled large swaths of Somalia, including much of the capital, Mogadishu. African Union forces have succeeded in pushing the extremists from most major cities, however the group continues to be active in Somalia's rural areas and still launches suicide car-bomb attacks in the capital.

Supreme Justices spent the morning talking about an 'f word',www.nbcnews.com,Pete Williams,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-justices-spent-morning-talking-about-f-word-n994631,"Supreme Justices spent the morning talking about an 'f word' The high court heard arguments in clothing line trademark case — but the discussion was far from routine. Erik Brunetti, Los Angeles artist and streetwear designer of the clothing brand FUCT. Patrick T. Fallon / Reuters Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 4:39 PM GMT By Pete Williams WASHINGTON — A bare majority of the U.S. Supreme Court seemed prepared Monday to allow a trademark for a California clothing brand that uses a form of the f-word. But the justices didn't appear very happy about the prospect. Eric Brunetti chose a brand name to match the subversive, anti-establishment theme of his line of streetwear. The single four-letter word ""Fuct"" appears on his brand of T-shirts, hoodies, jackets and shorts. But the federal government refused to issue him a trademark, citing a provision of law requiring the Patent and Trademark Office to refuse registration of proposed trademarks that are ""scandalous"" or ""immoral."" Government attorneys concluded that Brunetti's brand name was phonetically equivalent to the past tense of what a Justice Department lawyer called ""the paradigmatic profane word in our culture."" The trademark office considers a name to be scandalous if it is ""shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety"" or ""disgraceful, offensive, disreputable."" Federal courts have said the prohibition also applies to terms that are ""vulgar, lacking in taste, indelicate, and morally crude."" For that reason, several of the justices said during Monday's courtroom argument that the law amounts to a restriction on viewpoint, which isn't allowed under the First Amendment. Two years ago, the court struck down a parallel provision of federal law barring trademarks that disparage people or ""bring them into contempt or disrepute."" As a result of that earlier decision, Justice Department lawyer Malcolm Stewart told the justices that the government would now likely narrow its application so that only terms that are obscene or shocking would be barred. ""How is it determined?"" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, ""that a word is shocking? Is it a substantial part of the public? Would a composite of 20-year-olds find it shocking?"" Justice Elena Kagan said the law sweeps more broadly. ""If Congress wants to pass a narrow statute, it can do that,"" she said. ""You're asking us to uphold the statute based on a commitment to apply it more narrowly. That's a strange thing for us to do."" Stewart also said the law does not restrict speech, because Brunetti can call his clothing whatever he wants. He just can't get a trademark. ""The law isn't a limitation on speech,"" Stewart said. ""It's a limitation on a government benefit."" ""You keep telling us this is a government benefit,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. ""But people pay for this and get certain legal rights."" Several members of the court were also concerned that the trademark office operates without a clear standard. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the result is that the law is enforced inconsistently. Justice Neil Gorsuch sounded a similar concern. ""I can't see the rational line. Is it a flip of a coin?"" John Sommer, an Irvine, California, lawyer representing Brunetti, said in his written briefs that the government has issued a trademark for the brand name ""FCUK,"" which that company insists stands for French Connection UK, a clothing line called ""Fword,"" and an online dating site known as ""WTF is up with my love life?!"" But Sommer didn't have much luck trying to persuade the court that the term Brunetti wants to trademark isn't a form of a notoriously dirty word. ""Aw, c'mon, be serious,"" Justice Samuel Alito said. ""We know what he's trying to say."" Pete Williams Pete Williams is an NBC News correspondent who covers the Justice Department and the Supreme Court, based in Washington. "
Ballet prepares kids in Peru for a future beyond their poor communities,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ballet-prepares-kids-peru-future-beyond-their-poor-communities-n994696,"LIMA, Peru — In a Peruvian neighborhood where families consider running water a luxury, young girls are learning the delicate art of ballet dancing. In the classroom at a public school near the South American nation’s Pacific coast, girls line up at wooden ballet barres, point toes and curve arms.
“When I dance I forget about everything,” 16-year-old Maria Cielo Cardenas said on a recent afternoon. “It’s as if I were flying.”
The class led by Maria del Carmen Silva, a former professional dancer, is bringing classical ballet dancing to children from impoverished communities where leotards and shiny pink pointe shoes are seldom, if ever, seen.
The 52-year-old teacher says her mission isn’t just to teach girls how to plié, but to prepare them for a future outside the boundaries of their poor neighborhood. She takes students to dance in Lima’s wealthiest districts in the hopes of building friendships between those who can and cannot easily afford a new ballet costume.
Later this year, Silva also hopes to take them to Florida to participate in a dance competition, if she can raise enough money for plane tickets.
“Ballet isn’t known because it’s so expensive,” the former National Ballet of Peru dancer said. “You need to buy costumes, leotards and pointe shoes.”
Young ballet dancers practice their technique in a studio at a public school in the Chorrillos neighborhood of Lima, Peru, in April 2, 2019. Martin Mejia / AP Silva’s initiative has sparked new dreams in the minds of girls for whom dance, let alone international travel, long seemed like a distant possibility.
On any given afternoon, excited parents peer through the studio’s windows to watch their daughters practice to the sound of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “Waltz of the Flowers.” Many say they are experiencing ballet for the first time through their children.
“The only ballet we’d heard about before was the story of a dancing rat,” said Elcira Ruiz, the mother of two daughters, referring to a children’s books series.
Ruiz and her husband, who is nearly blind, attend all of their children’s performances. She records the girls dancing on her cell phone, and her husband later watches them by holding the screen close to his failing eyes.
Silva is convinced that the discipline required in ballet will teach life lessons to a group of students for whom hardship has come at an early age.
Three sisters who dance together are living with their grandmother because their mother left to work in Spain and their father abandoned them.
Cardenas frequently worries about her mother’s failing kidneys, but says dance relieves her stress.
Ballet students wait for the start of their lesson at a public school in the Chorrillos neighborhood of Lima, Peru, on April 2, 2019. Martin Mejia / AP Peru is a country where seven million people live on just $105 a month. Despite the country’s economic stability, it has one of the region’s lowest rates of investment in education. All of that means ballet is usually for the rich.
While some wealthier parents have balked at Silva’s initiative though, most have embraced it.
For Cardenas, the chance to practice in the upscale district of Miraflores is like taking a step into a new world. She loves walking through the neighborhood’s leafy streets, and she marvels at simple things like running water, which she does not have in her own home.
“When I entered four years ago, I felt uncomfortable,” she said of dancing with girls from entirely different backgrounds. “Now we are classmates, like sisters.”

'Game of Thrones' season eight premiere reconnects fans with the pilot that started it all,www.nbcnews.com,Ani Bundel,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/game-thrones-season-eight-premiere-reconnects-fans-pilot-started-it-ncna994626,"“Game of Thrones” season eight premiered this weekend , with the first of the final six episodes. For millions of hungry fans, it was something of a reunion: Characters who have travelled far and wide over the past few years returned to where it all began, to face an enemy no one believed in. This week’s episode — the beginning of the end for a fantasy story that has spanned generations and continents — deliberately echoed the original pilot in both structure and in style, reminding fans that those who were once children and pawns in the great game are now the ones in charge. When “Game of Thrones” premiered all the way back in 2011 , it was considered one of the strangest bets HBO had ever taken . Though high fantasy tales like “Lord of the Rings” had swept the Oscars a few years before, and “Harry Potter” was slaying at the box office , both franchises were seen as outliers. “Game of Thrones” was also more complex than either story, a meditation on the nature of power with a cast of dozens that would soon bloom to hundreds. Pacing an introduction to all of the main characters was so difficult it took two pilot episodes to get it right.
This week’s episode — the beginning of the end for a fantasy story that has spanned generations and continents — deliberately echoed the original pilot.
But that second pilot, entitled “Winter Is Coming,” managed to make the whole endeavor seem almost easy. Perhaps then it’s not surprising Sunday’s episode spent so much time looking back. The original cast has shrunk back down to a nearly manageable size again, a mere two dozen or so speaking parts. And with a gap of more than a year separating the end of the seventh season and this final season premiere, much of the hour was spent reminding everyone who these characters are, in a mirror image of how they were introduced in the first place.
In the initial pilot, after a quick introduction to the Stark brood of the North (father Ned, mother Catelyn, five kids, plus one bastard) the first major set piece “Game of Thrones” staged depicted the arrival of the ruling family from the South. The interactions between the high-born characters and their various underlings defined their personalities as well as their place in the hierarchy.
Related Pop Culture Five minutes with Ned Stark: His 'Game of Thrones' predictions and whether he'll return This same conceit was used on Sunday to again bring viewers up to speed on the Stark family. It also highlighted just how much the world has changed in eight seasons, and how much it hasn’t. In the original scene, Arya is the last to line up with her family, too busy sneaking around, trying to get a glimpse of the train before everyone else. This time, too, she’s not standing with her sister and brother but out with the crowd gathering intel. Knowledge has always served her well, as has her ability to keep her head down. Friends, family, traveling companions, allies and enemies all ride by, none giving her a second look, as she registers who has survived — and who has not.
Such deliberate juxtapositions reinforce the passage of time for other characters as well. Sansa Stark, the girl who once blinded by finery, now looks coldly upon a new queen and her beautiful furs. Instead, it is Daenerys who hopes to flatter and charm, and Sansa who responds with the icy disinterest originally perfected by Cersei.
Such deliberate juxtapositions reinforce the passage of time for other characters as well.
But while Sansa may have adopted Cersei’s diction, she’s outgrown the woman she once desired to emulate. When the men around her boast they’ve assembled “the greatest army the north has ever seen,” as if everyone should be very impressed with their work, she responds with logistics. How exactly is she supposed to feed all these men? How many Dothraki mouths will a bushel of wheat feed? And what do dragons eat anyway? (Maybe let’s not answer that last one in front of the children.)
The episode’s structure is evocative as well. The episode’s major reveal — that Jon Snow is actually not Ned Stark’s bastard as he has always believed, but the son of Ned’s sister Lyanna and her legal husband Rhaegar Targaryen — is a mirror reflection of the pilot’s scene between Ned and Robert, best friends grieving over Lyanna’s grave. Then, Ned lied to Robert about his sister, because the truth would ruin their friendship. Now, Jon’s best friend Sam reveals the truth, despite what it could do to their friendship.
Related Opinion 'Game of Thrones' returns for season eight — which means the Westeros hype is finally ending Then there was the pilot’s cold (literally) open, with its first glimpse of the coming White Walker menace, and a mysterious warning left in the snow. The threat may have been forgotten as those down south focused on their political machinations, but its spectre remained. An epic battle beckons now, but the White Walkers haven’t stopped leaving ominous messages. A dead Northern child nailed to a wall, surrounded by a mysterious symbol, makes the connection between season eight and season one brutally clear for those who remember the show’s first White Walker.
But it’s the end of the episode that really nailed how things come full circle. The moment Ned Stark is beheaded late in season one was a real turning point for many fans. The murder of the supposed hero sent a clear message: This show is different. But Ned’s death is actually the second tragedy to befall the Stark family. Ned’s son Bran Stark is also set up to be a traditional fantasy hero, the prepubescent kid who doesn’t know yet he’s special. Bran’s expected trajectory is radically altered when he is thrown out of a tower window by the queen’s powerful brother Jaime Lannister. It’s a shocking ending to the opening hour, as fans wondered if he would survive.
Naturally, season eight’s first episode ends with Jaime, now stripped of his titles and place in the family. Jaime is riding back into Winterfell for the first time since that incident, one his character has spent the last seven years slowly living down. And who is the first person he sees? None other than the very much alive Bran, a twist that elicited shocked gasps on Twitter . This time, the question is if Jaime will survive. Let the circle be unbroken.

Tax Day 2019 is the perfect day to make the case for increasing taxes on the rich,www.nbcnews.com,Morris Pearl and Rep. Pramila Jayapal,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/tax-day-perfect-day-make-case-increasing-taxes-rich-ncna994591,"It’s tax day in America — the day when millions of people across the country finally stop procrastinating and find out how much money the federal government owes them. Or worse, how much they owe the federal government. This year’s deadline has been met with a great deal of anxiety due to President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, which have decreased the average refund for filers. Indeed, according to the IRS, tax refunds are down $6 billion compared to 2018. Adding insult to injury is the fact that the people who benefitted the most from Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are the people who don’t need an extra boost . While enraging, this outcome is really just part of a broader truth: The top 0.1 percent of Americans own almost as much as the bottom 90 percent combined, and the gap between these groups is widening with each passing day. Virtually all of the benefits of our growing economy have gone to those at the top, while most American families have experienced stagnating wages and rising costs of living.
Adding insult to injury is the fact that the people who benefitted the most from Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are the people who don’t need an extra boost.
The rich continue to get richer, but for most Americans, things aren’t any better than they were 30 years ago.
These levels of inequality are dangerous and destabilizing — it’s no coincidence that the last time wealth in America was so concentrated was immediately before the Great Depression. Luckily, there’s a simple solution, one that the overwhelming majority of Americans already support .
Tax the rich.
To be clear, all we propose is make sure that the wealthiest in our country pay their fair share — which does not happen now and is one of the primary reasons why wealth inequality has continued to deepen . Think of the tax code as a fundamental building block of our economy, one of the few that the federal government has direct control over. By raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans (including on one of the authors of this op-ed) we can start to reverse decades of growing inequality and reshape our economy into one that works for everyone, not just a wealthy few.
The balance of our current economy isn’t an accident — it’s the deliberate result of decades of tax policies that have designed a system that rewards those who already have money over those who are earning it. When it comes to addressing inequality, there is no single tool at our disposal more powerful than Congress’ constitutional mandate on taxes. And it’s time Democrats in Congress especially started giving the tax fight the attention it deserves.
Our opponents, the oligarchs and lawmakers who have a vested interest in keeping power and wealth in the hands of a few elites, have focused their efforts on using the tax code as a primary tool for achieving those goals. And they’ve been winning — for decades. Unless we take control of this powerful tool of the tax code, we simply won’t be able to address the devastating effects of unparalleled income and wealth inequality.
Group of millionaires want to pay higher taxes, close wealth gap April 15, 2019 03:41 The point of raising taxes on the rich is not just to raise revenue, it is to fix the underlying broken system that perpetuates inequality — no matter how much revenue you might spend. Revenue issues aside, it is demonstrably, empirically bad for our country for so much wealth to be concentrated in the hands of so few. Addressing inequality in and of itself is an admirable goal that we should make central to our fight.
Make no mistake: This is no easy task. There are many incredibly wealthy individuals and groups willing to spend millions to protect their preferential tax rates, and it should come as no surprise that where there’s wealth in America, there’s political influence. Despite a bipartisan majority of Americans supporting raising taxes on the wealthy, many members of Congress, including some on the left, are resistant to calls to tax the rich because they’re worried about angering their donors.
At the same time, even some of those with wealth are beginning to understand that our country cannot sustain these levels of inequality. It is simply bad for America. That’s what led to the creation of Patriotic Millionaires and it’s also why people like Warren Buffet have spoken out in favor of raising taxes. In 2013, Buffet noted that he was probably “the lowest paying taxpayer in the office.""
Related Opinion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax on the rich isn't about revenue, it's about decreasing inequality There’s tremendous grassroots energy behind making our tax code more progressive, but the push for a fairer tax code cannot come from the grassroots alone. In a system that unfortunately rewards access over popular support, those with the most power in Washington — members of Congress and their wealthy donors — must step up and take responsibility for changing the system that their counterparts have built.
That’s why the two of us, the co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus and the chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, are writing this piece together. Our colleagues must recognize the role they have to play in righting these systemic wrongs. The status quo works wonderfully for millionaires and members of Congress, but it’s choking the life out of the rest of the country.
We are ready to push, and to push hard. Unless we take bold action, the rising tide of inequality is going to drown us all.

Supreme Court rejects death row appeal over anti-gay jurors,www.nbcnews.com,Brooke Sopelsa,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/supreme-court-rejects-death-row-appeal-over-anti-gay-jurors-n994656,"The Supreme Court is again rejecting a gay death row inmate's appeal that claims jurors in South Dakota were biased against him because of his sexual orientation. The justices did not comment Monday in leaving in place the death sentence for Charles Rhines.
South Dakota death row inmate Charles Russell Rhines is shown in this 1990s photo in Rapid City, South Dakota. Rapid City Journal / AP file Rhines was convicted in the stabbing death of Donnivan Schaeffer, 22, while burglarizing a Rapid City doughnut shop in March 1992. A jury convicted Rhines in 1993, and the state Supreme Court affirmed his sentence and conviction in 1996.
His appeal followed the Supreme Court’s 2017 ruling that evidence of racial bias in the jury room allows a judge to consider setting aside a verdict.
According to court documents included in Rhines’ appeal , several jurors made comments about Rhines’ sexuality and its impact on their decision to recommend the death penalty in lieu of life without the possibility of parole.
Juror Harry Kenney, in a sworn statement, said the jurors knew that Rhines ""was a homosexual and thought the he shouldn’t be able to spend his life with men in prison.”
Juror Bennett Blake, according to court documents, said there was “lots of discussion of homosexuality” among the jurors and “a lot of disgust.”
Juror Frances Cerosimo recalled in a 2016 sworn statement that another juror, whom she did not name, said, “if he’s gay, we’d be sending him where he wants to go if we voted for"" life without the possibility of parole.
Related NBC OUT Gay in rural America: Up to 5 percent of rural residents are LGBTQ, report finds The NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit racial justice legal group that had filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to hear Rhines’ case, issued a statement critical of the high court’s decision, saying “sexual orientation discrimination has no place in the administration of justice.”
“Allowing Charles Rhines’ death sentence to stand defies Constitutional protections and breaks with Supreme Court precedent,” Daniel Harawa, assistant counsel at LDF, wrote. “The Supreme Court is uniquely empowered to eradicate discrimination from the jury system, and this disappointing decision undermines public confidence in the administration of justice and the rule of law.”
The Supreme Court justices rejected a similar appeal from Rhines last year.

"Trump admin settlement paves way for 2,700 Central American children to reunite with parents in U.S.",www.nbcnews.com,Julia Ainsley,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/trump-admin-settlement-paves-way-2-700-central-american-children-n994611,"A federal court settlement on Friday paved the way for 2,700 Central American children whose parents are living legally in the U.S. to resume their applications for refugee status from their home countries and join their families. The program, known as the Central American Minors program , began under then-President Barack Obama in 2014 but was put on hold by in 2017. Over 1,300 minors had been admitted under the program, but about 2,700 additional minors had been only conditionally approved and had not yet traveled to the U.S. when the Trump administration rescinded the program.
The program was meant to allow a safe pathway for children to join their parents living legally in the U.S. without making the dangerous journey alone.
In the settlement, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agreed to complete the processing of the thousands of children who were given conditional approval. They will also consider applications for children born later in the process who are classified as add-ons to the program.
According to a statement from the International Refugee Assistance Project, which represented the plaintiffs in the case, “The government anticipates most applicants will be approved for parole and allowed to travel to the U.S.”
The settlement allows for the process to resume, which means that the children still need to be approved by a judge. In addition, the Trump administration has to file a detailed plan for processing the children by Thursday.
Related News News U.S. court temporarily allows Trump admin to resume returning asylum-seekers to Mexico The case, known as is S.A. v. Donald Trump in the Northern District of California, was brought by 12 children and parent applicants of the Central American Minors Program and the immigrant advocacy group CASA.
“I am so happy at the news that the government will allow eligible children to come to the U.S. to fulfill their dreams of a better life without danger and fear, where they can study and try to have a better future,"" S.A., one of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement released by the International Refugee Assistance Project.
""My heart jumps and cries for joy because there are so many who need to escape danger,"" S.A., said. ""I have faith that I will be together with my daughter and grandson soon.""
Last month, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco ordered the Trump administration to continue processing the children who had been conditionally approved to be resettled in the U.S.
A spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said that as a matter of policy, the agency could not comment on litigation.
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to request for comment.

PBS' 'Marcos Doesn't Live Here Anymore' depicts toll of deportation,www.nbcnews.com,Raul A. Reyes,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/pbs-marcos-doesn-t-live-here-anymore-depicts-toll-deportation-n994536,"A woman approaches a statue of the Virgin Mary outside an Ohio church and kneels to pray. “Here we are again,” she says aloud, in a tone that is at once respectful and weary. “Oh Mary, I don’t know how much more of this I can take. Please, please, please.”
She recites a few prayers before imploring once more: “I can’t take it anymore.”
The woman is praying for her family to be together — a private moment captured in a new documentary, “Marcos Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.”
It tells the story of Elizabeth Perez, a decorated U.S. Marine veteran, struggling to reunite with her husband, Marcos Perez, after his deportation to Mexico.
The film follows the couple and their four children as they navigate an immigration system that offers them little hope of being together again. A portrait of a marriage as well as the human costs of deportation, it airs April 15 on PBS’ Frontline.
In ""Marcos Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” @SutherlandFilms uses the story of a Marine veteran and her undocumented husband to offer a window into the complicated U.S. immigration system, depicting the human cost of deportation.
Watch April 15 on @PBS . https://t.co/QfY4aO1zbJ pic.twitter.com/3lxNvczaRb
— FRONTLINE (@frontlinepbs) April 6, 2019 Elizabeth Perez, 40, served a total of 10 years in the Ohio Army National Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps, including a tour in Afghanistan. She met Marcos Perez in California in 2009 and the couple moved together to Ohio. He was undocumented, with two decades-old misdemeanor convictions in his past.
More significantly, he had previously been deported, and then entered the country again without authorization. In 2010, he was picked up at a traffic stop in Ohio by local law enforcement officials. Two weeks later, he was deported to Mexico.
The day her husband got picked up, Elizabeth Perez says in the film, “my home became a house.”
Marcos Perez’s prior deportation and re-entry triggered a provision of immigration law that barred him from coming back to the United States legally for 10 years.
The film shows Elizabeth Perez attending marches and rallies, giving speeches, and approaching lawmakers for help bringing him back. She and her husband file repeated petitions for his re-entry. They laugh, quarrel, and confide in each other on FaceTime and Skype. While she and Marcos Perez married in 2010, in Mexico, they are now in their ninth year of a physical separation that remains largely out of their control.
Twice, Elizabeth Perez moved their family to Mexico to live with him, only to return because she felt it was too dangerous for their children.
She knows that she is relatively fortunate, compared to other families.
“I’m lucky because I am a citizen and I can speak out,” she said. “What about all the families being ripped apart, where both parents are undocumented? The one left behind can’t afford to be visible and public, or they might get deported too. These are good people who just want to live and work and raise their kids. They are not criminals.”
Filmmaker David Sutherland spent several years, shooting hundreds of hours of footage, making “Marcos Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” He did not set out to make a political film. “I am a portraitist . The issues come out of the people … I want you to feel as though you are living in their skin. I want you to care about my characters.”
Sutherland kept the ending of the film deliberately vague. “This is an evolving story; about deportation and its effects on a loving family. I hope it helps them, but really I hope it makes people think about Elizabeth and Marcos, and worry about them, regardless of politics.”
Elizabeth Perez’s situation is both unique to her and a reflection of the U.S. immigration system.
Elizabeth and Marcos. Kimmer Olesak A 2018 analysis by the immigrant advocacy group American Families United estimated that as many as 11,800 military families face deportation issues. Under the Trump administration, more veterans’ requests for help on immigration are rejected than was the case under President Barack Obama, the group found.
It might surprise people to know that marrying an American citizen does not give someone the right to be here , or protection from deportation.
“That couldn’t be further from the truth,” said David Leopold , chair of the immigration group at Ulmer & Berne, LLP and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association . Marrying a citizen gives a person the right to apply to immigrate on a faster track. “But if someone is in the country without authorization or entered without authorization, the law does not offer a pathway even if you marry a citizen.”
There are “all sorts of rigid rules and regulations” that bar people such as Marcos Perez from obtaining legal status, Leopold explained . “Yet the thing about Elizabeth is that she has gone through so much stress and trauma and still has a positive outlook; she is still positive about the future.”
Marcos Perez’s case is complicated by the fact that he has already been deported.
According to Veronica Dahlberg , executive director of HOLA Ohio , a grassroots Latino advocacy group, there are not a lot of viable options for families when one member is deported. “The system is very brutal, and we’ve seen its effects firsthand. Many times, people just give up and decide to move on with their lives without their spouse,” Dahlberg said.

“I learned that wasn’t the case at all. The people with the ability to help her quietly closed their doors and ignored her pleas. I was truly surprised,” Dahlberg wrote in an email.
Immigration enforcement is very aggressive in Ohio, Dahlberg said. Last year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out one of its largest workplace raids in recent history in Salem, Ohio, at a meat processing plant. Another raid at a gardening company led to more than 100 arrests.
For now, Elizabeth Perez and her husband are waiting until the summer of 2020, when he will be eligible to apply for lawful entry. “Where we stand is the same place as at the end of the film,” she said. “We are still on the hamster wheel of trying to get him back here. It is a waiting game now.”
There is no guarantee that Marcos Perez will be approved for a visa when he can reapply. Reached by phone in Mexico, he sounded hopeful.
“After so much time, we’ve been through a lot, living here, living there … I believe things are going to change,” Marcos Perez said. “We will be ok.”
Marcos and Elizabeth. David Sutherland In the past, he sometimes missed his family so much he thought about crossing the border illegally again to be with them. “I was so depressed. I was sad, missing my kids … I am different now; I’m glad I didn’t. And the closer we get to 2020, every day, I am feeling happier,” he said.
Elizabeth Perez is adamant that her experiences with the immigration system have not changed how she feels about her country. At times, she has wondered whether the waiting, hoping and struggling were worth it.
“But Marcos is my husband and a human being. I feel like this deportation has controlled so many things in my life that I cannot let it control my marriage. I won’t,” she said.
“We got married for a reason,” she added. “I love him, and I want him here with us.”

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 4:21 PM GMT By Corky Siemaszko and Elizabeth Chuck An Ohio wrestling coach and booster who organized tournaments that gave him access to hundreds of young athletes over several decades has been accused of child endangerment and hazing. Bart Freidenberg, who is currently the sports director for AAU Wrestling in Ohio , was charged on Friday with the offenses, which officials told NBC News involved a 15-year-old victim. Freidenberg did not immediately return a call from NBC News on Monday, and it was not clear when his arraignment was. An attorney for Freidenberg, Mark Minister, declined to speak to NBC News. ""As you can imagine, the situation is fluid, and at this juncture, it’s a 'no comment' situation,"" Minister said. The incident allegedly happened in June 2018 while the Ohio All-Star Wrestling Team, the team Freidenberg coached, was renting school facilities in Franklin, Ohio, before leaving for a wrestling tour on the West Coast, according to a press release from Franklin police chief Russ Whitman. ""During the practices in Franklin, Ohio one of the juvenile wrestlers from Cincinnati called his parents to come pick him up early. Once the family picked him up, it was found that the juvenile was a victim of a hazing incident. The incident was reported to the police,"" Whitman said in the press release, adding that Freidenberg was allegedly ""aware of the hazing event(s) and failed to put stop to it."" No Franklin students or staff members were involved in the incident, Whitman said. In a phone conversation with NBC News, Whitman said officials were not releasing much information about the alleged hazing ""because we’re hoping that others victims come forward."" The wrestlers on the team were from across Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, he said, and he asked that others contact the Franklin Police Department if they had been a victim of hazing. Freidenberg, 58, also has a long history as a wrestling coach at the Bexley Middle School in the Columbus suburb of Bexley, Ohio. From 2017 to 2018, Freidenberg was the assistant wrestling coach at the school, according to Mary Davis, the administrative assistant to the superintendent. Prior to that, Freidenberg was head coach from 1993 to 1995 and co-head coach from 1992 to 1993, Davis said. According to a resume Freidenberg posted online, he claimed to have been the “wrestling manager” at Ohio State University from 1979 to 1982 — which is the same time frame that team doctor Richard Strauss was allegedly sexually abusing wrestlers. An Ohio State spokesman said Freidenberg was never an employee of the university but confirmed he was enrolled at the school from Autumn 1978 through Spring 1984. An independent law firm is currently investigating the accusations against Strauss, who died in 2005, and whether top officials at the school took any steps to stop the alleged abuse. Also, several former wrestlers have accused powerful GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, a former assistant wrestling coach at OSU, with turning a blind eye to the alleged abuse. Jordan has repeatedly denied knowing anything about Strauss. Related Powerful GOP Rep. Jim Jordan accused of turning blind eye to sexual abuse as Ohio State wrestling coach Freidenberg also says on his resume that he was the head wrestling coach at another Columbus-area school called Watkins Middle School from 1997 to 2002.

He also described himself as the “media liason (sic) ” for the Ohio State High School Championships. There does not appear to be an organization by that name, but there is an Ohio High School Athletic Association. “I can confirm that Bart has assisted the media in various capacities at our state wrestling tournament,” OHSAA spokesman Tim Stried confirmed in an email. “He has helped with records, photography and obtaining bios of state tournament qualifiers.” Corky Siemaszko Corky Siemaszko is a senior writer at NBC News Digital.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 5:53 PM GMT By Janelle Griffith An Indiana man is suing his parents for destroying his porn collection, which he claimed was worth almost $29,000. In a lawsuit filed last week in federal court in Michigan, the man said he moved to Indiana after living with his parents in Grand Haven, Michigan, for 10 months after a divorce. He said he did household chores in lieu of paying rent, according to court documents. In December 2017, the lawsuit says, his parents delivered boxes of his belongings to his residence in Indiana, but they were missing many of his possessions. The man asked his parents about the ""missing property,"" and they said ""the items were destroyed,"" the lawsuit states. In a January 2018 email that was part of the lawsuit, the father admitted to destroying some of his son's belongings. ""I do not possess your pornography. It is gone,"" the email said. ""It has been either destroyed or disposed of. I may well have missed a few items that are now in your possession but, at this point, if you don't have it, it is gone. Ditto for your sex toys and smutty magazines."" His father also said in the email that it ""took quite a while"" to destroy 12 moving boxes full of pornography and two boxes of ""sex toys."" ""I did you a big favor by getting rid of all this stuff for you,"" the email stated. Unable to come to a resolution with his parents, the man said he filed a police report with the Ottawa County Sheriff's Department in Michigan in which he alleged the value of his collection to be $10,000 to $30,000, factoring in his ""emotional attachment"" to the items. He told officers he wanted to file charges against his parents for the destruction of his property, according to the police report. The man's mother told police that she and his father had asked their son not to bring any of his pornography into their house before he moved in because they knew he ""had issues with it."" The parents kicked him out after a domestic incident, the police report states. After the prosecutor's office declined to press charges, the man wrote his father an email. ""If you had a problem with my belongings, you should have stated that at the time and I would have gone elsewhere. Instead you choose to keep quiet and behave vindictively,"" he wrote, according to the lawsuit. His father allegedly responded that one reason ""I destroyed your porn was for your own mental and emotional heath. I would have done the same if I had found a kilo of crack cocaine. Someday, I hope you will understand."" The man later reached out to investigators again, allegedly sending one officer 44 emails listing movies he said his parents had destroyed, many of which he claimed were valuable, difficult-to-get films. The prosecutor again declined to file charges. The man is seeking $86,822.16 in damages and attorneys' fees. His attorney, Miles Greengard, declined to comment.

"In Nicaragua, steep pension cuts, tax increases could plunge country into recession",www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/nicaragua-steep-pension-cuts-tax-increases-could-plunge-country-recession-n970261,"Latino In Nicaragua, steep pension cuts, tax increases could plunge country into recession Last April, news of these measures led to protests and a government crackdown that led to hundreds of deaths and over fifty thousand leaving the country. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega waves to supporters in Managua on Sept. 5, 2018. Oswaldo Rivas / Reuters Feb. 11, 2019, 9:03 PM GMT By Associated Press MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaraguans revolted last April when the government announced it was raising payroll taxes and cutting retirement benefits to bolster a social security program hemorrhaging money. The unrest led authorities to quickly withdraw the measure, but as the protests boiled for months and broadened into demands that President Daniel Ortega leave office, security forces responded with a harsh crackdown that killed over 300 people. Hundreds more were arrested and an estimated 50,000 fled into exile. Now, with the dissident movement cowed, a new plan to cut pension payments by 30 to 40 percent and a raise in payroll taxes is taking effect. And economists and businesspeople are warning that it threatens to have even more severe effects for Nicaraguans and could plunge the country into deeper recession and unemployment. “This measure is absolutely much more drastic since it’s not gradual but instead immediate, and it will affect the nearly 800,000 insured in the country,” said Mario Arana, who was minister for development, head of the Treasury and president of Nicaragua’s Central Bank during the 2001-2006 administration of Ortega’s predecessor. “All sectors of the economy will be damaged,” Arana said. The social security package was approved in January by a legislature dominated by Ortega’s allies and took effect Feb. 1. Businesses with over 50 employees will see their social security tax payments rise from 19 percent to 22.5 percent of pay while the tax on a worker’s wages will go from 6.25 percent to 7 percent. The tax on independent workers increases from 18.25 percent to 22.25 percent of income. At the same time, the tax that funds disability, age and death insurance programs is rising from 10 percent to 14 percent. That has people like Mercedez Ramirez, who owns a beauty salon in the capital of Managua, worried. Over the last decade, she has already seen her clientele plummet and had to lay off two of her four stylists. Now she doesn’t know if she can afford the social security taxes for the two who remain. “This situation can’t go on,” Ramirez said. “If I let my employees go I’ll have to close my business and then ... what will we live on? My children are out of work.” Related Nicaragua blocks operations of NGOs who have criticized President Ortega Gustavo Porras, an Ortega ally who heads congress, which begins a new session Tuesday, said the change aims to “guarantee payment of all pensions and the rights of workers that were won under this government.” Yet authorities have not detailed how reforms will affect the finances of the Social Security Institute. Nor have they said whether they will address administrative costs at the agency, whose budget as of November was running at a record deficit of $86 million, up 57 percent from a year earlier. Enrique Saenz, an economist and former lawmaker who left Nicaragua months ago due to his opposition to Ortega, characterizes the crisis at the institute as a problem of Ortega’s own creation, blaming “fiscal mismanagement, professional incompetence and irresponsible populism.” Saenz said the institute was operating with a $60 million surplus when Ortega returned to power in 2007. But over the last 12 years its administrative costs more than doubled and its payroll more than tripled to over 4,000 workers, while executive positions rose from 10 to 136, he said. The International Monetary Fund has been warning since 2017 that the agency’s troubled finances threatened what had been relative stability in Nicaragua before the political crisis. The economy had been averaging annual GDP growth of about 4.5 percent since 2014. Despite the new tax increases, Nicaragua has not seen a repeat of last year’s mass protests. And it seems unlikely to, since Ortega, a 73-year-old ex-guerrilla who was first president from 1985 to 1990, forcefully quashed the challenge to his power, including effectively outlawing opposition demonstrations since September. The Associated Press and rights groups have documented physical abuse and torture of some people taken into custody. Many others lost jobs, were expelled from universities, or suffered other reprisals for taking part in protests. “We are not in the streets because there is a state of terror in Nicaragua, because there are police and shock troops that arrest you and beat you,” said Ana Margarita Vijil, leader of the dissident Sandinista Renewal Movement, which the government accuses of promoting a “terrorist coup.” Still, Vijil insists there will be protests because “this type of reforms ... only aggravate the crisis.” The 2018 political crisis pummeled the Central American nation’s economy, particularly tourism, commerce, infrastructure and investment. About 350,000 jobs were lost, including 160,000 that paid into the social security system, and the economy contracted 4 percent, according to World Bank figures. Jose Adan Aguerri, president of the High Council of Private Enterprise, contends the new overhaul will cause more joblessness and capital flight, run businesses into bankruptcy and inflate the cost of basic goods. The council is preparing to mount a legal challenge. “Let us remember that the political cost of applying these reforms and provoking more unemployment will be on the hands of the government,” Aguerri said Friday at a news conference. According to the Central Bank, about 58 percent of the workers who receive social security payments get less than $307 a month. The cost of the basic monthly food basket stood at $415 as of December. Also worried are some 82,000 Nicaraguans who are over 55 years old and about to retire, and whose pensions stand to fall by 30 percent to 40 percent. “I turn 60 this year and plan to retire in October, but under this law I will no longer get $400 in a monthly pension but just $280,” said a private accountant who insisted on speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals."

Tiger Woods' comeback could make him more valuable — and net him $100M,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/tiger-woods-comeback-could-make-him-more-valuable-net-him-n994621,"Tiger Woods demonstrated at this year's Masters tournament that he still has what it takes to compete — and win — at golf. Branding experts say his single-stroke victory on Sunday also shows that Woods, at 43, is still a winning investment for Nike and his other sponsors. Woods delivered $22.5 million in media exposure for Nike during the tournament on Sunday, according to Apex Marketing Group.
“He’s eclipsed what he provided Nike in brand exposure for the four majors last year with just this one major,” said Apex managing partner Eric Smallwood. “He’s got that drive now and he’s playing the best golf he’s played in recent years. I think he’s going to continue to provide Nike with enhanced exposure because the TV is going to follow him.”
President Donald Trump announced in a tweet on Monday that he would be awarding Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Spoke to @TigerWoods to congratulate him on the great victory he had in yesterday’s @TheMasters , & to inform him that because of his incredible Success & Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more importantly, LIFE, I will be presenting him with the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019 ""Spoke to @TigerWoods to congratulate him on the great victory he had in yesterday’s @TheMasters, & to inform him that because of his incredible Success & Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more importantly, LIFE, I will be presenting him with the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM!"" Trump tweeted.
Bob Dorfman, creative director at Baker Street Advertising, said Woods’ victory — especially if it is followed by future wins — could go a long way to helping him re-engage the wide variety of brands he endorsed before a sex scandal and tabloid-ready divorce prompted brands like Gatorade, Accenture, and AT&T to drop him.
“It legitimizes him — there were certainly questions about whether he was still viable,” he said.
“If anything, he’s probably become more valuable,” said Scott Kirkpatrick, a partner at Chicago Sports & Entertainment Partners. “I would say everybody who’s on his bag and his partners are getting more of a return than they expected,” he said. In addition to the boost in brand exposure for Nike, Apex Marketing Group estimated that Woods generated roughly a combined $1 million in exposure for sponsors Monster and Bridgestone during the event.
After Woods unexpectedly won the Tour Championship last year, many wondered if he would be able to mount a successful second act. Kirkpatrick said yesterday’s win gives marketers the confirmation they need. “There was talk of a comeback and now it’s more than real,” he said.
This is good news for sponsors seeking a return on their investment, and for Woods’ own bottom line. “I would not be surprised if, in the long run, this win yesterday at Augusta is worth $50 to $100 million in future benefits to Tiger. He will see revenue streams from this win for years to come,” said Richard Burton, the David Falk professor of sport management at Syracuse University.
“His appearance fees go up. If he is involved in designing golf courses, his fee goes up. His next Nike contract may be worth more,” he said, adding that Woods might also have clauses or licensing agreements in his current Nike contract that could earn him more money.
If Woods continues to play and win, more types of companies might consider him a viable pitchman. Although in his waning years as a professional golfer, Woods’ age could make him an attractive endorser for categories ranging from financial services to travel to pharmaceutical companies catering to an older demographic.
As a brand ambassador for Rolex, Apex Marketing Group estimated that Woods generated $2.3 million in post-event media exposure for the watchmaker after winning the Masters on Sunday, with widely circulated photos showing Woods holding his trophy with a Rolex on his wrist.
“Golfers have a long shelf life, more than other endorsers who are only popular in their sport for a limited number of years,” Dorfman said.
Robert Dilenschneider, founder and principal of the Dilenschneider Group, said the family-friendly image of Woods celebrating his win with family would be a strategic persona to focus on as he targets a more mature demographic. “Continue developing the image he advanced yesterday,” he said.
“If I was him, I’d have a press conference with his mother next to him and his son on his knee. People aren’t going to forget what happened 10 years ago, but Tiger has a chance here.”

Is a travel rewards credit card right for you? Think carefully.,www.nbcnews.com,Herb Weisbaum,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/travel-rewards-credit-card-right-you-ncna994541,"Free travel sounds mighty appealing. So, it’s easy to see why travel rewards cards that offer free airline tickets or hotel rooms are popular. More than one-third of Americans (35 percent) carry a credit card in their wallet that earns travel rewards, according to a survey of 2,000 adults by the personal finance website NerdWallet released last week. But it turns out, many people greatly overestimate the value of the points or miles they accumulate:
Only 18 percent knew that the average value of a travel rewards point/mile is one cent. Most (45 percent) thought it was worth more. Almost one in five (18 percent) said a point or mile is worth $1 or more. About one in seven (15 percent) thought they could get three or more round-trip domestic flights by cashing in a sign-up bonus of 50,000 points/miles, while 16 percent say that’s not enough to purchase any round-trip flights. NerdWallet estimates that 50,000 points (with a non-branded travel rewards credit card) could purchase an average of 1.6 round trip tickets. Overestimating the value of using a rewards credit card “can be a real letdown when you go to redeem those points in the future and find you don't have enough,” said Sara Rathner, NerdWallet’s credit card expert.
“It's very important to understand the value of a card's rewards, and other ways that the rewards program operates, so you know what you're getting into — ideally before you even apply for your card,” Rathner told NBC News BETTER.
Tip: If you’re considering a card with a sign-up bonus, know how much you’ll need to spend and how quickly to earn those extra points/miles. Is that level of spending realistic for you? You don’t want to spend more than you can afford simply to earn a bonus.
Related Good Cents Good Cents Is a store credit card worth it? DON’T HOARD POINTS/MILES FOR TOO LONG “Stockpiling travel rewards and letting them collect dust in your account is pointless,” Rathner said.
In some cases, rewards points or miles can expire, but the big risk is that they drop in value, if the airline or credit card company changes its rewards program.
Earlier this month, United Airlines announced that it’s changing from a static and predicable mileage reward chart to a dynamic-pricing system which will, as the airline described it, “fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including demand.” This new awards program applies to all new reservations for travel on or after November 15.
“If you’ve been saving up for years in the hopes of booking a specific trip, only to find that the price of said trip has doubled, that can be devastating,” said Brian Kelly, The Points Guy , in an email to NBC News BETTER. “With more airlines shifting away from fixed award rates and towards more dynamic-pricing models, it’s much harder to determine what a ‘good value’ award is.”
While it can make sense to sock away rewards for a big trip, the smart move is to do that with a general-purpose rewards card that pays you back in points, rather than an airline credit card that pays you in miles that can only be used for tickets on its flights.
“That way,” Kelly says, “if one of the partner programs changes its award structure, you have other options to still realize value for your hard-earned points and miles.”
DOES A TRAVEL REWARDS CARD MAKE SENSE FOR ME? There are two basic types of travel rewards cards:
General travel rewards cards , like the Capital One Venture Rewards or Chase Sapphire Preferred, let you use your rewards for travel or cash back. If you don’t travel very often, this is the way to go, since you can choose the type of reward. Co-branded rewards cards that are issued by an airline or hotel chain. If there’s an airline or hotel chain you typically use, this makes more sense. Aside from the basic rewards, you’ll get extra benefits, such as free baggage, special “members only” specials or complimentary upgrades. “Each travel rewards card has different ways to earn and redeem points or miles,” Oliver Browne, credit industry analyst with Credit Card Insider . “Generally, if you’re a person who doesn't like a lot of fuss, a travel rewards card may not be a good option for you; a cashback card would be better.”
Note: You’ll need good to excellent credit to qualify for a rewards card.
Other things to consider:
Annual fee: Rewards credit cards typically have an annual fee of $50 to $100. With premium rewards cards, fees range from $200 to $550. While these high-end cards, such as the Platinum Card from American Express and the Chase Sapphire Reserved come with a variety of travel perks, including access to airport lounges and credit for travel expenses, they don’t make sense for the occasional traveler. Higher interest rates: Rewards cards of any kind have higher interest rates than traditional credit cards. If you don’t pay your balance off in full each month, don’t even consider getting a rewards card. That interest can wipe out the value of those rewards. Related Do It BETTER Do It BETTER How to find the best travel rewards credit card for you TOP-RATED TRAVEL REWARDS CARDS The best travel rewards card is the one that works the best for you, based on your spending patterns and travel habits. You need to do your homework to learn the ins and outs of various programs. Compare how you’d earn rewards with that card and how you can spend them, as well as introductory bonus (if any) cardholder perks, and annual fee (if any).
Note: These highly-rated cards have no annual fee: Bank of America Travel Rewards cards, the Capital One VentureOne Rewards and Quicksilver cards, and Discover it Miles.
“It really is about finding the balance between the cost of holding the card and the value of the points you can get from the card,” NerdWallet’s Rathner said. “You always want to tip the scale in favor of getting more value as a reward than you would pay to hold the card.”

The president's daughter and senior adviser, on a four-day trip to promote a White House global women's project, spoke about roadblocks for women during a policy discussion with Ethiopia's president and after signing a joint statement with the African Union Commission. ""We can and we must address these barriers to women's equality and countries' prosperity,"" Trump said during a panel discussion held at the headquarters of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. She pointed to the limited number of female landowners on the continent and said some countries have laws allowing men to block their wives from working. Ivanka Trump pushes economic empowerment for women on Africa trip April 15, 2019 01:09 In the agreement, the United States and the African Union Commission pledged to help empower women and to fight problems such as child marriage, human trafficking and sexual abuse. She signed it at the commission's headquarters along with Kwesi Quartey, the commission's deputy chairman. Trump highlighted the ""collective goal"" to eliminate gender-based violence and stressed the shared focus on improving access to education and business opportunities. On her second day in Ethiopia, Trump delivered her message on gender equity in a country long considered a patriarchal society, where women and girls struggle with access to jobs and education. Female genital mutilation continues in some areas, although the government has outlawed the practice. Ethiopia has pursued sweeping political and economic reforms under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Last year, lawmakers approved a cabinet with women making up a record 50 percent of ministers and elected President Sahle-Work Zewde, the first woman to hold the largely ceremonial post. Trump met separately with both leaders Monday, sitting with Zewde in a formal room at the presidential palace. ""I can say that you came at the right time. Africa is on the rise,"" Zewde told Trump as the two participated in the panel discussion before a packed, largely female audience. During the event, Trump and David Bohigian, acting director of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, announced a new financing initiative for women in Africa. Known as OPIC 2X Africa, the effort will directly invest $350 million — and seek additional private investment — in businesses and funds owned by women, led by women or working to help women. OPIC provides loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance, funding projects that stretch across continents and industries. Trump started her day at Holy Trinity Cathedral, where she met with religious leaders and laid a wreath to mourn the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash that occurred soon after takeoff last month.

Chinese woman arrested at Mar-a-Lago is denied bail,www.nbcnews.com,Xuan Thai,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/chinese-woman-arrested-mar-lago-denied-bail-n994641,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A federal judge on Monday denied bail to a Chinese woman who was arrested while trying to enter President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club with a trove of electronic devices. Yujing Zhang, 33, has remained behind bars since March 30 when federal prosecutors say she lied to Secret Service agents to gain entry to the private club. Zhang pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of lying to federal agents and illegally entering a restricted area.
Federal Magistrate Judge William Matthewman refused to set bail for Zhang, saying he believed she posed an ""extreme risk of flight"" if released. Matthewman cited her financial resources in China and her lack of ties to the U.S.
Yujying Zhang's passport photo United States District Court Southern District of Florida ""It does appear to the court that she was up to something nefarious when she tried to gain access to Mar-a Lago,"" said Matthewman, who also noted that the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China.
Zhang told federal agents and club staff members conflicting stories when she tried to gain entry to the members-only resort last month, according to a criminal complaint.
Zhang was discovered carrying two passports, four cellphones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing computer malware, according to her criminal complaint. When agents searched her hotel room, they found a device for detecting hidden cameras, several debit and credit cards, and $7,500 in cash, according to court papers.
Zhang was indicted Friday on two counts: lying to a federal agent and illegally entering a restricted area. She faces up to six years in prison if convicted.
Prosecutors said in court Monday that additional charges are possible. A prosecutor also said that subsequent analysis on the thumb drive suggests that it may not contain malware after all.
Zhang's defense lawyers said the incident could have been avoided had she been provided with a Mandarin interpreter. They asked the judge to release her on a $250,000 bail secured by her father, and said she has agreed to wear an electronic monitoring device.
""It is a sad fact of this case that if a Mandarin interpreter was provided at that first contact with the Secret Service, we very well may not be here,” said Kristy Militello, one of Zhang's public defenders.
The FBI began investigating Zhang as a possible spy after her arrest but no espionage charges have been brought.
No espionage charge for woman arrested at Mar-A-Lago April 13, 2019 04:34 According to court papers, Zhang told an agent posted at a Mar-a-Lago security checkpoint that she was a member who came to use the resort pool, court papers say. She displayed two Chinese passports with her name and photograph to the agent, who then took her to Mar-a-Lago security to determine if she was a member of the club.
Mar-a-Lago security allowed Zhang to enter because her last name — one of the most common in China — matched that of an existing club member, according to court papers. Zhang did not give a definitive answer when asked if that member was her father, but the club granted her entry anyway. A ""potential language barrier issue"" may have played a role in the club's decision to let her in, court papers say.
Zhang's story changed once she made it to the club's main reception area, according to court papers.
After being asked several times where she was going, Zhang said she was there to attend the United Nations Chinese American Association event scheduled for that evening. The receptionist, who knew no such event existed, summoned the Secret Service, according to court papers.
In the arrest affidavit, the agent said Zhang spoke English well and during questioning ""became verbally aggressive with agents."" She had no swimsuit in her possession.

Not getting results in the gym? Ask yourself these 5 questions,www.nbcnews.com,Stephanie Mansour,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/not-getting-results-gym-ask-yourself-these-5-questions-ncna993971,"With the spring season comes an “out with the old, in with the new” mentality. And it can be a great time of year to re-evaluate your workout routine, too. Should you move your workout outdoors or stick with the gym? Is your current routine delivering results or are you looking to switch it up with some different activities? First things first: The old saying “If it’s not broken, don’t fix it!” applies here. If you’re enjoying your workouts and seeing the results you’re looking for, there’s no need to switch things up. But if you’re questioning if your workout routine is effective or you’re not enjoying it , we’re going to help you get to the bottom of the issue — and provide some adjustments you can make that will get you moving in the right direction.
1. Am I Bored? Are you getting bored with the same old routine? Research shows that boredom with any activity can breed dissatisfaction, which encourages people to search for creative change and novelty. As humans, we’re wired to get sick of doing the same thing over and over again — and that doesn’t stop short of exercise!
According to the American Council on Exercise , mixing up your exercise not only increases your adherence to a workout routine, but also may help speed up your results and help you avoid plateaus. Plus, varying your workout activities helps to prevent overuse injuries. Say, for example, you’re a runner. If you have knee or joint issues, switching things up with a low impact yoga or Pilates class a few times a week can help prevent injuries from the constant pounding on your joints.
Just beware of bouncing around from one workout to another too quickly. Take it slow when trying a new exercise you’re not as familiar with to avoid injury . Here are some small ways you can begin introducing novelty you’re your routine:
Try group fitness so that you can use other people as a variable in your workout, stay challenged by a professionally-curated workout routine and feed off the energy of a group mentalit y, which will be a departure from solo workouts! Take a different class. If you regularly go to spin class after work, try hitting the 8 a.m. class once or twice a week. Or if you’re used to taking bootcamp with a certain instructor, go on another day or time to give someone else a try. Switch up your playlist. If you regularly go to a dance or spinning class but are bored of the same music, go to another day or time or instructor. If you frequently head out for a run, refresh your own playlist and add in some new jams that will put a pep in your step. Bring a friend to your workout to spice things up. You may be surprised how much you look forward to a Saturday jog in the park when you can spend it catching up with a friend! Create new goals for yourself so that there’s a different motivating factor behind your workout. Consider signing up for a 5k or joining a sports league this summer (and spending the next few months getting in shape to play!).
The one simple exercise that can get you a slimmer waistline Feb. 15, 2019 01:09 2. Am I inconsistent? I see this issue a lot: people are religiously active on weekends, going on long hikes and bike rides, playing outdoors with their kids, and never missing a Sunday Pilates class. But these same weekend warriors just can’t seem to be as consistent during the week, when work and family obligations always seem to get in the way.
And the opposite can also be true: Some people thrive on the predictability and scheduling of the work week, never missing a workout, but go off the rails with their diet and exercise during weekends, when schedules are more lax. One study published in Obesity Research found that Americans 19 to 50 years old take in 115 more calories (mostly from alcohol and fat) per day on Friday through Sunday than on the other days of the week.
Regardless which boat you’re in, falling into a repetitive trap of consistently hitting workouts for only part of the week and then reverting to unhealthy habits the rest of the time can undo all of the hard work you’re putting in.
Related Weekend warrior Weekend warrior 5 science-backed ways to have a healthier weekend The truth is, what works under the constraints of weekday life may not work once those constraints change on the weekend, and vice versa. In over a decade of working with busy clients, I’ve found one super simple solution to this problem: pretend you lead a double life. It’s time to create two workout plans; one for the weekend version of you, and another for the Monday to Friday version of you.
If you often skip workouts during the week:
Cut your workout time in half on weekdays. Instead of a 60-minute workout 4 days per workweek, aim for 30-minute workouts 2 days per week (yes, cut the days in half, too!) Change the location of your weekday workouts. Having a hard time getting to the gym after a long commute home from work? Plan for workouts in your living room or a nearby park to make it easier for you to fit them in. Make workouts social. Often social plans pop up after work that interfere with workout plans. To avoid this, kill two birds with one stone by scheduling a fun group workout like a spin or barre class instead of just opting for drinks or dinner with friends. If you think weekends might be derailing you efforts, here are some suggestions:
Get it done in the morning. Since weekends tend to be less structured, there’s more of a chance that a last-minute dinner invite or impromptu Netflix binge can push your workout off the calendar. Getting your workout done first thing won’t only start your day on a healthy note, but it will ensure it gets done no matter what fun plans pop up. Make your social plans active. Just like during the week, checking your workout off the to-do list while also getting in some quality time with friends and family can help ease the stress of fitting in exercise, and make it more enjoyable. Head to the park for a game of basketball or tennis with your family, take a long walk with your spouse to catch up about your week, or arrange to meet up with friends for boot camp before brunch. Sign up for a class ahead of time. If you have a hard time motivating yourself to get moving on lazy weekends, committing to a class at a certain time can help hold you accountable. This can be especially motivating if you sign up for the same class each week and develop a rapport with the instructor and other students — you won’t want to let them down by not showing up. 3. Am I Seeing Results? Before you write off an exercise plan as ineffective, know that you may be looking for results in the wrong places — more specifically, the scale. My clients say, “I’ll believe it’s working when I see the scale move!” Seeing the number tick down can be a great motivator if you have pounds to lose , but chances are, it’s not going to move as quickly as you hope — and if your goal is permanent, sustainable weight loss, that’s a good thing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the safe rate of weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds per week. Losing weight faster than that is often due to eating and exercise habits that are unmanageable over the long term, that will often end in binges or rebounds where you pack the pounds back on down the line.
Related Health Health 2 ways to measure weight loss that have nothing to do with pounds So ask yourself: Am I seeing an average of 1-2 pounds of weight loss a week? If the answer is yes, give your body the time it deserves to see movement on the scale, and instead focus on other changes that can be occurring that are just as important, if not more so, than the number on the scale, like:
Are my clothes fitting looser? Do I have more energy ? Do I feel more toned or stronger? Am I lifting more weight than I used to be able to? Am I increasing how many repetitions that I’m able to perform in a workout? Is my cardiovascular endurance increasing? Am I less winded or less sore than I was when I used to do this similar routine? If your answer to the majority of these questions is no, then it’s time to change it up. Here are a few ways to keep your body guessing and push through a plateau:
Do your workout in the reverse order. Completely change your workout and try a new activity. Do the same workout outdoors instead of in the gym. Cut your dumbbell weight in half and double the repetitions. 4. Am I Getting Injured? Some soreness is expected when you’re working hard in the gym. But pain or excessive soreness can definitely be a deterrent to working out — or put you out of commission altogether . All too often I see people “pushing through the pain” and while there is certainly some discomfort that comes with exercising, pain is another story. Before you get to the point of serious injury, ask yourself a few questions:
Do I feel overall more or less fit and mobile than when I started my current workout routine? Do I have aches and pains more than most people I talk to? Do I leave a workout feeling less energized then when I started? As a recreational tennis player, I found that my shoulders and neck were getting extremely tight and tender once I upped my game to playing four times a week. This meant that I had to scale back my other workouts, like strength training and cardio, because my body just couldn’t handle it. In fact, when I would do my normal strength training, I noticed that I was actually losing mobility in my upper back and shoulders since I worked my arms so much in tennis. Similarly, when one of my private weight loss clients started doing Pilates on the reformer machine instead of on the mat, she felt her legs getting toned and stronger , so we cut out the lower body strength training from her workout routine to ensure she didn’t overwork them.
Moral of the story: Listen to your body! Here are a few adjustments you can make if you feel like your workout routine is causing you pain or contributing to an injury :
Scale back the workout and do less reps and less weight. Get a complimentary physical therapy assessment at a local office. Try a different modality of working out. Feeling stiffer from your 9-5? Add a yoga class into your workout routine. Feeling joint pain from a high-intensity interval training class ? Try a lower impact strength training workout instead. 5. Do I Dread My Workouts? Are your workouts the least favorite part of your day? We all have those days where we are tired or stressed and just not in the mood to hit the gym, and that’s okay. But if you’re dreading your workout more times than not, something has to give.
There could be a few factors at play here. Here’s how to shift your mindset:
Do you feel like you’re getting beat up while working out, but feel great after? Instead of focusing on how hard the workout is going to be, focus on how good you’ll feel afterwards. This is your pump-up ammunition to think about anytime you are planning for or begin dreading your workout. Do you actually dislike the workout? If so, don’t do it! There are so many different options when it comes to exercise activities that you should never settle for suffering through something you really don’t enjoy. Shop around for a new workout. Many studios offer a free class to new students so make a commitment to sign up for 2 to 3 this month and explore what other types of exercise may be more enjoyable for you. Do you feel rushed or crammed for time working out during the week, which just leaves you more stressed? When it comes to group fitness classes, there’s often not enough recovery time built in after the workout, which can leave you feeling hyped up and stressed to rush to your next commitment. Carve out 5 extra minutes to hit the stretching mats in the gym to allow your body to cool down and to stretch out any areas of the body that you worked in class. And consider adding in some lower impact more restorative workouts like Pilates and yoga once or twice a week. You’ll still be toning and strength training, while also giving yourself a much needed mental break. Take the change of season as your cue to do an honest assessment of what’s working and what’s not when it comes to your workout routine. Committing to making some adjustments now will help get you moving in the right direction. Slow and steady wins the race!

Jill Filipovic: Trump's anti-abortion agenda emboldened an all-out war on women's rights in dozens of states,www.nbcnews.com,Jill Filipovic,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-anti-abortion-agenda-emboldened-all-out-war-women-ncna994661,"It’s been a rough two years for reproductive rights. Since Donald Trump took office, a series of attacks on both abortion and contraception have come from the state and federal levels. A re-emboldened anti-abortion movement has emerged, and they’re gunning for major legal changes — and, they hope, a Supreme Court that would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion broadly legal across the United States. What triggered this shift? Trump’s Supreme Court judges — including, most recently, Brett Kavanaugh. How appropriate that opponents of a woman’s right to decide what happens to her body have decided that their best hope is in a Supreme Court made more conservative by a judge accused of sexual assault.
Among the more aggressive efforts to limit abortion are “heartbeat bills,” which functionally outlaw abortion by making the procedure illegal as early as six weeks from a woman’s last period. Most women don’t realize they’re pregnant until they miss a period — by which point they will be running up against the limits of a heartbeat law. By the time they take a pregnancy test and schedule a doctor’s appointment, they are likely to be beyond the date that an abortion would be legal.
 The end of Roe v. Wade is coming. But states like Ohio have rolled back abortion rights for years. More than a dozen states have put these laws before their legislatures, even though they are flatly unconstitutional and illegal. Ohio, Mississippi and Kentucky have made them law; Georgia is soon to follow. Because they violate Roe v. Wade, none of these laws are actually in effect. But they are being litigated up the chain, wasting a plethora of resources on what should be settled law.
That, though, is the point: To unsettle the law.
“We know that the pro-abortion forces are going to sue, and that’s part of the process,” said Lori Viars, an Ohio antiabortion activist, told the Washington Post . “We want this bill to go to the Supreme Court. It was written for this purpose.”
 The goal of Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban is to overturn Roe v. Wade Just a few years ago, passing legislation that blatantly violated Roe v. Wade was not the anti-abortion movement’s strategy. Instead, anti-abortion groups focused on dismantling abortion rights piece by piece with logical-sounding (though ultimately illogical) legislation that made abortions difficult or impossible to obtain, especially for the most vulnerable women.
For example, they passed laws mandating parental consent or notification for an abortion, on the grounds that minors are too immature to decide for themselves to end a pregnancy — never mind that without an abortion, those allegedly too-immature minors would be forced to be parents. They pushed to bar Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act from providing insurance coverage for abortion, which means that women in many states have to pay out-of-pocket for procedures that are typically hundreds of dollars (and can run into the thousands, if they happen later in the pregnancy). As a result, many poor women spend weeks or months squirreling away money, borrowing from family and friends, and pawning valuables to afford a termination that may be growing more expensive by the week.
Anti-abortion groups also passed mandatory waiting periods, including multiple visits to the doctor, for what is (or, at least used to be) an exceptionally simple outpatient procedure — another barrier for low-income women who are less likely to have the ability to take so much time off of work, and who carry a heavier burden when they have to pay multiple times for transportation, a clinic visit, and childcare.
These waiting periods, as well as the bars on Medicaid and even some insurance program coverage of abortion, have the effect of pushing abortion procedures later and later into pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups and politicians know that, and have used that knowledge to inform their legislative strategy. In states across the nation, they have tried to outlaw abortion after a certain number of weeks, often passing laws that would bar or seriously limit second-trimester procedures.
Beyond those legislative efforts, they’ve also made it harder for clinics to provide care by regulating them to a degree that no similar medical facilities face, despite the fact that early abortion is one of the safest procedures around — and that abortion at any stage is safer than childbirth.
That was all bad enough. But now, anti-abortion groups have moved into a new era of activism. Previously, there wasn’t much of a point in directly challenging Roe, because it was a non-starter; the votes weren’t there on the Supreme Court to overturn it. The best these groups and their representatives in the Republican Party could hope for was a landscape so hostile to abortion rights that safe, legal procedures were simply out of reach for many women. That much — sadly — they have achieved.
 Iowa's new six-week 'heartbeat' abortion bill is a blatant attempt to reverse Roe v. Wade And now, thanks to President Trump and the GOP, anti-abortion activists believe they have the majority on the Supreme Court, and that a direct challenge to Roe could end abortion rights as we know them. You see this boldness in some of the more extreme bills introduced in the states, like a recent proposed law in Texas that would have tried women who have abortions for homicide and, as a result, potentially subject them to the death penalty. That bill failed, but it still marks an important moment in anti-abortion activism: So-called “pro-life” politicians actually admitted what they eventually want, which is for the state to punish, incarcerate and potentially kill women who end their pregnancies.
There are also some bright spots. After decades of encroachments on the rights to abortion and contraception, pro-choice groups are going on offense. In progressive states, they are pushing to expand abortion access, not just defend it. And they have had some important successes.
But for the country as a whole, abortion rights are increasingly imperiled. And there is a direct line from the Trump Supreme Court appointees to these new, brasher attacks. Between the various “heartbeat” laws and the Texas death penalty for abortion bill, anti-abortion organizations and politicians are sending American women a clear message: They’re coming. And the end game isn’t just an end to Roe. It’s women who try to defy that end in prison cells.

Notre Dame Cathedral fire threatens to wipe out 'transcendental' cultural treasure,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-threatens-wipe-out-transcendental-cultural-treasure-n994721,"The Notre Dame Cathedral has long been regarded as a spiritual beacon, architectural marvel, monument to Parisian beauty and a towering symbol of French national pride. But the flames that engulfed the centuries-old structure on Monday threatened to demolish part of that rich cultural legacy, alarming admirers and worshipers around the world.
""It is bone-chilling. It is heartbreaking,"" Caroline Bruzelius, a professor of architectural history at Duke University, said of the blaze at the cathedral, built in the 12th and 13th centuries.
Related News Photos: Iconic Notre Dame Cathedral through history The fire's cause was not immediately known, but the French minister of the interior said late Monday that both towers of the cathedral were ""safe"" and the fire had weakened as they raced to save works of art.
Notre Dame, one of the world's most visited and photographed landmarks, is inextricable from French history, Bruzelius said. Napoleon was crowned there, and it has hosted other major ceremonies in the pulsing heart of the City of Lights.
It is also a global icon: the setting of Victor Hugo's classic novel ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame,"" the luminous backdrop for numerous films, the subject of a somber painting by Henri Matisse, and an inspiration to legions of tourists for much of modern history.

— Tyler Green (@TylerGreenBooks) April 15, 2019 It was Hugo's 1831 novel, a gothic romance about the deformed bell-ringer Quasimodo, that helped resurrect public interest in the cathedral, which had been badly desecrated amid the tumult of the French Revolution.
""The novel made people realize that the cathedral, which in some respects is the protagonist, was a national treasure,"" Bruzelius said. ""It came to represent Paris around the world, along with the Eiffel Tower.""

""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" helped inspire other popular works. Hugo's novel has been adapted into at least a dozen short and feature-length films, including a 1996 animated Disney movie of the same name.

— Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) April 15, 2019 The soul-stirring power of the cathedral itself, with its massive stained-glass windows and spire, made brief but memorable appearances in films such as ""The Aristocats,"" ""Ratatouille"" and Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris.""
Notre Dame's stunning French Gothic architecture is widely seen as an emblem of the style, a testament to both religious grandiosity and fine-grained sculptural detail.
""It is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture,"" the French government tourism site says. ""More than a historical monument, this cathedral is above all 'the House of God and the abode of men ... '""
Camille Pascal, a French writer and historian, said the mammoth blaze has already caused ""the destruction of invaluable heritage."" The spire ruined in the fire, like much of the cathedral itself , contained artifacts considered sacred to Roman Catholics, including a relic believed to be from Jesus Christ's crown of thorns.
""It's been 800 years that the cathedral watches over Paris,"" Pascal told French broadcaster BFMTV , with the cathedral's bells tolling for both ""happy and unfortunate events,"" such as the November 2015 Paris terror attacks.
The cathedral, built on the ruins of two earlier churches, has suffered all manner of damage and decay over the centuries — most violently during the French Revolution, when it was deconsecrated and saw many of its sculptures beheaded or smashed.
The cathedral has long been regarded as an architectural marvel. Martin Bureau / AFP - Getty Images file In the mid-19th century, the cathedral went through a major restoration under the French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In 1991, $19 million was set aside for a project to replace loose stones. In 2013, nine bronze bells were made to replace deteriorating artifacts.
Bruzelius, who has written extensively about the construction of the cathedral, said on Monday that she is intimately familiar with every nook and cranny of the structure.
""When they were cleaning and renovating the cathedral in the late 1970s and early '80s, I may have been the only person who went up the scaffolding over and over and over again,"" she said.
As part of her academic research, she measured the masonry, scrutinized the molding and studied the religious iconography, including the statues of saints. For her, Notre Dame is exalted ground.
""Why do tourists flock to it? Why do people come from around the world? Because it is just one of those monuments that is simply transcendental,"" Bruzelius said.

Religious conservatives grapple with how to respond to Buttigieg,www.nbcnews.com,Josh Lederman,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/religious-conservatives-grapple-how-respond-buttigieg-n994691,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Religious conservatives who have long been a reliable voting bloc for Republicans are grappling with a new challenge in Pete Buttigieg: how to respond to a Democratic presidential candidate who is leaning into the discussion about faith and its role in political life. For years, Democrats seeking inroads with religious voters have faced a major obstacle erected by evangelicals and other conservative Christians who have often portrayed resistance to socially conservative policies as attacks on people of faith. Adding to their challenge is the fact that few Democratic candidates have seemed comfortable emphasizing their personal faith, perhaps unsurprising given that their positions on abortion, LGBT rights and contraception differ from traditional religious orthodoxy.
Buttigieg, who formally declared his candidacy on Sunday, is flipping the traditional Democratic playbook by emphasizing how scripture informs his positions on those same issues, rather than shying away from the topic.
Using vocabulary familiar to religious conservatives, he has constructed his arguments in a way designed to allow voters to conceive of supporting him and his approach as affirming — rather than challenging — a strong belief in God and religious values.
“We have this totally warped idea of what Christianity should be like when it comes into the public sphere, and it’s mostly about exclusion,” Buttigieg said recently on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
“Which is the last thing that I imbibe when I take in scripture in church.”
Mayor Pete goes toe-to-toe with the Vice President on equality and faith April 12, 2019 07:10 He describes his own same-sex marriage in moral terms, saying that his union with his husband has made him a better man and brought him “closer to God.” His ascent to the national political stage has coincided with shifting political winds in the U.S. at least on gay rights, with polls showing that a majority of Catholics and white Protestants now support same-sex marriage, and moral condemnation of gays and lesbians is considered acceptable by a smaller segment of American society.
Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, rejected the notion that evangelicals in particular would be swayed by a candidate like Buttigieg. Still, he acknowledged that religious Americans who are more liberal would find his message particularly compelling.
“They perceive in him less hostility. They might not see things the way evangelicals do, but faith is still important to them,” Perkins said. But, he adds, when it comes to evangelicals, ""he's going to have a hard time because there's a disconnect between the talk about faith and actual biblical principles.”
In past elections, the notion of a disconnect was an easier argument to make. Then-Sen. Barack Obama, when he first ran for president in 2008, notoriously stumbled when remarks he made at a fundraiser were published in which he said Americans from small towns “cling to guns or religion” as manifestations of their economic anxieties. Hillary Clinton only rarely mentioned her own Methodist faith during her 2016 campaign, and her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, who is Jewish, said he wasn’t particularly religious.
Buttigieg, who was baptized Catholic and attended a Catholic high school but now attends an Episcopal church, has said that his faith does guide his behavior in public life, and that the lessons he draws from scripture are “about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers, which is another word for immigrants, and making sure that you’re focusing your effort on the poor.”
“Republicans do not have a viable successful playbook for dealing with Democrats that are willing and able to make a positive case around faith, and that is what Buttigieg has done pretty consistently,” said Michael Wear, who was the faith outreach director for Obama’s 2012 campaign and author of ""Reclaiming Hope.”
“He hasn’t gone negative. Most of the time when he talks about faith it’s the positive things in his life and the positive vision it gives him for governing,"" Wear said. ""It’s left Republicans pretty flat-footed.""
The uncertainty about how to speak about Buttigieg and his candidacy has played out in religious conservative circles and on the internet with increasing urgency as Buttigieg has surged in the polls and criticized Vice President Mike Pence for supporting religious liberty bills that limited LGBT rights. Pence and many supporters responded by accusing Buttigieg of attacking Pence’s faith.
The emerging strategy for responding to Buttigieg centers on emphasizing his positions on specific issues that remain a litmus test for many conservative voters, most notably abortion and gay marriage.
Erick Erickson, an evangelical radio host and conservative writer, posited on his blog The Resurgent that Buttigieg “apparently thinks Jesus would be ok with bestiality.” He based that on the logic that Jesus never addressed bestiality, and that Buttigieg has defended his support for abortion rights by pointing out that Jesus never discussed abortion. In another post he took aim at Buttigieg’s religious fidelity, arguing that since he’s Episcopalian, “he might not actually understand Christianity more than superficially.”
And after Buttigieg accused evangelicals of hypocrisy for backing Trump despite personal behavior that would make many churchgoers cringe, Christian writer Michael Brown wrote on the anti-abortion site LifeSiteNews that it was “absurd” for a “professing Christian and practicing homosexual” to point fingers at others.
“As an out-and-proud gay man, Buttigieg must discard the entire testimony of Scripture, since every single reference to homosexual practice in the Bible is condemnatory, without a single positive, homo-sex affirming statement of any kind,” he wrote.
Buttigieg: President Trump's use of religion may be 'cynical' April 7, 2019 01:16 Buttigieg’s biggest challenge with religious conservatives may be his support for abortion rights, which are still opposed by majorities of U.S. evangelicals, Baptists and Mormons, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey . The South Bend mayor told the Rev. Edward Beck, a Roman Catholic author, in a CNN interview this month that he doesn’t see “how my intervention as a government official, making rules about what she can and can't do, is going to help.”
Bob Vander Plaats, a prominent Iowa political activist and president of the group The Family Leader, said he and other social conservatives welcome the nascent focus on faith and religion in the 2020 conversation. He said when it comes to casting votes, religious conservatives would find Buttigieg’s policy positions simply untenable.
“Donald Trump will stand up for the sanctity of human life and the sacredness of life and the unborn child. And Pete Buttigieg and others will say, ‘No, I'm OK with abortion on demand, and even maybe a born-alive bill,’ which is completely contrary to the Christian faith,” Vander Plaats told NBC News.
He added: “That's the opportunity for the conversation, because once we peel back that onion, it'll be very, very clear: There is nothing in the scriptures that back gay marriage, there's nothing in the scriptures that would back embracing a gay lifestyle.”
Democrats seeking to peel away religious voters have significant ground to make up. In 2017, Pew found that the Republican advantage has only grown in recent years among evangelicals, with 77 percent of white evangelicals either identifying as Republicans or leaning in that direction. White Catholic voters and Mormons also leaned Republican by clear majorities.

Notre Dame fire: World mourns destruction at Paris cathedral,www.nbcnews.com,Doha Madani,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/notre-dame-fire-world-mourns-destruction-paris-cathedral-n994716,"PARIS — All around the world, people were united in grief and shock as a fire engulfed the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in the heart of Paris, with billowing smoke seen from miles away from the French capital's center. Hundreds gathered outside the cathedral, many in tears, as flames tore through the beloved building, causing the roof to collapse. French President Emmanuel Macron canceled a scheduled speech Monday to deal with the ongoing fire.
""Our Lady of Paris is in flames,"" Macron said on Twitter . ""Emotion for the whole nation. A thought for all Catholics and for all French. Like all our countrymen, I'm sad tonight to see this part of us burn.""
Nicolas Marang, 47, has lived in Paris for more than 25 years and took video as Notre Dame's spire collapsed amid the raging fire. He told NBC News he was running along the Seine River when he saw the smoke, which looked like a ""dark smog,"" coming from the Notre Dame.
The scene outside the cathedral was ""confusing and devastating,"" according to Marang.
""Something just collapsed inside me,"" he said. "" One of the worst things I've ever seen.""
Smoke rises from the Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris on April 15, 2019. Francois Guillot / AFP - Getty Images David Kang, 38, said he was on his way home when he passed by the Notre Dame and noticed the flames. People stopped all around, in shock, as they witnessed the landmark's destruction.
""It was an emotional experience. I see it every day on my way to home, it was so sad,"" Kang said. ""I don’t remember something like this ever happening. Notre Dame is the center of Paris.""
Audrey Edwards, 71, an American who retired to Paris in 2017, said she saw the smoke from her apartment window.
""I’m not a particularly religious person. Notre Dame is a masterpiece architecturally, and as a real estate broker, I started to tear up because it’s such a magnificent structure, aesthetically speaking,"" she said.
Edwards lived in Brooklyn and related the experience of seeing the plumes of smoke Monday to the images of the Twin Towers collapsing in lower Manhattan on 9/11.
""These are the things that you think are going to be eternal, but of course, nothing is,"" she said.
Notre Dame fire: Spire collapse like watching 'dagger go through the heart of Paris' April 15, 2019 02:14 University of Michigan student Madeline Boersma is living in Paris while she studies abroad at Sciences Po. Boersma, 20, said she was headed home from class but circled back to see the fire.
""Just walking down the street, you see it all the time,"" Boersma said. ""As I was walking up here I thought, 'I was just walking here three weeks ago and it was so normal.' Today I'm here and everyone is heartbroken.""
Gabriella Pilet, an Argentinean who has lived in Paris for 20 years, stood near the Seine and sang the Hail Mary prayer in French as the cathedral burned.
""I came here to honor this place,"" Pilet said. ""For me, it’s a symbol of gathering. Everyone, even if you’re not a Christian, comes here to gather.""
Pilet said she regrets never going up to the roof of the church as she had always planned.
""All the way at the end that was my favorite thing, a statue of the Virgin Mary,"" Pilet said. ""Several years ago after the terrorist attacks, they stopped you from visiting some places. I was very upset.""
People pray as the Notre Dame cathedral burns in Paris on April 15, 2019. Christophe Ena / AP President Donald Trump called the Notre Dame one of the ""great treasures of the world"" during an economic roundtable event in Minnesota.
The cathedral is ""beyond countries, that's beyond anything, that’s part of our growing up, it’s a part of our culture, it’s a part of our lives,"" Trump said.
Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, tweeted Monday that he prayed for the Paris landmark after hearing of the fire.
""I just went next door to our own beloved Cathedral, Saint Patrick’s, to ask the intercession of Notre Dame, our Lady, for the Cathedral at the heart of Paris, and of civilization, now in flames! God preserve this splendid house of prayer, and protect those battling the blaze,"" Dolan wrote.
The Vatican also issued a statement about the fire.
""The Holy See has seen with shock and sadness the news of the terrible fire that has devastated the Cathedral of #NotreDame, symbol of Christianity in France and in the world,"" the religious epicenter said.
Related News Paris weeps as Notre Dame Cathedral burns Pastor Miguel Castellanos of the Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal, Canada, tweeted his sympathies to those suffering and offered prayers to ""everyone who will have to work hard to rebuild an international treasure.""
At least 400 firefighters were on the scene, desperately trying to douse the flames that were destroying one of France's most treasured sites.
The New York Fire Department released a statement Monday expressing sympathy with the Paris Fire Brigade as they fought to quell the inferno.
""Images of Notre Dame in flames are an awful sight to behold,"" the agency said. ""The thoughts of the FDNY are with the members of @PompiersParis as they bravely battle this terrible fire in one of the world’s most beautiful and historic houses of worship.""
Former President Barack Obama sent out a message of hope alongside a photo of him with his daughters, Sasha and Malia, lighting candles at the cathedral.
""It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can,"" Obama said.

""Notre Dame is a symbol of our ability as human beings to unite for a higher purpose — to build breathtaking spaces for worship that no one person could have built on their own,"" Clinton said. ""I wish France strength and shared purpose as they grieve and rebuild.""
On social media, people across the world began recounting their experiences and appreciation of the cathedral's beauty. One Twitter user said that he first visited the church at 7 years old.
""It's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen, and I'd visit the cathedral each time I was in Paris just to be moved and astonished. This is heartbreaking,"" he wrote.

Aretha Franklin wins posthumous 2019 Pulitzer Prize,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/aretha-franklin-wins-posthumous-2019-pulitzer-prize-n994766,"Aretha Franklin is still getting R-E-S-P-E-C-T after death: The Queen of Soul received the Pulitzer Prize Special Citation honor Monday, becoming the first individual woman to earn a special citation prize since the honor was first awarded in 1930. The Pulitzer board said the award was given to Franklin for her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades.
Franklin died on Aug. 16 at her home in Detroit from pancreatic cancer at age 76.
The superstar musician was the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when she entered the prestigious organization in 1987.
The Pulitzer board most recently awarded a special citation prize in 2010 to Hank Williams, the country music legend who died in 1953. From the arts world, other recipients include Duke Ellington, Bob Dylan, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, George Gershwin, Ray Bradbury, William Schuman, Milton Babbitt, Scott Joplin, Roger Sessions, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.
Franklin's inclusion into the exclusive club re-confirms the impact her music — and voice — had and continues to have on the world.
Franklin became a cultural icon and genius of American song, considered by many to be the greatest popular vocalist of her time. Her voice transcended age, category and her own life.
She was professional singer and accomplished pianist by her late teens and a superstar by her mid-20s. Raised in Detroit, she recorded hundreds of tracks and had dozens of hits over the span of a half century, including 20 that reached No. 1 on the R&B charts.
But her reputation was defined by an extraordinary run of Top 10 smashes in the late 1960s, from the morning-after bliss of ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,"" to the wised-up ""Chain of Fools"" to her unstoppable call for ""Respect,"" transforming Otis Redding's song into a classic worldwide anthem — especially for the feminist and civil rights movements — making it one of the most recognizable and heard songs of all-time.
She sold millions of albums and won countless awards, including 18 Grammys, the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
She performed at the inaugurations of Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and even sang at the funeral for civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and at the dedication of Martin Luther King Jr's memorial.
Rolling Stone ranked Franklin No.1 on its list of the Top 100 singers and she was also named one of the 20 most important entertainers of the 20th century by Time magazine, which celebrated her ""mezzo-soprano, the gospel growls, the throaty howls, the girlish vocal tickles, the swoops, the dives, the blue-sky high notes, the blue-sea low notes. Female vocalists don't get the credit as innovators that male instrumentalists do. They should. Franklin has mastered her instrument as surely as John Coltrane mastered his sax.""
Franklin was born in Memphis, Tennessee, though her family moved to Buffalo, New York, and then settled in Detroit. She grew up singing in the church alongside her father Rev. C.L. Franklin, a prominent Baptist minister who recorded dozens of albums of sermons and music. She joined him on tour and she released a gospel album in 1956. Four years later, she signed with Columbia Records and when her contract ran out in 1966, she joined Atlantic Records.
That's when she blazed the pop and R&B charts with a string of hits, including ""Respect,"" ''I Say a Little Prayer,"" ''Think,"" ''Chain of Fools,"" ''Day Dreaming,"" ''(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You've Been Gone,"" ''Rock Steady"" and ""Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do).""
Her Grammy-winning album, ""Amazing Grace,"" is one of the seminal albums in not only Franklin's discography, but the canon of American pop music. It is the basis for the recently released concert film ""Amazing Grace,"" filmed over two sessions in January 1972 at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in the Watts section of Los Angeles.

Meet the human-friendly robot that could pave the way for household bots,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/meet-two-armed-robot-could-pave-way-household-bots-ncna994671,"Researchers have created a robot that they say could bring a softer touch to automation. Dubbed Blue, the two-armed bot is designed to work alongside humans and be cheap enough not to break the bank. For now, it’s a research tool. But researchers California, Berkeley — who created Blue — say its human-friendly design and artificial intelligence capabilities could pave the way for household robots that help out with domestic tasks such as cleaning, folding laundry and even making coffee.
“We wanted to create a new robot that is right for the AI age rather than for the high-precision, sub-millimeter, factory automation age,” Pieter Abbeel, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Berkeley and the leader of the research team that built the robot, said in a written statement.
The robots Abbeel references are widely used in manufacturing, but they can be risky for humans who get in the way. Between 1992 and 2015, 61 Americans died from injuries sustained in robot-related accidents, according to the Center for Occupational Robotics Research of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
Related Technology Technology Why robotic pets may be the next big thing in dementia care That’s doubly true for robots that use deep reinforcement learning, a technique in which machines try a task over and over again until they get it right. Mistakes made by a big, powerful industrial robot can be dangerous for human and machine alike. A robot that learns by trial and error needs a gentler touch — especially in households with children and pets.
How do you make a robot that performs useful household tasks without putting others at risk? Abbeel and his team designed Blue so that it responds to touch, varying the force it exerts according to the force exerted on it. In a video showcasing Blue’s abilities , the robot gives way immediately when nudged by a human.
Blue’s design is softer than those of some industrial bots. Its components are covered in curved plastic shells, with few sharp edges. Its arms, shaped roughly like a human’s, end in small claw-shaped grippers. A camera mounted between the arms like a tiny head allows the bot to take in its surroundings.
Blue isn’t the first sensitive robot. But with total manufacturing costs of less than $5,000, it may be one of the cheapest. Industrial robotic arms can cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Right now, Blue can’t do too much on its own. When it folds a towel, arranges flowers in a vase and makes coffee in the video, it’s being piloted by a researcher using a virtual reality headset . And to keep costs down, it’s not as strong or precise as its industrial brethren. Selma Šabanović, an expert in human-robot interaction at Indiana University who wasn’t involved in the research, said the arm wasn't quite ready to take over your chores.
“[Blue] is more for use by the robotics community as a research tool than directly for home users,” she said in an email. Šabanović added that Blue’s low price tag will make it more accessible for researchers and teachers, possibly leading to more and better research on domestic robots.
Laurel Riek, a professor of computer science and emergency medicine California, San Diego, said Blue could be useful to other researchers working on robots that can cook, clean and even collaborate with humans.
In the meantime, it looks like we’ll be doing our own laundry.

Will Meghan Markle's and Prince Harry's baby have to pay U.S. taxes?,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/taxes/will-meghan-markle-s-prince-harry-s-baby-have-pay-n994731,"Meghan Markle's and Prince Harry’s baby will be born into privilege as a member of the British royal family, but he or she will also have the rights of an American citizen. And with that comes the duty of filing an annual tax return with the Internal Revenue Service, an obligation Americans born abroad must meet, even if they’ve never lived in the United States.
“If you are an American citizen, you owe U.S. tax no matter what,” said Steve Dean, faculty director of the Graduate Tax Program at The New York University School of Law.
Under U.S. law, an American parent automatically passes on citizenship to a child born abroad, as long as the parent has lived in the U.S. at some point over the past five years. In the case of the royal baby, it’s likely he or she will be eligible for an American passport.
The United States is one of the only countries in the world that taxes nonresident citizens. That means that even the Duchess of Sussex had to file a tax return with the IRS this year, despite being a member of the British royal family and living thousands of miles away.
“The U.S. is exceptionally broad in its idea of citizenship taxation,” said Michelle Lyon Drumbl, a clinical professor of law and director at Washington & Lee University School of Law’s Tax Clinic.
An estimated 8.7 million Americans, excluding members of the military, live overseas in 160-plus countries, according to the Association of Americans Resident Overseas. Those Americans have the compliance burden of filing a tax return, but most of them will be exempt from paying extra taxes to the IRS, due to the foreign earned income tax exclusion. This allows people who earn regular-sized incomes to not have to pay additional taxes if they are not living in the U.S. They simply have to account for it.
“For most people it’s not so much of a big issue, but if you’re vastly wealthy, you’d have a lot to worry about filing obligations,” Dean said. While the royal baby theoretically wouldn’t have to file a tax return next year, any investment in his or her name could potentially be within the reach of the IRS.
And if the sting of being hit with a massive tax liability isn’t enough, Americans abroad are also expected to prepare their own tax bill. Most countries tell each citizen what they owe, but in the U.S., the onus is on the taxpayer to calculate his or her own bill and send the appropriate payment to the government.
Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and the United Kingdom's foreign secretary, caught the attention of the IRS in 2014 after he sold his house in London for a profit. Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to British parents, but moved back to the U.K. as a young child.
Johnson ultimately paid the tax bill, which he called “absolutely outrageous” and renounced his U.S. citizenship. But in the land of the free, nothing comes for free. The price to renounce U.S. citizenship comes to $2,350, one of the highest in the world.

Nurses Who Vaccinate: Anti-vaccine myth dispeller talks with Lester Holt,www.nbcnews.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/nurses-who-vaccinate-anti-vaccine-myth-dispeller-talks-lester-holt-n994736,"Melody Anne Butler, a registered nurse and infection preventionist at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center on Long Island, New York, had mixed feelings about vaccines until she was pregnant with her third son during the deadly H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. The mother of four was concerned for her baby's safety, but also overwhelmed by scary reports circulating online about vaccine safety. After talking with her clinical nurse educator about pseudoscience and vaccine misinformation on the internet, Butler decided to get her children vaccinated.
She was shocked that nurses were involved in spreading vaccine myths online. That led to Butler founding Nurses Who Vaccinate , a nonprofit that provides nurses and health care professionals with current, evidence-based information on the benefits of immunizations and current recommendations. But her early encounters with nurses who were opposed to vaccines were frustrating.
""They did not want to hear what I had to say,"" Butler told NBC News anchor Lester Holt. ""It was my first encounter with very vile anti-vaccinators. I was really taken back because these were fellow nurses and they were not receptive to the information.""
Amid the ongoing measles outbreaks in the U.S ., Butler discussed vaccine misinformation and common myths with Holt.
Holt: Do you change minds?
Butler: Yes, but it's not an overnight thing. I establish a relationship with these people. They know they can come to me with their questions and concerns because I was one of them. I understand you can be taken for a ride. I understand how susceptible people can be, even those who are college educated.
Related Health Measles outbreak: How doctors can change anti-vaccine minds Holt: Are there more of them [people resistant to vaccines] than there are of you online, in social media? Are you outnumbered?
Butler: Vaccinating is the norm. However, just like when we go to the bathroom and wash our hands, we don't come out and tell everyone every single time. Most people do vaccinate , so it's really important that more people start telling everyone.
Holt: But in terms of social media, are there more folks spreading false messages on social media than there are the facts?
Butler: There are not more people, but sometimes they are the loudest and they tend to go viral because a lot of their stories can be quite sad at times, or their points come across as very scary. It's a lot easier to scare someone than it is to unscare them.
Holt: What are the top inaccuracies or myths about vaccines?
Butler: The most frequent questions I get are, can I give my child all these vaccines at the same time? Should I wait to give these vaccines? And do vaccines cause autism?
Holt: And do they cause autism?
Butler: Absolutely not. We have amazing evidence and studies are constantly coming out. There was amazing meta-analysis coming out from Denmark that once again showed evidence-based research showing that children who receive the MMR vaccine do not have an increased risk of autism .
Holt: What are the other myths out there?
Butler: One of the common questions: 'Is aluminum present in there? I heard heavy metals could be devastating to children.'
And what I usually tell them, is that there's more aluminum present in breast milk than there is in the vaccine your child's going to get. Aluminum is a very abundant resource on earth. We cook with aluminum. Your child's going to come into contact with it on a greater level outside vaccines.
Holt: You mentioned that you started this based on other nurses who were putting out false information. When I go on social media and look at the anti-vaxxer community, a lot of it is based on medical professionals, doctors, and nurses who are promoting some of these ideas. Does that concern you?
Butler: It does concern me when people are using the medical profession as a way to promote misinformation. But, once again, if you look at the CDC, New York State Department of Health — valuable, accurate resources — these claims are very easily debunked.
It just takes a lot of time and it takes a one-on-one conversation to go through some of these concerns and myths.
Holt: No matter where you stand in this, people love their children and they want the best for their children. So, how do you approach that conversation?
Butler: It's a framework conversation, called a case method. It's very simple. It really helps me to kind of focus my message and also acknowledge the patient's fear.
Holt: How do you take emotion out of this conversation?
Butler: You don't. Because I'm passionate about this — I'm doing this because of emotion.

"Julián Castro raises $1.1 million in first quarter, lagging behind other 2020 contenders",www.nbcnews.com,Suzanne Gamboa,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/juli-n-castro-raises-1-1-million-first-quarter-lagging-n994826,"Julián Castro, one of the earliest candidates to jump into the Democratic presidential primary race, raised more than $1.1 million in the first quarter of his campaign — big money, but millions behind the field's leaders. Castro's staff announced the fundraising total on Monday, the deadline for filing for the many candidates in the race to be the party's nominee for president. Other candidates also have been announcing their first quarter hauls and thus far, Castro's total — $2 million with money from his exploratory committee added in — is dwarfed by the numbers several of his competitors have announced.
Although Castro lags far behind several candidates, his campaign manager Maya Rupert said in a statement that the campaign met its internal goals for the year's first three months and “smashed” its fundraising goal in April's first two weeks, raising an additional $572,000 — more than half the total for the first quarter that ended March 31.
“We’re just getting started and are rapidly building momentum,” Rupert said.
Castro, who has refused to accept contributions from political action committees, has accumulated 50,000 unique donors since December 2018. Their contributions have averaged $32 per donation.
The number of unique donors is important because of the Democratic National Committee’s requirements to make the stage for the first debate. The debate, hosted by NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo , is scheduled for June 26 and 27 in Miami.
To qualify for the stage, candidates have to receive at least 1 percent of support in three DNC-approved polls or raise money from at least 65,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 200 unique donors per state in at least 20 states.
Monday was the deadline for candidates to file their fundraising reports, which the Castro campaign said it would meet.
Castro has struggled to be seen as one of the leading candidates in the crowded Democratic field since he first announced his campaign on Jan. 12.
Unlike some of the other contenders, he has not been in the national spotlight since President Barack Obama left the White House.
Castro served as Obama's secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Before that, he was mayor of San Antonio, the nation’s seventh largest city, and was the youngest person elected to its city council.
He has seen some spike in interest in his candidacy since releasing his immigration plan earlier this month, and after some high-profile national interviews, including with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow .
His immigration plan was the first detailed plan to be released by any of the candidates and called for treating entry to the U.S. without authorization as a civil, rather than criminal, violation , among other things.
Castro: Trump administration 'sloppiest' on security matters April 3, 2019 07:01 The campaign also has also stepped up its fundraising efforts, bringing out the big guns — Castro’s mother Rosie Castro — in mid-March.
Also on Monday, the campaign announced it added Julia Ager, former chief digital officer for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as senior adviser for digital.
The campaign has spent $625,000 and had $677,000 cash on hand as of March 31, 2019.

SUBSCRIBE April 15, 2019, 9:23 PM GMT / Updated April 15, 2019, 10:45 PM GMT By Associated Press MILWAUKEE — A 17-year-old told investigators that he fatally shot his grandparents and was planning to cause harm at his eastern Wisconsin high school, police said Monday. Police officers responding to a 911 call for assistance found the bodies of 74-year-old Dennis Kraus and 73-year-old Letha Kraus at their home in Grand Chute about 11:30 a.m. Sunday, Officer Travis Waas said. He declined to release details of the call. Police arrested their grandson, Alexander M. Kraus at the couple's home, Waas said. Kraus, who lives in nearby Neenah, admitted that he shot the couple, Waas said. Waus declined to comment on the nature of Kraus' plans at his school or the severity of the threat. Police also released no information on why the couple was shot. Kraus was being held in the Outagamie County Jail and has not yet been charged. Police said in a news release that he could be charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Each charge would carry a life sentence. An initial court appearance was set for Tuesday afternoon. Wass said he didn't know whether Kraus had an attorney who could comment on the allegations. Online court records didn't list his case as of Monday afternoon. Grand Chute, a city of 22,000, lies about 110 miles (177 kilometers) northwest of Milwaukee. Neenah, home to 26,000, is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Grand Chute. Wisconsin is one of six states that treat 17-year-olds as adults in the criminal justice system. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has included provisions in his state budget that would move 17-year-olds back into juvenile court. Alexander M. Kraus Outagamie County Sheriff / via AP A long gun believed to have been used in the crime was recovered at the grandparents' house, Waas said. Kraus also told investigators about his plan to cause harm at Neenah High School, where he was a junior, Waas said. He said investigators recovered documentation related to that plan. He said more details would be included in charging documents Tuesday. The school district released a statement Monday saying police determined there was no danger to students and staff at the high school and that the school day would proceed as normal. Additional counselors were available to students and there was an extra police presence at the high school, the district said."

Bill Weld announced Monday he was officially running for president on the GOP line — making him the first Republican to challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 primaries. ""America deserves better,"" Weld's campaign announcement video said, before showing video clips of Trump mocking John McCain, imitating a disabled reporter, praising Wikileaks and the notorious ""Access Hollywood"" tape where he was caught on audio making inappropriate comments about women.
""It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag. It is time to return to the principles of Lincoln — equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. There is no greater cause on earth than to preserve what truly makes America great. I am ready to lead that fight,"" Weld said in a statement.

The announcement video noted that Weld was appointed a U.S. attorney by then-President Ronald Reagan, and that he successfully battled tough odds when he was elected as a Republican governor in a heavily Democratic state. The Harvard Law School graduate served two terms as governor of Massachusetts.
Weld, 73, has run on a ticket against Trump before — he was the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee in 2016, when former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson led the party's ticket. They got just more than 3 percent of the vote.
Bill Weld: The case for my run is there to be made April 16, 2019 08:24 He changed his registration back to the GOP after the election, and announced he was forming an exploratory committee in New Hampshire in February.
""I'm here because I think our country is in grave peril,"" he said then. ""I cannot sit quietly on the sidelines any longer.""
The Trump campaign had no comment and referred reporters to a statement from the Republican National Committee.
""President Trump enjoys unprecedented support among Republicans. He has already delivered a long list of incredible accomplishments for conservatives and the country,"" an RNC spokesperson said. ""The RNC and the Republican Party are firmly behind the president. Any effort to challenge the president’s nomination is bound to go absolutely nowhere.""

The film, which earned nearly $67 million worldwide, was based on Becky Albertalli’s young adult novel “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.”
“As I’m sure you might have heard, we’re getting a Love, Simon spinoff series on the new Disney+ service!” Albertalli wrote on Twitter. “I’m extremely excited and I can’t say much.”
Though Albertalli did not share many details surrounding the project, she did confirm that the series will not be an adaptation of her book “Leah on the Offbeat” — the sequel to “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda” — but rather a different story “set in the world of Simon.”

'We will rebuild': What we know about the fire at Notre Dame of Paris,www.nbcnews.com,Alex Johnson,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/we-will-rebuild-what-we-know-about-fire-notre-dame-n994851,"The full devastation of the mammoth fire at the Cathedral of Notre Dame of Paris on Monday remains to be tallied, but it's known to have destroyed the giant spire that housed some of Christendom's most sacred relics. French President Emmanuel Macron promised Monday night that ""we will rebuild"" the 850-year-old cathedral, one of the greatest monuments to Christianity in the world. Much remains unknown, including what caused the fire, but as firefighters and investigators sifted through the scene, answers to some questions emerged.
What is the Cathedral of Notre Dame of Paris? The Paris cathedral — whose name means ""Our Lady of Paris"" — is one of seven cathedrals of Notre Dame in France and by far the most famous. Built on the Île de la Cité in the Seine beginning in the 1160s, it is an essential component of French identity and the home to irreplaceable works of art and religious significance, attracting more than 14 million visitors a year.
The 850-year history that went up in smoke in the Notre Dame fire April 15, 2019 01:56 The cathedral, which replaced an earlier basilica under the supervision of King Louis VII and Maurice de Sully, who became bishop of Paris in 1160, has survived frequent modifications, wars, revolutions and renovations — sometimes just barely.
Much of the cathedral was damaged and many of its treasures were destroyed during the French Revolution, and in 1793, four years in to the revolution, it was rededicated to the Cult of Reason, with the Goddess of Liberty replacing the Virgin Mary on altars.
Napoleon restored the cathedral to the Roman Catholic Church in 1801, and he was crowned emperor there in 1804. But upkeep of the structure was minimal, leading to Victor Hugo's depiction of the cathedral as a decrepit, barely functioning edifice in his 1831 novel, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" King Louis Philippe didn't order its full restoration until 13 years later.
Just last year, the Archdiocese of Paris launched what it called an urgent fundraising appeal to save the cathedral, which it said was again starting to crumble.
Related News Iconic Notre Dame Cathedral through history What caused the fire? No cause had been determined Monday night, but the Paris prosecutor's office said it had ruled out arson and terrorism.
Speculation centered on the possibility that the fire may have been related to the years-long renovation project , which included the spire, but reports later emerged that no work was under way when the fire broke out at about 6:50 p.m. local time, after the end of the workday.

What was at risk? Among the priceless relics that was saved, according to the mayor of Paris, was the Holy Crown of Thorns, which the Roman Catholic Church says was placed on Jesus' head before his crucifixion. Historians have called it the cathedral's equivalent of the crown jewels.

Mayor Anne Hidalgo said emergency responders also formed a human chain to salvage the Tunic of Saint Louis worn by King Louis IX during the Crusades, along with ""several other major works.""
Michel Picaud, a senior adviser to Friends of Notre Dame, the organization overseeing reconstruction efforts at the cathedral, told NBC News that while the roof of the complex was destroyed, the flames didn't appear to have spread to the lower part of church, likely saving its revered 8,000-pipe Great Organ and its three famous stained-glass rose windows, which date to the 13th century.
Related News Notre Dame Cathedral fire ravages 'transcendental' cultural treasure Twelve 10-foot-tall statues representing the apostles and four others representing Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are also safe. They were recently removed from atop the church as part of the ongoing renovations.
In addition to the roof and the spire, authorities said flames spread to one of the cathedral's two rectangular towers. But Jean-Claude Gallet, the fire chief of Paris, said: ""We now consider that the main structure of Notre Dame has been saved and preserved.""
How did the world react? In a statement, the Vatican called Notre Dame of Paris ""a symbol of Christianity in France and across the world,"" saying it was shocked and saddened by the fire. It thanked the estimated 500 firefighters who responded and called for prayers for ""all those who are doing everything possible to face this dramatic situation.""

"Notre Dame 'will rise again' after fire, but the restoration will be 'painstaking,' experts say",www.nbcnews.com,Tim Stelloh,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/notre-dame-will-rise-again-after-fire-restoration-will-be-n994856,"French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild after a massive fire tore through the centuries-old church on Monday. Restoring the iconic cathedral would likely be complicated, lengthy and expensive, experts said.
But they also appeared optimistic that such a rebirth is possible.
Jonathan Foyle, an architectural historian and author, said a critical part of the restoration process will be to assess how damaged Notre Dame’s massive stone vaults were by the blaze. Extreme temperatures can cause calcination — a process that turns stone into powder, he said.
Watch: Notre Dame spire collapses in fire April 15, 2019 01:27 Then, there’s the possible damage caused by firefighters trying to extinguish the blaze: Dumping cold water on red hot stone can cause it to shatter and crack, Foyle said.
“It’s gone through a very complex trauma,” he said. “You’re going to need months to figure out whether it is safe enough to stay standing.”
Foyle said there are French architects trained in medieval building techniques that would be up to the task of restoring this “pioneering giant of Gothic cathedrals.”
“This building has been through the French Revolution, the Huguenots and two world wars,” he said. “I have no doubt it will rise again.”
Related World news Parisians grieve, pay their respects to Notre Dame If the stones were badly ""baked"" during the blaze that may mean the vaulted roof and surrounding walls have to be dismantled, according to Paul Binski a professor of the history of medieval art at the U.K.'s Cambridge University.
""Stone doesn't burn but it bakes, so my estimation is that they will have to take the entire vaulting system of the church down because it simply will not be safe,"" said Binski, who specializes in the art and architecture of Western Europe in the Gothic period. ""That may involve taking the upper walls down, to a certain degree, depending on the extent of the damage.""
The rebuilding process could take two decades of painstaking work and restructuring, said Emily Guerry, a professor of medieval European history at Britain's University of Kent.
“The cost will be unimaginably high, but it’s worth every penny,” Guerry said, adding that the “delicate” work required to restore the cathedral to its original Gothic style will be France’s largest and most important renovation project for the next 20 years.
Annabelle Radcliffe-Trenner, a principal at Historic Building Architects in New Jersey, called the fire “devastating” but also believed that the cathedral could be resurrected.
She pointed to massive fires at St. Bernard’s Episcopal Church, a Gothic-style structure in New Jersey that she was involved in rebuilding, and Windsor Castle, the iconic royal residence in Berkshire, England, that burned in 1992.
The castle’s chapel was badly damaged, she said, “but it’s been fully restored — which you could tell from the big wedding last year. Restoration can be done; it’s just painstaking work.”
 's treasures rescued from devastating blaze April 16, 2019 01:01 She said experts would ""go in slowly, peeling back the damage safely and getting people to evaluate” what was lost and what can be saved.
“The key is getting in very quickly to stabilize things like stained glass,” she said.
Any actual rebuilding will take “years and years and years,” Radcliffe-Trenner said.
Foyle estimated that it will cost tens of millions of dollars and require an army of stone masons, glaziers, plumbers and carpenters.
Still, such a massive project could signal a “rebirth,” he said.
“In a way, projects like Windsor Castle — they look disastrous, and they are, but they give life to traditional trades,” he said. “Sometimes they can have a silver lining.”

Matt Rourke / AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE Oct. 30, 2018, 4:00 PM GMT By Phil McCausland PITTSBURGH — For the survivors of the Holocaust, the massacre at a synagogue here reminded them of some of the darkest memories a person could ever recall. Shulamit Bastacky is one of the hidden Jewish children who escaped the terrors of the Holocaust, and her neighbor, Melvin Wax, 86, is among the 1 1 people who were shot and killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue by a man with anti-Semitic views. Bastacky will celebrate her 55th anniversary in the United States next week, more than seven decades after she spent three years living in a Catholic nun's basement in Lithuania, in an attempt to hide from the Nazis. That violence and anti-Semitism like this could occur in this country is unthinkable to Bastacky. “I never ever expected this in America: the country of liberty, of freedom of speech, of freedom of religion,” Bastacky said. “When we came to this moment, it was absolutely horrific — beyond description. It almost made me sick. When a person goes to a place of worship, whether it’s a synagogue or a church or a mosque, you come in peace and leave respectfully.” Pittsburgh synagogue massacre the latest in rise of anti-semitic incidents across the U.S. Oct. 29, 2018 01:30 There are many Holocaust survivors who chose to settle here in Pittsburgh. The neighborhood Squirrel Hill, where Tree of Life Synagogue is located, is considered the backbone of the Jewish community in the city. Survivors here speak regularly to the community about hate speech and their experiences during the Holocaust. “These people were murdered, they were killed, because they were Jews,” Bastacky said. “This happened because one man had so much hate in him, but also because anti-Semitism is rising in America.” Judah Samet, 80, another Holocaust survivor who is a member of Tree of Life Synagogue, told the Washington Post that he showed up to Saturday's ceremony late, missing the tragic shooting by four minutes. He connected that man's anti-Semitism to his experience during the Holocaust. “I survived the second time yesterday,” he told the newspaper on Sunday, saying that it had renewed his commitment to telling his story. After Saturday’s attack, Bastacky said she is also committed to educating as many young people as she can about the Holocaust and its causes. Forgetting the past is not an option, she said. Holocaust survivor Shulamit Bastacky in the lobby of her apartment building in Pittsburgh on Oct. 29, 2018. Allen G. Breed / AP That’s why she and many other survivors work with the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh to speak to schools and civic groups throughout western Pennsylvania about the horrors of the Holocaust. People need to learn to not be a victim, victimizer or just a bystander, she Bastacky said. “There’s an incredible value of having a survivor here who could tell us about how he or she felt knowing what happened on Saturday, to encourage us to stay positive and fight against hate,” said Dr. Lauren Bairnsfather, the director of the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh . On Saturday, the center brought a guest speaker and Holocaust survivor to speak across the street from the Tree of Life Synagogue. The center had made plans in January with Magda Brown, 91, a survivor, to speak at Chatham University. Brown found out when she boarded the plane from her home in Chicago that 11 Jews were killed while practicing their religion. It’s an anti-Semitism that is all too familiar to Brown. That is why she refused to cancel the event, she said, quoting the founding principle of the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center: “Remember the past, transform the future.” Survivor Stories: Victim of JCC attack had to come to grips with being shot 'because I was Jewish' Sept. 18, 2018 03:20 Brown and her family were removed from their home in Hungary and pushed into crowded train cars headed for Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1944. When they arrived, Brown’s parents, aunts, uncles and cousins were immediately taken to the gas chambers. The Nazis who ran the camp shaved her head, took her belongings and tortured her for months at Auschwitz before sending her to a work camp where she handled dangerous chemicals to build German munitions. “It is all coming back — coming back like a flood,” Brown said. “I’ve been living in this country since 1946. I’ve been so appreciative of considering myself a proud, conscientious, voting American. I raised my children the proper American way, and I lead that kind of life. Unfortunately this kind of situation shakes you up because of my experiences. If I were to say I’m not worried, I would be lying.” Hungarian Jews arrive by train at the Auschwitz death camp, circa 1942. UniversalImagesGroup / Getty Images Brown escaped a death march to Buchenwald, another concentration camp, in March 1945. Two American soldiers later found her and several other prisoners hiding in a barn. This history, she said, is more important than ever. “Genocide does not happen from one minute to the next,” Brown said. “It builds gradually.” Brown said that this attack is not random and anti-Semitism has not disappeared. That is why Holocaust survivors, like her, emphasize their mantra of “never again.” “I experienced discrimination, I experienced Nazi terror in concentration camps, so needless to say I am talking to the reality,” Brown added. “It is very, very painful. I just kept hoping that something like this would never happen again.” Phil McCausland"

Jerry Brown signed a bill in 2018 adding lessons on Vietnamese-American refugees, the Cambodian genocide and the Hmong history. Members of LaoSD at a Lao boat racing festival. Courtesy of LaoSD March 14, 2019, 9:49 PM GMT By Lakshmi Gandhi A Laotian American community organization wants to add a new chapter into California's newly revamped history curriculum: Laotian history. The group Lao Advocacy Organization San Diego, better known as LaoSD, was formed in 2018 after then-California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill adding sections on the Vietnam War and the Vietnamese refugee experience to history books. That bill also added lessons on the Cambodian genocide and on the Hmong history, but LaoSD says those lessons lack mention of the contributions of Laotians and the history of Laos during the Vietnam War. “Laotians being left out of that curricula makes the bill incomplete,” Pida Kongphouthone, a member of LaoSD’s organizing committee, said. Related California passes textbook standards including 'comfort women,' Sikhs The move to include the story of Laotian Americans into textbooks is a personal one for Kongphouthone and other members of LaoSD. Born in a refugee camp in Thailand, he came to the United States at the age of two in 1980 with his family. “We went through that process of being children of immigrants, of refugees,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for us to communicate to our fellow Americans why Laotian Americans are here.” California has one of the largest Laotian American populations in the United States, with about 82,000 people of Laotian descent living in the state — 8,000 of them in San Diego County according to the Census Bureau estimates. But Kongphouthone said there is a concern that younger members of the Laotian community do not fully understand the history of Laos in the 1970s and the subsequent wave of immigration that followed because the Vietnam War has been too traumatic for older community members to discuss with younger generations. “Our elders, our parents our grandparents have [post-traumatic stress disorder] from their journey from escaping the war, from fleeing violence,” he said. “We are just beginning to talk about it.” In order to fill the gaps in terms of including Laotian history into the curriculum, LaoSD is lobbying members of the California Legislature to support Assembly Bill 1393, which was introduced in late February by San Diego Assemblywoman Shirley Weber. Members of LaoSD with California Assemblymember Shirley Weber, who authored a bill requiring Laotian-American history and cultural studies be included in California schools. Courtesy of LaoSD The bill would require the state’s Instructional Quality Commission, which develops and recommends curricula to the state Board of Education, to develop and submit a curriculum that incorporates the history of Laotian refugees. If the bill passes the Assembly, the group will then work to get it passed in the state Senate and get signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Ultimately, Kongphouthone said he and other organizers want California’s textbooks to reflect the full history of all Southeast Asian Americans. “Americans of Laotian descent are part of the American social fabric. We serve in the military, we work in entertainment and business, we volunteer, we are your neighbors, we are business owners,” he said. “That’s why it is important that not only is the history complete, but also to highlight the immigrant story of fellow Americans.” Follow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and Tumblr .

White House officials concerned about being exposed by Mueller report,www.nbcnews.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-officials-concerned-about-being-exposed-mueller-report-n994861,"WASHINGTON — Some of the more than one dozen current and former White House officials who cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller are worried that the version of his report expected to be made public on Thursday will expose them as the source of damaging information about , according to multiple witnesses in the investigation. Some of the officials and their lawyers have sought clarity from the Justice Department on whether the names of those who cooperated with Mueller’s team will be redacted or if the public report will be written in a way that makes it obvious who shared certain details of Trump’s actions that were part of the obstruction of justice probe, people familiar with the discussions said. But, they said, the Justice Department has refused to elaborate.
Mueller report release has White House officials concerned April 16, 2019 01:14 Of particular concern is how Trump — and his allies — will react if it appears to be clear precisely who shared information with Mueller, these people said.
“They got asked questions and told the truth, and now they’re worried the wrath will follow,” one former White House official said.
Some of those who spoke with Mueller's team, such as former White House counsel Don McGahn, witnessed Trump’s actions up close and were privy to key moments in the obstruction investigation and spent many hours with investigators.

One person close to the White House said there is “breakdown-level anxiety” among some current and former staffers who cooperated with the investigation at the direction of Trump’s legal team at the time.
There is also concern that new facts in the report could be disclosed that do not reflect favorably on the president, two people familiar with the discussions said.
“You have a whole bunch of former White House officials and current White House officials, but especially former White House officials, who were told to cooperate,” the former White House official said. “So people went and did that, and now the uncertainty is just how much of that information is going to be in that report and how identifiable to individuals is it going to be. And nobody knows.”
Attorney General William Barr has indicated he will make redactions before releasing the Mueller report to Congress, including classified information Congress has said it needs to see. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Another person familiar with the discussions said the officials who are worried are those who said negative things about Trump. This person said the “million-dollar question” swirling around Trump world is how much of the report will be redacted, specifically if it will be a “net plus or minus” 100 pages of the more than 300-page report.
Fueling officials' concern is that Attorney General William Barr hasn’t been clear about what the report might entail. Barr has said he wants to make as much of the report public as he can, while also making clear parts of it will be redacted for grand jury testimony, classified information and material that could affect ongoing investigations. He also said information that could ""infringe on the personal privacy"" and reputations of ""peripheral third parties” could be redacted, a phrase unclear to some witnesses in the investigation.
“Even if names are redacted or names aren’t in the report to begin with, it could be situations people were asked about and they answered truthfully that at least for some people — specifically the president — would be identifiable because the situation applies to just one person,” the former White House official said. “Nobody has any idea what this is going to look like on Thursday.”

"Mark Zuckerberg leveraged Facebook user data to fight rivals and help friends, leaked documents show",www.nbcnews.com,Olivia Solon,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-leveraged-facebook-user-data-fight-rivals-help-friends-n994706,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg oversaw plans to consolidate the social network’s power and control competitors by treating its users’ data as a bargaining chip, while publicly proclaiming to be protecting that data, according to about 4,000 pages of leaked company documents largely spanning 2011 to 2015 and obtained by NBC News. The documents, which include emails, webchats, presentations, spreadsheets and meeting summaries, show how Zuckerberg, along with his board and management team, found ways to tap Facebook’s trove of user data — including information about friends, relationships and photos — as leverage over companies it partnered with.
In some cases, Facebook would reward favored companies by giving them access to the data of its users. In other cases, it would deny user-data access to rival companies or apps.
Mark Zuckerberg leveraged Facebook user data, leaked documents show April 16, 2019 03:26 For example, Facebook gave Amazon extended access to user data because it was spending money on Facebook advertising and partnering with the social network on the launch of its Fire smartphone. In another case, Facebook discussed cutting off access to user data for a messaging app that had grown too popular and was viewed as a competitor, according to the documents.
All the while, Facebook was formulating a strategy to publicly frame these moves as a way of protecting user privacy.
Private communication between users is “increasingly important,” Zuckerberg said in a 2014 New York Times interview . “Anything we can do that makes people feel more comfortable is really good.”
Related Tech Inside bikini-photo startup Six4Three's scrappy battle to put Facebook on trial But the documents show that behind the scenes, in contrast with Facebook’s public statements, the company came up with several ways to require third-party applications to compensate Facebook for access to its users’ data, including direct payment, advertising spending and data-sharing arrangements. While it’s not unusual for businesses that are working together to share information about their customers, Facebook has access to sensitive data that many other companies don’t possess.
Facebook ultimately decided not to sell the data directly but rather to dole it out to app developers who were considered personal “friends” of Zuckerberg or who spent money on Facebook and shared their own valuable data, the documents show.
Facebook denied that it gave preferential treatment to developers or partners because of their ad spending or relationship with executives. The company has not been accused of breaking the law.
A man poses for photos in front of the Facebook sign on the company's campus in Menlo Park, California, in 2014. Jeff Chiu / AP file About 400 of the 4,000 pages of documents have previously been reported by other media outlets, and also by a member of the British Parliament who has been investigating Facebook’s data privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, this cache represents the clearest and most comprehensive picture of Facebook’s activities during a critical period as the company struggled to adapt to the rise of smartphones following its rocky debut as a public company.
The thousands of newly shared documents were anonymously leaked to the British investigative journalist Duncan Campbell, who shared them with a handful of media organizations: NBC News, Computer Weekly and Süddeutsche Zeitung. Campbell, a founding member of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, is a computer forensics expert who has worked on international investigations including on offshore banking and big tobacco. The documents appear to be the same ones obtained by Parliament in late 2018 as part of an investigation into Facebook. Facebook did not question the authenticity of the documents NBC News obtained.
Related Tech U.K. lawmaker Damian Collins releases seized Facebook emails, claims company lacks 'straight answers' The documents stem from a California court case between the social network and the little-known startup Six4Three, which sued Facebook in 2015 after the company announced plans to cut off access to some types of user data. Six4Three’s app, Pikinis, which soft-launched in 2013, relied on that data to allow users to easily find photos of their friends in bathing suits.
Facebook has acknowledged that it considered charging for access to user data . But Facebook has challenged the significance of those discussions, telling the Wall Street Journal last year and NBC News this month that the company was merely mulling various business models.
Facebook has also repeatedly said that the documents had been “ cherry-picked ” and were misleading. Facebook reiterated this stance when NBC News contacted the social media company for comment on the newly leaked documents.
“As we’ve said many times, Six4Three — creators of the Pikinis app — cherry picked these documents from years ago as part of a lawsuit to force Facebook to share information on friends of the app's users,” Paul Grewal, vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement released by the company.
“The set of documents, by design, tells only one side of the story and omits important context. We still stand by the platform changes we made in 2014/2015 to prevent people from sharing their friends' information with developers like the creators of Pikinis. The documents were selectively leaked as part of what the court found was evidence of a crime or fraud to publish some, but not all, of the internal discussions at Facebook at the time of our platform changes. But the facts are clear: we've never sold people’s data.”
The finding of “evidence of a crime or fraud” came from a preliminary decision by the judge in the Six4Three case about an earlier round of leaked documents.
NBC News has not been able to determine whether the documents represent a complete picture. Facebook declined to provide additional evidence to support the claim of cherry-picking.
Still, these freshly leaked documents show that the plans to sell access to user data were discussed for years and received support from Facebook’s most senior executives, including Zuckerberg, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, chief product officer Chris Cox and VP of growth Javier Olivan. Facebook declined to make them available for comment.
After NBC News contacted Facebook for comment, Facebook’s lawyers wrote to the judge in the Six4Three case, claiming that Six4Three had leaked the documents to a “national broadcast network” and seeking to depose Six4Three’s founders. NBC News received the documents from Campbell, who received them from an anonymous source. Six4Three denied leaking the documents.
Related Tech Facebook's 2018 timeline: Scandals, hearings and security bugs When Facebook ultimately cut off broad access to user data in 2015, the move contributed to the decline of thousands of competitors and small businesses that relied on what Facebook had previously described as a “level-playing field” in terms of access to data. In addition to Pikinis, the casualties included Lulu, an app that let women rate the men they dated; an identity fraud-detecting app called Beehive ID; and Swedish breast cancer awareness app Rosa Bandet (Pink Ribbon).
The strategy orchestrated by Zuckerberg had some of his employees comparing the company to villains from Game of Thrones, while David Poll, a senior engineer, called the treatment of outside app developers “sort of unethical,” according to the documents. But Zuckerberg’s approach also earned admiration: Doug Purdy, Facebook’s director of product, described the CEO as a “master of leverage,” according to the documents.
Facebook declined to comment on these employee communications.
A PRIVACY MYTH One of the most striking threads to emerge from the documents is the way that Facebook user data was horse-traded to squeeze money or shared data from app developers.
In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in early 2018 and rising awareness of the Six4Three case, Facebook has attempted to frame changes it made to its platform in 2014 and 2015 as being driven by concerns over user privacy. In statements to media organizations, Facebook has said it locked down its platform to protect users from companies that mishandled user data, such as Cambridge Analytica, as well as apps that spammed users’ news feeds or were creepy, such as Six4Three’s bikini-spotting app Pikinis.
Related Tech Mark Zuckerberg to shift Facebook toward a 'privacy-focused' platform However, among the documents leaked, there’s very little evidence that privacy was a major concern of Facebook’s, and the issue was rarely discussed in the thousands of pages of emails and meeting summaries. Where privacy is mentioned, it is often in the context of how Facebook can use it as a public relations strategy to soften the blow of the sweeping changes to developers’ access to user data. The documents include several examples suggesting that these changes were designed to cement Facebook’s power in the marketplace, not to protect users.
In Six4Three’s case, for example, Facebook’s head of policy Allison Hendrix acknowledged in a June 2017 deposition obtained by NBC News that the social network never received any complaints about the Pikinis app, nor did Facebook send Six4Three any policy or privacy violation notices. Six4Three, Hendrix confirmed, was playing within the rules Facebook had set for developers.
Despite this, Six4Three’s access to data, specifically access to a user’s friends’ photos, was cut off in April 2015 as part of sweeping changes to Facebook’s platform announced a year earlier, which affected as many as 40,000 apps. Six4Three shut down the app soon afterward.
Ted Kramer, founder of Six4Three. Peter DaSilva / for NBC News “Our case is about Zuckerberg’s decision to weaponize the reliance of companies on his purportedly neutral platform and to weaponize the private and sensitive data of billions of people,” said Six4Three founder Ted Kramer.
A TURNING POINT FOR FACEBOOK Facebook recognized early on that working with third-party app developers could help make the social network more interesting and drive the platform’s expansion. Beginning in early 2010, Facebook created tools that allowed the makers of games (remember Farmville?) and other apps to connect with its audience in return for ensuring those users spent more time on Facebook.
Facebook achieved this through its “Graph API” (Application Programming Interface), a common means to allow software programs to interact with each other. In Facebook’s case, this meant that third-party apps such as games could post updates on people’s profiles, which would be seen by players’ friends and potentially encourage them to play, too. Beyond that, it allowed the makers of those games to access a slew of data from Facebook users, including their connections to friends, likes, locations, updates, photos and more.
The Graph API — and particularly the way it let third parties promote their products to and extract data from a user’s social connections — was a key feature of Facebook that Six4Three and thousands of other companies relied upon for viral marketing and user growth.
However, after a few years, Facebook decided the app developers were getting more value from the user data they extracted from Facebook than Facebook was getting out of the app developers, the documents show.
After Facebook went public in May 2012, its stock price plummeted, which Zuckerberg later characterized as “disappointing.” The company was in a desperate position, documents show, with users sharing fewer photos and posts on the platform as they spent more time on their cellphones. An internal Facebook presentation looking back at this period used the phrase “terminal decline” to describe the fall in engagement.
Facebook executives, including Zuckerberg and Sandberg, spent months brainstorming ways to turn the company around. An idea that they kept returning to: make money from the app partners, by charging them for access to Facebook’s users and their data.
‘SELL DATA FOR $” Several proposals for charging developers for access to Facebook’s platform and data were put forward in a presentation to the company’s board of directors, according to emails and draft slides from late August 2012.
Among the suggestions: a fixed annual fee for developers for reviewing their apps; an access fee for apps that requested user data; and a charge for “premium” access to data, such as a user trust score or a ranking of the strongest relationships between users and their friends.
“Today the fundamental trade is ‘data for distribution’ whereas we want to change it to either ‘data for $’ and/or ‘$ for distribution,’” Chris Daniels, a Facebook business development director, wrote in an August 2012 email to other top leaders in the company discussing the upcoming presentation.
Discussions continued through October, when Zuckerberg explained to close friend Sam Lessin the importance of controlling third-party apps’ ability to access Facebook’s data and reach people’s friends on the platform. Without that leverage, “I don’t think we have any way to get developers to pay us at all,” Zuckerberg wrote in an email to Lessin.
In the same week, Zuckerberg floated the idea of pursuing 100 deals with developers “as a path to figuring out the real market value” of Facebook user data and then “setting a public rate” for developers.
“The goal here wouldn’t be the deals themselves, but that through the process of negotiating with them we’d learn what developers would actually pay (which might be different from what they’d say if we just asked them about the value), and then we’d be better informed on our path to set a public rate,” Zuckerberg wrote in a chat.
Facebook told NBC News that it was exploring ways to build a sustainable business, but ultimately decided not to go forward with these plans.
""I just can’t think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us.”
Zuckerberg was unfazed by the potential privacy risks associated with Facebook’s data-sharing arrangements.
“I’m generally skeptical that there is as much data leak strategic risk as you think,” he wrote in the email to Lessin. “I think we leak info to developers but I just can’t think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us.”
Facebook told NBC News that this was an example of a cherry-picked email designed to bolster Six4Three’s case.
Zuckerberg didn’t know it at the time, but a privacy bug affecting an unnamed third-party app would create precisely this kind of strategic risk the following year, according to a panicked chatlog between Michael Vernal, who was director of engineering, and other senior employees.
It’s not clear exactly what happened or which app was involved, but it appears that Zuckerberg’s private communications could have leaked from Facebook to the external app in an unexpected way.
Vernal said that it “could have been near-fatal for Facebook platform” if “Mark had accidentally disclosed earnings ahead of time because a platform app violated his privacy.”
“Holy crap,” replied Avichal Garg, then director of product management.
“DO NOT REPEAT THIS STORY OFF OF THIS THREAD,” added Vernal. “I can’t tell you how terrible this would have been for all of us had this not been caught quickly.”
Vernal and Garg did not respond to requests for comment.
‘GOOD FOR THE WORLD’ BUT NOT ‘GOOD FOR US’ In late November 2012, Zuckerberg sent a long email to Facebook’s senior leadership team saying that Facebook shouldn’t charge developers for access to basic data feeds. However, he said that access to Facebook data should be contingent on the developers sharing all of the “social content” generated by their apps back to Facebook, something Zuckerberg calls “full reciprocity.”
The existing arrangement, where developers weren’t required to share their data back with Facebook, might be “good for the world” but it’s not “good for us,” Zuckerberg wrote in the email.
He noted that though Facebook could charge developers to access user data, the company stood to benefit more from requiring developers to compensate Facebook in kind — with their own data — and by pushing those developers to pay for advertising on Facebook’s platform.
The endgame: to ensure Facebook maintained its dominant position in the market.
“The purpose of the platform is to tie the universe of all the social apps together so we can enable a lot more sharing and still remain the central social hub,” Zuckerberg said in the email.
Facebook told NBC News that the focus of “full reciprocity” was to enable users to share their experiences within external apps with their friends on Facebook, not about providing Facebook with user data.
CUTTING DEALS With Zuckerberg’s vision for Facebook set, the company began making deals with some of its most valued partners, including dozens of app developer friends of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. Facebook whitelisted their access to feeds of user data while restricting that same access to apps that Facebook viewed as competitors.
These data access deals prepared key partners, including Tinder, Sony and Microsoft, for sweeping changes to the Facebook platform that the company planned to announce at its annual developer conference in April 2014 and enforce within a year.
In one instance, described in June 2013 documents, Amazon received special treatment for the launch of a group gifting product, despite the fact that it competed with one of Facebook’s own products.
“Remind me, why did we allow them to do this? Do we receive any cut of purchases?” Chris Daniels, then Facebook’s director of business development, asked in an email.
“No, but Amazon is an advertiser and supporting this with advertisement ... and working with us on deeper integrations for the Fire,” Amazon’s smartphone, replied Jackie Chang, who worked with Facebook’s “strategic partners.”
Amazon released a statement to NBC News: “Amazon uses publicly available APIs provided by Facebook in order to enable Facebook experiences for our products and only uses information in accordance with our privacy policy.”
Apps that were not considered “strategic partners” got different treatment. In a March 2013 discussion, Justin Osofsky, then director of platform partnerships, described restricting the MessageMe app from accessing Facebook data because it had grown too popular and could compete with Facebook messages. He asked colleagues to see if any other messenger apps have “hit the growth team’s radar recently.”
“If so, we'd like to restrict them at the same time to group this into one press cycle,"" he wrote in an email.
‘IT’S SORT OF UNETHICAL’ Deal negotiations created confusion among partners who had grown accustomed to unfettered access to Facebook user data.
“We gave a bunch of stuff ‘for free’ historically (data, distribution) and now we’re making you ‘pay’ for it via reciprocal value,” Vernal, director of engineering, wrote in an email in June 2013. He added, “The confusing thing here is that we haven’t really announced these changes publicly/broadly yet.”
Some Facebook employees were unhappy about this direction, particularly the way the company appeared to be blocking competitors from accessing data.
Here’s an extract from a December 2013 chatlog between several senior engineers talking about the changes:
Bryan Klimt: “So we are literally going to group apps into buckets based on how scared we are of them and give them different APIs? ... So the message is, ‘if you’re going to compete with us at all, make sure you don’t integrate with us at all’? I’m just dumbfounded.”
Kevin Lacker: “Yeah this is complicated.”
David Poll: “More than complicated, it’s sort of unethical.”
Lacker and Poll declined to comment. Vernal and Klimt did not respond to requests for comment.
Facebook declined to comment on the employee exchanges.
THE PR SPIN When it came to publicly announcing the sweeping changes at Facebook’s annual F8 developer conference in April 2014, members of the communications team worked with Zuckerberg to craft a narrative around user trust, not competition or profitability.
In a March 2014 email discussing Zuckerberg’s keynote speech at the event, where he was due to announce the removal of developers’ access to friends’ data, Jonny Thaw, a director of communications, wrote that it “may be a tough message for some developers as it may inhibit their growth.”
“So one idea that came up today was potentially talking in the keynote about some of the trust changes we’re making on Facebook itself. So the message would be: ‘trust is really important to us — on Facebook, we’re doing A, B and C to help people control and understand what they’re sharing — and with platform apps we’re doing D, E and F.’”
If that doesn’t work, he added, “we could announce some of Facebook’s trust initiatives in the run up to F8” to make the changes for developers “seem more natural.”
Facebook told NBC News that it was “completely reasonable” for someone on the communications team to discuss the best way to get the message out on changes to the platform.
User trust was crucial when Zuckerberg delivered his speech at the event on April 30, 2014.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 developer conference in San Francisco in 2014. Ben Margot / AP file “Over the years, one of the things we’ve heard over and over again is that people want more control over how they share their information, especially with apps, and they want more say and control over how apps use their data,” he told the audience of journalists and developers . “And we take this really seriously because if people don’t have the tools they need to feel comfortable using your apps, that’s bad for them and that’s bad for you.”
But despite Facebook’s public focus on privacy, staff member emails described confusion over the way third-party apps could override users’ privacy settings.
Even if users locked down their account so that their photos and other data were visible to “only me,” those photos could still be transferred to third parties, according to the documents.
In April 2015, Connie Yang, a product designer, told her colleagues that she’d discovered apps collecting profile data she had marked as “only me” and displaying it to “both you and *other people* using that app.”
“While ‘whoa how did you start working at Casterly Rock’ is a fun opener,” she wrote, referring to the ancestral stronghold of the most fearsome family in “Game of Thrones,” “isn’t this directly violating what we tell users is ‘only me’?”
Yang did not respond to requests for comment.
Facebook said this was another example of cherry-picked emails.
THE DOCUMENTS’ LEGACY Even though Facebook eventually decided not to charge developers directly for access to user data, the extensive discussions around its monetary value, shown in the leaked documents, could create lasting problems for the company, privacy and policy experts say.
The biggest threat Facebook faces now is not competition but antitrust regulation, which is designed to promote fair competition among companies for the benefit of consumers, using fines or restrictions on mergers and acquisitions.
Regulators have typically struggled to build robust antitrust cases against technology companies that offer services to users for free. If the product is free, then it’s harder to argue that the consumer is being harmed by a monopoly.
But if regulators can show that users were paying for access to Facebook with their personal data, and that Facebook valued that data as leverage against competitors, that could expose Facebook to an antitrust complaint, said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade association representing digital publishers (including NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News).
“These emails clearly establish the value of consumer data to Facebook,” Kint said. “It shows that it is not free.”
Facebook said that the service has always been free for users and developers.
Related News Cambridge Analytica harvested data from millions of unsuspecting Facebook users In February, the Federal Trade Commission announced a task force to monitor anti-competitive behavior in the tech industry to, in the words of FTC chair Joseph Simons , “ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.”
Policymakers have called for the FTC to investigate Facebook specifically for violating antitrust laws.
The company “appears to have used its dominance to cripple other competitive threats by cutting them off from its massive network,” Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month .
Facebook appears to be preparing for the inevitable, with Zuckerberg writing his own op-ed in The Washington Post in March calling for regulation in areas including harmful content and election integrity, but not antitrust. Facebook watchers saw this show of willingness as an attempt by Zuckerberg to curry favor with policymakers at a time when many are baying for the company’s blood.
Ashkan Soltani, a privacy expert and former FTC chief technologist, said that Zuckerberg is approaching the looming threat of regulation with “bravado” and trying to “leverage things for his benefit.”
Meanwhile, David Carroll , a professor at the New School, who pursued legal claims in the U.K. in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, says Zuckerberg is “bracing for impact.”
“When the penalty hits they can be like, ‘Yeah, we agree, we deserve this fine.’ It positions them to be conciliatory,” Carroll said.
The “master of leverage” strikes again.

Dating after 40? The millions who are should get the HPV vaccine,www.nbcnews.com,Dana Hill,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/dating-after-40-millions-who-are-should-get-hpv-vaccine-ncna994746,"I’m 44, never married, and expect to have new sex partners in the future. In that, I'm not alone: According to the U.S. Census Bureau , there were 3.5 million Americans aged 40-44 who have never been married in 2018. Adding in people who are divorced, widowed or separated, that number of unmarried people around my age swells to 6.5 million — or 35.7 percent of all people in that age group. And that's just those who are single right now: As our society has moved away from lifetime marriage and monogamy, a large number of people my age and older have the potential to engage with new sex partners in the future.
But none of us has had access to the HPV vaccine before now. Gardasil (which has no generic version) was approved in 2006 for women ages nine to 26 to protect against four strains of the virus, two of which caused genital warts and two of which caused cancer; then 32, I was too old to qualify. (The approval was extended to men ages nine to 26 in 2009 .)
 Why I wish I didn't avoid an awkward conversation about HPV in men Thanks, however, to a October 2018 decision by the Food & Drug Administration, women and men aged 27 through 45 finally have the opportunity to obtain Gardasil 9 (the latest version of the vaccine) protect ourselves from nine of the 200 strains of human papilloma virus, some of which are spread through vaginal, anal or oral sex and cause warts and cancer. This means that people between the ages of 38 and 45, who were above the age limit in 2006, can now get vaccinated.
Thus, I’ve begun the 3-shot course of Gardasil 9.
Anyone like me who missed the age window previously might think they do not need protection from HPV because they have already been exposed to various HPV types, have suffered no consequences or are in a committed relationship with no plans to have a new sex partner.
 Why are some men so terrible, and what can we do about it? However, the Centers for Disease Control reports HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women get the virus at some point in their lives. While most people can mount an immune response to a single HPV virus and clear it within a year, sometimes more virulent strains take 24 months or longer to go away.
And several recent studies have shown that older women remain at risk of HPV infection due to their sexual activity. In Canada, where there is no upper age limit for the HPV vaccine, health providers have warned about the risk of HPV in populations over age 40 because lifetime monogamy to one person is no longer the statistical norm. A 2017 U.S. study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that women close to age 65 are less likely to get screened for HPV. In Sweden, where women are not screened regularly after 60, 30 percent of cervical cancers present in that population .
By getting the HPV vaccine now, young Gen Xers can prevent avoid HPV infections later life.
For me, an HPV infection is not merely a possibility; it’s already happened. I was in my 20s when my Pap smear results showed that I had been infected with a strain of high-risk HPV. High-risk HPVs — of which there are 15 types — can cause cancer in any part of the body with cells affected by HPV, including the cervix, oropharynx (including the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils), anus, rectum, penis, vagina and vulva.
According to the National Cancer Institute , high-risk HPVs cause 43,000 HPV-related cancers each year in the United States, which is 3 percent of all cancers in women and 2 percent of all cancers in men. It also causes cervical cancer, the 14th most-common cancer in the U.S., as well as anal cancer, which actress Marcia Cross has recently battled .
A 2019 study published in published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention , found that the vaccine decreased infections of two high-risk HPV strains, leading to a smaller proportion of cervical disease.
Though my high-risk HPV was caught in time, my treatment was sufficiently unpleasant that I wish I could have received a vaccine to avoid it. After my diagnosis, I had several colposcopies — cervical biopsies — as the virus lingered in my body.
My infection also caused sufficient irregular cells (dysplasia, in the parlance) that I had to undergo a Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure, a surgery during which my doctor used an electrified wire to scrape away the bad cells from my cervix; I was under general anesthesia, though today LEEPs may be performed using local anesthesia.
 Fran Drescher: When cancer is in the 'whisper' stage, listen to it — even it means finding another doctor There are potential long-term side effects to LEEPs: Some women to experience loss of sexual pleasure, and multiple cervical procedures can increase risks for cervical insufficiency , a significant risk factor for miscarriage.
Thankfully, my high-risk HPV infection was caught through routine screening, treated and never developed into cancer. Some women, however, do not get regular screenings. And, for heterosexual men, there is no HPV test and no currently available treatment. For men who have sex with men, some doctors recommend annual anal cancer testing via anal Pap smears. Otherwise, unless men are told about an infection by a partner, they may not know they have been exposed until cancer develops.
Anyone under 45 who plans to be sexually active in the future should not miss this window of opportunity and should take action before reaching the age cutoff. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about getting the HPV vaccine. Three shots, a copay and some shoulder soreness are a small price to pay to be inoculated from cancer-causing viruses.

"Notre Dame Cathedral fire: Parisians grieve, pay their respects to landmark",www.nbcnews.com,Saphora Smith,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-parisians-grieve-pay-their-respects-landmark-n994896,"PARIS — In the most solemn week on the Christian calendar, Paris is in mourning. The charred scaffolding of Notre Dame Cathedral stood out like a scar in the gray sky of the ""city of light"" early Tuesday.
As it drizzled, there was a gaping hole where the landmark's roof would have offered protection.
What will happen to Notre Dame Cathedral's artwork? April 16, 2019 10:13 Some made a point of taking time to pause and pay their respects during the French capital's buzzing rush hour.
“People have come as if they are visiting a sick friend,” student Jossien Prouteau, 22, said while standing on a bridge across the Seine River, which connects the Left Bank with Île de la Cité — the island where Notre Dame is. ""Watching the flames last night was like watching a woman being beaten up without being able to do anything.""
As a practicing Catholic, Prouteau said he would typically spend a few minutes each day thinking or praying outside the cathedral.
“I’m in mourning,"" he added. ""It is not only a beautiful work of art aesthetically, but there is a spiritual connection.""
Others on the banks of the Seine expressed a common sense of disbelief that Notre Dame, which embodies so much of French identity, history and culture, could be left in such a state.
“It’s been something we’ve always seen. We passed by it without paying attention, but today we’re measuring up how much this building means to us,” said Pierre Ribette, who had come to take photos of the ruins to send to his children, who live abroad.
The altar is surrounded by charred debris in the Notre Dame Cathedral. Ludovic Marin / AFP - Getty Images A sea of smartphones were pointed toward Notre Dame's damaged roof in the nearby Saint-Michel area.
“I’ve never seen so many people here. I had trouble making it here from the Metro,” said Georges Montero, 65, who owns one of the riverside stalls selling traditional postcards and prints of Paris.
“I struggle to imagine how they’re going to rebuild it in the same way as it was, think of all the stained glass, the artifacts,” he said, shaking his head. “Even with our technical capabilities today, I doubt they can do it.”
Related World news World news Notre Dame fundraiser laments that surge in donations didn't come sooner Chet Wargocki, 67, who recently moved to Paris from New York, was more optimistic.
“The great lady is clearly distressed, but she is still magnificent and indomitable,” he said while surveying the cathedral from the terrace of a local brasserie.
Jack Lang, who served as France's culture minister between 1981 and 1986 and then again between 1988 and 1992, was among those who gathered on the banks of the Seine to survey the damage. He said predictions that it would take ""tens of years"" to rebuild the cathedral were ""unacceptable.""
“This is a monument that is dear to the heart of millions of people around the world,” Lang said. ""It needs urgency.""
Hours earlier, crowds gathered after dark to sing the ""Hail Mary"" as fire swept across the roof and threatened to raze the greatest of Gothic cathedrals to the ground.
Watch: Bystanders sing hymns as Notre Dame burns April 16, 2019 01:02 Nearly 400 firefighters battled the blaze. Human chains were formed to rescue relics and priceless works of art, including a crown of thorns some believe to have been worn by Jesus Christ.
""The crown of thorns, the tunic of St. Louis and several other major works are now in a safe place,"" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Twitter.
It remained unclear Tuesday how the fire had started but authorities said the incident was being treated as an accident.
It wasn’t until late at night that a city official said the structure of the building — including its two famous bell towers — had been saved. Crews had been battling the blaze for around nine hours.

Notre Dame Cathedral's treasures rescued from devastating blaze April 16, 2019 01:01 French President Emmanuel Macron pledged that France would rebuild the 850-year-old cathedral, considered to be one of the most important Christian places of worship in the world. The popular tourist attraction welcomes some 14 million visitors each year and was undergoing renovations.
""There does seem to be a death in the family, not just the Catholic family — the world family,"" Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, told NBC's ""Today"" show on Tuesday . ""As people gather around and look at the charred remains of our Notre Dame, it's almost like we are at a funeral parlor.""
Some around the Île de la Cité were under no illusions about how long it would take to return Notre Dame to its former glory.
“It’s such a symbol for everyone living in France, everyone in Paris,” said Jane Winfield, 58, who moved to Paris from Britain around two decades ago. “I regret that I may not live long enough now to see it fully restored.""

Here are some of our top takeaways:
Among the Dems, there’s Sanders, O’Rourke and then everyone else: We knew from early totals that Sanders and O’Rourke had put up big numbers , but the latest breakdowns show how those engines chugged along at a rate that far outpaced their rivals. Sanders raised about $445k in contributions per day during the 41 days he was in the race, and O’Rourke hit about $520k a day over 18 days. The next closest was Kamala Harris, who pulled in about $172k for every day she was in. Warren is making a big gamble on a big operation: Elizabeth Warren has spent the most of any Democratic candidate, at $5.3 million in the 90 days she’s been in the race. By our count, she’s shelled out about $1.2 million on 161 staff salaries, suggesting that she’s planning to outhustle other contenders with a lot of resources on the ground early. She’s still got a big chunk of money in the bank from her $10m+ transfer from her Senate campaign, but that high spending rate meant that she burned through more than 85 percent of her Q1 contributions. The question is: How long is that spending rate sustainable? Team U.S. Senate is staying above water — mostly because of their past campaign nest eggs: Of the senators running for president, all moved at least some reserves from their Senate accounts over to their 2020 war chest. But for Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, those were very substantial investments — ranging from about a third of their topline fundraising total (for Booker) up to three-quarters (for Gillibrand). Those transfers give those candidates healthy-looking war chests, but it’s not because of great outside fundraising prowess. The exception, by the way, is Kamala Harris, who transferred about $1.2 million from her Senate campaign but raised an additional $12 million in other contributions. Buttigieg’s lean campaign: It’s striking how Buttigieg’s fundraising took off as he gained name ID and buzz. He raised just $72,000 in itemized donations (donations of $200 or more) on Jan. 23, the day he announced his exploratory committee, compared with the million+ hauls of some of his competitors on their announcement days. (Of course, Buttigieg went on to raise more than $7 million more.) He’s also spending very little so far, with a burn rate of under 10 percent and just about $200k spent on payroll and consulting. That means that he’s got plenty left in the bank to compete on a Tier One/Tier Two level, but will have to start growing out his organization to compete on the ground. Tough news for Julian Castro: Yes, it’s a crowded field, and it’s hard to catch fire. But Castro, at a $1.1m haul, is being outraised by not one but two candidates who are basically unknown outside of niche constituencies — Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang. Looming over all of this — Trump’s totals: We learned over the weekend that Trump’s campaign brought in $30 million in the first quarter and has about $40 million on hand. Combine that with the RNC’s efforts, and his reelection campaign heads into the spring with $82 million in the bank. (The Democratic candidates combined are currently sitting on about $91 million cash on hand.) What’s more, Trump’s latest paperwork shows that — for all the talk of how Democrats are playing the small-dollar fundraising game — he’s still pulling in a lot of those under-$200 donations himself. By our math, small donations made up about 54 percent of the Trump campaign’s haul. That pales in comparison to a Sanders or a Warren, but it’s competitive or better than most of the other top-tier 2020 Democrats.

It was a topic of repeated questioning in the run up to his announcement. But finally: We’ve now seen 10 years of Bernie Sanders’ tax returns.
NBC’s Shaquille Brewster reports that Sanders’s total income, which previously came mostly from his U.S. Senate salary, “popped to over $1 million in 2016 and 2017, after he wrote ‘Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In’ in November 2016, raising his effective tax rate for those years to over 30 percent.”
One thing worth remembering: Back in 2016, under intense pressure to release them, Sanders only opted for a brief summary of his 2014 returns.
Shortly before that release, he said : “They are very boring tax returns. No big money from speeches, no major investments. Unfortunately — unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate. And that’s what that will show.”
Compare that with his defense — last night during a FOX News town hall — of the big payout from his book: “In my and my wife's case, I wrote a pretty good book. It was a bestseller, sold all over the world, and we made money. If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do it.""
Our question: Sanders has been resistant to this disclosure for years, which fueled plenty of speculation about what the returns might show. If the headline all along was just “we made money” … why did Sanders absorb all those questions rather than just make the release last cycle?
(Also yesterday, Beto O’Rourke released 10 years of his own tax returns, with the most recent filing showing an income of more than $360,000. )
2020 vision: Bill Weld is in Trump is now the first incumbent president to face a notable primary challenge since George H.W. Bush in 1992, with former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld making his longshot run official.
Weld said in his announcement that Trump’s “priorities are skewed toward promotion of himself rather than for the good of the country,” and urged “a return to the principles of Lincoln — equality, dignity and opportunity for all.”
On the campaign trail today Joe Biden travels to South Carolina to deliver a eulogy for the late Fritz Hollings… Beto O’Rourke has a series of events in Virginia… Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker are in Iowa… Amy Klobuchar has a health care roundtable in Florida… Elizabeth Warren holds an organizing event in Colorado… John Delaney stumps in New Hampshire.. and Howard Schultz tours the southern border in Nogales, Ariz.
Clear your calendar: In case you somehow missed it The Department of Justice says that it expects to release the redacted version of the Mueller report on Thursday morning.
Some reading while you wait: NBC’s Carol E. Lee, Hallie Jackson and Kristen Welker write that some of the more than a dozen current and former White House officials who cooperated with Mueller are worried that his report will expose them as the source of damaging information about the president.
Tweet of the Day Hundreds of firemen of the Paris Fire Brigade are doing everything they can to bring the terrible #NotreDame fire under control. All means are being used, except for water-bombing aircrafts which, if used, could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral.
— Sécurité Civile Fr (@SecCivileFrance) April 15, 2019 Data Download: The number of the day is… net +5 percent. Net +5 percent.
That’s former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore’s net favorability rating among registered Alabama Republican voters in a new poll from Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.
Thirty-four percent of those voters have a favorable view of Moore in the poll, compared to 29 percent who view him unfavorably.
Moore, if you remember, is the main reason why Republicans gifted Democrats an Alabama Senate seat in 2017 after bombshell allegations that he groped women decades ago while they were teenagers and he was an adult.
Not only does Moore have a net favorability rating in the poll, but he also has a lead over the potential Alabama Senate GOP primary field.
Part of that lead is due to Moore’s overwhelming name recognition among Republican voters—two of his top potential challengers are unknown by about half of Republicans.
And the GOP establishment will likely move to bury Moore if he decides to run again, spurned by a failure to do so in 2017 and encouraged by results like this poll, where 50 percent of registered Alabama voters say they want to replace Jones with a Republican.
But as Moore continues to flirt with another bid, polling like this won’t dissuade him from doing so. And that could create another problem for the GOP.

Secret tapes in racially tinged police scandal may revive difficult time for Buttigieg,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/secret-tapes-racially-tinged-police-scandal-may-revive-difficult-time-n994871,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. — A lawsuit related to the demotion of a former South Bend police chief could potentially re-open one of the more uncomfortable moments of Pete Buttigieg's mayoralty as his presidential run picks up steam. The South Bend Common Council is pushing to have tapes made public that secretly recorded police officers on telephone calls in which they allegedly made racist comments.
The controversy led Buttigieg to demote the city's first black police chief, Darryl Boykins, in 2012. Boykins then sued the city alleging racial discrimination, saying that the secret taping scandal was used as a pretext to oust him.
Buttigieg pushes national service to boost national cohesion April 16, 2019 06:13 Boykins' demotion prompted a wave of criticism from many leaders in the city’s black community. African American pastors and city council members have said they want the tapes released so they can hear whether white police officers used racist language.
Separately, a group of officers is suing the city trying to block the tapes' release, saying they were illegally recorded.
The mayor's office says it can't release the tapes without approval from a judge since the recordings could violate wiretapping laws. Nonetheless, Buttigieg said several years ago that he ""would be very interested to know what is on the tapes.""
Litigation has been ongoing for six years and has cost the city over $2 million , according to The South Bend Tribune.
A judge was supposed to decide on summary judgment by the end of last year, but a ruling could now be coming soon, according to The Hill .
The issue arose by accident after a former detective set up an automatic recording system on his office phone that continued to record officers after he left.
The department's former communications director said she discovered that the recordings contained racist remarks and even discussions of a potential criminal conspiracy and brought it to Boykins' attention.
But Boykins and the communications director ended up being punished because the mayor's office said that the recordings violated laws that require at least one party to consent to being recorded on a phone call — a position strongly endorsed by the officers recorded on the calls.
But the Common Council, which wants the tapes to be made public, claims there was "" implied consent "" among police officers because everyone knows the police department records calls.
While the recorded calls do not relate directly to Buttigieg, they could revive questions about race and justice in South Bend.
The mayor's office declined to comment on the pending litigation, and Buttigieg's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

"5 jobs that pay more than $75,000 that you can get with an associate degree",www.nbcnews.com,"Kerri Anne Renzulli, CNBC",04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/5-jobs-pay-more-75-000-you-can-get-associate-ncna994666,"High-paying jobs don’t just belong to those with advanced degrees. If you want to earn in the high five figures or even into the six figures, you can get there with only two years of higher education. But you’ll need to carefully pick the subject you earn an associate degree in to do so.
To help you get the best return for your education investment, CNBC Make It combed through data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to identify all the occupations that pay workers with an associate degree more than $75,000 a year.
Getting one of these top-dollar jobs means you’ll be drastically out-earning your peers with a similar education and, maybe, even out-earning those with a four-year degree. The average annual salary of someone with an associate degree is $41,496 a year, according to the BLS, or about $34,000 less than the lowest-paying gig on this list.
Related Climb the Ladder Climb the Ladder 14 in-demand jobs that pay over $100,000 and are hiring now So if you’re ready to land a high-paying job without staying in college for another two-to-five years, consider one of these five occupations:
Air traffic controllers Median annual wage: $124,540
Projected job growth through 2026: 3 percent
Coordinating the safe movement of aircraft pays top dollar, but it also requires lots of training. Air traffic controllers are responsible for directing aircraft in the ground and air, controlling all ground traffic on runways and taxiways and giving landing and takeoff instruction to pilots. Because their role impacts the safety of hundreds of passengers per flight and typically requires quick decision-making for multiple aircraft, they must be trained and licensed.
Many people become air traffic controllers by obtaining at least an associate degree through an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) program. All air traffic controllers must also hold an Air Traffic Control Tower Operator Certificate or be otherwise appropriately qualified. Controllers are then tested throughout the course of their career, needing to pass a physical exam each year and a job performance exam twice per year.
How to make college cheaper Nov. 6, 2017 02:40 Funeral service managers Median annual wage: $78,040
Projected job growth through 2026: 7 percent
Overseeing the operations of a funeral home may seem a morbid job, but it is a highly rewarding one. These managers need to not only be skilled in handling typical business tasks, like staffing, marketing and maintaining revenue, but also at offering counsel and support to grieving families, arranging for the removal of the deceased’s body, preparing the deceased for the funeral, and filing death certificates and other legal documents with appropriate authorities.
Typically, an associate degree in funeral service or mortuary science is all the education that’s needed to become a funeral service worker. On the job training, however, is also important, as those studying to be funeral directors and morticians must one to three year-long internships and pass a state and/or national board exam.

Projected job growth through 2026: 10 percent
These healthcare workers prepare radioactive drugs for patients to assist with imaging or therapeutic purposes. They operate the imaging equipment used to diagnosis and treat patients. They may also help physicians in researching the uses of radioactive drugs.
Nuclear medicine technologists typically need an associate degree from an accredited nuclear medicine technology program. Although, some technologists become qualified if they have a degree in a related health field and complete a 12-month certificate program. They commonly need a certification in the field and some states may require a license to practice.
Nuclear technicians Median annual wage: $80,370
Projected job growth through 2026: 1 percent
Monitoring radiation is an average day for these technicians who typically work in nuclear energy production or help physicists and engineers in nuclear research. They operate the equipment necessary for these nuclear experiments or power generation and track the levels and types of radiation that are produced by such activities. Testing air, water and soil samples for radioactive contamination can be another aspect of their job.
Nuclear technicians typically need an associate degree in nuclear science or a nuclear-related technology. Some gain equivalent experience from military service. Extensive on-the-job training is also required.

Part of the healthcare team called in to treat cancer, these therapists operate the machines that deliver concentrated radiation therapy to a patient’s tumor. They are also responsible for explaining treatment plans to patients, determining the region of the body receiving treatment, and checking for unusual reactions.
Employers usually prefer to hire applicants with at least an associate degree in radiation therapy, though some companies accept those who’ve completed a certificate program. In most states, radiation therapists must be licensed or certified. Requirements vary depending on the state but typically include passing a national certification exam.

The burnt ruins of the Greater Union Baptist Church, one of three that recently burned down in St. Landry Parish, in Opelousas, La., on April 10, 2019. Gerald Herbert / AP Breaking News Emails April 16, 2019, 2:19 PM UTC By Associated Press OPELOUSAS, La. — The white man suspected in the burnings of three African American churches in Louisiana will remain in jail, denied bond Monday by a judge, as state prosecutors added new charges declaring the arsons a hate crime. Twenty-one-year-old Holden Matthews, the son of a sheriff's deputy, entered his not guilty plea via video conference from the St. Landry Parish jail. The judge set a September trial date. In denying bail, state District Judge James Doherty sided with law enforcement officials who said they worried Matthews would try to flee the area or set more fires. ""We felt that he was an immediate risk to public safety,"" said Louisiana Fire Marshal Butch Browning. ""In my mind, I felt another fire was imminent."" Holden Matthews, 21, was booked into the St. Landry Parish Jail on three counts of Simple Arson of a Religious Building. St. Landry Parish Sheriff Dept. Testifying in court, Browning outlined a litany of evidence, including some new details of the investigation, that he said tied Matthews to the torching of the three black churches over 10 days. The fire marshal described cellphone records placing Matthews at the fire locations, and he said images on the phone showed all three churches burning before law enforcement arrived and showed Matthews ""claiming responsibility"" for the fires. Matthews, who had no previous criminal record, was arrested Wednesday on three charges of arson of a religious building. Prosecutors filed documents Monday adding three more charges, accusing Matthews of violating Louisiana's hate crime law, confirming that they believe the fires were racially motivated, a link authorities had previously stopped short of making. Browning said federal officials also are considering filing additional federal hate crime and arson charges against Matthews. Related News A suspect was caught in the Louisiana church fires, but fear lingers Matthews, shackled and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, never spoke to the court during the hearing, letting his court-appointed lawyer enter the not guilty plea for him. His parents watched their son's appearance on video conference from the courtroom, his dad repeatedly wringing his hands and, at one point, leaving the room in tears. The fires, all started with gasoline, occurred in and around Opelousas, about 60 miles west of Louisiana's capital city of Baton Rouge. Matthews' arrest came a little more than two weeks after the first blaze at the St. Mary Baptist Church on March 26 in Port Barre, a town just outside of Opelousas. Days later, the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas were burned. Each was more than 100 years old. The churches were empty at the time, and no one was injured. But at one location, two occupants of a nearby home had to evacuate when the siding on the home started to catch fire from the church. The fires set the community on edge. Gov. John Bel Edwards said the church burnings were a reminder ""of a very dark past of intimidation and fear."" Matthews' attorney Quincy Cawthorne questioned some of the evidence cited by Browning and said Matthews didn't have the financial means to be a flight risk. He also objected to suggestions that the house near one of the churches was intentionally set on fire, putting the residents' lives in danger. A pretrial hearing in the case was set for July 17, with jury selection scheduled to begin Sept. 10. Prosecutors, through Browning's testimony, gave more insight into the evidence that law enforcement used to build their case against Matthews. The fire marshal said a receipt shows Matthews bought a gas can and a package of oil rags similar to those found at the site of the fires. A lighter and the package of oil rags, missing some of its contents, were found in Matthews' truck, Browning said. He said Matthews documented the fire on his cellphone, while video surveillance in the area around the churches showed a truck similar to the one Matthews drives. Matthews had copies of news reports about the fires on his phone as well, Browning said. ""He actually superimposed himself on those news reports, claiming responsibility for these fires,"" Browning said. In addition, Browning said video on Matthews' phone showed a conversation with a friend before the fires in which he talked about burning churches and using gasoline to do it. The fire marshal said Matthews posted on Facebook about and showed interest in a movie called ""Lords of Chaos,"" which Browning said is a recent Norwegian film that involved church burnings. Matthews had shown interest in ""black metal,"" an extreme subgenre of heavy metal, Browning said. The music has been linked, in some instances, to fires at Christian churches in Norway in the 1990s. ""The evidence we have was unequivocal,"" Browning said. Later he added: ""He has clearly demonstrated the characteristics of a pathological fire setter."""
Regular marijuana users may need heavier sedation for medical procedures,www.nbcnews.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/regular-marijuana-users-may-need-heavier-sedation-medical-procedures-n994931,"Patients getting surgery may need higher levels of anesthesia if they are regular marijuana users , a new study suggests. After reviewing the medical records of 250 Colorado patients who got colonoscopies and other endoscopic procedures, researchers determined that regular marijuana users needed more anesthesia than those who didn't use cannabis, according to the study published in the Annals of the American Osteopathic Association. In fact, marijuana users needed more than twice the amount of propofol, a powerful anesthetic, compared to others, the researchers found.
“Although marijuana use has been legalized for recreational and medical use in many states, it’s been a very poorly studied substance,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Mark Twardowski, a specialist in internal medicine who is in private practice in Colorado. “So we can’t say it doesn’t have an effect on other medications and substances that patients might be using. Our study demonstrates that it seems to have an effect on at least the classes of medication used for sedation for simple endoscopic procedures.”
Related storyline Daily use of powerful pot linked to severe mental disorders, European study finds Twardowski typically starts with a low dose of the sedating medications and increases the amount until the patient is relaxed, but awake, and is comfortable during the procedure.
“Usually you know you need more if the patient tells you they’re feeling uncomfortable or you notice them starting to grimace or start shifting around on the table,” he explained.
“Knowing if someone is using marijuana regularly might affect how we do anesthesia.
Twardowski got the idea for his study after noticing that marijuana users seemed to require higher levels of sedation, he said. He and his colleagues reviewed files on patients who had gotten endoscopic procedures between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 — a period when cannabis was legal — at an endoscopy center located in the surgical services department at a Level III trauma hospital in a small Colorado city.
Out of the 250 patients examined in the study, 25 were regular cannabis users. When the researchers compared the records of the 25 to those from non-users they found increased levels of all three sedatives had been needed to achieve the right level of anesthesia. Compared to non-users, regular marijuana users required:
14 percent more fentanyl 19.6 percent more midazolam 220.5 percent more propofol Twardowski said his findings underscore the importance of patients telling their surgeons about marijuana use.
“Knowing if someone is using marijuana regularly might affect how we do anesthesia,” he explained.
Marijuana-related ER visits spike at Colorado hospital after legalization March 26, 2019 00:00 The fear, Twardowski said, is that increasing those medications might end up “pushing high the danger of shutting off a patient’s respiration — while still not achieving pain control.”
The new findings weren’t a surprise to Dr. Ajay Wasan, a professor of anesthesia and psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and vice chair for pain medicine in the department of anesthesia at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
“Any kind of brain-altering substance can have an effect on another brain-altering drug,” Wasan said.
While the new study includes just 25 cannabis users, “it’s completely consistent with other small similar previous studies,” Wasan said after reading the research. “All together they suggest long-term marijuana use has an impact on anesthesia care.”
Studies like this one add to the growing evidence of emerging health problems that recreational marijuana use can have, Wasan said.
“We’re getting all these signals from different parts of the health care system. One important message is that we have to use California and Colorado as learning labs,"" he said.
Because cannabis was designated by the DEA as a Schedule 1 drug alongside substances such as LSD, heroin and MDMA, researchers have not had the opportunity to fully investigate marijuana. There’s no question that there needs to be more research on cannabis , said Dr. Anthony Watkins, an assistant professor of surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine and an abdominal transplant surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.
“We do know that there are some drugs that are commonly prescribed to patients that marijuana can either decrease or increase the breakdown of,” Watkins said.

What's hot at this year's New York Auto Show,www.nbcnews.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/what-s-hot-year-s-new-york-auto-show-n994456,"The New York International Auto Show opens to the public on Friday, marking the end of the annual auto show season that began in Paris in the fall. Close to 20 different manufacturers will stage major debuts this year, from a family-friendly Porsche to a Bugatti expected to cost as much as $4 million.
Here’s a look at some of the hippest, hottest, and fastest new models on show at the 2019 NYIAS:
Acura TLX PMC
The Acura TLX sedan is back in the Big Apple, having made its debut in 2014. But Honda’s luxury brand is polishing this apple by introducing a special edition, the TLX PMC. It’s a bespoke version that will be largely hand built at the same, special production center that handles Acura’s two-seat supercar, the NSX. Priced at around $50,000, the TLX PMC will feature a high-performance version of the marque’s VTEC V-6 driving power to all four wheels through the Acura Super-Handling All-Wheel-Drive system.
2020 Acura TLX PMC Edition Dan Howell / Acura Audi R8 Decennium
Volkswagen’s biggest luxury brand has an assortment of announcements, including a new version of its compact Q3 crossover, as well as updates of the TT RS sports coupe, and the R8 supercar. All versions of the R8 will now be able to top 200 mph. The two-seater also will break the $200,000 barrier with the introduction of the limited-edition Decennium model. Meant to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the R8 line, only 500 copies will be brought to the U.S., at a price of $216,245 each.
Audi R8 Decennium Audi Bugatti “110 ans Bugatti” Chiron Sport
One of the most exclusive brands in the world, Bugatti produces barely one car a week, but it has been adding a series of special editions that are more powerful and more exclusive. The latest is a version of the Chiron Sport meant to mark the marque’s 110th anniversary. Though the brand may be owned by Germany’s VW, Bugatti loves to emphasize its roots by, among other things, incorporating the French tricolor on this model’s mirror caps. The 280 mph hypercar is expected to be priced around $4 million.
Bugatti ""110 ans Bugatti"" Chiron Sport Bugatti Cadillac CT5
Like most manufacturers, Cadillac is rolling out an assortment of new SUVs, such as the XT4 that debuted at last year’s NYIAS. But the brand remains “very much committed to sedans,” said Cadillac President Steve Carlisle, and it plans to prove that with the launch of the new CT5m which features a new take on the Art & Science design theme that has made Cadillac a visual standout. The brand bills the CT5 as a “driver’s car,” with the sort of performance and handling you can rarely get out of a tall and boxy SUV.
Cadillac's CT5 Sport Cadillac Jaguar XE
Jaguar is aiming to broaden the appeal of its compact sport sedan by adding two new special editions. That includes the 300 Sport, with its 296-horsepower turbocharged-four engine, as well as the Landmark Edition, which features a distinctive front bumper, 18-inch alloy wheels and some unique interior details.
Jaguar 2020 XE sports sedan Jaguar Koenigsegg Jesko
The Swedish carmaker has a history of pushing the limits, and the new Jesko is no exception. Able to punch out 1,578 horsepower and 1,160 pound-feet of torque, it will become one of the world’s fastest and most powerful vehicles, with a top speed claimed to reach around 300 mph. Named after the father of the company’s founder, it is envisioned as more of a grand tourer, with more precise handling than the current Koenigsegg speed king, the Agera.
Koenigsegg Jesko Eric Griess / Koenigsegg Lincoln Corsair
Like its cross-town rival, Cadillac, Ford’s Lincoln brand has been struggling to rebuild its once-formidable reputation. It is winning kudos with a series of new crossover-utility vehicles, such as the big Aviator that debuted in New York last year. The Corsair is its downsized sibling and replaces the old Lincoln MKC. Though small, the Corsair is expected to be loaded with upscale features.
The Lincoln Motor Company will debut the all-new Lincoln Corsair on April 17, at the 2019 New York International Auto Show. Lincoln Motor Company Maserati Levante One of One
There’s a growing market for limited editions and other exclusive products, and Fiat Chrysler’s Maserati brand aims to burnish its image with a new program, dubbed One of One, that will allow customers to extensively customize their vehicles. Not surprisingly, the customization program will begin with a special Levante SUV featuring an exclusive interior designed by Italy’s fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
Maserati Levante ONE OF ONE Allegra Antinori Maserati Mercedes-AMG CLA 35
Mercedes is introducing eight new models in New York, including four AMG offerings, such as the CLA 35. The basic CLA has become a compact design icon with its distinctive, coupe-like shape. Now, add a 302-horsepower twin-turbo engine that will launch it from 0 to 60 in 4.6 seconds. The CLA 35 will also feature Mercedes’ new voice assistant.
Mercedes-AMG CLA 35 Mercedes-Benz Pininfarina Battista
There are plenty of skeptics when it comes to battery-electric vehicles, but resistance is fading among performance fans, and the Pininfarina Battista underscores why. The stunning shape was developed by one of the world’s most well-respected design houses. For power, the Italians reached out to Rimac, a Croatian start-up specializing in electric drive technology. Named for Pininfarina’s founder, the Battista 1,900 hp can hit 186 mph.
The Pininfarina Battista’s stunning shape houses electric drive technology that lets the hypercar hit 186 mph. Automobili Pininfarina Porsche Cayenne Coupe
It may be best known for sports cars like the 911, but Porsche defied the naysayers when it launched its original Cayenne SUV and followed up with the Macan, now its best-selling model. Like so many other luxury brands, it is adapting to a world in which sport-utility vehicles are rapidly taking the place of sports cars, and that means expanding the line-up with a more coupe-like version of the Cayenne.
Porsche Cayenne Coupe Porsche Range Rover Velar SVAutobiography Dynamic Edition
Britain’s Land Rover is rapidly expanding its line-up, especially among its most exclusive Range Rover family. With its 5.0-liter supercharged V-8 punching out a hefty 550 horsepower, this new version of the luxurious Velar will be able to hit 60 before you can get its name out of your mouth. To complement the performance upgrade, the Velar SVA features a new grille and bumper vents meant to improve engine breathing, as well as quad tailpipes and interior upgrades.

"In a record-long bull market, why are some big banks coming up short?",www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/who-s-not-enjoying-country-s-record-economic-growth-some-n995011,"Wall Street has been watching closely as the biggest U.S. banks have reported first-quarter earnings over the last several days, trying to interpret what the results mean not just for the present, but for the future. “The issue, I believe, isn’t where we are today, but what does the near term hold?” said banking analyst Bert Ely.
Most of the banking sector’s results have been a mixed bag: Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase each hit profit records, with Chase beating analysts’ expectations on revenue, as well.
Wells Fargo beat analysts’ expectations for per-share earnings, but the company warned that net interest income — a key profit metric — is likely to drop by up to 5 percent this year. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and M&T Bank also all beat profit expectations while missing on revenue.
“The guidance you’re seeing from a lot of banks just isn’t all that positive,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
Some of that is due to the different types of financial activities and services in which specific banks specialize.
“It’s the haves and have-nots. For banks that are more focused on capital markets activity such as Goldman, it was a pretty weak quarter… despite what was clearly a very robust quarter for equities,” said Stephen Biggar, director of financial services research at Argus Research.
While ordinary Americans were happy to see their 401(k) balances recovering in the first quarter of 2019 after the market’s wild ride in the final weeks of 2018, a more placid environment isn’t necessarily good for bank bottom lines. “Banks make money, generally, on volatility,” Biggar said.
Since spending and borrowing by both consumer and businesses remains robust, banks with a bigger retail or “Main Street” footprint fared better on the strength of commercial lending, consumer spending, and credit cards. However, analysts question how long this momentum can be sustained, especially as the stimulative effect of tax cuts fades, and whether banks will sacrifice quality for quantity.
“I think the big question today is what’s coming down the road,” Ely said. “There are growing concerns about credit quality, in the consumer area, in business loans and in real estate, both in commercial real estate and housing.”
Interest rates present another challenge. Since higher rates contribute to higher net interest income, a more passive Federal Reserve could leave banks with fewer ways to generate growth.
“A tailwind for banks over the past two years has been the higher short-term rates,” Biggar said. “But obviously, as the Fed backs off, that means banks will no longer have this as a tailwind.”
With revenue growth falling short, this suggests a worrisome trend: That banks are propping up profits with aggressive cost-cutting to please investors in the short term.
“The tricky part, from a cost-cutting standpoint, is you can only cut so far,” Samana said. “If the core of the banking business is net interest income and the yield curve is at flat as it is, it’s a very difficult story.”
And all of this is unfolding during the longest-running bull market, in a climate of near-full employment and low inflation — in other words, about as good an overall economic picture as banks could hope to see.
“The sense is that there’s more downside risk than upside potential at this point,” Ely said. “At the moment, things are about as good as they’re going to get.”

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 16, 2019, 3:43 PM GMT By Dartunorro Clark Two House committees have issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions for information on President Donald Trump’s finances. The chairs of the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees said in statements to NBC News on Tuesday that they are working in tandem to probe the president’s financial ties. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said they're pursuing the information as part of their investigation into ""allegations of potential foreign influence on the U.S. political process,"" adding that the committees issued a “friendly subpoena” to Deutsche Bank, which has longstanding ties to the president. “As part of our oversight authority and authorized investigation into allegations of potential foreign influence on the U.S. political process, the House Intelligence Committee today issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions in coordination with the House Financial Services Committee, including a friendly subpoena to Deutsche Bank, which has been cooperative with the Committees,” he said. “We look forward to their continued cooperation and compliance.” House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said: “The potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern. The Financial Services Committee is exploring these matters, including as they may involve the President and his associates, as thoroughly as possible pursuant to its oversight authority, and will follow the facts wherever they may lead us."" Trump has been associated with Deutsche Bank since the late 1990s , a time when the big Wall Street banks wouldn't lend to him following a series of business mishaps. Eric Trump, the president's son and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, slammed the subpoenas as an ""abuse of power"" in a statement to NBC News. “This subpoena is an unprecedented abuse of power and simply the latest attempt by House Democrats to attack the President and our family for political gain,"" he said. ""Instead of legislating, the committee is obsessed with harassing and undermining my father’s administration, doing everything they can to distract from his incredible accomplishments. This incompetence is the exact reason why the American people have such disdain for politicians and why my father was elected President. Today’s actions by the committee set a horrible precedent for all taxpayers.” Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Kerrie McHugh told NBC News that the bank “is engaged in a productive dialogue"" with the two committees. ""We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations,"" McHugh said. Schiff told The New Yorker in a profile published in December that he is interested in the German financial institution because of its longtime relationship with Trump and its past ties to Russian money laundering. In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $630 million by New York and British financial regulators for its role in a Russian money-laundering scheme. Trump's financial disclosures showed he held roughly $360 million in debt to the bank before his election as president, The Washington Post reported in 2016. Schiff told NBC News' “Meet The Press” in December that Trump's records with Deutsche Bank could expose ""a form of compromise"" with Russia. ""Well, the concern about Deutsche Bank is that they have a history of laundering Russian money,"" Schiff said. “And this, apparently, was the one bank that was willing to do business with the Trump Organization."" Schiff added, ""If this is a form of compromise, it needs to be exposed.” Trump said in 2017 that any efforts by special counsel Robert Mueller to look into his business dealings would be crossing ""a red line."" He also reportedly exploded in anger after erroneous news reports that Mueller had subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, which led Trump to consider firing Mueller in early December 2017, The New York Times reported, citing White House officials, people close to the president and others familiar with the episode. New York Attorney General Letitia James' office also issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank in March as part of an inquiry into a set of major Trump Organization projects, a source familiar with the investigation told NBC News .

Sept. 16, 2015: Undergoes second back surgery — a micro-discectomy — to remove a disc fragment that was pinching his nerve. October 2015: Hasa third back procedure to relieve discomfort in his back and sets no timetable for his return to the PGA Tour. April 20, 2017: Undergoes a fourth back surgery. The spinal fusion, labeled a ‘success’ by his surgeon, Dr. Richard Guyer, to alleviate pain he had been experiencing in his back and leg. How his knee affected his back “Knee injuries are often one of the first injuries we see in golfers,” Dr. Alpesh Patel, chief of orthopedic spine surgery at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital, in Chicago said. “Once their mechanics are off, then we’ll see back injuries secondarily. So, it’s not uncommon that in Tiger’s story we saw a chain link between one and the other.” Patel notes that this sequelae of injuries doesn’t just happen in competitive golfers but also occurs in recreational golfers — except later in life. “We may first see these arthritic issues starting in late 30s and early 40s — as opposed to the late 20s and 30s as in Tiger’s case — and then back injuries in mid to late 40s,” Patel said. Dr. Todd J. Albert, orthopedic spine surgeon and surgeon-in-chief at the Hospital for Special Surgery , in New York, also notes the role that genetics plays in degenerative conditions that plague the knee and back. “More than likely, Tiger’s knee and back conditions were related. His genetics might be such that he had some early degeneration of his cartilage in his knee that caused him to change his swing mechanics and exacerbated the degenerative cartilage in his back. In other words, his knee degeneration and his disk degeneration may be related,” Albert said. The back fusion surgery that was key According to TigerWoods.com , Woods’ bottom lower-back disc severely narrowed, causing sciatica and severe back and leg pain. He tried conservative therapy, which included rehabilitation, medications, limiting activities and injections, but it failed to resolve his pain, so Woods opted to have surgery. The procedure was a minimally invasive surgery called an Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion which entails removing the damaged disc and re-elevating the collapsed disc space to normal levels. This allows the diseased vertebrae to heal to the other. The surgery gave Woods the ability to stand pain free. Dr. Richard Guyer of the Center for Disc Replacement at the Texas Back Institute performed Woods' surgery.

In essence by repairing that vertebrae you are taking that sick motion out of the matrix where he was repeatedly injuring himself. It was the right procedure for him. He is also an amazing athlete with great determination,” Albert said. Publicly Woods tempered his expectations. “When healed, I look forward to getting back to a normal life, playing with my kids, competing in professional golf and living without the pain I have been battling so long,” he said in a 2017 statement. Woods’ surgery is unique because it was performed on the front side of his body where less muscle is affected. The typical recovery is fairly quick and most people are able to walk immediately after surgery, Patel says. “Patients are out [of the hospital] within a day or two. If someone is doing desk work, they might be back to work in 3 to 4 weeks. For someone who is doing low or moderate forms of exercise, they are back in 3 to 4 months. For higher intensity sports, or return to competitive golf … 9 to 12 months, but recreationally maybe a little sooner,” he added. The best recovery yet Both Albert and Patel point out that there are many popular misconceptions and beliefs about spine surgery, citing that some of these opinions stem from the fact that spinal injury is only rocommended in extreme cases. Albert notes that too many fusions have been done when more conventional methods such as physical therapy, yoga and Pilates could be used to increase core strength, thereby decreasing the strain put on the neck and lower back. “The only indications for a surgery like this are for cases of proven instability, multiple failed disk operations that have resulted in collapse, or repeated failures of conventional therapies,” Albert told NBC News. People experiencing progressive neurological symptoms, such as weakness, numbness and/or tingling in the legs should seek medical attention as early intervention decreases the likelihood of having surgery, he added. Related Tiger Woods' comeback could make him more valuable — and net him $100M Patel cautions against people with mild or moderate back pain from seeking surgery as a first option, but highlights that Woods' redemption story is an example of great care and perseverance intersecting with dedicated rehab. “There is quite a bit of debate as to whether back surgery works and there is variability in the outcome of treatment, but I think successful outcomes increase with a clear diagnosis, a highly motivated patient, and shared decision making,” Patel said. “In a well-chosen patient, these surgeries can have good results. Tiger's recovery is probably the best yet. But I fear that people can go overboard, and say, 'hey, this works for Tiger and this will work for me'.” Shamard Charles, M.D. Dr. Shamard Charles is a physician-journalist for NBC News and Today, reporting on health policy, public health initiatives, diversity in medicine, and new developments in health care research and medical treatments.

Writer of Netflix's upcoming 'Selena: The Series' commemorates her birthday,www.nbcnews.com,Kristina Puga,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/writer-netflix-s-upcoming-selena-series-commemorates-her-birthday-n994521,"The late ""Queen of Tejano"" music, Selena Quintanilla, would have been 48 on Tuesday. The bicultural and bilingual singer who broke records and whose success was cut short when she was murdered at 23 by her fan club manager in 1995, is a musical and cultural touchstone for generations of Latinos who identified with her life.
Tejano music star Selena, performs in the Alamodome in San Antonio, on March 18, 1995. Selena was killed March 31, 1995, in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Yolanda Saldivar, who managed Selena's boutique in San Antonio, has been charged in the killing. Morris Goen / San Antonio Express-News via AP, file “She was part of my existence as a Latino boy,” said Moisés Zamora , the head writer and one of the executive producers for Netflix’s “Selena: The Series,” which is expected to air in 2020.
“I associated her with my family and being Mexican in America.” he said in a phone interview with NBC News.
It's how Selena navigated her cultural identity — she was a young woman of Mexican heritage who grew up in Corpus Christi speaking English, yet rose to fame singing in Spanish — that resonated with Zamora's own situation.
Zamora, 40, was in high school when he discovered the music of the crossover singing sensation.
""As long as I stay true to who I am, I think it’s going to be okay,"" he said of the way he approaches his life, including his upcoming Netflix project, something he has learned from the late singing legend.
Zamora couldn't talk about specifics surrounding the much anticipated Netflix series, which will be a coming-of-age story about Selena's life. Campanario Entertainment will executive produce alongside Suzette Quintanilla (Selena’s sister), and Gio Ximenez (who was a co-producer for “American Crime”) will be co-executive producer.
Zamora, who has worked as a staff writer on two other TV shows — the Emmy-winning series “American Crime” and “Star” on Fox, said he recognizes the pressure and anticipation around the Selena series.
""Now I have a chance to create this epic drama,"" he said. He wants to create a show that people like and want to binge watch on Netflix.
""One of the things that helps me is that this feels so familiar,"" he said, referring to tackling something big and life-changing. ""This feels like so many journeys I see around me through my family.""
Zamora was born and raised in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. But when he was 11, his family moved to Loyalton, California and later, to the state's agricultural hub of Central Valley.
Moises Zamora with his ""Selena"" notebook. Courtesy of Moises Zamora Zamora’s father, a doctor, worked at a medical clinic where many of his patients were farmworkers.
“My dad would tell me all the stories of the laborers - no water, extreme heat conditions,"" said Zamora.
He used that knowledge when he wrote for the third season of the television show “American Crime"" in 2016.
“What was really wonderful about that job was that everything came full circle,” he explained. “The third season is about field workers in California — the abuse, exploitation, injuries,"" he said. ""I know that world really well.""
Like Selena, Zamora harnessed his family's and his own bicultural and bilingual upbringing in his work, which, apart from TV writing includes an award-winning documentary, a book and writing for film.
Zamora went to Brown University and majored in international relations, but he later realized that what he really wanted to do was write.
He delved back into his first language, Spanish, and at 25 wrote a coming-of-age novel, “Susurros bajo el agua” (“Whispers Under the Water”), published in 2005. The story, told through the eyes of a 16-year-old, is about a prodigy raised by a single mom who lied to him about his identity, and he goes on a search for it. It won the Binational Literary Prize for Young Novel Border of Words.
For Zamora, there was something about writing in Spanish that pulled him into exploring deeper into himself.
“When I would get sad and emotional – [my internal] language would change from English to Spanish. It felt a little closer to my heart,” he said. “I noticed my poetic self more truthful in Spanish.""
Related News Selena forever: Iconic Tejano star's legacy lives on 23 years after her death Despite being educated primarily in English, Zamora still felt he had to thrive in Spanish before he could do so in English, and Selena was an inspiration in that area.
“I had to succeed in Spanish before I could succeed in English, which is somewhat what Selena did — succeed in Spanish first before making her English crossover,"" said Zamora.
""There is a poem called, ‘Roots and Wings,' that’s kind of my immigrant experience,"" Zamora added, ""uprooted from Mexico, but at the same time given wings.”
He worked in advertising for a number of years, moving up to creative director, when he was approached by a friend at USC to help with a short film. Through this experience, he realized he enjoyed the collaborative nature of producing a film, which led down a different, and fruitful path.
His first film, ""Young and Mexican,"" received the Best Documentary by a Mexican Director award at the Oaxaca Film Festival in 2011. The documentary delved into the idea of what would have happened if he stayed in his hometown.
After the documentary's success, Zamora took a screenwriting class at UCLA and went in that direction.
Throughout his educational and professional evolution, Zamora was also going through another process that wasn't easy for a child of immigrants.
“I was 19 when I came out to my mother and brother,"" said Zamora, who is gay. ""I came out to my father two years later over Christmas. He asked me out of the blue, and I couldn't lie to him.""
Related News Love Selena? Forever 21 launches 'White Rose' clothing collection He said his father cried that whole night, although he jokes that it was actually easier coming out to his parents than telling them he wanted to be a writer, because as immigrant parents, they always dreamed of him becoming a doctor or lawyer - a profession that, to them, made the move to the U.S. “worth it.”
“When you give all these choices to your kid, and they choose the one they don’t understand...” explained Zamora. “They were like ‘What?!’”
Yet like Selena, the life that Zamora took was different than his Mexican parents and relatives before him — yet ultimately he achieved success and carved his own path.
This is a theme that Zamora, like many U.S. Latinos, is fascinated by. In fact, one of his future projects is about a Mexican-born prodigy, Dafne Almazán , who at 17 is the youngest grad student enrolled at Harvard in 100 years.
“I have the rights to produce a TV show about her,” said Zamora, who is developing the show for his production company ""Ten Pesos.""
Succeeding while toggling two cultures and navigating two languages is one of Selena's enduring legacies that many Hispanics understand.
When Selena crossed over to singing in English, Zamora said, she wasn't going from one ""identity"" to another, like he previously thought. That's who she was.
“I didn’t get to analyze that until a lot later,” he said. “Both of my worlds were merging, and I think she did that for a lot of people, and why she’s so wonderful.""

"'You only get to be one person': Buttigieg, Maddow on coming out, weight of 'the closet'",www.nbcnews.com,Brooke Sopelsa,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/you-only-get-be-one-person-buttigieg-maddow-coming-out-n994946,"It's been less than four years since gay marriage was legalized in the U.S., and LGBTQ people still face hurdles in adopting children, joining the military and buying wedding cakes. But on primetime TV Monday night, a remarkable conversation took place: A presidential contender and one of the country’s most-watched cable news hosts discussed the weight of the metaphorical closet and their experiences in coming out as gay. “You went through college, and then the Rhodes Scholarship process and getting the Rhodes scholarship and going to work for McKinsey and joining the Navy and deploying to Afghanistan and coming home and running for mayor in your hometown and getting elected before you came out at the age of 33,” MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said to Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, on her show Monday night. “I think it would have killed me to be closeted for that long.”
Buttigieg on coming out as gay: 'You only get to be one person' April 16, 2019 05:15 “It was hard,” replied Buttigieg, who announced his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination over the weekend. “It was really hard.”
“Coming out is hard, but being in the closet is harder,” said Maddow, a fellow Rhodes scholar who came out during college.
In addition to coming out to others, Buttigieg, now 37, revealed it also took him “plenty of time to come out to myself.”
“There were certainly plenty of indications by the time I was 15 or so that I could point back and be like, ‘Yeah, yeah, this kid’s gay,’ but I guess I just needed to not be,” he explained. “There’s this war that breaks out, I think, inside a lot of people when they realize they might be something that they’re afraid of, and it took me a very long time to resolve that.”
Related NBC OUT NBC OUT Almost 70 percent of Americans OK with gay presidential candidate, poll finds In addition to the struggles many people face coming out as gay, at the time Buttigieg was planning to come out, he was also an officer in the United States Navy Reserve and an elected official in Indiana. He told Maddow he assumed at the time that both roles were “totally incompatible with being out.”
Initially, Buttigieg said, the demands of his job as mayor forced him to put his personal life on the back burner.
“I did get a lot of meaning from that work, and in some ways, because it was so demanding, I almost didn’t mind for a sort of inordinately long time that I didn’t have much of a personal life,” he said. “The city was a jealous bride for a long time and kept me busy.”
However, a seven-month deployment to Afghanistan in 2014 really put him “over the top.”
“I realize that you only get to be one person,” he told Maddow. “You don’t know how long you have on this earth, and by the time I came back, I realized, ‘I’ve got to do something.’”
Buttigieg came out in a June 2015 op-ed in The South Bend Tribune just before the Supreme Court’s landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S.
“I was well into adulthood before I was prepared to acknowledge the simple fact that I am gay. It took years of struggle and growth for me to recognize that it’s just a fact of life, like having brown hair, and part of who I am,” Buttigieg wrote. “Like most people, I would like to get married one day and eventually raise a family. I hope that when my children are old enough to understand politics, they will be puzzled that someone like me revealing he is gay was ever considered to be newsworthy.”
Related NBC OUT NBC OUT Buttigieg goes from cordial to critical of Pence on campaign When Maddow asked if Buttigieg thought coming out could cost him re-election, he revealed he was unsure.
“I felt like I had done a good job by the people of South Bend, and I had some level of trust that I would be rewarded for that with a re-election, but there’s no way to really know,” he said. “There’s no playbook, no executive in Indiana had ever been out, and so it was kind of a leap of faith.”
Buttigieg was re-elected in 2015 with nearly 80 percent of the vote — a wider margin than his election in 2011.
When it comes to the presidential election, Buttigieg said most people are “either supportive or even enthusiastic about the idea of the first out person going this far.” And he’s right: A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found nearly 70 percent of U.S. voters were either enthusiastic (14 percent) or comfortable (54 percent) with a gay or lesbian presidential candidate. This is up from 43 percent in 2006.

— Carrie Dann (@CarrieNBCNews) April 1, 2019 Buttigieg told Maddow at the very least, he hopes his will make it easier “for the next person who comes along.”
The conversion between Maddow and Buttigieg garnered a significant amount of social media attention. The country singer Chely Wright, who is lesbian, revealed she was in “tears” watching the segment.
“I came out 9 years ago and I feel like now— in this very moment— there’s is a tangible shift,” she wrote on Twitter.
I’m in tears as I watch @PeteButtigieg on @maddow @MaddowBlog .

In the image, captured by Brooke Windsor, a man is seen spinning the child in the air outside the Paris landmark. The man and child, who Windsor believes are a father and his daughter, are smiling at each other. ""I almost went up to the dad and asked if he wanted it,"" Windsor tweeted Monday.

Brooke Windsor took a photo of a father and daughter dancing outside the Notre Dame before a fire broke out at the cathedral on April 15, 2019. Brooke Windsor In an update Tuesday, Windsor said she has not been able to find the pair but was ""hopeful."" About an hour after the touching moment was captured on camera, many onlookers were left in tears as they watched a massive fire rip through the historic church causing the building's roof to collapse and destroying a spire. The blaze began at 6:50 p.m. after the cathedral had closed to the public. No one was killed, but two police officers and a firefighter were injured. Around 400 firefighters worked to contain the inferno, which was extinguished early Tuesday after a nine-hour battle. The city's fire service said in a tweet that the cathedral's structure was saved and that ""main works of art are safe."" A spokesman for Paris' City Hall told NBC News that some of the church's famed rose windows and main organ were in good condition, and the cathedral's ""most precious treasures"" had been spared from the flames and moved to an undisclosed location.

Notre Dame fundraiser laments that surge in donations didn't come sooner,www.nbcnews.com,Alexander Smith,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/notre-dame-adviser-laments-frustrating-donations-only-came-after-fire-n994916,"The devastating fire that ripped through Notre Dame Cathedral has encouraged an outpouring of support from wealthy philanthropists, with billionaires and major companies pledging hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild the ravaged structure. But these large donations have been met with exasperation by the building's senior fundraising adviser, who is asking why it took such a tragic event to raise money the church has desperately needed for years.
""It's very, very frustrating,"" the adviser, Michel Picaud, told NBC News. ""The importance of restoring this cathedral is only in the full light today, which is frustrating because part of it has been burned in the fire and has now disappeared.""
Related News News Parisians grieve, pay their respects to Notre Dame Cathedral ""I think if the restoration work had been already carried out it would have minimized the risk of fire, but as long as we do not know the reason for this catastrophe it is too early to say for sure,"" Picaud added.
At 859 years old, Notre Dame was in dire need of repair before Monday's fire .
The 300-foot spire that crumbled in the blaze already had a large number of cracks that needed ""immediate restoration,"" according to the cathedral's website. Many gargoyles were in disrepair and the shifting buttresses were ""causing problems for the stability of the whole building,"" it said.
In 2014, France's Ministry of Culture said the work would require 150 million euros in funding (around $169 million). But until Monday raising the cash had proved difficult.
Now, after part of the building has been gutted by fire, some of France's richest people and companies have pledged at least 500 million euros to the rebuilding effort.
Picaud lamented the paradoxical situation in which he now has more than three times the amount of money he originally asked for, but only after some of the features he wanted to repair have been destroyed.
Although he said he was frustrated, he still was still ""quite grateful"" to those who had donated.
""We absolutely need billionaires contributing to this, because the work is now absolutely huge,"" he said.
What will happen to Notre Dame Cathedral's artwork? April 16, 2019 10:13 Because of the country's strict secular laws, Notre Dame is owned by the government, which allows the Archdiocese of Paris to use it for free. The government spends around 2 million euros a year on its upkeep, but the church says this is only enough for relatively minor repairs.
""The government is in charge of 93 cathedrals all over France, and the amount dedicated to Notre Dame de Paris was not enough for the restoration,"" Picaud said.
Susan Corr, president of the European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organisations, said this was a common fight for those trying to safeguard even the most celebrated cultural relics.
""Heritage sites come at the end of all government budgets,"" she said. ""For people who work in the field, when it comes down to it, it’s hard to get funding. The value of these sites is intrinsic in so many other ways.""
To try to make up this shortfall, a U.S.-based charity, Friends of Notre Dame, stepped in over the past year or so, raising 3.2 million euros ($3.6 million) from private donors, according to Picaud, who is also the charity's president.
Before the fire, the charity had aimed to raise 20 million euros over the next decade, added to 40 million euros pledged by the French government. Around 5.5 million euros of this pot was already being put to use, as could be seen by the scaffolding that surrounded part of the building during Monday's blaze.
Statues that stood on Notre Dame were recently removed for restoration. George Gobet The project aimed to restore the spire and its 250 tons of lead. And days before the fire, the statues of 12 apostles and four evangelists were lifted by crane and taken to southern France for restoration.
However, the pre-fire funds of 60 million euros were just over a third of the total needed. It's only now that the blaze has destroyed some of the features that were in need of repair that the required money has flooded in.
After the fire, French President Emmanuel Macron announced an international fundraising effort.
""We'll rebuild this cathedral all together,"" he said Monday night.
Related Photos: Iconic Notre Dame Cathedral through history Photos: Iconic Notre Dame Cathedral through history Photos: Iconic Notre Dame Cathedral through history Already, the family of French billionaire Bernard Arnault, along with its luxury goods group LVMH, said it would donate 200 million euros.
""The Arnault family and the LVMH Group, in solidarity with this national tragedy, joins the reconstruction efforts of this extraordinary cathedral, symbol of France, its heritage and its unity,"" according to a statement from LVMH, which is behind brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon.
Francois Henri Pinault, the head of Kering — which owns brands including Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent — vowed to donate 100 million euros.
""This tragedy is striking all the French people, and beyond that, all those attached to spiritual values,"" Pinault said in a statement. ""Faced with this tragedy, everyone wishes to give life back to this jewel of our heritage as soon as possible.""
And on Tuesday afternoon, the Bettencourt Meyers family, which owns beauty giant L'Oréal, as well as the French energy company Total announced they would be donating 100 million euros each.
Firefighters work at Notre Dame Cathedral on Tuesday. Benoit Tessier / Reuters The cathedral has bounced back before. In 1831 Victor Hugo wrote in his novel, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" that ""one cannot but regret, cannot but feel indignant at the innumerable degradations and mutilations inflicted on the venerable pile, both by the action of time and the hand of man.""
Publicity from the novel lead to it being restored in the 1800s, including the construction of the spire that was destroyed Monday. However some of that work has been criticized by architectural conservationists as sloppy and rushed, making subsequent restoration efforts even harder.
Looking to the future, Picaud says he can only hope that the surge of support from household brands will continue after the headlines fade.
""My message would be to support us in this program which will now, unfortunately, be even bigger than what we thought at the beginning,"" he said. ""And to try and fund the restoration program over the next 10 years, because I think it will take a long time.""

""Not surprisingly,"" he added, moderator Bret Baier and ""the 'audience' was so smiley and nice. Very strange.""

""(A)nd now we have @donnabrazile?"" his tweet concluded.

""Sorry I make you sick,"" Baier responded. ""Hope you feel better.""
Sanders was the first 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to do a town hall with the network. The DNC announced last month it would not allow Fox News to host any of the Democratic presidential primary debates, citing the network's close relationship with the Trump administration.
Fox News asked the DNC to reconsider, citing in part the work of Baier and Martha MacCallum, who co-moderated the Sanders' town hall.
The DNC announced in February that NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo will host the first 2020 presidential primary debate in June.

If you’re Bernie Sanders, the answer is simple — go there. Sanders stepped onto the cable channel for a town hall on Monday and worlds, for a moment, collided. More importantly, though, everyone walked away just fine. During his recent media tour earlier this year, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey talked to podcast host and Ringer CEO Bill Simmons about how the platform can leave many users with “filter bubbles and echo chambers.” Said Dorsey, ""If you follow only the perspectives you want to hear, it constantly emboldens your own view."" We exercise physically — put our body through physical discomfort, so we can better ourselves physically. In that same way, intellectual exercise, through intellectual discomfort, can lead to bettering ourselves intellectually. The April 15 event was a win-win for Sanders and for the cable news network — both from an intellectual and a strategic perspective. This is what happened on Monday, when Sen. Bernie Sanders became the first Democratic presidential candidate this election cycle to participate in a town hall on Fox News . The April 15 event was a win-win for Sanders and for the cable news network — both from an intellectual and a strategic perspective. For Sanders, the intellectual exercise of fielding questions from Fox anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum — in exchanges which were both fair and occasionally combative — allowed him to craft his policy positions in a more challenging environment. Healthy, nuanced debate is important, and a great test for a candidate who, if he succeeds in the primary, will have a far more unwieldy sparring partner in the general election. But there is another reason why this was a win for Sanders, and it’s a strategic one — Fox News’ audience is not monolithic in its conservative beliefs. Sanders knows this. When he was asked recently on “The Daily Show” about why he agreed to go on Fox News , Sanders said: “It is important to distinguish Fox News from the many millions of people who watch Fox News.” . @BernieSanders is doing a Fox News town hall. But why? — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) April 5, 2019 So — who watches Fox News? While it’s true that Fox News over-indexes as a go-to media outlet for Republicans, there are certainly Democrats and Independents tuning in as well. According to a 2017 Pew survey , while 43 percent of Fox News’ audience identify as conservative or lean Republican, 10 percent identify as liberal or lean Democrat. A 2018 Suffolk University poll found that while 67 percent of respondents said they were Republicans, that left one in three that leaned Independent or Democratic. And these are big numbers. Yes, Fox News averaged 1.4 million viewers in its total day numbers during the first quarter of 2019 — but this is just based on Nielsen’s data, and as I’ve written before , the actual number of cumulative viewers is significantly higher. That means the town hall was seen by millions of voters Sanders had the chance to appeal to. And appeal to them he did, as evidenced by this viral moment when Bret Baier asked the audience how many people would be willing to switch to a health care system more inline with Sanders' Medicare For All proposal. The response was clear. Raise your hand if you're sick and tired of your private health insurance company. We need Medicare for All. #BernieTownHall pic.twitter.com/3euHRCjqn9 — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 15, 2019 But the other side of this is the benefit to Fox News. Yes, it’s smart strategically for Fox News, which knew there would be a guaranteed amount of interest due to the inherent entertainment value. But the event’s more important benefit was as an intellectual exercise for its viewers. By exposing its viewers to a perspective they may not see or hear very often — by inviting discomfort — Fox was doing a massive service for its audience. (Although, it should be noted, Tucker Carlson’s viral segment from January railing against the ruling class was Sander-esque at times.) For once, Fox News viewers weren't hearing about Sanders’ positions from a primetime host or a three-minute segment; they were hearing about his positions from him, unfiltered. And they may have bristled at what they heard. But that sort of healthy intellectual discomfort is far too rare on both traditional and social media platforms. Sanders may not have convinced many, but exposure to different perspectives breeds tolerance. They may have bristled at what they heard. But that sort of healthy intellectual discomfort is far too rare on both traditional and social media platforms. We are at a moment — on Twitter and other platforms — where more voices than ever before have access to other voices across the spectrum. Yet we also see an urge to avoid voices that make us uncomfortable. This perspective is embodied by, for example, Kara Swisher of Recode asking the CEO of YouTube whether conservative host Ben Shapiro’s videos could be banned, after she discovered her 13-year-old was a viewer of Shapiro’s. Former President Barack Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder went Bill Maher’s HBO show shortly after the 2016 election and urg ed the host to “ban” Republican Rep. Darrell Issa because “we have to push our side.” (Maher rightfully pushed back.) Media Matters’ CEO Angelo Carusone push ed a full boycott of Fox News after the Sanders’ town hall news broke. These “filter bubbles” exist on both ends of the political spectrum. But there is something particularly illiberal and provincial about the instinct to eliminate what is deemed unacceptable thought, uncomfortable thought, or even offensive thought. (No one is saying Bernie Sanders should go on Info Wars, of course — not all outlets are deserving of bipartisan attention.) 2019 has had its first electric political moment, and it was Bernie Sanders on Fox. — Peggy Noonan (@Peggynoonannyc) April 15, 2019 With nearly 20 Democratic candidates running for president this election, every vote matters. Democratic candidates who shun Fox News, or any other venue that may be less than fully comfortable, are making both a strategic and an intellectual mistake. Pete Buttigieg knows this — he was on ""Fox News Sunday"" in March . Andrew Yang knows this — he sat down with Ben Shapiro last week for an hour-long interview. These candidates are treating the brain like a muscle and exercising it. Hopefully the audience for these conservative, alternative venues are doing the same. The DNC made the call in March to spurn Fox News as a venue for all debates during the primary, so it is incumbent on the candidates to make the call on their own. Sanders’ town hall on Fox News was a victory for healthy, intellectual discomfort. And everyone should leave the exchange of ideas better — more tolerant of alternative perspectives, more challenged in their own beliefs.
