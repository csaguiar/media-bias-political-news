Yet, soon after his winning the office, I saw that MSM was attacking him 24/7. I want my president to succeed. It was clear the MSM did not. There was no honeymoon period often seen with other presidents. I was seeing the start of Trump Derangement Syndrome. So, since about January 2017 I have not watch any MSM(CNN, MSNBC, CBS, etc). I have left MSM, and have not missed it one bit."

Lord Jesus, whatever it takes, save those babies.
Amen.

I did not say white nationalist terrorism. I said nationalist terrorism meaning homegrown over against foreign terrorism.
Most people other than the 30% or so hard core Trump supporters view White Nationalism as a euphemism for White Supremacy. Mere jumped up bigotry dressed up and softened by an attempt to rebrand the term Supremacism."

POLLAK 7 Apr 2019 LAS VEGAS, Nevada — President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence both spoke at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership meeting at the Venetian Hotel, underscoring both the importance of Jewish support to the Republican Party and the conviction that many Jews are ready to switch.

That might seem a false hope after the 2018 midterm elections, when more than 75 percent of Jews voted for Democratic candidates.
But Trump’s unparalleled record on Israel, his family ties to the Jewish community, and the Democrats’ growing hostility to Israel and tolerance for antisemitism have clearly convinced Republican leaders that Jewish support is worth courting aggressively.
Prior to Trump’s address, four former Democrats took the stage — all of whom had voted for Barack Obama at least once — to explain why they had each shifted their allegiances to the Republican Party.
Former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN), who was once a harsh critic of Trump, told the audience of about 2,000 that he had been wrong. Citing the traditional Passover song of “Dayenu” (“It would have been enough”), in which the recurring theme is one of gratitude for each miracle performed during the Exodus from Egypt, Coleman cited the moving of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the withdrawal from the Iran deal, the recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and the closure of the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington as great achievements that each, in themselves, would have merited a vote of thanks.
It is unclear whether Republicans’ effort will succeed. Many liberal Jews prioritize social issues like abortion above Israel, and the mainstream media — many of whom presented laughably slanted accounts of Trump’s remarks — are sticking to their 2016 theme of describing Trump as a nascent antisemite.

It will not only have to evacuate the communities around the Strip, but also [the cities of] Ashdod and Ashkelon and even Tel Aviv,” Yahya Sinwar told a group of Gaza officials. “Our fingers are on the trigger and they will remain pressed against it in order to protect our people. We will be the sword and shield,” Sinwar said, according to the Hamas-linked Al-Aqsa TV.
Sinwar also noted the role played by Egyptian mediators in negotiations to broker understandings between Israel and the terror group, saying the country “had a significant role in easing the siege imposed on Gaza, and we are grateful.” Both Israel and Egypt enforce a number of restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza. Israel says the blockade is necessary to keep Hamas and other terror groups in the Strip from arming or building military infrastructure. An Islamist terror group, Hamas seeks to destroy Israel.
