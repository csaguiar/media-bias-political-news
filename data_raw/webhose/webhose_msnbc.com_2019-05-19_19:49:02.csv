"If Romney is 'sickened' by Mueller's revelations, what will he do? | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/if-romney-sickened-muellers-revelations-what-will-he-do,"By Steve Benen The vast majority of congressional Republicans have been willing to stick to the White House’s script in the wake of the Mueller report’s release, but we’ve seen a handful of notable exceptions.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), for example, arguably Congress’ most moderate GOP member, told Maine Public Radio last week that the special counsel’s findings offered “an unflattering portrayal of the president.”
And if Collins had been in New Jersey in 1937, I suspect she might’ve described the Hindenburg as “an unfortunate transportation incident.”
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) went considerably further on Friday, issuing a written statement that read:
“It is good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President of the United States with having conspired with a foreign adversary or with having obstructed justice. The alternative would have taken us through a wrenching process with the potential for constitutional crisis. The business of government can move on.
“Even so, I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President. I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia – including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement; and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in Ukraine.
“Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders.”
The statement, not surprisingly, was not well received at the White House. Donald Trump, who’s had a strained relationship with the senator whom he considered for his cabinet, published a tweet on Saturday afternoon, mocking Romney’s defeat in the 2012 presidential election.
Putting aside the fact that Romney actually won a larger share of the popular vote than Trump, my concerns about the senator’s statement came from a very different angle.
To be sure, given that so few GOP officials were willing to say anything even remotely critical of the president, the fact that Romney responded to the Mueller report by throwing a few elbows seemed reassuring. Since Thursday morning, Republican principles have largely gone into hiding, so Romney’s public disgust stood out for a reason.
But the seven words that stood out for me in Romney’s statement were these: “The business of government can move on.”
In practical terms, the Utah Republican seems eager to have it both ways. On the one hand, Romney wants to take a stand, condemn Trump’s misdeeds, and position himself as the brave truth-teller in a party that’s too afraid of his party’s base to respond to the Mueller report with candor.
On the other hand, Romney doesn’t actually want to do anything of practical significance. His statement wasn’t intended to serve as the starting point for a conversation about how best to hold the president accountable for his transgressions; rather, the senator’s statement was apparently his end point.
After all, as Romney sees it, “The business of government can move on.”
But maybe it can’t? With the special counsel’s report detailing multiple instances in which the president lied, encouraged others to lie, and r epeatedly obstructed a federal investigation , is this really the best time to walk away from the revelations?
As the Washington Post ’s Michael Gerson noted late last week, “Already, Republicans are urging the country to move on. In this case, moving on would ignore and reward corruption on a grand scale.”

Giuliani: 'Nothing wrong' with getting campaign aid from foreign foe | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/giuliani-nothing-wrong-getting-campaign-aid-foreign-foe,"By Steve Benen Rudy Giuliani made multiple appearances on the Sunday shows yesterday, doing his best to pretend the Mueller report wasn’t devastating for his client in the Oval Office, and presenting a series of wildly unpersuasive arguments.
The Republican told CNN, for example, “There’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.” In reality, there’s plenty wrong with it. A foreign adversary launched a military intelligence operation against our elections, and the attack included stealing Americans’ materials.
For Donald Trump’s lawyers to insist there’s “nothing wrong with” a U.S. campaign accepting assistance from our international foes is to invite additional attacks.
On “Meet the Press,” Giuliani went on to tell NBC News’ Chuck Todd that the public had a “ right to know ” about the information contained in the materials the Russians stole. The former mayor compared hacked information to the Pentagon Papers.
But that’s absurd. Not only did the hacked emails not point to any Hillary Clinton wrongdoing, but Giuliani’s argument – an implicit defense of an illegal hack – could just as easily be applied to stealing others’ materials. If a hack produced the president’s tax returns, would Giuliani be equally cavalier about the public’s “right to know”?
But what struck me as especially notable was Giuliani’s response to a question about Sen. Mitt Romney’s (R-Utah) criticism . Here was the exchange between Trump’s lawyer and CNN’s Jake Tapper.
GIULIANI: What a hypocrite. What a hypocrite.
TAPPER: But why is that hypocritical?
GIULIANI: Any candidate – any candidate in the whole world, in America, would take information, negative [information].
In context, the former mayor was clearly referring to taking “information” from a foreign adversary.
Last summer, then-Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), one of Moscow’s favorites, made a similar argument, insisting “there’s not a person in this town” who wouldn’t welcome foreign intervention to win an election.
Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 5/23/18, 9:44 PM ET History highlights Trump's failure on Russian election outreach Rachel Maddow tells the story of how Adlai Stevenson, acting for the good of the country, not only rejected overtures of the Soviet Union to assist his presidential campaign but told his political rival, President Eisenhower about the matter. share tweet email save Embed The pitch hasn’t improved with age.
There’s no reason to speculate about how others might’ve acted under similar circumstances because there are some meaningful historical parallels. For example, Russia offered to help Adlai Stevenson win the White House in 1960 and held a meeting with the Illinois Democrat to offer Moscow’s assistance.
Stevenson refused, left the meeting, went home, and documented every detail he could remember. He then quickly went to the authorities , explaining that a foreign adversary had just tried to intervene in American presidential election.
Eight years later, when Russia offered similar assistance to Hubert Humphrey, that didn’t go well for the USSR, either.
“Any candidate in the whole world in America would take information” from Russia to win an election? Evidently not, Rudy.

* Prepare for a very problematic ruling : “The Supreme Court seemed willing Tuesday to let the Trump administration add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census form that goes to every U.S. household, despite claims from populous states that it would actually make the count less accurate.”
* The delay could take a while: “The House Oversight Committee has agreed to postpone its deadline for a subpoena of President Trump’s financial records until after a court rules on a lawsuit filed by the president on the matter, according to a court filing Tuesday.”
* A rare sight : ‘In a national first in the fight against the opioid crisis, a major drug distribution company, its former CEO and another top executive have been criminally charged in New York.”
* The latest on the Easter attacks : “Sri Lanka’s defense minister said Tuesday that the coordinated Easter Sunday attacks that killed at least 321 people were in retaliation for the recent Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand.”
* In case you missed this yesterday: “House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., issued a subpoena Monday to President Donald Trump’s former White House counsel Don McGahn for testimony and documents as part the panel’s investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the president and others.”
* An underappreciated point : “Climate change creates winners and losers. Norway is among the winners; Nigeria among the losers. Those are the stark findings of a peer-reviewed paper by two Stanford University professors who have tried to quantify the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions on global inequality.”
* Even for him, this was weird phrasing: “Trump claimed the New York Times had apologized to him after the 2016 election and that if they wanted his forgiveness again, they’d have to make a real gesture out of the apology: ‘Get down on their knees and beg for forgiveness.’” (Keep in mind, the newspaper never apologized to him, and it’s unclear why he keeps saying it did.)
* Consistent with a larger pattern: “President Donald Trump opened a new flank in his battle against illegal immigration on Monday when he ordered his administration to crack down on ‘visa overstays’ – foreigners who legally enter the country but remain in the U.S. after their visas expire.”
* From Team Trump to Facebook : “Facebook has hired Jennifer Newstead, a President Donald Trump-appointed legal adviser at the State Department, as its new general counsel as the company faces scrutiny from governments around the world over how it manages content and data on its sprawling social network.”

Did Mulvaney warn the DHS chief not to bring up election interference? | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/did-mulvaney-warn-the-dhs-chief-not-bring-election-interference,"By Steve Benen As important and consequential as Russia’s attack on our elections was in 2016, there’s no reason to examine the interference in a solely retrospective way. On the contrary, there’s every reason to believe officials in Moscow, pleased with the success of their previous efforts, will try again in 2020.
With this in mind, Kirstjen Nielsen, before ending her tenure as Homeland Security secretary, reportedly tried to organize a meeting of relevant cabinet secretaries to prepare a coordinated strategy in preparation for the next election cycle.
Her efforts would’ve benefited from some presidential leadership, which she never received. In fact, according to a New York Times report , acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Nielsen not to even broach the subject of foreign interference in our elections around Donald Trump, apparently because it makes the president feel bad.
Ms. Nielsen left the Department of Homeland Security early this month after a tumultuous 16-month tenure and tensions with the White House. Officials said she had become increasingly concerned about Russia’s continued activity in the United States during and after the 2018 midterm elections – ranging from its search for new techniques to divide Americans using social media, to experiments by hackers, to rerouting internet traffic and infiltrating power grids.
But in a meeting this year, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, made it clear that Mr. Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Mulvaney said it “wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below his level.”
It’s easy for many observers outside the White House to get the impression that the delicate president has a fragile ego, but this report suggests the problem might be even more severe than we’ve been led to believe.
U.S. intelligence officials believe a foreign adversary may target our elections next year, but no one should bring this up in the president’s presence, because he prefers not to be reminded of the dubious legitimacy of his own election.
The principal goal, in other words, isn’t to protect the American system of elections from a foreign attack, but rather, it’s to protect the American president’s feelings.
Making matters worse, this is not just a story about White House passivity and negligence in the face of a looming threat. On the contrary, regular readers may recall , Trump has taken some steps that might even make the problem worse.
It was, after all, just last year when the White House eliminated the job of the nation’s cyber-security czar, as part of John Bolton’s reorganization of the National Security Council.
The New York Times reported at the time, “Cyber-security experts and members of Congress said they were mystified by the move…. It was the latest in a series of steps that appeared to run counter to the prevailing view in Washington of cybersecurity’s importance.”
A year later, it’s no easier to defend the move.

SAUL LOEB Trump thinks the Supreme Court can save him from impeachment (it can’t) 04/24/19 12:45 PM By Steve Benen
Now that he’s placed two far-right jurists on the Supreme Court, Donald Trump seems convinced that the nation’s highest bench will effectively serve as a rubber stamp, clearing the way for everything he wants.
The White House agenda on DACA ? The president expects the Supreme Court to rule his way. Birthright citizenship ? The president expects the Supreme Court to rule his way. Redirecting funds through an emergency declaration ? The president expects the Supreme Court to rule his way. Tearing down his own country’s health care system ? The president expects the Supreme Court to rule his way.
Two senior administration officials told NBC News in November that “with Justice Brett Kavanaugh now on the Supreme Court,” the White House “ expects to win .”
With this mind, consider Trump’s latest mini-tantrum on Twitter.
“The Mueller Report, despite being written by Angry Democrats and Trump Haters, and with unlimited money behind it ($35,000,000), didn’t lay a glove on me. I DID NOTHING WRONG. If the partisan Dems ever tried to Impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Not only are there no ‘High Crimes and Misdemeanors,’ there are no Crimes by me at all. All of the Crimes were committed by Crooked Hillary, the Dems, the DNC and Dirty Cops - and we caught them in the act! We waited for Mueller and WON, so now the Dems look to Congress as last hope!”
Much of this is gibberish, including the assertions that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings uncovered no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Reality tells a different story , especially as it relates to obstruction of justice.
It’s also bizarre that the erratic president believes his opponents have been “caught in the act” of committing crimes – misdeeds that exist only in Trump’s mind.
But what may matter most is Trump’s intention to “head to the U.S. Supreme Court” if congressional Dems launch an impeachment effort.
We’re occasionally reminded of just how little our amateur president understands about the basics of American governance and civics. We’re also reminded that Trump doesn’t feel the need to ask anyone for clarifications about how the system works, since his misplaced confidence overshadows his ignorance.
But as someone really ought to let the president know, Congress is responsible for initiating, overseeing, and executing the impeachment process. Lawmakers, and no one else, determine whether a president has committed impeachable acts.
Trump could “head to the U.S. Supreme Court,” but there’s literally nothing justices could do for him, even if they wanted to. The judiciary has no authority to help or hinder the impeachment proceedings.
The president doesn’t know that, and while that’s embarrassing, he nevertheless seems eager to let everyone know just how confused he is.
In the process, Trump is also offering a peek into his perspective on problem-solving. When he finds himself in a jam, the president seems to instinctively look for a fixer: Trump has spent his tenure assuming that everyone from his attorney general to his congressional allies to his White House counsel can simply make his problems go away for him.
As of this morning, the president seems to think the Supreme Court can even rescue him from the threat of impeachment.
It cannot."

An excerpt from 'Our Lost Declaration' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,msnbc.com,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/excerpt-our-lost-declaration,"By Morning Joe staff Since the days when early humans first organized themselves into groups for mutual protection and assistance, human societies have imposed rules intended to keep order. As societies evolved, those rules were written down and became systems of laws. A society’s values are reflected in the system of laws it adopts to protect the rights of its people, and especially how much value that society places on each individual human soul. Sometimes these values are defined in the affirmative—when a society shows what it believes. Our American society does this in the Declaration of Independence. The Continental Congress, which approved this document, was issuing the manifesto of a new society free of British rule, one founded on a revolutionary combination of ideas.
The document leads off by explaining the truths the Congress’s members held to be self-evident: that people have certain rights; that government’s job is to protect these rights and remain answerable to the people in doing so; and that if government fails at this job the people can adjust it as they see fit. These simple statements in the Declaration’s preamble contain thousands of years of human wisdom, distilled and interpreted in the mind of an authentic American genius.
Sometimes, however, just as much can be learned about a society by the values they define in the negative—that is, when they explain what they are definitively against.
The Declaration does this, too, in the litany of grievances against King George III. This is why that section of the Declaration deserves consideration on its own, despite not being as rhetorically memorable as the passages that open and close the document. This is one of the imbalances that I have tried to correct in this book.
Most—but I fear increasingly few—Americans can recite the part of the Declaration that shows what America stands for, but fewer are familiar with the Founders’ explanation, in the same document, of what America stands against. American society remains committed to the principles of equality and liberty outlined in the Declaration’s first lines. But the grievances listed later should remind us of what we fought against, and what we must not allow ourselves to become.
As we near the first-quarter mark of the twenty-first century, the steady growth of the administrative state under presidents of both political parties has made the central government based in Washington an all- too- common intruder into the lives of most Americans. In many ways, these lessons of the eighteenth century have never been more relevant.
We must remember that the Declaration of Independence is not just a manifesto for natural human rights, but it is a manifesto against a strong central government that would infringe upon those rights. It is against “swarms of officers” that “harass” the people. It is against the unchecked growth of executive power. It is against an administrative state.
The tragedy of American legislative bodies (federal and state) in the twentieth and into the twenty-first century is one of slow and steady unilateral disarmament. Bit by bit, state legislatures have become more comfortable giving up more and more of their power to the federal government. Likewise, the Congress in Washington has turned over much of its power to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats housed within the executive branch. In many areas where Congress once reigned supreme, it has now been reduced to a token “oversight” role at best.
The steady usurpation of legislative authority by the executive branch, and of state authority by federal authority, is a creeping phenomenon that is in some ways nearly as menacing to American liberty as a royal colonial governor who woke up on the wrong side of his feather bed. And the greatest indignity is that this is a problem largely of our own making. Over the last eight decades, the people’s elected representatives have made countless choices that have steadily diminished their own power, and with it that of the people they represent. In many respects, they have done so for a simple, understandable, but indefensible reason: Delegating to others the difficult and contentious task of making law has a tendency to make reelection easier.
What is needed is an innovative, perhaps even a radical reimagining of the relationship between Congress and the executive branch, and between state governments and the federal government. This would be a system in which Congress actually exercises the power and authority it is supposed to, rather than delegating that power to a vast web of government agencies. In such a system, any powers not delegated to the federal government to the Constitution would actually be reserved for the state governments or the people, as the Tenth Amendment promises.
Although it might seem radical to us to put more power back in the hands of legislatures, that’s only because we’ve had blinders on for too long. The Founders’ original vision, forged in part by watching their elected legislatures in the colonies get trampled on and dissolved at will by the King’s appointed governors, was one that vested as much power as possible in the place where it was closest to the people— the chamber of their elected representatives. And in a republic like ours, isn’t that where most of the power should belong?
No other conclusion can be drawn from the colonists’ response to the heavy- handed actions of King George III’s government. The seeds of revolution were planted when that government, whose ruler combined a devoted British patriotism with a German absolutist idea of monarchy, decided to squeeze its American colonies tighter and tighter.
Those seeds took root when His Majesty’s royal governors shut down the colonial legislatures where the people had their only say in government. They grew whenever a citizen was dragged before one of His Majesty’s courts without benefit of a jury of his peers—a right any British subject should have enjoyed— or when the courts were shut down altogether due to conflicts with the King’s law. They flourished despite the pressure of unfair trade restrictions, attempts to control the free market for products like tea. And finally they bore the fruit of revolution.
Of course, it took the work of several skilled hands to bring that fruit to bear. Thomas Paine’s rhetoric lit the fire that would fuel the engines of independence. Edmund Randolph defied his loyalist father and fought with George Washington, then joined his fellow Virginians to lead the charge for breaking all ties with Britain. John Adams used his legal skill to remind the royal courts what justice really meant, and later added his expertise to the drafting of the Declaration. Benjamin Franklin, despite being stricken with gout, helped with the editing—and used his trademark wit to console the main author as the full Congress argued over the draft. It was Thomas Jefferson, of course, whom Franklin consoled— the man who staved off his headaches long enough to focus on the important task at hand, and shake loose from the shelves of his meticulously organized mental library the ancient and modern ideas he would use to explain the Americans’ unprecedented act to an astounded world.
These men were not perfect, and neither was the system they created. They were keenly aware that as they signed their names to a statement that “all men are created equal,” this was far from the reality for many of their fellow men and women. And for many Americans, it took far too long for this reality to come to pass. Millions of African Americans lived, worked, and died never knowing freedom simply because of the color of their skin, and their descendants in large swaths of the country were forced into second-c lass citizenry until the latter half of the twentieth century. Millions of Americans were not able to exercise that most precious of the rights of citizenship— the vote—until that same century due to their race or gender. There were the Mormons who were forced out of their communities by government forces because of their religion, and the Japanese Americans who spent years behind barbed wire on American soil because they happened to look like the enemy (even as their sons fought under the Stars and Stripes).
For many in marginalized communities in America to this day, the fight for real equality goes on. But what makes that fight so righteous is that we still look to the words of the Declaration for inspiration. When Jefferson and his colleagues signed their names to that document, they were making a bet on an idea. It’s a bet that every succeeding generation of Americans has done its best to make good on.
Sometimes making good on it means expending blood and treasure. In the midst of the greatest struggle we have yet faced to preserve our founding ideals, one of America’s greatest leaders turned to the Declaration of Independence for strength. Abraham Lincoln, despite his deep knowledge of and respect for the law rooted in the Constitution, viewed the Declaration as a perfect expression of our founding principles.
He felt there was no firmer bedrock on which our nation could stand than the simple truth that “all men are created equal.” Indeed, Lincoln observed that he “never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.” 1
In 1854, during his famous series of debates with Stephen Douglas, Lincoln called that concept “the leading principle, the sheet anchor of American republicanism.” And he used it to attack the institution of slavery, arguing that if slaves were indeed human, they too had the right to govern themselves according to the Declaration. “If the negro is a man,” said Lincoln, “why then my ancient faith teaches me that ‘all men are created equal’; and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man’s making a slave of another.” That, according to Lincoln, was “despotism”— the very charge Jefferson leveled at King George. 2
Four years later, he told an audience in Chicago that what binds us all together as Americans, whether our families had been here since the founding or came in the latest wave of immigration, was that we could all rally behind the “father of all moral principle”—that doctrine of equality expressed in the Declaration. “That is the electric cord in that Declaration,” he said, “that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty- loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.” 3 It is recorded that applause erupted after this line—and it is easy to see why.
In February 1861, as he prepared to take over the presidency of a country inching toward war over the question of slavery, Lincoln spent George Washington’s birthday in Philadelphia. In a short impromptu speech on the steps of Independence Hall, Lincoln considered the question of what had kept the country united in the decades since its founding.
He concluded that the great unifying force was “that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time.” 4
And in November 1863, as the war to make all Americans free raged around him, Lincoln addressed those gathered to dedicate a cemetery at the site of the recent Battle of Gettysburg. “Four score and seven years ago,” he told those assembled, “our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” There was his “ancient faith” again. But now he cast the current struggle in no uncertain terms as an effort to reclaim our founding principles. “Now we are engaged in a great civil war,” he said, “testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure.” It was a test that, by God’s grace, we passed.
Just as our nation has not always expressed perfectly that ideal of liberty among our fellow men, Lincoln’s additional hope that this liberty be expanded across the entire world has sadly remained unfulfilled. But Lincoln understood then what we must understand now— that the Declaration of Independence must be a guiding light, always moving ahead of us, urging us onward, urging us to ever more perfectly follow the principles it sets out.
A century after Lincoln spoke those immortal words at Gettysburg, someone else stood in front of a colossal marble statue of Lincoln and made a proclamation that was no less immortal. “Even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. assured the throngs stretched out before him, “I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.” And then he told us what the American dream meant to him. “I have a dream,” he said, “that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal.’ ” The crowd cheered. Dr. King recognized our nation’s creed in Jefferson’s words, and he was urging us to better live up to it.
This is our task as Americans today, and it will be the task for every future generation. Armed with a greater understanding of the Declaration’s principles and how it came to be, we will surely be able to fulfill it.

White House chief of staff tries to clarify Trump's illegal directives | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/white-house-chief-staff-tries-clarify-trumps-illegal-directives,"By Steve Benen When Kirstjen Nielsen was forced from her post as Homeland Security secretary, it quickly became obvious that one of the sources of tension between her and Donald Trump was her reluctance to ignore federal laws . The president reportedly urged her, repeatedly, to implement immigration policies that were “ clearly illegal ,” and when Nielsen balked, Trump grew “infuriated.”
It brought to mind recent remarks from former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who told an audience about the kind of instructions he’d receive from Trump. “So often, the president would say, ‘Here’s what I want to do and here’s how I want to do it,’” Tillerson explained . “And I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law.’”
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, of course, is also filled with examples of Trump directing people to take legally dubious actions.
But White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney sat down with The Atlantic recently, and he suggested there’s been some confusion about the president’s instructions.
Often, Mulvaney said, the president is not telling aides “to do something illegal”; he’s “just giving me ideas on what his priorities are and what he wants to accomplish.”
Oddly enough, this sounds a bit like what Tillerson said, only in a way intended to sound more flattering to the president.
Let’s say, for example, Trump speaks with Department of Homeland Security officials and tells them to start ignoring existing federal asylum laws – something the president has been accused of doing. In Mulvaney’s model, Trump hasn’t told officials “to do something illegal”; he’s simply sharing some ideas about the kind of border policies, some of which may be illegal, he’d like to see implemented.
Or put another way, the president doesn’t give directives, encouraging people who work for him to commit crimes, so much as he tells them about his priorities without any real regard for whether his goals are legal or not.
How … reassuring ?
Garance Franke-Ruta recently published a Twitter thread , highlighting “all the different ways Trump has asked people who work for him or the government to break laws.” Alas, it was not short.
Mick Mulvaney’s apparent defense of this dynamic is that Trump has actually just asked people who work for him to pursue his vision without regard for legal boundaries. The president wants what he wants, and he neither knows nor cares what’s permissible under the law.
That’s a far less persuasive defense than the White House chief of staff may realize.

Economy shows surprising resilience in early months of 2019 | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/economy-shows-surprising-resilience-early-months-2019,"By Steve Benen Economic growth in the latter half of 2018 gradually slid in the wrong direction, prompting fears of a possible economic downturn. Those concerns are a lot quieter this morning .
Reports of the demise of the U.S. economy proved unfounded as first quarter activity showed surprising strength. The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.2% annual pace in the first three months of 2019, the government said Friday.
The gain was well above forecasts. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 2.3% increase in gross domestic product…. One unexpected factor behind the acceleration in GDP growth in the first quarter was a sharp upturn in state and local government spending.
The full report from the Commerce Department is online here .
If recent history is any guide, Donald Trump and the White House will, any minute now, claim that GDP growth of 3.2% is even better than the 3% rate the Republican says was his goal, so it’s worth remembering that this morning’s report refers to quarterly growth – January through March – not annual growth. (Also, the president promised annual growth between 4% and 6% . Why he set expectations unreasonably high is still a mystery.)
What’s more, this new figure will be revised in the coming months.
Regardless, there’s no denying that 3.2% growth is the latest evidence of a healthy economy, and should bury talk of a looming recession, at least for a while.
As for the image above, the chart shows GDP numbers by quarter since the Great Recession began. The red columns show the economy under the Bush and Trump administrations; the blue columns show the economy under the Obama administration.

insists there was 'an attempted overthrow' of US government | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-insists-there-was-attempted-overthrow-us-government,"By Steve Benen On five occasions this month, Donald Trump has promoted Twitter content from others claiming there was an attempted “coup” against his administration. Last night on Fox News, the president lent his voice to the same hysterical talking point.
While discussing the origins of the Mueller probe – which he and fellow Republicans have demanded an investigation into – with his best friend and Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump called the investigation a “coup” and the “greatest political scandal” in history, even greater than Watergate.
Looking over the transcript, the president was not subtle on this point. It seemed as if Trump called into Sean Hannity’s show specifically to push this line.
“Really, it’s a coup,” Trump said. “It’s spying. It’s everything that you can imagine. It’s hard to believe in this country that we would have had that…. I really say, now we have to get down because this was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government.”
He added, “This was a coup. This wasn’t stealing information from an office in the Watergate apartments. This was an attempted coup. And it’s like a third world country – and inconceivable.”
I can appreciate the fact that we’ve all grown quite inured to Donald Trump appearing on Fox News and saying strange things. It’s an understandable reaction.
But it’s worth pausing to appreciate just how extraordinary the circumstances are. For the first time in our history, the sitting American president has told the world that there was “an attempted overthrow of the United States government” – a declaration that has been greeted with widespread shrugs, as if it were a routine Thursday night.
Because, by and large, it was. This is our life now.
In reality, I suspect most sensible observers realize there was no actual “coup” attempt. No one tried to “overthrow” anything. Donald Trump may make wild-eyed, hysterical accusations like these, targeting his political opponents, but his claims are broadly overlooked because the public realizes the president occasionally peddles nonsense that shouldn’t be taken too seriously.
That, in and of itself, is unsettling. In recent generations, the world has looked at the United States as the home of the strongest and most stable political system anywhere. The idea of a “coup” or an “attempted overthrow” is the stuff of fanciful fiction.
Except, that is, in 2019, when everyone can hear the American president share his paranoid fantasies aired live on national television.
It was especially striking to hear Trump tell Hannity, “[I]t’s like a third-world country.” That’s true, though not in the way the president probably intended.
When a leader of dubious legitimacy makes up claims of attempted coups, that is, in fact, “like a third-world country.” As of last night, it also happens to be our country.

Why Trump's new rejection to the Arms Trade Treaty matters | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-new-rejection-the-arms-trade-treaty-matters,"By Steve Benen Six years ago, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the Arms Trade Treaty on a vote of 154 to 3. While there were some abstentions, the only nations opposed to the ATT were Iran, North Korea, and Syria . The United States voted with the majority, and several months later, then-Secretary of State John Kerry officially endorsed the treaty, beginning the ratification process.
That process, at least in this country, is now dead. Donald Trump made some news at the NRA convention today, announcing the end of the United States’ support for the ATT. The Washington Post reported :
President Trump announced Friday that he would un-sign the global arms pact known as the Arms Trade Treaty in the latest illustration of his aversion to international pacts and world governance.
“We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom,” Trump said during a speech before the National Rifle Association in Indianapolis. “I’m officially announcing today that the United States will be revoking the effect of America’s signature from this badly misguided treaty.”
Specifically, the president added that he intends to formally ask the Senate to end the ratification process, so that he can “dispose of” the treaty (which, evidently, the Senate will have already done).
When the assembled crowd applauded this afternoon, Trump said, “I’m impressed. I didn’t know too many of you would know what it is.”
That’s probably because he didn’t know what it was. In fact, given his rhetoric today, Trump still doesn’t know much about the treaty he’s eager to “dispose of,” or why he’s aligning the United States with Iran, North Korea, and Syria.
The Arms Trade Treaty would not affect Americans Second Amendment rights at all. If ratified, the measure would have literally no bearing on existing U.S. gun laws, and it would place no new limits on consumer access to firearms or individual ownership of guns. Period. Full stop.
Rather, the point of the treaty, since the beginning, has been to set controls on the international gun trade based on whether the weapons would be “used to break humanitarian law, foment genocide or war crimes, abet terrorism or organized crime or slaughter women and children.”
As John Kerry explained after helping negotiate it, “It will help reduce the risk that international transfers of conventional arms will be used to carry out the world’s worst crimes, including terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.”
And yet, as longtime readers may recall, Republicans have ignored the unambiguous text of the treaty and come up with some bizarre justifications to opposes it. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), for example, insisted that abiding by the treaty would lead to an international registry of American gun owners and “full-scale gun confiscation.”
Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) added in 2013 that the treaty was part of an effort to “sign away our laws to the global community and unelected U.N. bureaucrats.”
It’s never been altogether clear whether Republicans actually believed their talking points, but either way, all of this, like Trump’s rhetoric today, was and is demonstrably ridiculous.
It’s also the position has prevailed, at least in this country.

Trump's newest skill: he thinks he's 'the greatest hostage negotiator' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-27-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-newest-skill-he-thinks-hes-the-greatest-hostage-negotiator,"Trump’s newest skill: he thinks he’s ‘the greatest hostage negotiator’ 04/26/19 04:34 PM By Steve Benen One of the oddities of Donald Trump’s personality is that he’s convinced himself he’s an expert in practically every subject. For example, the president recently assured the public, “I’m a professional at technology.” What kind of technology? He didn’t say, but we can probably assume he meant every possible kind .
That, of course, is just the starting point. Trump has also claimed to be the world’s foremost authority on everything from terrorism to campaign finance, the judicial system to infrastructure, trade to renewable energy. NowThis recently prepared a video montage on the subject, and it was amazing to see the many subjects on which the president considers himself a world-class expert.
This morning, our polymathic president let us know about yet another area of his alleged expertise.
“ ‘President Donald J. Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States. 20 hostages, many in impossible circumstances, have been released in last two years. No money was paid.’ Cheif [sic] Hostage Negotiator, USA!”
Sure, you and I might think that to have great skills as a hostage negotiator, one would probably need some kind of training, but not our president. He talked to the nation’s “chief” hostage negotiator, who’s certain that Trump is “the greatest hostage negotiator,” not only alive today, but who’s ever lived “in the history of the United States.”
So, what’s this all about?
The White House told reporters this morning that the president was referring to Robert C. O’Brien, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department, who offered some effusive praise for Trump last month, though he’s never publicly said what the president Quote: : d him saying.
The Washington Post added :
[D]id O’Brien really say what Trump attributed to him? Did he really call Trump the greatest hostage negotiator in U.S. history? Or did he simply refer to the broader concept of “unparalleled success,” which is more about results rather than acumen?
The State Department hasn’t responded to inquiries, but there is plenty of reason to believe Trump has hyperbolized O’Brien’s praise.
Ya think?
Look, Trump has made clear that he doesn’t really understand how quotation marks work, and he’s also shared the details of conversations that have happened only in his imagination . On other occasions, the president has taken parts of a Quote: : , removed parts he doesn’t like, added words that make him feel better about himself, and then shared those Quote: : s with the public as if they were real .
With all of this in mind, I’d recommend some skepticism before accepting as fact the idea that Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator who’s ever lived.
Postscript ; In case it’s not obvious, this issue has come to the fore in light of reports that North Korea billed the United States $2 million for Otto Warmbier’s hospital care. The main U.S. envoy sent to retrieve Warmbier, shortly before his death, reportedly accepted the bill and agreed to its terms before the student’s release in 2017, but the president insisted twice today that the bill was never paid.
