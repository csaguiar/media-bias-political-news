"Ocasio-Cortez lectures male reporter, implies sexism over Liz Warren story. There's just one MASSIVE problem.",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-lectures-male-reporter,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) lectured a male reporter this week and implied he was sexist over a story that he did not write, but merely shared.
What happened? On Thursday, CNN's Andrew Kaczynski shared a story from the Washington Post that detailed Sen. Elizabeth Warren's legal work while teaching at Ivy-League schools. According to the report, Warren charged clients as much as $675 per hour.
In his tweet, Kaczynski only summarized the story's main thesis, but did not offer additional commentary or analysis.
However, that did not stop Ocasio-Cortez — and thousands of others, for that matter — from criticizing Kaczynski has if he had criticized Warren or actually written the story himself.
""BREAKING NEWS: Lady Had A Job, Got Paid More Than Me,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
""Nice work. Now do the amount of Wall Street, Big Pharma, & Fossil Fuel presidential candidates accepted over their careers & how much they're taking now,"" she added, implying that Kaczynski's tweet was somehow sexist.
What's the problem with AOC's criticism?
As Alex Griswold of the Washington Free Beacon quickly pointed out, Ocasio-Cortez's criticism toward Kaczynski is unfounded because the CNN reporter did not write the Warren story.
In fact, two women, both Washington Post reporters, wrote the story: Annie Linskey and Elise Viebeck."
"WATCH: Iran Foreign Minister calls US policy 'terrorism', CNN reporter replies with question about Tweets - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-minister-cnn-us-terrorism,"Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein just had dinner with him . Beto O'Rourke sounds just like him . And this week, CNN interviewed him. He's Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, and he's getting quite a lot of face time lately.
In his interview with CNN's Fred Pleitgen, Zarif said quite a lot that was clearly designed for Democrat ears. He goaded Trump, he bashed National Security Advisor John Bolton and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he praised Obama's Iran Deal. He even snarked about the electoral college.
It wasn't all so, uh, tame, though. No, in addition to suggesting that Trump and Bolton are provoking a war, ominously suggesting that accidents, then correcting to ""incidents"" tend to happen in the Persian Gulf, where a U.S. Carrier Strike group was just sent, and warning that the United States is playing a ""dangerous game"" that could have ""painful consequences"", he also said that our policy toward Iran is ""terrorism.""
Not ""like"" terrorism, and not ""economic"" terrorism, as some outlets have characterized his comments. Just terrorism, point blank.
Watch this excerpt from CNN's interview (which you can find in full at the end of this post):
""Economic war means targeting Iranian people, targeting ordinary citizens, trying to deprive them of their means of livelihood. That amounts to terrorism,"" said Zarif.
After he finished his lengthy remarks about how the United States is to blame, CNN's Pleitgen followed up on that important point by asking if Zarif takes President Trump's tweets seriously. Seriously, watch.
""Do you take tweets by President Trump seriously?"" he asked pointedly.
He was referencing Trump's tweet from last week , where he said that threatening the U.S. would be an ""official end to Iran.""
Helpfully, Pleitgen added, ""Or has it come to the point where you don't take it seriously because the message keeps changing?""
At two other points in the interview, Pleitgen was equally helpful, as he prompted the foreign minister to theorize about who is ""actually"" calling the shots in American foreign policy. The idea that Bolton is pulling all the strings is very popular in the cable news crowd this week.
Watch:
Pleitgen did press for ask a few questions of Zarif that weren't about how bad and provoking Trump and Bolton are, including whether the country takes any responsibility for threats or attacks against the U.S. or its allies. Zarif said they don't.

Trump tweets confidence in 'Chairman Kim' over 'small weapons' in apparent slight to John Bolton,www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-tweets-kim-confidence-missiles,"National Security Advisor John Bolton, who Iran and Beto O'Rourke paint as the real culprit behind nefarious war-making in Washington, is in the news for another reason this Saturday, and it appears to have caused indigestion in the President.
Bolton was speaking to reporters in Japan, where the President is visiting this weekend, when he said that North Korea's missile tests earlier this month were a violation of U.N. resolutions.
""U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibit North Korea from firing any ballistic missiles,"" Bolton said, speaking with regard to the ballistic missiles North Korea fired the first week of May. ""In terms of violating U.N. Security Council resolutions, there is no doubt about that.""
President Trump, however, has no concerns, and he said as much in a Tweet that is hard to read as anything but a direct reaction to Bolton. ""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" the President wrote, obviously referring to at least Bolton if not other members of his cabinet and administration.
""I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,"" he added with some affection. He also shared an anecdote of an insult to former Vice President Joe Biden, currently the Democratic frontrunner for 2020, saying that Kim called him ""Swampman"" and insulted his IQ.
North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Bidan a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that's sending me a signal?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2019
Update Note : President Trump deleted the original tweet, which had several typos (including spelling Joe Biden's name wrong) after this story was published, and resent a corrected version.
North Korean state television offered a number of insults to Joe Biden this past week. Enough that it prompted a pretty funny cold open on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert .
Obviously President Trump thought it was funny, in any case. But no cause for concern.
Unless it concerns you that the President felt it necessary to contradict the National Security Advisor's correct assessment of a hostile foreign dictator resuming missile tests expressly prohibited under U.N. agreements and this administration's own policy.
There has been a great deal of speculation in Washington this week that John Bolton, and to a lesser extent Mike Pompeo, are really calling the shots on big foreign policy matters like North Korea and Iran. Perhaps that perception of not being The Man is having the desired effect on Trump."
"Homeless Houston car thief and 'Mexican national' spent 40 minutes torturing, murdering grandmother of six as she begged for her life",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeless-houston-murder-grandmother,"The suspect in a brutal slaying of a grandmother of six over a small amount of money and a car battery was in court this week on capital murder charges, after he was caught at the scene and police say he confessed to the crime.
The shocking murder took place in the Houston suburb of Sharpstown early this week, either late Sunday night or early on Monday, police say.
Etta Nugent, 75, was found dead by her son, after she failed to show up to visit her husband, who was in a convalescent care facility recovering from a medical procedure. Nugent had three children and six grandchildren. She was a retired parish secretary at Holy Ghost Catholic Church. Her friend and neighbor Sharon Shanahan told KHOU that Nugent was ""well loved"" by family as well as her friends and neighbors. ""She's just salt of the Earth,"" said Shanahan.
Nugent was stabbed over and over in a murder that lasted from 40 minutes to an hour, according to police, because she opened the door to a man seeking help. She was unable to help him repair his stolen truck """"because of her age,"" reported the Houston Chronicle.
The man, identified as Marco Cobos, 19, invoked his fifth amendment right to remain silent in his first court appearance, according to his attorney Alvin Nunnery, who spoke with reporters shortly after leaving court, where he also revealed Cobos ""country of origin"" and that his last known whereabouts was Phoenix, Arizona.
""There is some question about whether he's in the country legally or not,"" said his attorney. Cobos is referred to in reports as a Mexican national. He also said separately that Cobos has been in the United States for 18 years.
The grisly murder was apparently spontaneous, like the confession. According to authorities, Cobos stabbed the victim but failed to kill her, by his own account , and sought more knives from the kitchen before returning to stab her again repeatedly.
During an interview, police said he confessed to forcing his way into the home. He forced his way into the home as Nugent spoke to him through a crack in the door. He stabbed her in the chest and went to the kitchen to find more knives, according to prosecutors.
He heard the doorbell ring and saw Nugent on the front porch trying to escape. Cobos said he went outside and grabbed her in a ""bear hug."" He got more knives from the kitchen and continued stabbing her until she died.
Cobos took her car keys and about $560 from her purse to buy food and a new battery for the stolen F-150, prosecutors said. He returned again to eat and look through her belongings, prosecutors said. During the hours Cobos spent in Nugent's home after murdering her, he not only had a meal but used her credit cards to pay his own cell phone bill.
Police were on the scene investigating Monday evening, following Nugent's son's discovery of her body, when Cobos attempted to return to her home in her stolen vehicle. He was caught at around 8:30pm a few doors down.
The Houston Chronicle reports that Nugent pleaded for her life during the torturous killing.
Cobos was held without bond."
MSNBC host asks Beto how media can 'do better' for him: 'If you don’t like the coverage you can change it' - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/msnbc-asks-how-to-help-beto,"MSNBC's Nicole Wallace was so busy gushing over Beto O'Rourke, maybe she forgot the cameras were on. That's as plausible an explanation as any for why she asked the 2020 Democrat candidate how the media can do a better job covering his and other Democrats' campaigns going into next year.
Usually when the Democrats in the media are trying to figure out how to help the Democrats running for office, they don't say out loud that's what they're doing.
But former Republican Wallace just walked it right out.
""So I've straddled both sides of the campaign, and now covering campaigns,"" she said. ""Play media critic: What can we do better for those of us covering your candidacies far away from where the first votes will be cast in Iowa and New Hampshire?""
As Beto did his best ""befuddled but giant-toothed Hugh Grant"" bit, Wallace added ""don't hold back!"" and they both laughed together like old friends.
""That's a good question,"" said O'Rourke, proving all politicians lie.
He then launched into a lengthy reply in which at one point, without apparent irony or any seeming rebuke, he said one thing the media can do is ask more substantive questions. He said that. Watch:
""Present company excluded"" he said. Amazing.
Wallace, though, wasn't finished fawning. ""I'll leave you with some free advice,"" she said. ""Grab Garrett [Haake], who is NBC's correspondent on your campaign and tell him what's on your mind.""
""If you don't like the coverage, you can change it. You're the candidate,"" said Wallace.
You. Can. Change. It.
She thanked O'Rourke effusively for joining her, and Beto waved goodbye to the camera. That's not a figure of speech, he did that.
The entire bizarre exchange needed a hilarious soundtrack, honestly. Luckily we have the internet.
""If you don't like the coverage, you can change it."" Just wow. Expect to see that sound bite in a lot of ads and compilations for the next few years. Unbelievable."
Here's the story behind the viral photo of soldier placing flag at Tomb of Unknown Soldier during storm - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/soldier-tomb-of-unknown-storm,"During a severe thunderstorm that ravaged our nation's capital last Thursday, a solider with the 3d U.S. Infantry Regiment was photographed placing a small flag at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider.
That image, and the story behind it, has gone viral ahead of Memorial Day.
Image source: Facebook/3d U.S. Infantry Regiment
What's the story behind the photo? In a Facebook post , The 3d U.S. Infantry Regiment — which is also known as ""The Old Guard"" — described the moment as ""one of the most extraordinary displays of discipline and dedication to duty ever to be witnessed at Arlington National Cemetery.""
Here's the full story:
[On Thursday], torrential rain and drastic wind gusts overcame America's most hallowed grounds. Visitors ran for cover. News media piled into vehicles together. The streets flooded. Trees as old as the cemetery itself broke at the trunk and came crashing down. But America's Regiment endured. They found low ground and held fast through the wind and the rain. Some had to be to ordered to stand down from planting flags, still determined to continue to honor the fallen.
During the storm, one of the most extraordinary displays of discipline and dedication to duty ever to be witnessed at Arlington National Cemetery was taking place at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. With only a few watching from cover, a Tomb Sentinel approached the Unknowns with U.S. flags in hand. As thunder shook the ground and rains washed down without abandon, the Tomb Sentinel pierced through the elements with breath-taking precision. He knelt and placed the flags in honor of the Unknowns. For the select few who saw this moment, it was jaw-dropping. Humans have their limits, but The Old Guard has yet to meet theirs. According to WTHR-TV , the sentinel photographed placing the flags at the tomb was identified as Tyler McKee.
The Old Guard is responsible for conducting memorial affairs and representing the U.S. during special events. Part of the regiment's duties include standing continuous watch outside the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier inside Arlington National Cemetery."
"Federal judge who ruled against Trump's border wall made large donations to Obama, DNC",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-border-wall-obama-donations-haywood-gilliam,"The federal judge who blocked President Donald Trump's border wall plans in a ruling on Friday previously donated nearly $30,000 to former President Barack Obama, political action committees, and Democrats.
What are the details? U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam — who was confirmed to the bench in 2014 after being appointed by Obama — donated $6,900 to Obama's 2008 campaign and $14,500 to Obama's re-election efforts, federal election records show .
Additionally, records indicate Gilliam donated $4,500 to the Democratic National Committee in 2012 and sent $3,100 to the Covington Burling LLP PAC, a political action committee that supports Republican and Democratic political candidates, according to The Washington Examiner .
Gilliam made the donations before he was confirmed to the court.

During his Senate confirmation, Gilliam told Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that he would remain impartial as a judge, not allowing political ideology motivate his rulings.
""I have never viewed my legal practice as ideological, and I can assure the Committee that if confirmed as a district judge, I would base my decisions solely on the facts of each case and the applicable precedent, without regard to any political ideology or motivation,"" Gilliam said.
He also told the Senate Judiciary Committee that ""any personal views would not interfere in any way with my ability to neutrally apply the law.""
Anything else? As The Examiner noted, Gilliam is one of three federal judges to recently rule against the Trump administration with major decisions who also donated to Obama.
The other two judges — U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta and U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos — ruled that Trump's accountants must comply with subpoenas for his financial records and that Deutsche Bank and Capital One can divulge Trump's financial records to Congress."
Utah judge disparaged President Trump from the courtroom. Now he's paying the price.,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/utah-judge-suspended-anti-trump-michael-kwan,"A Utah judge who openly disparaged President Donald Trump in the courtroom and on social media is now facing the consequences of his actions.
What are the details? The Supreme Court of Utah has upheld a six-month suspension without pay for Taylorsville Justice Court Judge Michael Kwan.
In a ruling last week, Utah's Supreme Court determined Kwan undermined public confidence in the judiciary for ""improper use of judicial authority and his inappropriate political commentary."" Kwan criticized Trump, both on social media and in his courtroom, before and after the 2016 election.
From NBC News :
Three days after the 2016 election, Kwan wrote on Facebook, ""Think I'll go to the shelter to adopt a cat before the President-Elect grabs them all"" — a reference to the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump was heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals without consent.
Almost a month after Trump's inauguration, Kwan said ""welcome to the beginning of the fascist takeover"" and questioned whether Congressional Republicans would be ""the American Reichstag,"" this time referring to the political body of Nazi Germany.
Kwan also disparaged Trump in 2017 when a defendant voiced hope that Trump would follow through on his promise to implement tax reform.
Kwan defended his actions before the Utah Supreme Court, characterizing his comments as ""constitutionally protected speech."" However, the court vehemently disagreed.
""Fulfillment of judicial duties does not come without personal sacrifice of some opportunities and privileges available to the public at large,"" the court wrote . ""And as a person the public entrusts to decide issues with the utmost fairness, independence, and impartiality, a judge must at times set aside the power of his or her voice.""
Ultimately, the court dismissed each of Kwan's defenses and upheld the stiff reprimand because the judge ""has been the subject of prior discipline and the recipient of prior guidance.""
""Judge Kwan's behavior denigrates his reputation as an impartial, independent, dignified, and courteous jurist who takes no advantage of the office in which he serves,"" the court said. ""And it diminishes the reputation of our entire judiciary."" "
"Media 'watchdog' pushes deceptively edited clip to smear Ben Shapiro, incites liberal outrage mob - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ben-shapiro-media-matters-science,"While Democrats and the mainstream media spent part of last week outraged over a viral video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), which they claim was deceptively edited, a liberal media watchdog deceptively circulated a video of Ben Shapiro.
What happened? On Friday, Media Matters for America researcher Jason Campbell tweeted a clip of Ben Shapiro discussing the development of modern science and the distinctions between scientific advancement in the Western world and the Eastern world.
""Ben Shapiro thinks that 'the idea of science' is unique to the Western world,"" Campbell captioned the tweet.
However, the clip, which was deceptively edited and devoid of its entire context, disproves Campbell's summary. Instead, the clip shows Shapiro correctly describing the scientific revolution by distinguishing ""between generalized science and incremental technological change.""
Regardless of what Shapiro actually said, the clip incited the liberal outrage mob, which accused Shapiro of minimizing — or downright rejecting — scientific advancements, namely in the Islamic and Asian world.
""Mr. Shapiro, I'd be happy to let you sit in on either my History of Science course or my class on the History of Alchemy so you can see the Islamic/Arab origins of modern science,"" one person said .
""Where does he think the 'Al' in Algebra comes from?"" another person said .
""It took me 5 seconds to google that the ancient Chinese invented the compass, gunpowder, printing and paper making. Ben literally just makes sh*t up without even the most basic of sources, and on top of that he does it to promote this vague idea of the west' (aka white people),"" yet another person claimed .
How did Shapiro respond? In response to criticism, Shapiro pointed people to another video in which he discusses the contributions the Muslim world made to science.
Here's what Shapiro actually said in the video:
The truth is, that the vision of modern science: the idea of hypothesis and hypothesis being rejected by evidence — that sort of science, experimental science, is unique to the west. There is a difference between technological progress, which does exist in a vast number of civilizations. And that technological progress is generally linked to the human need to overcome the environment around them.
There's a difference between that and the pure idea of exploring science for its own sake, which then has technical applications later. That is something that seems fairly unique to the West, which is why you see thinkers in the West, like Isaac Newton, who are trying to figure out general rules of the universe in a way that very few people were doing in other civilizations.
Now, that doesn't mean that every other person in every other civilization was incapable of doing this. Obviously, there were strides in science and mathematics, particularly in the Indian world in the first millennium. But great expanse of science was deeply wedded to, historically speaking, the Judeo-Christian belief that in order to investigate God, you had to investigate God's universe, and that was tied to a Greek natural law evidentiary-based position that the way to discover natural rules, was to look at the evidence. That's an Aristotelian idea.
So, as I say, this is not to discount the discoveries of other civilizations. The question is why the West did it best. And the answer is that the West did it best not just because they were making technological advances — again, technological advances exist throughout history — the question is why is it that the West came up with this idea of science, this generalized idea of science that was then used to create tremendous technological change far beyond what you would get if you were just in a field and you needed to figure out how to make a plow work better, for example.
There is a difference between generalized science and incremental technological change. (H/T: Erick Erickson, The Resurgent )"

"Liberal journo tweets fabricated Trump quote, Dems and media fall hook, line, and sinker",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/fake-trump-quote-biden-viral-bremmer,"A political scientist and author, a man who is a contributor to Time and has almost half a million Twitter followers, fabricated a quote about Joe, which he attributed to President Trump. Guess what happened next.
If you guessed ""Democrats, journalists, #Resistance Twitter, and so on Tweeted it and treated it as true,"" then ding-ding-ding, you win. Because that is indeed what happened.
The quote, which one can admit is sort of plausible as Trumpism, was ""Kim Jong Un is smarter and would make a better President than Sleep Joe Biden.""
It really caught on, as you can see by the retweets. And although that above number does not include people who ""quote retweeted"" it, there were plenty. Including Congressman Ted Lieu and CNN contributor Ana Navarro .
We could go on. And on. But you get the picture. On the same weekend when there is a huge flap about fake Pelosi videos, how this was taken at face value is mystifying. Particularly with a track record on taking things at face value the left and media have built up. Kavanaugh hearing, MAGA hat Covington teens, Smollett...
Still, not everyone fell for it, of course. Some learning has happened in the last two years.
But it was fake, of course. And that eventually came out.
And once the truth was out, Bremmer suffered the wrath of the mob something fierce. Here are just two examples. There were many, many more.
This is not a real Trump quote; what he and Sarah Sanders said on this is bad enough as is. If you're basing your views of reality based on Ian Bremmer's tweets in 2019, please reconsider. pic.twitter.com/izVoCXcsly
— Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) May 26, 2019
The lesson here is not the one Bremmer intended, though it's close. He seems to think he taught everyone how plausible his fake quote is. But in reality, what he instructed was ""Don't trust Ian Bremmer.
And it's a great lesson in letting hate and confirmation bias make you a fool. Journalists have fallen for fake news about Trump time and time and time and time again. When, if ever, will they finally look in the mirror and ask ""am I not as objective as I think I am?""
Here's an exit question, based on a tweet from Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra.
The question: Will it be treated with the same scorn? They will say ""but the President did it, not a Time writer"" but … what about the Democrats who shared this fake quote?"
WATCH: Amy Klobuchar tells Iowa audience what John McCain 'recited' as Trump was inaugurated,www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-klobuchar-mccain-recited-inaugurated,"Democrat candidate for the 2020 nomination Sen. Amy Klobuchar has, from the gate, been running her campaign at a different pace and tune than her many, many rivals. And the weekend gathering in Iowa, celebrating her birthday and chock full of anecdotes, was no exception.
One particular anecdote stood out, shared and reported across a lot of media because of the two subjects. Naturally, like all anecdotes, policy discussions, jokes, or passive sighing sounds made by any Democrat running for office, Trump was one of the subjects.
The other was Trump-foil and redeemed hero to Democrats who reviled him in 2008, the late Sen. John McCain.
Klobuchar spoke of him twice in her remarks, that were either disjointed or seem that way because of social media. In one case, she referenced Trump attacking McCain after his death (a true story), and in the other a story about the former POW himself, and what he had to say during Trump's inauguration ceremony. Or rather, what he had to list.
It was that one that got the ink. Watch.
Your browser does not support the video tag. ""I sat on that stage between Bernie and John McCain,"" said Klobuchar. ""And John McCain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech because he knew more than any of us what we were facing as a nation.""
""He understood it. He knew because he knew this man more than any of us did,"" she said.
An odd but very believable story, though seemingly one without any real conclusion. It is the suggestion that there is a point without really making one.
Klobuchar was a great admirer of McCain and speaks of him often on the trail. It just one of the many ways in which she campaigns differently than her competitors. Just not necessarily better, given the poll numbers."
MAGA hats blurred out in high school students' yearbook photo: 'Whoever did this doesn't like Trump',www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/maga-hats-blurred-out-in-yearbook,"Jeremy Gebhart and a friend were shocked when they saw a photo of themselves in Littlestown High School's yearbook.
""We were like, 'They blurred our hats out!'"" Gebhart, 16, told WPMT-TV .
Image source: WPMT-TV video screenshot
What happened?
Gebhart said he and a friend wanted to show their support for President Donald Trump during the Pennsylvania high school's spirit week back in October, the station reported.
Sure enough, the photo was picked for the yearbook — but at some point their red hats that read ""Trump: Make America Great Again"" were photoshopped out, WPMT said.
Image source: WPMT-TV video screenshot
""I just think that whoever did this doesn't like Trump,"" Gebhart added to the station.
He also told WPMT his freedom of speech was taken away: ""Everybody has First Amendment rights, freedom of speech and they are allowed to think what they want and say what they want, but they aren't allowed to take that away from other people.""
'Infuriated' Gebhart's mother Lorriane was none too pleased, either.
""I was infuriated because he wears that hat because he supports our president,"" she told the station. ""He's not doing anything illegal; he's wearing a hat of support.""
Image source: WPMT-TV video screenshot
Lorraine Gebhart added to WPMT that the guilty party ""used this on purpose to blur out that Trump logo and make their own statement.""
What did the school district have to say?
Littlestown School District sent the station the following statement from Superintendent Christopher E. Bigger:
I am aware of the yearbook situation and a mistake was made. The mistake was not noticed during the editorial preview process prior to print. We apologize on behalf of the yearbook club. It is not the policy or practice of the district to improperly censor speech. Please understand we are working with young adults who are practicing to become citizens and what a better place to do so than in a school setting. We must find a way to have civil discourse around emotionally charged issues with students where the facts are understood and the opportunity to learn is available. School officials told WPMT that an investigation is underway, and it's unclear who made the photoshopping call.
Anything else? ""It's OK to disagree with people's views, but what's not OK is taking your freedom of speech and using it to take away someone else's,"" Lorraine Gebhart told the station.

Marine vet running for Congress vowed to fight socialism and now Democrats & MSM are accusing him of 'threatening violence',www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/marine-vet-running-for-congress-vowed-to-fight-socialism-and-now-democrats-are-accusing-him-of-violence,"A former Marine, a fourth generation member of the U.S. military, cut an ad recently for his campaign for congress that is now being deliberately misrepresented, and he is being smeared, by Democrats and members of the press.
NOTE: THE WORDS 'CUT AN AD' IN THE ABOVE SENTENCE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN ANYTHING VIOLENT.
In his ad, Republican Harrison Floyd promises to fight socialists in Congress just like he fought terrorists overseas. The ad shows the socialists in Congress, and it also shows him fighting overseas. That's how videos usually work, with both pictures and words.
But bad faith Democrats and mainstream media hacks are pretending that they haven't spoken English all their lives, and don't understand metaphor, terms of art, narratives, or campaign ads. And therefore, the white opposition candidate Carolyn Bourdeaux is capitalizing on the moment to try to find some kind of advantage over the young, black, war veteran from a family with a history of service to this country.
Naturally, the media is playing dutifully along. Check out the video below.
NOTE: CHECK OUT DOES NOT MEAN DIE IN THE SENTENCE ABOVE, BUT JUST THAT YOU SHOULD WATCH THE VIDEO.
What they want is for you to say ""oh that's somewhat ambiguous"" or ""I could see how someone could take it that way, using a literal interpretation,"" but, you know, don't. Because that's preposterous. Things don't happen in a vacuum.
In order for them to say there is even a slight chance that you could take this to mean that he's threatening to shoot to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders to death, you have to evaporate all knowledge of the Marine Corps, American veterans (who Democrats pretend to like on holidays like Memorial Day), word usage and meaning, and the most basic standards of common communication and speech.
You have to lie, in other words. To yourself and everyone else. And you can see them tying themselves in knots trying not to show that they know they are lying.
Take, for example, the reaction of his white Democrat opponent Bourdeaux. She tweeted: ""Violence has absolutely no place in our public discourse & I denounce this abhorrent video in the strongest possible term. This message doesn't represent GA values & for Harrison Floyd to enter this race by inciting violence is wrong.""
Do you know what she didn't say? She didn't say ""call the Secret Service, this man threatened to shoot a sitting member of Congress to death."" Do you know why she didn't say that? Because it is absolutely idiotically insane and literally no one thinks that. It is preposterously, impressively stupid. Law enforcement would laugh in her face.
I dare her. I dare you, Carolyn Bordeaux. I dare you to report him to the FBI. Accuses him of violence somewhere other than in a tweet designed to get the media to fawn over you.
Oh, speaking of the media fawning: it's bad enough for a Democrat trying desperately to be relevant to lie to herself and others about how English works. (Or tell the truth about what she thinks of American veterans.) But the trash below from the New York Post is outright despicable, and they should issue a retraction and an apology.
Look at this garbage .
Look at those weasel words: ""appears"" to ""threaten.""
Hmm, threaten what, Shant Shahrigian? Why weren't you more clear? ""Appears?"" Do you think that's what he did or not? Threaten their jobs? Threaten their lives? Speak up, Shant .
Shahrigian uses another propaganda trick. Here's his opening paragraph.
A congressional candidate in Georgia is targeting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders all but literally. The middle is just a bland description. Here is the a quote from the video, here is a quote from the Democrat, here is a description of the political contest, yadda yadda yadda. Then his closer:
Floyd's video came in a heated political season that has seen death threats to politicians including Ocasio-Cortez's ally Rep. Ilhan Omar. See that? The suggestion of impropriety without the explicit explanation for how this is what was implied. ""All but literally"" he says. And then he brings up death threats, just to associate this with death threats, something neither he nor Carolyn Bordeaux will state directly. They want you to connect the dots, and they drew the dots really close together for you. All but literally.
But is this campaign video a death threat? Shahrigian and Bordeaux should answer up, chop chop.
NOTE: CHOP CHOP IS SLANG PHRASE WHICH MEANS DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AXE RELATED VIOLENCE
What makes this the most outrageous is how pro forma it is. Shahrigian was almost certainly fed the story by the campaign. I've been writing about politics for a decade and a half. Believe me, they sent this story around. And the Post article is practically cookie-cutter. His quote, her quote, link to death threats, file that puppy and get back to tweeting about Pinterest and Whole Foods or whatever is the latest millennial dystopian nightmare.
It didn't stop with the lazy New York Post cough reporter cough, and the white, civilian, public policy professor and Democrat running against Floyd. No, social justice activist Shaun King also got involved. He didn't say ""this is a threat to commit a literal and genuine violent act against a sitting member of Congress and member of the Senate. Nope. He just said this.
The implication of impropriety without the explanation. Again.
Now, some of you many not be familiar with Shaun King. Which is fine.
Jeff Dunetz and Joe Newby at The Lid have some other Twitter reactions that will steam your collar, too.
The reason they've triggered on [NOTE THE WORD TRIGGERED HERE DOES NOT REFER TO A GUN] this isn't because they think that this former Marine from a family that has served this country for generations actually intends any violence. No. it's because he's speaking out against socialism.
The far left believe they have a moment because of Donald Trump. They are pulling out all the stops, forcing every hand, laying down all the markers to make socialism both the primary message of the Democrat party and a mainstream part of American life.
And they don't care who they smear to do it. In fact, being able to smear an American veteran is just a nice bonus for them.
Now watch them spend Memorial Day paying lip service the very American military tradition they just finished denigrating.
NOTE: NOW WATCH THEM IS A FIGURE OF SPEECH AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS MEANING ANYTHING BINOCULAR OR GOOGLE EARTH RELATED.
Then again, if you feel like visiting their Twitter and asking them, ""do you think Harrison Floyd threatened to murder Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and, if so, why haven't you done anything about it?"" well .. hey, that's your business. As a fellow former United States Marine, I offer only a Semper Fi. Oh, and this link to Floyd's website ."
BuzzFeed attempts to link Ben Shapiro — an Orthodox Jew — to man who vandalized synagogue with Nazi symbols,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/buzzfeed-connects-ben-shapiro-indiana-man-nazi,"BuzzFeed News published a story over the weekend that attempted to connect Ben Shapiro to an Indiana man accused of vandalizing a synagogue with Nazi symbols.
What did BuzzFeed say? In a story detailing the radicalization of Nolan Brewer, a 21-year old Indiana man who plead guilty last week to defacing a synagogue with Nazi symbols, BuzzFeed News linked Brewer to Shapiro, an Orthodox Jew who was recently named the biggest target for anti-Semitic hate online .
In the story's opening paragraph, BuzzFeed referred to Shapiro as a ""former Breitbart editor,"" which Shapiro is:
An Indiana man who plead guilty to defacing a synagogue with Nazi symbolism detailed to federal agents his road to radicalization, including meeting with members of the far-right group Identity Evropa and being inspired by the writings of a former Breitbart editor and the Nazi propaganda site Stormfront. Later in the story, BuzzFeed emphasized the purported connection to Shapiro by quoting from Brewer's sentencing memorandum:
According to Nolan, [his wife] began with rightwing yet mainstream views such as those presented on Fox News. She then moved on to writing by Ben Shapiro and articles on Breitbart News which bridged the gap to the notorious white supremacist and anti-Semitic propaganda site Stormfront. BuzzFeed further parroted the connection by attempting to reach Shapiro for comment as if he actually played a role in radicalizing Brewer into a white supremacist who praised Adolf Hitler.
Shapiro, of course, did not return BuzzFeed's multiple requests for comment.
Meanwhile, when posting its story to Twitter, BuzzFeed outright claimed a connection between Shapiro and Brewer.
""A man who vandalized a synagogue with Nazi symbols told federal agents his road to radicalization included meeting with the far-right group Identity Evropa and reading Ben Shapiro, Breitbart News, and the Nazi propaganda site Stormfront,"" the tweet read.
How did Shapiro respond? While he did not return BuzzFeed's requests for comment, Shapiro commented on the story Sunday, writing on Twitter that it is ""garbage."""
"WATCH: Pro-life activist struck with cane, shoved by pro-choice demonstrators — and cop appears to just wave victim away",www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pro-life-activist-struck-with-cane-shoved-by-pro-choice-demonstrators,"Video showed a pro-life activist getting struck with a cane and shoved by pro-choice demonstrators who converged on him last week — and a cop who was told about it apparently just waved the victim away.
Coleman Boyd still continued to express his opinions, telling the pro-choice crowd, ""I beg you, please, have mercy on these babies,"" WAPT-TV reported .
What happened?
Pro-choice advocates gathered outside the Mississippi Capitol in Jackson on Tuesday to protest the state legislature's bill banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected.
Video showed Boyd talking to and walking toward the pro-choice demonstrators, trying to convince them that ""babies in the womb"" are ""human beings.""
Image source: YouTube screenshot
With that a pair of men walked up to Boyd — and things quickly got physical.
One of them holding a cane was seen using it to jab Boyd, who replied by saying, ""Call the cops. He just hit me with his cane.""
Image source: YouTube screenshot
The other man confronting Boyd told the man with the cane to not touch the pro-life activist.
Soon another pro-choice advocate in a tie-dyed shirt approached Boyd and repeatedly said, ""F*** off, jackass,"" before yet another appeared among the growing crowd, shoved Boyd backward, and also said, ""F*** off.""
Image source: YouTube screenshot
The pro-choice demonstrator who urged his fellow activists to not get physical told Boyd that he's ""disturbing a meeting"" and should leave — but Boyd kept right on speaking.
""We are shedding innocent blood!"" he told the pro-choice crowd. ""And we as a people will stand before God!""
Image source: YouTube screenshot
When Boyd told them ""Jesus said he is the way, the truth, and the life,"" that pro-choice activist who wanted him to leave replied that he's seen Boyd at abortion clinics ""spitting on women"" and accused him of being a ""hypocrite.""
""You call yourself a Christian,"" the man told Boyd.
Cop appears to ignore Boyd
As the strains of Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" blared from nearby speakers, Boyd spotted a police officer, walked over to him, and told him he was hit with a cane.
But the cop appeared to wave off Boyd.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
When reporters later asked Boyd why he was there, he told them he wanted to protect babies in the womb.
""They're being led to destruction, they don't have a voice,"" he said. ""They're human beings made in the image of God."" He added that ""we should not be able to murder children in the womb to have our comforts and our better life ... just because they quote 'get in our way.'""
A federal judge cited the dignity of women in his decision Friday to block Mississippi's pro-life heartbeat bill.

New Mexico Democratic governor pulled troops from border 'charade' — now she's demanding federal help over border crisis,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-mexico-gov-demands-federal-help-border-crisis,"New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) has heavily criticized President Donald Trump's immigration agenda and the administration's overall response to the border crisis.
In February, she condemned what she called Trump's ""charade of border fear-mongering"" and announced she was withdrawing most of the New Mexico National Guard troops deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border in her state.
""I reject the federal contention that there exists an overwhelming national security crisis at the Southern border,"" Lujan Grisham said, according to NPR .
Her comments came just more than one week before Trump declared a national emergency in response to the overwhelming migrant crisis at the border.
But now, more than three months after her public campaign of opposition against the Trump administration, Lujan Grisham is seeking the federal government's assistance to manage the impacts of the border crisis on New Mexico.

According to KOAT-TV , Lujan Grisham met with federal officials in Washington, D.C., last week, including acting-Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, to discuss the ongoing crisis.
Lujan Grisham asked McAleenan to increase government personnel at the border and requested reimbursement for humanitarian assistance, among other resources.
""The governor wants to continue to urge the federal government to increase its personnel on the border as a means of improving the logistical and communications output,"" the governor's spokesman, Tripp Stelnicki, told KOAT.
How did Republicans react? Considering Lujan Grisham's public outcry against the Trump administration, Republicans had a field day with her trip to Washington.
""She declares there's no crisis. She removes the National Guard, and now she's there asking for money,"" New Mexico GOP Chairman Steve Pearce mocked, KOAT reported.
""Everything in her actions indicate that she believes there's a crisis, but yet she will not dedicate the resources or request to her colleagues in Congress to start passing the laws that will change the situation there,"" he criticized. ""The border communities are going to continue to be overrun."""
NYC public school educators allegedly told to favor black students over whites — in name of 'racial equity' - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-public-school-educators-allegedly-told-to-favor-black-students-over-whites,"New York City's public school educators allegedly have been instructed to focus on black students over whites as part of ""racial equity,"" the New York Post reported .
""If I had a poor white male student, and I had a middle-class black boy, I would actually put my equitable strategies and interventions into that middle-class black boy because over the course of his lifetime he will have less access and less opportunities than that poor white boy,"" a consultant hired by the city Department of Education told administrators at a workshop, the paper said, citing accounts of those in room.
""That's what racial equity is,"" Darnisa Amante, the consultant in question, added, according to the Post.
How did the president of the NYC Parents Union react? Mona Davids, president of the NYC Parents Union — and who is black — told the paper she's appalled by the alleged purpose of ""racial equity"" told to educators.
""It's completely absurd — they want to treat black students as victims and punish white students,"" Davids added to the Post. ""That defeats the purpose of what bias awareness training should be.""
What did the department of education have to say? The paper said DOE spokesman Will Mantell wouldn't indicate if Chancellor Richard Carranza supports Amante's alleged statements.
""Anti-bias and equity trainings are about creating high expectations and improving outcomes for all of our students,"" Mantell added to the Post in a statement. ""These trainings are used across the country because they help kids, and out-of-context quotes and anonymous allegations just distract from this important work.""
More from the paper:
Amante, a lecturer at Harvard University Graduate School of Education, is CEO of Disruptive Equity Education Project, or DEEP, a group aimed at ""dismantling systemic oppression and racism,"" it says. She did not respond to emails seeking comment.
The DOE's Office of Equity and Access has contracted DEEP for $175,000. Another anti-bias consultant, Glenn Singleton, the author of ""Courageous Conversations,"" which includes a critique of the ""white supremacy culture,"" has a $775,000 contract. Disruptive Equity Education Project (DEEP) Promotion Video youtu.be
What else? The Post also said the department's $23 million, mandatory anti-bias training has ""irked some administrators, teachers and parents who contend parts are ugly and divisive"" — including four white female DOE executives demoted under Carranza's new regime who intend to sue the city for racial discrimination, claiming whiteness has become ""toxic.""
More from the paper:
At a monthly superintendents meeting in the spring of 2018, shortly after Carranza's arrival, members were asked to share answers to the question: ""What lived experience inspires you as a leader to fight for equity?""
One Jewish superintendent shared stories about her grandmother Malka who told of bombs falling in Lodz, Poland, and running from the Nazis in the wee hours by packing up her four children and hiding in the forest, and her grandfather Naftali, who spent nearly six years in a labor and concentration camp, where he witnessed the brutal execution of his mother and sister. ""My grandparents taught me to understand the dangers of 'targeted racism' or the exclusion of any group, and the importance of equity for all people. This is my core value as an educator,"" the superintendent told colleagues, according to the paper. ""At the break, I stood up and, to my surprise, I was verbally attacked by a black superintendent in front of my colleagues. She said, 'This is not about being Jewish! It's about black and brown boys of color only. You better check yourself.'""
The Jewish superintendent also told the Post that ""I was traumatized. It was like 1939 all over again. I couldn't believe this could happen to me in NYC!""
Two other superintendents — one black and one Dominican — defended the Holocaust comments as valid and vouched for their colleague as one who fights to level the playing field for all students, the paper said.
And a Manhattan middle-school teacher with her own children in public schools called the the DOE training ""a catalyst for hate and division"" and recoiled at training phrases like ""replacement thinking"" and the disdain for ""whiteness,"" the Post reported.
""My ancestors were enslaved and murdered because of their religion, I am now being forced to become 'liberated' from my whiteness,"" the teacher told the paper. ""I am being persecuted because of the circumstances of my birth. I was not aware that I needed to be liberated from how God created me.""
The teacher added to the paper that despite the chancellor's insistence that those who complain about the training need it the most, ""I will never be brainwashed by Richard Carranza and his minions. I cannot support a schools chancellor who is implicitly biased against me and my children."""
MARS: Trump makes major announcement about the future of US space exploration,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-mars-space-exploration-plans,"Standing alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, President Donald Trump announced Monday that the United States will be ""going to Mars very soon.""
During a press conference, Trump announced his ambitious plans for the U.S. space program, which includes a new partnership with Japan.
""We'll be going to the moon, we'll be going to Mars very, very soon. It's very exciting. From a military standpoint, there is nothing more important right now than space,"" Trump said, according to Bloomberg . ""Japan will join our mission to send U.S. astronauts to space.""

However, Trump did not provide an exact timetable or additional details about his space ambitions, which have so far included proposing a new military branch — the United States Space Force — and signing legislation directing a U.S. mission to Mars by the 2030s.
Unfortunately, some believe Trump's plans for Mars are too ambitious, with future missions to the moon being a more realistic and attainable goal.
""The moon is the proving ground; Mars is the horizon goal,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in March.
Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence announced in March the U.S. would return to the moon within five years, accelerating existing lunar return plans from 2028 to 2024.
Trump's announcement came at the end of his four-day state visit to Japan."
Double standard? Dem senator calls for investigation into Trump's EPA over something Obama's EPA did,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/tammy-duckworth-epa-investigation-ethanol-waivers,"Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) has called for an investigation into the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether the agency broke federal law by granting small oil refineries waivers to bypass regulations mandating that corn ethanol be mixed into their gasoline supply.
However, the liberal lawmaker was silent when the Obama administration granted the exact same waivers.
What did Duckworth allege? According to the Washington Examiner , Duckworth requested the EPA's inspector general conduct an investigation over allegations the EPA has ""misled"" Congress.
""Recent document disclosures reveal that the EPA misled Members of Congress, industry and the public,"" she wrote in a letter to the EPA's acting inspector general. ""This deception by EPA political appointees may indicate improper motives and conflicts of interest, and it warrants a thorough review.""
Shockingly, the waivers in question are somewhat of a bipartisan issue on Capitol Hill. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) have also petitioned for the EPA to cease granting waivers. The common thread between Duckworth, Grassley, and Ernest? Their states are the two of the nation's leading producers of corn ethanol.
The senators argue most of the companies that have been granted waivers are subsidiaries of or somehow connected to larger oil companies, such as Exxon, therefore not legitimately meeting qualifications for the ethanol-mixing exemption.
Is there a double standard? As the Examiner noted, Duckworth claims the Trump administration has issued 35 EPA waivers in the last two years, whereas the Obama administration granted only seven.
However, Reuters reported last year that EPA records show the Obama administration granted 14 waivers in 2015 and 20 in 2016 — just one less than the Trump administration over a similar period of time.
So, what's this all about? Is Duckworth really concerned with EPA guidelines? Or is Duckworth motivated by the ethanol lobby of which she is a beneficiary?
From Hot Air :
The reality here is that Duckworth, just like Grassley and Ernst (this is a bipartisan problem), are in the pocket of the ethanol lobby and continually seek to prop up the corn and soybean growers while trying to use the power of the government to damage the oil and gas industry. They don't want to have the waivers issued because they know it will lead to more artificial, government-mandated demand for ethanol while bankrupting refineries, literally in some cases. This request for an investigation is a partisan ploy, working at the expense of private industry. (H/T: Jazz Shaw )"
Privately-funded border wall construction begins in El Paso,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/privately-funded-border-wall-construction-begins-in-el-paso,"Construction has begun on a section of border wall in El Paso, Texas, with the help of a privately funded organization that saw an area of need, according to Fox News .
The organization, called "" We Build the Wall ,"" is seeking to close a large gap in the El Paso sector, which is a large and heavily-trafficked crossing area where authorities say 930 people are apprehended per day. According to former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, this is only the beginning.
""We'll keep on building as long as people keep chipping in. The average contribution has been only $67 but so many people have chipped in,"" said Kobach, who is involved with We Build the Wall and who served as an immigration advisor to President Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The barrier is being built on private land—land which the Army Corps of Engineers have said is too rugged for fencing, Kobach said.
""This is the first time any private organization has built border wall on private land,"" Kobach said on ""Fox & Friends.""
The privately-funded effort comes at a time when Pres. Trump's attempt to fund the wall using a national emergency declaration is facing legal hurdles.
U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. blocked construction of two border wall sections Friday—46 miles in New Mexico and five miles in Arizona. The president intends to appeal the ruling, and attacked the judge on Twitter.
""Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern wall that is already under construction,"" Pres. Trump wrote. ""This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime, drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal!""
Pres. Trump declared the border situation a national emergency in February after an extended government shutdown failed to help him secure congressionally-approved border funding."

"World War II vet, 96, delivers mesmerizing rendition of national anthem — and in a way you probably wouldn't expect",www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/world-war-ii-vet-delivers-mesmerizing-rendition-of-national-anthem,"On this year's Memorial Day, it seems a lot of folks are talking about Pete DuPré — a 96-year-old Army veteran who served in World War II — and the mesmerizing rendition of the national anthem he turned in Sunday before a soccer game between the U.S. Women's National Team and Mexico.
But DuPré didn't sing a note. He just let his harmonica do all the talking.
And the hyped-up crowd at Red Bull Arena near Newark, New Jersey, simply fell silent once ""Harmonica Pete"" started playing, ABC News said .
And when he finished, the fans erupted in cheers, the network reported.
More to the story Turns out DuPré is well known to the U.S. team's players, ABC News said.
See, the squad visited Normandy, France, with DuPré and three other World War II veterans in January, the network said.
And the U.S. Women's National Team — which bested Mexico 3-0 on Sunday — will return to France this week to defend its World Cup title, ABC News added.

NYC employs manipulative tactics over gun control law ahead of major SCOTUS cause,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-gun-control-law-scotus,"Over fear that a Supreme Court ruling will inspire nationwide Second Amendment changes, New York City officials are attempting to manipulate a future Supreme Court ruling by amending the law on which the court will rule.
What are the details? According to the New York Times , the New York City Police Department held an ""unusual"" public hearing last month. The purpose? To make a Supreme Court case ""disappear.""
After the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to an existing gun control regulation in the Big Apple, city officials sought to amend the regulation in hopes that it would nullify the court's future decision. Officials reportedly fear the Supreme Court will rule against the city, impacting gun regulations nationwide.
More from The Times:
The regulation allows residents with so‐called premises licenses to take their guns to one of seven shooting ranges in the city. But it prohibits them from taking their guns to second homes and shooting ranges outside the city, even when the guns are unloaded and locked in containers separate from ammunition.
The city's proposed changes, likely to take effect in a month or so, would remove those restrictions. But before officials could move forward with the amendment they first needed to hold a public hearing. At that hearing, city officials were rebuked for their manipulative tactics.
""This law should not be changed. Not because it is a good law; it is blatantly unconstitutional. No, it should not be changed since this is a clear tactic to try to moot the SCOTUS case that is specifically looking into this law,"" one woman wrote to the hearing.
""This is a very transparent attempt to move the goal post in the recent Supreme Court case,"" another man said.
Is there existing precedent? It is not yet clear if the amendment would render the Supreme Court's future ruling moot, but according to the Times, there is perhaps existing precedent for the situation.
Before the Supreme Court ruled on D.C. v. Heller — perhaps the most important Second Amendment case in U.S. history — the National Rifle Association nearly upended the case, according to lawyer Robert Levy, who led the Heller litigation.
While Levy and his team of lawyers argued the Heller case before federal appeals court, NRA lobbying efforts, which sought to repeal D.C.'s highly restrictive gun law, nearly short-circuited Levy's efforts.
""Repealing D.C.'s ban would have rendered the Heller litigation moot,"" Levy wrote in a 2008 essay. ""After all, no one can challenge a law that no longer exists.""
In the end, the NRA relented, paving the way for the landmark decision in 2008 that reaffirmed an individual's right to own firearms.
New York City's case will be heard before the Supreme Court this fall.

Former Miss Gay Ohio America to teach teenagers 'how to do drag' in public library summer class — and it's titled 'Drag 101',www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-miss-gay-ohio-america-to-teach-teenagers-how-to-do-drag,"A former Miss Gay Ohio America is set to teach teenagers ""the building blocks of how to do drag"" in a public library summer class — and the course is titled ""Drag 101,"" WOWK-TV reported .
What are the details? ""Curious about the art of drag and no idea where to start? Come learn the basics with former Miss Gay Ohio America and local queen, Selena T. West!"" the class description reads . ""We will learn about the application of makeup and creating characters, as well as the history of drag. All genders welcome! Teens only, please.""
Image source: WOWK-TV video screenshot
The free class will take place at the Orange Branch of the Delaware County District Library system from 2 to 3 p.m. on June 5, WOWK reported, adding that there's no signup or registration required. There do not appear to be any other scheduled ""Drag 101"" classes on the library web site during the summer.
What does the 'Drag 101' teacher have to say? ""My boy name is Kyle Gayle. I'm 29-years-old and my drag name is Selena T. West,"" the Columbus drag performer told the station.
Image source: WOWK-TV video screenshot
West added to WOWK that ""Drag 101"" has ""nothing to do with sex or gender identity at all.""
What does the county library director have to say?
George Needham, Delaware County District Library director, added to the station that the class is ""probably the most controversial program I've ever worked with in 40 years.""
Image source: WOWK-TV video screenshot
He told WOWK that ""Drag 101"" is one of about 400 summer programs, 45 of which are for teenagers.
""A big mission for the library is to encourage lifelong learning, to encourage curiosity, and to encourage people to be engaged in the world,"" Needham added to the station.
What does a conservative U.S. Senate candidate have to say? Melissa Ackison — a mother of four and Republican candidate for U.S. Senate — told WOWK she has questions about the ""Drag 101"" class.
""My first concern was, 'Are there background checks for this program, and how are they vetting candidates who come in for something like this?'"" she told the station.
Melissa Ackison Image source: WOWK-TV video screenshot
Ackison also wondered to WOWK if ""Drag 101"" is an appropriate use of tax dollars or class time for teens and if it simply shouldn't be offered.
But the library director doesn't see it that way.
""You know if it helps to add to the education of the community, if it helps to add some civil discourse, I'll take a news crew every week,"" Needham told the station.

Pres. Trump says black people 'will not be able' to vote for Joe Biden because of support for 1994 crime bill,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pres-trump-says-black-people-will-not-be-able-to-vote-for-joe-biden-because-of-support-for-1994-crime-bill,"President Donald Trump said Monday that former Vice President and former senator Joe Biden's support for a 1994 crime bill that created the ""three strikes"" rule would hurt him with black voters, according to the New York Daily News .
President Trump in the same series of tweets, criticized Biden's support for the tough-on-crime law while touting his own role in advancing bipartisan criminal justice reform that aimed to curb over-incarceration.
""Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing,"" President Trump wrote. ""That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!""
""Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected,"" the president said in a tweet a little over an hour later. ""In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 bill!""
The president is referring to the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act , signed by former President Bill Clinton. The most well-known result of the law was a policy of ""mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for Federal offenders with three or more convictions for serious violent felonies or drug trafficking crimes.""
The law also included funding for border control and illegal immigrant deportations, as well as ""enhanced penalties for failure to depart the United States after a deportation order or reentry after deportation.""
Biden, as ranking minority member and eventually chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, contributed significantly to efforts to establish mandatory minimums for drug offenses and to curb violent crime. His role in the effort has been well-documented in recent years as a potential obstacle to his presidential ambitions.
A spokesman for Biden in 2015 claimed the then-vice president had actually opposed the three strikes aspect of the 1994 law, supposedly fearing unintended consequences.
Biden has not yet responded to the president's tweets."
"Only a certain type of 'white guy' should be president, according to marginal candidate Eric Swalwell",www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/only-a-certain-type-of-white-guy-should-be-president-according-to-marginal-candidate-eric-swalwell,"The emphasis on identity politics in the Democratic Party has resulted in a not-so-subtle vilifying of the dominant demographic in U.S. presidential history: The white male.
Even with two old, white men leading in the early polls in former Vice President Joe Biden and current Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, white male candidates still seem to feel obligated to speak in an almost apologetic way for their race and gender ( looking at you, Beto ).
This includes California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, who is running on a campaign mostly focused on gun control, and who is currently polling at approximately zero percent .
Swalwell was asked during an appearance on Vice News Tonight: ""Why should another white guy be president?""
""Well, a white guy who doesn't see other identities, or understand other experiences should not be president,"" Swalwell replied. ""I do. And where there would be gaps in my knowledge or my experience, I will pass the mic to people who do have that experience. I've also pledged that I would ask a woman to serve as vice president.""
This writer's perspective As a minority, I would be happy to see another minority ascend to the presidency. But, race and gender are not qualifications for office, and should not be the first thing considered when a voter selects a president or when a presidential candidate selects a running mate.
Swalwell, in his eagerness to atone for his white maleness, elevates race and gender to the top of the list when deciding who he would hypothetically select as advisors or as a running mate.
Instead of attempting to become knowledgeable and empathetic enough to speak competently on issues that impact minorities, Swalwell would simply hand the microphone to a token on his staff to handle the issue.
Instead of evaluating VP candidates on merit, and then potentially selecting a woman who is well qualified, Swalwell promises to just select some woman to be named later, which feels more condescending than it does equitable.
It seems unlikely that we will have to concern ourselves with a potential Swalwell presidency this cycle, but the tone of his answer reflects how clumsily white male Democratic candidates respond to questions of race and gender."
Senate Republicans brush off impeachment threat from House Dems: 'It would be quickly disposed of',www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-republicans-brush-off-impeachment-threat-from-house-dems-it-would-be-quickly-disposed-of,"Senate Republicans are publicly dismissive of the threats from House Democrats that they may bring articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, knowing that they have all the power in the situation, The Hill reported.
Some Democrats in the House of Representatives have been vocal for months about their desire to impeach the president, but so far impeachment hasn't gained any momentum. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) has an idea why that is.
""It would be defeated,"" Cornyn said. ""That's why all they want to do is talk about it. They know what the outcome would be.""
'Quickly disposed of' Democrats control the House, so they very well could introduce and pass articles of impeachment. But because Republicans have such a significant majority in the Senate (53-47) as well as the potential vice presidential tie-breaking vote, there's almost no chance that such an effort could be successful.
After the release of the Mueller report, in which special counsel Robert Mueller left open the question of whether the president should be charged with obstruction of justice, some Democrats have called for impeachment based on the evidence Mueller presented.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said impeachment based on Mueller's report would be quickly dismissed.
""I think it would be disposed of very quickly,"" said Graham, who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""If it's based on the Mueller report, or anything like that, it would be quickly disposed of.""
How would it play out? With control of the Senate, Republicans would have the power to dictate how extensive an impeachment trial would be. Meaning, it would not be extensive at all. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would be able to set the rules and ensure a brief trial with limited input by Democrats.
""Why on earth would we give a platform to something that I judge as a purely political exercise?"" Senate Judiciary Committee member Thom Thillis (R-N.C.) asked. ""We have to perform our constitutional duty, but if people think that we're going to try and create a theater that could give you the perception that this is a matter that rises to the level of Watergate, that's nonsense."""
US ambassador walks out of UN conference after dictator Nicolas Maduro's representative is given leadership role - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-ambassador-walks-out-of-un-conference-after-dictator-nicolas-maduros-representative-is-given-leadership-role,"The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, Robert Wood, walked out of the conference's session Tuesday after a representative of Venezuela's dictator was selected to lead it.
What happened? ""We have to try to do what we can to prevent these types of states from presiding over international bodies,"" Wood said, according to Reuters .
Wood argued that someone representing Juan Guaido, the U.S.-backed Venezuelan opposition leader and declared interim president, should lead the conference instead of a representative of the country's current dictator, Nicolás Maduro. He also called Venezuela a ""rogue state.""
Wood was also a former leader of the conference, which rotates through leadership based simply on where the first letter of the name of a member country appears in the alphabet. He said that allowing members of certain countries to take over just because it was their turn was wrong.
""Clearly, when you have regimes like the Assad regime [in Syria] and the Maduro regime presiding over this body, there s something fundamentally wrong with how we are conducting our business. And we need to examine that,"" he said.
Wood also said that the Lima Group, a collection of other Latin American countries, would also no longer be taking part in the conference, Fox News reported . The governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru have all publicly voiced their support for Guaido.
The Venezuelan ambassador responded The conference's new president, Jorge Valero, who represents Maduro's government, criticized Wood's departure, saying that the conference was ""not a forum for coup-mongering.
""We regret that the representative of the United States and its docile allies continue to bring to this forum matters that are outside the mandate"" of the Conference on Disarmament, Valero said.
Each president oversees the conference for one month."
President Trump 2020 victory predicted in multiple models — and a voice many might not expect is heralding it - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/president-trump-2020-victory-predicted-in-multiple-models-and-a-voice-many-wouldnt-expect-is-heralding-it,"Steven Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in former President Barack Obama's administration — which doesn't exactly make him the most likely individual to herald the notion that President Donald Trump is poised to win the 2020 election.
But that's exactly what Rattner did Monday in an op-ed for the New York Times, taking note of multiple models showing that Trump will come out on top next November, based on the strength of the economy and his incumbent status.
Rattner first pointed out Yale professor Ray Fair's model , which he said has proven very reliable given it predicted Obama would get 53.1 percent of the popular vote in 2008 (he actually totaled 53.7 percent) and 51.8 percent in 2012 as the incumbent — the latter figure was short of what Obama got by just two-tenths of 1 percent.
While Fair's model showed Trump getting 54.1 percent of the vote while falling well short of that (48.8 percent), Rattner said he was ""quite confident that the gap was a function of the generally unfavorable rankings on Mr. Trump's personal qualities. In other words, a more 'normal' Republican would likely have won the popular vote by a substantial margin (instead of losing it by three million votes).""
More from Rattner's op-ed:
A good part of Mr. Trump's edge in 2016 was the incumbency factor — after eight years of a Democratic president, voters would ordinarily have wanted a Republican. (Since 1952, only one man has become president following eight years of a president of the same party.) In 2020, incumbency will be a tailwind for Mr. Trump as the vast majority of presidents are chosen for a second term.
In its present state, the economy will also be helpful to the president. All told, Mr. Trump's vote share would ordinarily be as high as 56.1 percent. But that's before factoring in his personality. As recent polls show, if the election were today, he would lose to most of the Democratic hopefuls by a substantial margin; in the case of Joe Biden, by nearly eight percentage points. Anything else? Rattner also pointed out that others are predicting the same outcome, noting that Mark Zandi — chief economist at Moody's Analytics — said Trump won all 12 models he looked at. And Donald Luskin of Trend Macrolytics has reached the same conclusion in his examination of the Electoral College, the op-ed added.
""So the question for 2020 may well be whether Mr. Trump can overcome the majority of voters' poor perception of him and use a good economy and incumbency to win re-election,"" Rattner concluded.
The former Obama official pointed to a Trump 2020 victory last year on MSNBC as well, saying ""in the fall of 2020, if the economy looks like this, it will be very good for Donald Trump.""

What happened? Milano shared her scathing remarks on Twitter, in which she branded the 80-year-old veteran actor a ""has been"" and more.
On Saturday, Milano addressed videos on Voight's timeline, which featured the actor delivering pro-Trump remarks.
Milano shared one of Voight's videos and wrote, ""Now I understand why Republicans like to discredit actors and our political views. 'Stay in your lane, Jon!' 'Has been!' 'F-lister trying to stay relevant!' 'Nobody cares what an out of touch actor thinks!'""
Over two videos, titled, ""To my fellow Americans,"" Voight called Trump ""the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.""
Elsewhere in the video, Voight argued his support for the president and criticized Democrats for their liberal rhetoric.
""I know that you'll agree with me when I say that our president has our utmost respect and our love,"" Voight said during the video. ""This job is not easy, for he's battling the left and their absurd words of destruction.
""Our nation has been built on the solid ground from our forefathers and there is a moral code of duty that has been passed on from President Lincoln,"" he added.
He also praised the president and his administration for improving the state of America on all fronts, calling the nation ""stronger, safer and with more jobs"" under the Trump administration.
What else? The majority of responses to Milano's tweet were negative, and pointed out her hypocrisy for railing against the actor when she is often the brunt of political ire from the other side, and often demands tolerance for liberal opinions.
One user wrote , ""@jonvoight is no f-lister; 1 Academy award & 4 Golden Globes and still acting. More credits than yours. No need to call names because of differing opinions and beliefs. #tolerancegoesbothways.""

Netflix may stop filming in Georgia because of pro-life law,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/netflix-may-stop-filming-in-georgia-because-of-strict-anti-abortion-law,"Netflix says it will likely join the fight against the state of Georgia after Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed a restrictive abortion bill into law earlier in May.
Many Hollywood players opt to film and produce in the Peach State because of its hefty tax incentives.
What is Netflix saying? The online streaming giant said that it will stand in solidarity with entertainers who refuse to work in Georgia because of the state's new abortion law, and will ""rethink"" its filming options if the law isn't struck down.
The company issued a statement through Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos.
""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this,"" Sarandos' statement read. ""It's why we work with the ACLU and others to fight it in court. Given the legislation has not yet been implemented we'll continue to film there — while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to.""
""Should it ever come into effect, we'd rethink our entire investment in Georgia,"" Sarandos' statement warned.
Kemp signed the heartbeat bill — which would ouright ban abortions after it is possible to detect a fetal heartbeat — on May 7. Fetal heartbeats can be detected as early as six weeks into a woman's pregnancy. The measure is set to go into effect on January 1.
What else? Netflix isn't the only one weighing its options — Lori McCreary, former president of the Producers Guild of America as well as CEO of Revelations Entertainment — told Variety that she is hesitant to continue working in the state.
""It's hard to wake up every day feeling like I'm growing up in my mother's generation,"" McCreary said. ""I don't have anything that's shooting in those locations, but I would give it a second thought in those states because I think it's important for us to support [women].""
Calls for a boycott of the state have gained momentum in Hollywood since the abortion bill began generating buzz, with a laundry list of liberal entertainers signing off on such a movement.
Gov. Kemp isn't deterred — he, in fact, recently blasted boycotting celebrities who refuse to work in the state with scathing remarks of his own.
""I understand that some folks don't like this new law,"" he said. ""I'm fine with that. We're elected to do what's right — and standing up for precious life is always the right thing to do.
""We value and protect innocent life,"" he said, ""even though that makes C-list celebrities squawk."""
Missouri's only abortion clinic might be stopped from performing abortions by end of the week,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/only-abortion-clinic-in-missouri-could-be-stopped,"Missouri's only abortion clinic may soon be stopped from performing abortions — unless a state court intervenes.
""BREAKING: Missouri could soon become the first state in the country to have no health center that provides safe, legal abortion, leaving more than a million people in a situation we haven't seen since Roe v. Wade. This is unacceptable. Abortion care is health care. Period,"" Planned Parenthood President Dr. Leana Wen tweeted Tuesday morning in response to the news.
Planned Parenthood officials said that the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is ""refusing to renew"" the St. Louis clinic's annual abortion license, which is set to expire Friday, CBS News reported. The organization said it plans to file a lawsuit Tuesday, asking the state court to allow the clinic ""to keep serving Missouri women,"" according to the report.
""This is not a drill. This is not a warning. This is a real public health crisis. More than 1 million women of reproductive age in Missouri will no longer have access to a health center in their state that provides abortion care,"" Wen wrote in another tweet.
The organization's leader has vowed to keep the clinic open.
""To the women of Missouri, know this: Planned Parenthood will not stand for it. We will never abandon you and we will help you to get the care that you need — no matter what. Our doors remain open,"" Wen wrote on Twitter.
What are the details?
Last week, Health Department officials notified the clinic about three issues that could affect its license renewal, Planned Parenthood officials told CBS News.
The organization said it would address two of the state's requests, including providing an additional pelvic exam for abortion patients and making adjustments to the state-mandated counseling.
But Planned Parenthood claimed that the state's third request is out of its control.
State officials requested interviews with seven doctors who perform abortions at the clinic as apart of an investigation into ""deficient practices.""
Planned Parenthood said only two of the seven physicians are employed by the organization, therefore, it could only provide interviews with the two who are employed there.
The Health Department wrote in a letter that it would be unable to ""complete our investigation until it interviews the physicians involved in the care provided in the potential deficient practices.""
""[T]he investigation needs to be completed and any deficiencies resolved before the expiration of [the clinic's] license on May 31, 2019,"" the letter continued.
What did the clinic say? Dr. Colleen McNicholas, a physician at the St. Louis clinic, told CBS that she is not aware of the details surrounding the investigation.
""We are 100 percent committed to the best care that we can provide for patients. So certainly if there is an issue with the care we're providing we want to know about it,"" McNicholas said, adding that she expects to be interviewed by the Health Department Tuesday.
""We want to be able to address that. But we can't do that when we're being attacked,"" she said.
What else? Last week, Gov. Mike Parson (R) signed a pro-life bill that will ban abortion after eight weeks.
""By signing this bill today, we are sending a strong signal to the nation that, in Missouri, we stand for life, protect women's health, and advocate for the unborn,"" Parson said in a statement on Friday. ""All life has value and is worth protecting."""
French Senate votes to keep Notre Dame Cathedral as it was before the fire,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/french-senate-keep-notre-dame-as-it-was,"The French Senate is standing up to efforts in the French government to give Notre Dame Cathedral a modern redesign following the massive fire last month.
According to multiple media reports, France's Senate passed a bill to restore the centuries-old Catholic worship site after a lengthy debate and stipulated that the structure must be restored as it was before the conflagration.
On April 15, a fire tore through the historic building, engulfing the structure's roof and hallmark spire but miraculously leaving the sanctuary's altar and cross intact , as well as sparing other historic treasures . The cause still officially unknown.
In the aftermath of the tragedy, the question of how to rebuild and restore the church has turned into a fraught battleground between traditionalists who want to see the world famous church rebuilt as it was and those who favor a more modernist approach.
Shortly after the fire, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild Notre Dame ""more beautiful than before"" and announced an international design competition for the restoration plans. That announcement spurred a slew of possible new designs for the cathedral. One widely criticized design proposed turning the more than 800-year-old sacred space into a greenhouse.
A survey published at the end of April found that a 54 percent majority of French respondents would like to see the building returned to its historical appearance, while just over one-fifth had no opinion on the matter.
Notre Dame Cathedral was taken over by the country's new secular, republican government during the French Revolution and remains public property to this day, even though the Catholic Church has exclusive rights to the use of the building and grounds. That arrangement leaves the oversight of building repairs under the jurisdiction of the national government.
While the office of the president of France does carry more power than government leaders of other European countries , Macron does not have the power to veto legislation in the same way a U.S. president would; he can merely ask the French Parliament to revisit the issue."
Happiness expert says happiest people of all are women 'who never married or had children',www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/happiness-expert-says-happiest-people-of-all-are-women-who-never-married-or-had-children,"While the happiest of all wives may be religious conservatives , a happiness expert has declared that the happiest people of all are actually unmarried, childless women, The Guardian reported .
In fact, Paul Dolan — a professor of behavioral science at the London School of Economics — said over the weekend that such women are more likely to live longer than married mothers, the paper reported.
Eye-opening revelation
""Married people are happier than other population subgroups, but only when their spouse is in the room when they're asked how happy they are,"" Dolan said, The Guardian reported. ""When the spouse is not present: f***ing miserable.""
He added, ""If you're a man, you should probably get married; if you're a woman, don't bother,"" the paper said.
More from The Guardian:
Men benefited from marriage because they ""calmed down"", he said. ""You take less risks, you earn more money at work, and you live a little longer. She, on the other hand, has to put up with that, and dies sooner than if she never married. The healthiest and happiest population subgroup are women who never married or had children,"" he said.
Dolan's latest book, ""Happy Ever After,"" cites evidence from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which compared levels of pleasure and misery in unmarried, married, divorced, separated and widowed individuals. The study found that levels of happiness reported by those who were married was higher than the unmarried, but only when their spouse was in the room. Unmarried individuals reported lower levels of misery than married individuals who were asked when their spouse was not present. He added that women's health was mostly unaffected by marriage, although middle-aged married women were actually at a higher risk of physical and mental conditions than single women, the paper said.
""You see a single woman of 40, who has never had children — 'Bless, that's a shame, isn't it? Maybe one day you'll meet the right guy and that'll change,'"" Dolan said, according to the Guardian. ""No, maybe she'll meet the wrong guy and that'll change. Maybe she'll meet a guy who makes her less happy and healthy and die sooner."""

What are the details? According to WBTS-TV , four Jewish teens saw the victim bobbing in the Chestnut Hill Reservoir while walking along the body of water on Thursday night.
The teens flagged down a police officer and reported that they'd seen a person in trouble in the water.
""As I approached [the teens], two of them ran up to my car,"" Boston College Police Officer Carl Mascioli told the outlet. ""There was a body in the water.""
The officer ran to the reservoir and confirmed that there was indeed a man lying motionless in the water. Mascioli determined that the unnamed man didn't have much time left.
When the officer pulled the unidentified man from the water, he noticed the tattoo of the Nazi symbol on the man's hand.
""While I was pulling him out of the water, I also observed that he had a swastika on his hand,"" Mascioli told the outlet.
""I kind of let the gentleman know sometimes good deeds have a funny way of turning around,"" the officer said. ""[The teens'] good deed had a little bit of a twist to it.""
What was the teens' reaction? The teens, who were not publicly identified, said that they had no regrets about helping to save the man's life — but noted that they did want the man to know that ""it was four young Jewish boys that helped save his life.""
""A good deed is a good deed and that's part of life,"" Mascioli said. ""We should be helping everybody out.""

Here's what we know Gov. Janet Mills (D) signed the new law Friday. It will not take effect until September 2021 and will include an exemption for children whose parents have already gotten exemptions for them. It also still includes an exemption for medical reasons.
Maine is the fourth state to have passed such legislation.
""As governor, it is my responsibility to protect the health and safety of all Maine people, and it has become clear that our current laws do not adequately protect against the risks posed to Mainers,"" Mills told CNN .
While she acknowledged that ""people of good will hold sincere beliefs on both sides of the issue,"" she added, ""Maine has a vaccination opt-out rate that is three times higher than the national average for students entering kindergarten and the state ranks seventh in the country for the rate of non-medical exemptions taken among school-age children.""
State Sen. Lisa Keim (R), an opponent of the law, told the Portland Press Herald, said that by passing legislation like this Maine was ""pushing religious people out of our great state.""
In April , Maine's Center for Disease Control reported that state ""immunization rates among school-age children continue to decrease,"" and that the rate of kindergarteners who had received the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella had fallen to 93.8 percent. 95 percent is considered to be the threshold for ""herd immunity,"" where enough of a population is immune to a disease to prevent its spread. During the same time period, the amount of non-medical exemptions for childhood vaccinations was on the rise.
What else? When expressing her support for the law, Mills said that Maine had the worst rate of whooping cough in the United States.
In May, Maine also had its first case of measles since 2017."
NFL legend Burgess Owens decries 2020 Dems' push for slavery reparations,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nfl-legend-burgess-owens-decries-2020-dems-push-for-slavery-reparations,"Former Super Bowl champion and conservative author Burgess Owens says the slavery reparations movement promoted by several Democratic presidential candidates is an affront to American ideals, and has laid out his argument in a recent op-ed.
What are the details? Owens penned a column for the Wall Street Journal last week, declaring, ""I didn't earn slavery reparations, and I don't want them."" The retired Oakland Raider told the story of how his great-great-grandfather, Silas Burgess, was able to achieve great success in America despite first arriving to the country as a slave.
The author of ""Why I Stand: From Freedom to the Killing Fields of Socialism"" went on to explain how his ancestor escaped slavery to become a successful entrepreneur, land owner, and family man who built his town's first black church and first black elementary school.
""Now, because of him,"" Owens wrote of his namesake, ""a bunch of Democratic presidential hopefuls want to give me money, because of work I've never done, stripes I've never had, under a whip I'll never know, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Elizabeth Warren and others want to give me free stuff. Never mind that it will be taken from others, who also dreamed, worked and sacrificed to earn it.""
Several 2020 candidates have gone on record saying they believe the descendants of slaves should receive payment from the U.S. government to compensate for America's slave-owning past.
Owens went on to decry the reparations movement in its entirety, calling it divisive, demeaning to both blacks and whites, and a notion which ""demeans America's founding ideals.""
Anything else? Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Owens reiterated, ""Unfortunately, the left doesn't see respect the way we see it. They will lie, steal and cheat to get what they think they deserve, which is somebody else's property.""
The former NFL player told the network he did not believe the slavery reparations movement would continue to gain steam, and instead called for the Democratic Party to pay reparations for the damage it has done ""to our country and the black community.""

NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's new criminal guidelines to allow violent young adults to get out of jail free,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-mayor-de-blasios-new-criminal-guidelines-to-allow-violent-teens-to-get-out-of-jail-free,"The city of New York will allow more young adults to get out of jail free on charges, including assault and battery and armed robbery, the New York Post reported.
Mayor Bill de Blasio's Office of Criminal Justice has developed new guidelines which his office hopes to allow three times as many teens to be released from jail with no bail. The policy takes effect Saturday.
It will also increase the number of adults who qualify for the mayor's no-bail Supervised Release Program.
What are the details? The policy will expand the Youth Engagement Track to include young adults ages 18-19. It's currently capped at 17 for most of the city.
The program, which allows mostly ""high-risk"" teens charged with misdemeanors or nonviolent felonies to be released without bail, will expand to more serious and violent crimes including first- and second-degree robbery.
Miriam Popper, executive director of diversion initiatives for the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice, expects the number of eligible teen defendants to more than triple, according to the Post.
Teens who are released with no bail will be ""placed on an intensive supervision schedule in the first month,"" Popper wrote in a memo to judges earlier this month. Those who are placed in the program would also be required to undergo psychological counseling.
Why is the city expanding the program? The Supervised Release Program expansion plays into de Blasio's controversial plan to close the Rikers Island jail complex.
""In our city, we have reduced our jail population about 30 percent already,"" de Blasio said during an interview on CNN' s ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""We are ending the era of mass incarceration in New York City.""
What do opponents say? A high-ranking New York Police Department official told the Post that de Blasio's administration adopted the new policies without considering the effect on ""neighborhoods where people are being robbed and assaulted.""
""Without bail, the perps will be thinking: 'I'm in and I'm out. Nothing's going to happen.' "" the official said. ""'What's the big deal?'""
""People who have never been a victim of crime, they really don't think about the consequences of this,"" the official added.
Court system sources for the Post said that many judges fear they could lose their jobs if they don't align with the program's more lenient guidelines.
""There's tremendous political pressure in this city, and it comes from the New York City government, it comes from the defenders who are emboldened,"" one courthouse source told the newspaper. ""Judges feel the pressure."""
Hilariously unhinged Trump protester at SF free speech rally goes viral after ranting about smashing fascists' free speech,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/unhinged-trump-protester-smash-free-speech-for-fascism,"A woman is going viral for her foul-mouthed appearance at a recent rally in San Francisco.
What are the details? Fog City Midge, a conservative filmmaker and producer, visited the free speech rally in San Francisco, where liberal protesters gathered to rail against conservatives standing up for their rights to express their conservative views.
Fog City Midge shared the video on her popular YouTube channel and captioned it, ""Fake News Media have pushed a false narrative of Trump supporters being fascists from day one. At the recent Free Speech Rally in SF, Trump-Derangement leftist characters like this show how effective they've been. The hypocrisy is crazy! No problem admitting that sometimes they act like fascists to fight the 'fash.' Unreal!""
During the visit, Midge met up with the protester, who railed against fascism, but admitted that sometimes, you have to use fascism to fight fascism.
Here are some of the protester's most interesting Quote: s:
""I hate fascists. I hate fascism. Fascism is not a political philosophy. Fascism is an illness, it's a plague, it's a disease. It's a tumor! You cut it out! You don't argue with them! You don't debate them!"" ""'Hey, doctor, can you give me an argument against cancer, please, so I can argue against cancer?' No! No! No."" ""I'm not intolerant, idiot! My father and my uncles ... got the purple heart! Patton! Ike! Bradley! Montgomery! Churchill! ... [I'm angry] because I hate your fascist ass!"" ""I'll write your obituary and piss on your grave."" ""I am very intolerant of fascism, you moron! ... I'm also intolerant of cancer and AIDS, f***head."" ""If they dox me, they're gonna get the shock of their f***ing life. ... They use face recognition. The tech comes from Putin."" ""These are stupid f***ing fatso dirtbags living in their mom's basements. They are not ... a threat. But, we do not have to have them on our streets! We should not have to see their ugly faces! Let them go back to their f***ing cellars!"" ""Of course I'm intolerant!"" ""The election of Trump encouraged the 'fash' to come out of their basements. We now have fascism because Trump, Trumpism led to fascism. We weren't fascists in 2016."" ""Their right to be white people who get the jobs first ... who tell me, stupidly, 'I can't tell if you're a man or a woman,' to which I say, 'Neither can I! So f***ing what! Does that mean you get to kill me? Noooo.' I can't tell if I'm a man or a woman.'""
What else? Elsewhere during the five-minute video, Midge asked the protester if she believed that the whole point of free speech was the ability to demonstrate and march.
""No free speech for fascists! No free speech for cancer! No free speech for HIV!"" the protester blared. ""No, sorry.""
Midge told TheBlaze that the anti-Trump and leftist protesters at the rally ""claimed that they were there to 'smash fascism,'"" and insisted that ""all Trump supporters were 'fascists'"" with no right to free speech.
""Sometimes we have to get fascist against the fascists,"" the protester added. ""That's a terrible thing for me to say. I'm a spiritual person.""

Baseball team apologizes over video depicting AOC as an 'enemy of freedom',www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/baseball-team-apologizes-over-video-depicting-aoc-as-an-enemy-of-freedom,"A minor league baseball team has apologized to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) after playing a Memorial Day tribute video showing her as an example of America's ""enemies of freedom.""
What are the details? During a doubleheader Monday night, the Fresno Grizzlies aired a clip between games at Chukchansi Park that showed a series of images set to a patriotic speech given by the late President Ronald Reagan. The congresswoman's picture was included in a part where Reagan speaks of the ""enemies of freedom,"" sandwiched between North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and deceased Cuban communist leader Fidel Castro.
The other images in the ""enemies of freedom"" portion showed Antifa activists.
Reagan - Memorial Day Tribute - We are Americans www.youtube.com
The Grizzlies — a Class AAA team affiliated with the Washington Nationals — issued a statement apologizing to their fans, the community, and past and current service members afterward, saying that ""unfortunately what was supposed to be a moving tribute ended with some misleading and offensive editing, which made a statement that was not our intent and certainly not our opinion.""
The club also apologized to Ocasio-Cortez directly, saying on Twitter, ""We're embarrassed we allowed this video to play without seeing it in its entirety first. We unconditionally apologize to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez in addition to our fans, community and those we hurt.""
Anything else? Grizzlies spokesman Paul Braverman told USA Today that the employee who chose the video has been identified and is remorseful for selecting it to be broadcast at Chukchansi. Still, Braverman said the club will likely not play clips pulled from the internet in the future out of ""an abundance of caution."""
Kamala Harris wants states to check with her before they pass any more pro-life laws,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-wants-states-to-check-with-her-before-they-pass-any-more-pro-life-laws,"Not to be outdone by the rest of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary field on the abortion front, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., announced her new ""reproductive rights"" plan on Tuesday that would force states to check with her administration before enacting any new pro-life laws.
In a statement accompanying the plan, Harris cited a ""the pressing need to pass federal legislation protecting reproductive rights"" but added that ""simply codifying Roe v. Wade isn't enough"" because ""extreme politicians in state legislatures have been working to systematically chip away at Roe for decades.
""From Alabama to Ohio, and Missouri to Georgia, the goal of Republican politicians is clear: Overturn Roe v. Wade and end safe and legal abortion in America,"" the statement adds elsewhere, referencing the recent trend of state-level laws restricting abortion.
The candidate's answer to the pro-life trend in state legislatures would be a ""Reproductive Rights Act,"" which would borrow from the 1965 Voting Rights Act and require that states get pre-cleared by the Department of Justice before any new pro-life law could take effect.
Under the VRA, states with a history of racial segregation and codified discrimination had to get clearance from the Department of Justice before they could change their voting laws. Those states were Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia, according to DOJ records .
The Voting Right's Act's old preclearance formula, however, was struck down at the Supreme Court on 10th Amendment grounds in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013 by a 5-4 decision.
Harris' proposal acknowledges the results of the 2013 decision and blames the outcome on a ""partisan majority""; it also claims that the court ""explicitly invited Congress to update the formula"" along new lines, which is what she would do to safeguard abortion access as president.
Under the plan, state and local governments with a ""pattern of violating Roe v. Wade in the preceding 25 years"" would be subject to a preclearance requirement.
""Under the plan, any change with respect to abortion in a covered jurisdiction will remain legally unenforceable until DOJ determines it comports with the standards laid out by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade , as applied in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt , and the Women's Health Protection Act, which Harris co-sponsors in the Senate,"" the proposal explains.
The Women's Health Protection Act was reintroduced in both chambers of Congress last week and would statutorily bar states from passing new ""non-medical"" pro-life laws .
Harris' abortion proposal follows a week after the announcement of fellow 2020 candidate and Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's plans to create a federal "" Office of Reproductive Rights. """
"Man claims he was the victim of anti-gay hate crime while waiting for subway. Turns out, he lied.",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-man-lies-subway-hate-crime,"A Manhattan man who told police he was the victim of an anti-gay hate crime while waiting for the subway in New York City over the weekend lied about the incident, police say.
What happened? The New York Post reported Sunday that a man, who was waiting for the subway in Tribeca, was assaulted by two men shouting anti-gay slurs.
The 25-year-old victim was allegedly attacked following a verbal altercation with the two men, police said. The assault left the victim with a laceration on his head that required eight stitches, the New York Daily News reported .
Meanwhile, police combed the neighborhood for the alleged attackers, who fled the scene on foot.
What are police saying now? After interviewing witnesses, police now say the victim was actually the attacker. The Post reported Monday that the victim initiated the attack — not the two unidentified men he accused.
The Post reports:
Police interviewed multiple people, however, who witnessed the incident and said the straphanger was the aggressor. Video obtained by police allegedly shows him spitting at subway riders when the suspects-turned-victims step in and try to stop him.
Cops believe the man was drunk and that no gay slurs were ever made. Police said they will not file charges against the man for filing a false police report, The Post reported."
Supreme Court to decide whether parents of Mexican teen shot in Mexico by US Border Patrol can sue United States,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-mexican-teen-shot-by-border-patrol,"The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether or not the family of a Mexican teenager shot on the Mexican side of the border by U.S. Border Patrol agents can sue the U.S. government for reparations.
What are the details? In 2010 , 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca was shot in the head and killed by Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa. The agent was reportedly trying to deal with rock-throwing illegal immigrants who were trying to cross the border. However, according to USA Today , a video taken on a cellphone seemed to show Hernandez Guereca hiding underneath a train trestle before he was killed.
One thing both sides agree on is that Hernandez Guereca was on the Mexican side of the border at the time of the incident. Lawyers for his family claimed that he was playing with his friends in a concrete culvert near the border when he was killed.
Sergio Belmonte, a spokesman for the city of Juarez, Mexico, said that Hernandez Guereca was unarmed and ""did not have the physical size to threaten anyone."" The mayor of the city said that the teen was a ""straight-A student.""
Hernandez Guereca's family wants to sue the United States government for monetary damages. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The U.S. government has refused to extradite Mesa to Mexico.
What else? The Supreme Court had heard this same case in 2017 , but decided to send it back to the lower courts. In their dissent on this decision, Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that they believed Hernandez Guereca should be protected by the Fourth Amendment. Justice Clarence Thomas also dissented, but argued that instead of handing the case back to the lower courts, the Supreme Court should have ruled against the family's petition to sue."
Meghan McCain tells Amy Klobuchar to show some respect and leave her late father out of 'presidential politics',www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/meghan-mccain-tells-amy-klobuchar-to-show-some-respect-and-leave-her-late-father-out-of-presidential-politics,"Meghan McCain, the daughter of the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), has asked Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to stop using her father's legacy on the campaign trail, after the 2020 hopeful invoked her former colleague in order to take swipes at President Donald Trump over the weekend.
What are the details? On Saturday, Klobuchar used stories of Sen. McCain's disdain for the president during a speech in Iowa, where she claimed the late senator recited the names of dictators to her during President Trump's inauguration ceremony.
According to TheBlaze 's Caleb Howe, ""Klobuchar was a great admirer of McCain and speaks of him often on the trail.""
But Meghan McCain, a co-host on ""The View,"" is apparently not impressed with the Democrat's strategy, and called on Klobuchar to ""please be respectful to all of [the McCain family] and leave my father's legacy and memory out of presidential politics.""
George Conway — a frequent critic of President Trump and the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway — defended Klobuchar on Tuesday, saying, ""Sen. Klobuchar was perfectly respectful, and the anecdote she told redounded to the late Senator's credit. His legacy belongs to the nation he devoted his life to serving.""
Anything else? Sen. McCain and President Trump had an ongoing feud that continued even after the senator passed away in August 2018 after battling brain cancer, the Washington Examiner reported.
According to USA Today , Sen. McCain issued a statement one month before he died, condemning the president's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, saying, ""The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,"" while calling the meeting ""a tragic mistake.""
President Trump has taken several shots at the former POW since his death. In March, he declared on Twitter that he was ""never a fan of John McCain and I never will be."""
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez melts down over NY Times’ ‘glamour shot’ of former Trump aide Hope Hicks,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-meltdown-hope-hicks-story,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) blasted The New York Times for sharing a glamorous photo of former Trump aide, Hope Hicks.
Wait, what? Ocasio-Cortez lambasted the outlet on Sunday after it published an article on Hicks, President Donald Trump's former communications director, criticizing the tenor of the article and its accompanying photo.
The 29-year-old freshman congresswoman criticized the coverage of 30-year-old Hicks as ""some Lifetime drama called 'Hope's Choice.'""
The article, which examined Hicks' tenure in the White House, theorized on how she may react to a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) in connection to the Russia investigation of the Trump administration .
One of the outlet's Twitter accounts shared the article, captioning it, ""Hope Hicks, one of the best-known but least visible former members of President Trump's White House staff, is facing an existential question: whether to comply with a congressional subpoena.""
In one tweet, Ocasio-Cortez wrote, ""What gets me is news breaks that this woman is weighing committing a crime before Congress & it's getting framed by the NYT as some Lifetime drama called 'Hope's Choice.'""
""This is a fmr admin official considering participating in a coverup led by the President,"" she said. ""Treat her equally.""
In a second tweet, the freshman lawmaker added, ""In the aftermath of shootings, media routinely post menacing photos of people-of-color victims + dredge up any questionable thing they'd ever done. But when Hope Hicks considers not complying w a subpoena, it's glamour shot time.""
What else? The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hicks — who stepped down from her White House position in March — in April.
The committee gave Hicks a June 4 deadline at which time she is required to disclose documents that the committee requested, including ""any personal or work diary journal or other book containing notes, a record, or a description of daily events.""
Hicks is expected to testify in front of the committee on June 19.
Hicks has yet to indicate whether she will comply with the subpoena."
President Trump claimed he revoked John Brennan's security clearance — but he never did,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-brennan-security-clearance-trump-never-revoked,"President Donald Trump claimed last August that he had revoked former CIA Director John Brennan's security clearance. The administration claimed Brennan's ""erratic conduct and behavior"" posed a threat to the intelligence community.
In response, Brennan threatened legal action and called Trump's decision an ""egregious abuse of power and authority.""
But it was revealed this weekend that Trump never carried through with the revocation — and Brennan still maintains his top-level security clearance.
What is going on? Although Trump was serious about revoking Brennan's clearance, The New York Times reported over the weekend that White House aides and Justice Department officials blocked Trump from doing so, arguing the move would ""jeopardize national security.""
Despite leaving his post as CIA director once Trump became president, Brennan continued to consult lawmakers and other government officials on sensitive intelligence matters, a standard practice for senior intelligence officials no longer working in the government.
Brennan — one of the president's most outspoken critics — has continued that practice, despite Trump's threats and claim of revocation.
According to The Associated Press , Brennan briefed Democrats on Capitol Hill last week about the growing tensions with Iran, which Democrats fear Trump will escalate.
The revelation about Brennan's security clearance comes days after the president authorized Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority"" to declassify intelligence information related to the origins of the Russia investigation, a power that Barr requested.
Barr, with the help of U.S. Attorney John Durham, is investigating the origins of the investigation. They are working closely with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is also investigating possible abuses of the FISA court during the course of the Russia investigation."
Second GOP rep blocks passage of $19 billion disaster relief bill - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/massie-blocks-disaster-relief-bill,"A second Republican member of Congress has blocked the rushed passage of a $19 billion disaster relief bill.
What's the background? This is the second time that the House of Representatives has tried to pass this bill by unanimous consent, since many members are currently away from Washington, D.C., during the Memorial Day spring recess. If even a single member objects, the bill is stalled until the House is back in session.
On May 24 , Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) objected to the bill and blocked it from proceeding. He called it the ""kind of swampy practice"" that ""Texans elected me to stand against.""
Before the bill reached the House, it passed the Senate by a vote of 85 to 8.
This legislation included $3 billion for farmers, $909 million in food benefits and other aid to Puerto Rico, and $3 billion set aside to ""rebuild our military bases and Coast Guard facilities."" It also included additional ""supplemental appropriations"" for departments dealing with the natural disasters. What it lacked was any funding for border security, which the Senate had stripped out before it passed the bill.
President Donald Trump publicly expressed "" total approval "" for this bill after it passed the Senate, even without any border funding.
What happened now? On Tuesday, the House of Representatives again tried to pass the relief bill, and it was once again blocked by a single member. This time it was Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) who spoke out against the bill.
""If the speaker of this House felt that this was must-pass legislation, the speaker of this House should have called a vote on this legislation before sending its members on recess for 10 days,"" he said, according to Politico .
In addition to objecting to the bill being rushed through without the whole House in session, Roy and Massie raised objections to spending $19 billion while the national debt continues to grow, and to the Senate's removal of all border-related funding.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) argued that this bill ""needs to be passed as soon as possible for the welfare for the people in this country.""
However, Hoyer also said that he won't call the House back into session early and will instead wait for members to reconvene after their recess ends. This would place the House vote on Monday or Tuesday of next week.
""Very frankly, three or four days isn't going to make a difference. What makes a difference is the inability to come to a rational agreement, which we have done, and not have somebody object simply because they have the power to do so in this context,"" Hoyer said, according to Politico.
Other House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.), are supporting both this bill and Hoyer's push to get it passed quickly.
The House and Senate have been debating versions of this bill for several months now. The current version was first introduced in the House on April 9."
This Catholic high school quietly holds funerals for homeless veterans,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/catholic-high-school-funerals-for-homeless-veterans,"America magazine profiled an all-boys school in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, for its practice of holding funerals for homeless veterans.
What are the details? America contributor Michael Kotsopoulos, who works at the school, detailed his recent experience at one of these funerals and how it moved him. He told of his somber encounter at the school:
I am greeted by a wooden casket hoisted on the shoulders of eight high school basketball players as I enter the lobby of Catholic Memorial School in early January. An American flag covers the casket. At 8 a.m., I expect a tired expression across the face of each young man and wonder how they will navigate the halls to the narrow chapel. Kotsopoulos went on to recall what vice principal Tom Ryan told him and the rest of the faculty on his first day of work at the school.
""If you want to let a student know that they're loved, call them by their name,"" he recalled Ryan saying. ""After all, someone loved them enough to give them one.""
When a person calls someone by their name, it shows the person that they matter — that they exist in the eyes of at least one other person. But what happens when nobody knows their name? And what happens when those who knew it no longer exist? Who reminds them of their own dignity then? Kotsopoulos attended the funeral of homeless U.S. Army veteran Timothy Fowl, a man whom nobody seemed to know. Kotsopoulos and his peers did know, however, that Fowl passed away at the Brockton VA Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, and that he'd spent six years of his life in the Army as a medical specialist.
Fowl reportedly worked as a welder in the years following his discharge, but then fell on hard times, and, according to Kotsopoulos, left behind no known friends or family and ""received no heartfelt goodbyes.""
Eight members of the school's basketball team carried the casket for an American service member that they never met.
School President Peter Folan eulogized Fowl.
""Here at C.M., we're a family,"" he said. ""A proud family. We're a community that welcomes people in and accepts them for where they are. We ask them to join us on our journey toward being more, doing more and caring for others.""
""Timothy Fowl, welcome to our family,"" Folan added.
Kotsopoulos wrote that few people knew Fowl at the time of his death, but as President Folan ""listed off his military service and the significance of his duty, a room full of young men began to understand what the name Timothy Fowl meant. To them, it meant sacrifice for one's country. It meant service. It meant bravery. With that, every student left school that day keeping Mr. Fowl's memory alive.""
How did this come about? According to Kotsopoulos, in 2017 the director of campus ministry — Kevin Durazo — started the tradition of providing funerals for veterans with no known living loved ones or friends.
""The school considers it a part of its mission to welcome those on the margins into their community — an active and engaging way for an adolescent to understand the concept of empathy,"" Kotsopoulos wrote. ""At C.M., serving means to walk with, not ahead of, another. Though students collectively complete over 15,000 hours of required service work each year, they do not receive hours for their participation in the funeral.""
Kotsopoulos revealed that Durazo coordinates with a local funeral home and invites different school groups to host funeral services for the various veterans.
""The school partners with Lawler and Crosby to coordinate the casket, hearse, and transportation needed for the burial at the veterans' cemetery in Winchendon, [Massachusetts],"" Kotsopoulos said.
Incredible. What else? In retrospect, Kotsopoulos said that services of this type leave profound impressions on the boys' minds.
""As a Christian Brothers school, C.M. prioritizes Jesus' seven corporal works of mercy in its active service to others,"" he wrote. ""These works instruct us to feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, shelter the homeless, visit the sick, visit prisoners, give alms to the poor, and bury the dead.""
He continued:
During these funeral services in the chapel, our students learn what it means to welcome someone on the margins into their family. They give shelter, visit the sick and bury the dead. They learn how to empathize with the suffering of others and to see a stranger as their brother.
And it starts with learning his name."
President Trump doubles down on Kim Jong Un's insult to Joe Biden — and adds to it,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-calls-biden-an-idiot,"President Donald Trump added to the controversy over an insult to former Vice President Joe Biden from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un that the president agreed with.
The president had said that he had agreed with the dictator that Biden was a ""low IQ person,"" but after Democratic outrage, he doubled down with a tweet on Tuesday.
"" I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil,"" said the president.
""Kim Jong Un called him a 'low IQ idiot,' and many other things, whereas I related the Quote: of Chairman Kim as a much softer 'low IQ individual.' Who could possibly be upset with that?"" he added.
The president was referring to a statement of outrage by the Biden campaign about Trump siding with an insult from one of the world's worst dictators.
""Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that,"" the president said to reporters on Monday.
The Biden campaign issued a statement decrying the act by Trump on Monday.
""To be on foreign soil, on Memorial Day, and to side repeatedly with a murderous dictator against a fellow American and former Vice President speaks for itself,"" said Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield.

"Trump supporter confronts Justin Amash at town hall for endorsing impeachment, and it gets very heated",www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/amash-and-maga-hat-debate-at-townhall,"Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) was confronted by a Trump supporter at his town hall meeting who wanted answers after the Republican Libertarian called for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
The woman, who was wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" cap, accused Amash of acting like a Democrat for reaching the conclusion that the president had committed impeachable acts.
""This is what Mueller and the Democrats have all tried to, and the deep state, the bureaucrats, I don't know if you've ever dealt with a bureaucrat, but it's just mind-boggling that we have to deal with them,"" the woman said, ""I have a lot of experience.""
""How come you've become a Democrat when we voted for you as a Republican because you just drink the same Kool-Aid as all the Democrats?"" she asked.
Amash had to calm down over-heated members of the audience before he answered her question.
""First, I have one of the most constitutionally conservative and fiscally conservative voting records in the whole Congress,"" Amash answered to great applause.
""And in fact, I have voted to spend less than any member of Congress in either chamber since I've been in Congress,"" he explained,"" so I've voted for less spending. When I got elected as part of the Tea Party movement, people cared about limited government, they cared about fiscal conservatism, making sure that our government wasn't spending too much.
""Under the current administration,"" he added, ""spending is skyrocketing, so spending has gone way up, and Republicans unfortunately, haven't said that much about it, and I continue to reduce spending at the federal level. I talked earlier about how I think we do too many things at the federal level.""
Amash continued on to say that he is always at the top or near the top of every conservative scorecard that rates the votes of members of Congress.
""I haven't changed, I am who I said I was,"" Amash concluded to great applause. ""I am a principled constitutional conservative who has stayed consistent regardless of whether we have President Obama in office, or President Trump.""
Amash has picked up a primary challenger due to his public announcement that he would support an effort to impeach the president based on his reading of the redacted Mueller report.

Hurdler born male but competing as female easily takes NCAA women's national championship,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/hurdler-born-male-but-competing-as-female-easily-takes-ncaa-womens-national-championship,"A college hurdler who was born male but has been competing as a female just became an NCAA women's national champion.
CeCe Telfer of Franklin Pierce University won the 400-meter hurdles Saturday night by more than a second with a personal collegiate-best time of 57.53 seconds and also was named to the All-America First Team in the 100-meter hurdles.
Telfer is the school's first women's track & field champion. FPU is an NCAA Division II school in Rindge, New Hampshire.
What did Telfer's head coach have to say?
""It was tough conditions out here with the wind and the heat over the last three days, but as she has over the last six months, CeCe proved herself to be tough enough to handle it,"" head coach Zach Emerson said of Telfer's run. ""Today was a microcosm of her entire season; she was not going to let anything slow her down. I've never met anybody as strong as her mentally in my entire life.""
What's the background? Telfer — formerly known as Craig — as recently as January 2018 ran with the men's track & field team at Franklin Pierce University. Telfer started going by the name CeCe while competing with the men before transitioning to women's competition.
According to the website Turtleboy Sports , which researched some of Telfer's statistics as a male competitor, Telfer was an above-average male hurdler. But as women's hurdles are lower, Telfer soon dominated the competition and became the top women's competitor in the women's 55-meter hurdles and 55-meter sprint.
The NCAA has had a policy for transgender athletes for years. It is legal under NCAA bylaws for a biological male to compete in the women's division if that male has suppressed his testosterone levels for one year.
A guidance document on the issue published by the NCAA took the stance that it is not accurate to assume that a male who has transitioned to become a transgender female has an unfair advantage over a biological woman, saying ""it is important not to overgeneralize.""
Here's a clip of Telfer in action earlier this spring:

"Awkward: Gillibrand raps in response to question about music she likes, gets lyrics wrong",www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/awkward-gillibrand-raps-in-response-to-question-about-music-she-likes-gets-lyrics-wrong,"It seems that every time a Democratic presidential candidate tries to be ""cool,"" things go horribly, awkwardly wrong. Such was the case with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who has a few of these cringeworthy moments in her campaign already.
Gillibrand was campaigning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, over the weekend, and taking questions from those in attendance. A child asked her what her favorite song was by the artist Lizzo.
It's unclear why this child even thought Gillibrand had a favorite Lizzo song. Maybe she was instructed by someone to ask this specific question to give Gillibrand a chance to appear culturally aware to younger voters. Maybe this girl just hoped Gillibrand liked Lizzo.
After Gillibrand's response, it's equally unclear whether Gillibrand actually has any idea who Lizzo is, or if she's ever heard any of her songs.
Gillibrand chose Lizzo's ""Good as Hell"" as her favorite song. But instead of telling a young child in Iowa that she liked a song called ""Good as Hell,"" she decided instead to attempt to perform the lyrics.
""I flip my hair back, check my nails. Baby how you feeling?"" Gillibrand rapped.
The actual lyric is ""I do my hair toss,"" not ""I flip my hair back."" Which seems like a minor mistake, except that, as The Daily Caller's Eddie Zipperer notes, the ""hair toss"" line is repeated 12 times in a song that's only two minutes and 45 seconds. Something a big fan of the 2016 song might know.
At least Gillibrand didn't get into the first verse of the song, which starts off ""Woo child, tired of the bulls***. Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving. Yes Lord, tryna get some new s***.""
File this one away with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) saying she listened to music by Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac in college when those artists hadn't released music yet , or Beto O'Rourke live streaming haircuts and dentist appointments. Or the numerous Democrats posting videos while cooking .

Biden may have a difficult time distancing himself from 1994 crime law—he once called it the 'Biden crime bill',www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-may-have-a-difficult-time-distancing-himself-from-1994-crime-bill-he-once-called-it-the-biden-crime-bill,"Former Vice President Joe Biden hasn't yet responded to President Donald Trump's criticism of Biden's support for a 1994 crime law that contributed to increased incarceration rates. If or when he does, Biden will certainly have to address past comments proudly taking ownership of the law.
The Hill reported Tuesday that, during a 2007 Democratic presidential debate , Biden used his extensive role in getting the bill passed to attack then-Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani.
""He is genuinely not qualified to be president,"" Biden said of the former New York City mayor. ""Here's a man who brags about how he made the city safe. It was the Biden crime bill that became the Clinton crime bill that allowed him to do that.""
Biden was the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee when the law passed under former President Bill Clinton. Clinton has since apologized for signing the bill, admitting that it exacerbated the problem of mass incarceration.
Twelve years after those comments during his last unsuccessful run for president, Biden finds himself as the early frontrunner in the Democratic field for the 2020 nomination. However, the politics of criminal justice have changed significantly, and the most significant bipartisan achievement of Pres. Trump's first term was a law seeking to reverse the damage from the 1994 law.
Earlier this month, Biden told a New Hampshire audience that the crime bill ""did not generate mass incarceration."" Biden has said laws set by individual states dictating mandatory minimum sentences for drug and nonviolent crimes was the main problem.
Pres. Trump, surely understanding that Biden could very well be his opponent in November 2020, has highlighted the negative perception the 1994 law could cause Biden, saying ""African Americans will not be able to vote for you.""
""I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!"" Pres. Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday."
Montana case of mother who lost her child due to health issues shines spotlight on child protective service abuses,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/case-of-little-boy-taken-from-mom-adopted-out-because-of-her-health-shines-spotlight-on-child-services-abuses,"Most Americans would never imagine that going to the hospital could result in the government seizing their child, but that's exactly what happened to Debbie Westlake when she went to the emergency room three years ago.
Montana's Child & Family Services division sent out a social worker on their first ""Priority 1"" call who determined Westlake's 4-year-old son, Robert, should be taken from daycare to foster care before his mother was released from the hospital that day.
There were no allegations of child abuse or substance abuse — the state wanted to make sure Westlake had an adequate backup plan for a babysitter in the instance of her getting sick again. Now, Robert has been adopted out to another family, and his case shines a light on how states are incentivized to bring kids into the system and keep them there in exchange for federal dollars.
What are the details? CFS required Westlake to take a slew of courses and attend counseling, which she did. In the meantime, she had a hysterectomy that cleared up the symptoms that landed her in the hospital in the first place. But she could never reach the state's demands.
According to court documents obtained by TheBlaze, District Judge Michael Menahan admitted during proceedings, ""I have to say that this is one of the more difficult cases, if not the most difficult case, that I've had in terms of the narrow legal issue as to whether or not to grant temporary investigative authority and emergency protective services based on a finding of probable cause that a child — in this case, Robert — may be a youth in need of care.""
Nonetheless, Judge Menahan ultimately decided the boy would be better off raised by someone else and terminated Westlake's parental rights, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld the ruling on appeal.
Robert was adopted earlier this year by a couple who had no children of their own.
Meanwhile, the rookie social worker, Grace Zitzer, who pushed for Robert's removal in the first place bragged of the ""patience and kindness"" she learned at CFS as part of her bid to become the reigning Miss Montana .
What happened to the Westlake family is egregious, but far from rare. Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform wrote in the Montana Standard earlier this year that ""contempt for parents who use drugs, or parents who simply are poor and whose poverty is confused with 'neglect,' runs so deep that Montana now has a dubious distinction: It is the child removal capital of America.""
What is going on in Montana?
The state of Montana's Child & Family Services division has been under fire for years; plagued by high turnover, accusations of mismanagement, and — most alarmingly — taking children from their parents and placing them into the foster care system at consistently high rates.
A 2017 analyst published by Child Trends shows Montana has nearly three times the rate of children in foster care than the national average, at 16.8 per 1,000 — more than any other state besides West Virginia.
While the rate of children in foster care has been on the rise across the U.S. and often linked with substance abuse by guardians, drug and alcohol use among parents who lost their kids in Montana isn't much higher than the national average, according to data compiled by the National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare.
Just a few months ago, a number of former department employees claimed to the Daily Interlake that they were bullied by supervisors into removing kids on unfounded grounds.
As the number of children in the Montana foster system has increased, so have the millions of dollars in federal funding the state receives. But protests by whistleblowers, parents, and advocates have also grown, causing lawmakers and the judicial system to take notice.
What's being done to stop this? The massive spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in February included a law called the Family First Prevention Services Act. According to an analysis by The Pew Charitable Trusts , the legislation was ""propelled by the belief that children in difficult homes nearly always fare best with their parents,"" and ""effectively blows up the nation's troubled foster care system.""
Under the Family First Prevention Services Act, the $8 billion divvied out to states for kids in foster care would be restricted and redirected to focus on keeping families together rather than incentivizing foster placement.
Montana state lawmakers are trying to correct their system, too, but have repeatedly faced pushback from Gov. Steve Bullock (D), who recently vetoed legislation that would have authorized the Office of the Child and Family Ombudsman to investigate complaints of retaliatory action against parents.
The governor argued in his letter explaining the veto that the bill, HB 753, ""would permit civil lawsuits based on ex parte investigations against workers, disregarding their due process rights."" He concluded that the legislation ""creates a specter of legal liability that will make it even harder for the state to recruit and retain good workers, leaving children less safe and delaying the goal of everyone involved: family reunification.""
Debbie Westlake doesn't believe family reunification was the goal of the state in her case, and court documents support her claim. Maybe Miss Montana could use her influence and platform to see if her state could take another look at the processes for taking kids from their homes."
SCOTUS upholds portion of Indiana abortion law that requires aborted babies' remains to be buried or cremated,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotus-upholds-portion-of-indiana-abortion-law-that-requires-aborted-babies-remains-to-be-buried-or-cremated,"The U.S. Supreme Court upheld on Tuesday an Indiana law that requires abortion providers to bury or cremate fetal remains but it rejected an appeal to reinstate a law that would prohibit discriminatory abortions.
In 2016, then-Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a bill that prohibited abortion providers from treating aborted babies as ""infectious and pathological waste,"" according to the law . The other part of the law banned abortions sought because of a baby's race, sex, or a disorder, such as Down syndrome.
State Attorney General Curtis Hill Jr. said the law was passed in response to an ""alarming trend of disability-selective abortions."" The law was intended to protect children ""with Down syndrome and other disfavored characteristics from invidious discrimination,"" NBC News reported.
Both provisions were later blocked by the lower courts.
What does this mean? The 7th Circuit Court blocked the requirement for abortion providers to treat an aborted baby in the same way that any other deceased human would be treated in the state.
""We now reverse that determination,"" the Supreme Court wrote in their opinion. ""This Court has already acknowledged that a State has a 'legitimate interest in proper disposal of fetal remains.'""
In a separate opinion , Justice Clarence Thomas expressed his support for the provision.
""Indiana law prohibits abortion providers from treating the bodies of aborted children as 'infectious waste' and incinerating them alongside used needles, laboratory animal carcasses, and surgical byproducts,"" Thomas wrote. ""I would have thought it could go without saying that nothing in the Constitution or any decision of this court prevents a State from requiring abortion facilities to provide for the respectful treatment of human remains.""
The lower court also blocked a provision that prevented a doctor from performing an abortion sought after the sex of the baby or a congenital defect or disorder is diagnosed.
The Supreme Court upheld that decision which means the law cannot take effect.
What else did Justice Thomas write? Thomas likened discriminatory abortions to Eugenics adding that the court would need to confront the Constitutionality of the law.
In her view, birth control had been ""accepted by the most clear thinking and far seeing of the Eugenists themselves as the most constructive and necessary of the means to racial health. It is true that Sanger was not referring to abortion when she made these statements, at least not directly. She recognized a moral difference between ""contraceptives""and other, more ""extreme"" ways for ""women to limit their families,"" such as ""the horrors of abortion and infanticide.""
Whereas Sanger believed that birth control could prevent ""unfit"" people from reproducing, abortion can prevent them from being born in the first place. Many eugenicists therefore supported legalizing abortion, and abortion advocates — including future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher — endorsed the use of abortion for eugenic reasons. Technological advances have only heightened the eugenic potential for abortion, as abortion can now be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics, such as a particular sex or disability.
Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana's. But because further percolation may assist our review of this issue of first impression, I join the Court in declining to take up the issue now. Were there any dissents? Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the court applied the wrong standard in upholding one provision of the law.
""The case implicates the right of a woman to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the state,"" Ginsberg said.
She was the only justice to note a dissent.
What else? Now Vice President Pence wrote on Twitter that he was proud of the law that he signed as governor of Indiana.
""As Governor of IN I was proud to sign a law that requires remains of aborted babies be treated w/dignity & respect and blocks groups like Planned Parenthood from the horrific practice of selling fetal tissue. Today's decision by the Supreme Court was a victory for life!"" he tweeted.
In another tweet, Pence commended Thomas for his opinion.
""Today, Justice Quote: : SCOTUS has been zealous in the past in barring discrimination based on sex, race, & disability. Hopeful someday soon SCOTUS will recognize the same protections for the unborn when they rule on future appeals of pro-life legislation."""

Moore managed to lose the 2017 special election, ceding the seat formerly held by Jeff Sessions to a Democrat for the first time in 20 years. His campaign was mired by a scandal regarding his alleged relationships with teenage girls while he was in his early 30s.
What did he say? Alabama Rep. Bradley Byrne told The Hill's Scott Wong that Moore's camp told Byrne to expect a June campaign launch. Byrne also expressed doubt about whether Moore could win.
""I think people are very concerned that we Republicans lost a U.S. Senate seat because he was our nominee in 2017, and we don't need to do that again,"" Byrne said.
Moore jumped on Byrne's comments on Twitter.
""What is Bradley so worried about?"" Moore asked. ""He knows that if I run I will beat Doug Jones.""
The president's son sees things differently.
""You mean like last time?"" Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter. ""You're literally the only candidate who could lose a GOP seat in pro-Trump, pro-USA ALABAMA. Running for office should never become a business model. If you actually care about #MAGA more than your own ego, it's time to ride off into the sunset, Judge.""
The 2017 special election Before Jones defeated Moore, a Democrat had not won a Senate election in Alabama since the 1990s. Moore's campaign was greatly weakened when numerous women said he initiated relationships with them when he was in his 30s and they were between 14 and 18 years old.
One woman, Leigh Corfman, said she and Moore had sexual contact, but not intercourse. Moore denied all the allegations, calling them attacks fro the Democratic Party and The Washington Post."
New book has a bombshell claim about obstruction charges — and Mueller demolished it with just 7 words,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-wolff-book-refuted-already,"A new book claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller drew up a draft indictment of President Donald Trump for obstruction, but a spokesman for Mueller obliterated the accusation in a curt statement.
Author Michael Wolff says that Mueller drew up a draft indictment of the president that included three charges of obstruction, and that the document was heavily debated by members of Mueller's office.
He claimed that he obtained the document from ""sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel.""
But as soon as that apparent bombshell dropped, it was dismantled by a rare statement from a spokesperson for Mueller.
""The documents that you have described do not exist,"" said Peter Carr to the Daily Caller.
Wolff has had remarkable access to the White House, but he has been criticized heavily for audacious claims in his previous Trump book, ""Fire and Fury.""
Democrats were disappointed when a redacted version of the Mueller report was released and Republicans used it to justify claims that Trump had not obstructed justice as many of his detractors claimed.
Trump's opponents in the Congress are now seeking to have Mueller testify about the claims in the report, hoping to prove that U.S. Attorney General William Barr lied in his summary of the document to Congress.
Wolff's book ""Siege: Trump Under Fire,"" will be released in June.

The interaction happened with a 10-year-old girl at a campaign stop in Houston.
Reporter Felicia Sonmez of the Washington Post immediately flagged the interaction as contrary to his promises.
""In a somewhat odd moment at tonight's AFT town hall,"" Sonmez tweeted, ""Biden tells a 10-year-old girl, 'I'll bet you're as bright as you are good-looking.'""
""He takes her over to the assembled reporters,"" Sonmez said, ""then stands behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders while he's talking.""
""Recall that Biden filmed a video last month in which he vowed to respect women's personal space,"" she added in a second tweet. ""Seems he hasn't quite gotten the message.""
In videos of the campaign stop, Biden tells the girl, ""I bet you're as bright as you are good looking.""
After she answers that she's interested in journalism, so Biden grabs her and whisks her away to the back of the room where the reporters are covering the event.
He continues grasping her by the shoulders, and at one point leans in very close to her head.
The girl smiled throughout the interaction, and didn't vocalize any discomfort.
Sonmez also reported that the Biden campaign refused to comment on the interaction.
Biden has been accused by a former Democratic lawmaker of inappropriately touching and smelling her before a campaign event. After she made her accusations, numerous women released statements offering other inappropriate behavior from the former vice president.

Mitch McConnell infuriates Democrats by saying he would fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2020,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mitch-mcconnell-infuriates-democrats-by-saying-he-would-fill-a-supreme-court-vacancy-in-2020,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would fill a Supreme Court vacancy if one opened in 2020, angering Democrats who point to his refusal to allow former President Barack Obama to appoint a justice in 2016, according to Fox News .
""Uh, we'd fill it,"" McConnell answered in response to the question of what he would do if a justice died and a spot opened on the court during the election cycle.
McConnell said he believes making an impact on the nation's courts is so important because it leaves a longer-standing impact on the nation than laws that can be changed as soon as a different party gets in power.
""Yeah, the reason I started with the judges -- as important as all the other things are that we're talking about -- if you want to have a long-lasting positive impact on the country, everything else changes,"" McConnell began. ""I remember during the tax bill, there were people agonizing over whether one part of the tax bill was permanent or not. And I said: 'Look, the only way the tax bill is permanent, depends upon the next election. The next election. Because people have different views about the taxes in the two parties and approach it differently when they get in power.""
McConnell added: ""What can't be undone is a lifetime appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of the judge is to follow the law. That's the most important thing for the country, which cannot be undone.""
While McConnell's comments drew laughter from the assembled crowd, they quite upset Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who criticized McConnell on Twitter.
""Senator McConnell is a hypocrite,"" Schumer wrote. ""Seriously it's no surprise. @SenateMajLdr McConnell lives for GOP judges because he knows the GOP agenda is so radical & unpopular they can only achieve it in courts. Anyone who believes he'd ever allow confirmation of a Dem President's nominee for SCOTUS is fooling themselves."
Ted Cruz responds to Rep. Ilhan Omar's claim that Latinos couldn't hack it in a merit-based immigration system,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-reacts-to-ilhan-omar-on-immigration,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) weighed in on Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-Minn.) recent claim that implementing a merit-based immigration system would put Latinos at a disadvantage in seeking U.S. citizenship.
What are the details? The freshman congresswoman tweeted Tuesday: ""A 'merit-based' immigration policy is fueled by racism toward the Latinx community. Our immigration policies shouldn't be based on discrimination, fear, or bigotry. We should welcome immigrants to our country and offer a simple pathway to citizenship.""
Omar was presumably voicing her opposition to a recent proposal introduced by President Donald Trump, which Politico reported would implement a point-based merit standard for legal U.S. citizenship. Yet the freshman congresswoman apparently realized her claim of racism had backfired, and deleted the message from her feed — but not before the Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra captured it for all to see.
Conservative pundit Michelle Malkin also shared Omar's comments, pointing out the irony in the freshman congresswoman's claim.
Sen. Cruz reacted to Omar's comments by saying, ""As the son of a Cuban immigrant whose Dad came to get a math degree & become a computer programmer, I'm troubled that Dems seem to believe Hispanic immigrants can't qualify for skills-based legal immigration. Bringing in more scientists, engineers & doctors is good for U.S. jobs.""
Anything else? While Omar removed her own words asserting that Latinos could not hack it under a skills-based immigration system, she kept an analysis from the Washington Post on her Twitter feed (as of this writing) along with the quote, ""Our research suggests that prejudice against Latinos is an important, if veiled, reason that some Americans advocate admitting primarily highly educated, highly skilled immigrants."""
"College student pleads guilty to tricking Secret Service, sneaking into Mar-a-Lago while President Trump was there",www.theblaze.com,Jana J.

Mark Lindblom, a business major at the University of Wisconsin, apologized to a federal magistrate on Tuesday for his actions that he said weren't intended to harm anyone, the Palm Beach Post reported.
""I wanted to see how far I could get,"" Lindblom told Magistrate Judge William Matthewman, according to the newspaper.
The incident occurred while Lindblom was visiting his grandparents who are members of the nearby Palm Beach Bath & Tennis Club, which shares a beach with Mar-a-Lago.
What are the details? On Nov. 23, Lindblom reportedly walked down the beach and into a security line where Mar-a-logo club members pass through a metal detector before re-entering the club's property.
""Mr. Lindblom was wanded by Secret Service agents and he walked on through,"" lawyer Marcos Beaton told the court, according to the newspaper.
The college student was on the club's property for about 20 minutes before he was arrested near the pool.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John McMillan told Matthewman that Lindblom took some photos on his cellphone while he wandered around the club.
""We have no reason to believe he had a political, criminal or terroristic purpose,"" McMillan said. ""It was a foolish decision he did on a lark.""
Lindblom reportedly cooperated with agents during his arrest.
Security has since been tightened to prevent future trespassers from sneaking into the club, McMillan said.
What else did Lindblom say about the incident? Lindblom said he was unaware of the dangers that Secret Service agents face until he watched an online video of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981.
These men and women are dedicated to serve us and protect the president,"" he told the court, according to the Palm Beach Post. ""I'm so sorry for wasting their time.""
Matthewman reminded Lindblom that he could have been shot had the Secret Service agents believed he posed a threat.
""The result of one person slipping by with an evil motive can be just disastrous,"" he said.
What was Lindblom's sentence? Lindblom received one year of probation for entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds. He faced up to six months in jail.
""I'm sure you'll become a productive member of society despite this youthful indiscretion,"" Matthewman told Lindblom."

What are the details? Jessica and Franklin Richardson were planning on enjoying a picnic at Oktibbeha County Lake near Starkville, Mississippi, when a white female campground manager pulled up to the site and demanded they leave the premises.
The manager also reportedly pointed a gun at the couple while insisting they go.
According to Jessica, the female campground manager insisted that the couple was not permitted to be there because they didn't have reservations.
Franklin, an Army National Guard sergeant, complied with the unnamed woman's wishes and left the campground with his wife. On their way out, the couple and reportedly visited the main office and discussed the matter with a man, who the couple reported was the woman's husband. The man purportedly told the couple that reservations weren't needed for the lake.
Jessica shared a video of the incident on Facebook, and captioned it:
RACISM IS ALIVE AND WELL!!
Today was a beautiful day so my husband (who's a vet), our 2 year old dog, and myself, decided to Google a lake to visit and have a picnic. We found a lake located in starkville, ms and decided to visit. Not five mins later a truck pulls up and a white lady screams at us, she then jumps out of her truck with a Gun. And proceeded to point it at the 3 of us, simply because we didnt make reservations. After leaving my husband stopped by the office and talked with her husband (they're the property managers). The husband tells my husband that reservations aren't needed for the lake. This happened In Starkville, Ms At the time of this writing, her Facebook video has been viewed more than 500,000 times.
In the video, Jessica can be heard saying, ""This lady just literally pulled a gun because we're out here and didn't have reservations for a lake we didn't even know we needed reservations for.""
The female campground manager can be seen approaching the couple and their dog, with a gun in hand, who appears to tell them that they should have checked in with the office.
""We didn't know,"" Jessica can be heard saying to the woman. ""All you had to do was tell us. ... The only thing you had to do was tell us to leave, and we would have left. You did not have to pull a gun.""
The couple can be seen walking away from the woman as she puts her gun in her pocket."
Mayor orders private company to cease and desist construction of border wall in his city over reported lack of permits,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/city-orders-wall-construction-to-stop,"The mayor of a city in New Mexico has ordered a company that raised $22 million for a border wall to immediately stop construction . Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea said that the company, We Build The Wall, failed to obtain the proper permits.
Construction started just recently After Congress refused to give President Donald Trump the funding he requested for the construction of a border wall, We Build The Wall started a GoFundMe campaign to privately fund the project and raised more than $20 million.
After the company failed for months to give updates about the project's progress, it faced accusations that it had scammed donors.
In a Facebook post, company founder Brian Kolfage claimed that he had deliberately not updated donors because ""powerful people want to stop our progress"" and he didn't want to ""tip anyone off.""
On Monday , Kolfage announced in another post that a section of the border wall that his company had been working on in New Mexico was ""nearly complete."" He told the Texas Tribune that this wall cost between $6 and $8 million.
But by the next day, We Build The Wall had been served with a cease and desist order from the city of Sunland Park, New Mexico.
What happened now? ""The city has not provided any permits, it has not approved of the construction that has gone up already,"" Peter Ibardo, a spokesman for the city of Sunland Park, told the Texas Tribune . ""They built the structure without authority or any building permits from the city.""
In a news conference, Perea said an incomplete application had been submitted by the company on Friday, after construction was already underway.
""At this point, it will be turned over to the courts for follow-up on the matter,"" Perea said.
Perea also said that the wall was taller than the 6-foot height limit for walls constructed within city limits.
We Build The Wall has insisted that it followed proper procedure. In a statement sent to KVIA-TV , We Build The Wall said that it had ""done everything"" necessary ""to be in compliance with all regulations"" and that the order to stop construction was ""a last ditch effort to intimidate us from completing this historic project by a local government with a long history of corruption problems.""
Kolfage responded to the cease and desist order by suggesting in multiple Facebook posts that city officials had been ""paid off"" to ""lie and shut down the wall project"" by a Mexican cartel.
""Follow the money,"" he wrote. ""Border patrol agents told me the first person to throw a fit was paid off by the cartel. Sunland Park New Mexico is loaded with corrupt officials."" He offered no proof to back up this claim.
In addition to Kolfage, the company's leadership team includes former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon."
"Blind, autistic performer helped to 'America's Got Talent' stage by his mom. Then he starts singing — and it's simply mind-blowing.",www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/blind-autistic-performer-americas-got-talent,"Blind, autistic performer Kodi Lee was led by his mother to the "" America's Got Talent "" stage for the show's season premiere Tuesday, and the 22-year-old's special needs were immediately apparent.
Lee spoke clearly but haltingly as he held a cane in one hand and grasped the arm of his mother, Tina Lee, with his other hand.
""We found out that he loved music really early on,"" his mother told the judges and audience. ""He listened, and his eyes just went huge, and he started singing, and that's when ... I was in tears. Because that's when I realized, 'Oh my gosh — he's an entertainer.'""
Image source: YouTube screenshot
Tina Lee added that ""through music and performing he was able to withstand living in this world, because when you're autistic, it's really hard to do what everybody else does. It actually has saved his life, playing music.""
Bringing down the house
So Mom led her son to a piano, where he sat down and tested the microphone.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
Then he began to sing Leon Russell's ""A Song for You"" — and it was amazing.
Lee sported a beautiful, soulful voice that few if any in the crowd — much less the judges, led by famously critical Simon Cowell — could have been expecting.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
When he was finished, Cowell and fellow judges Howie Mandel, Julianne Hough, and Gabrielle Union — as well as the audience — gave Lee a standing ovation.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
""What just happened there was extraordinary,"" Cowell said. ""Your voice is absolutely fantastic. You have a really beautiful tone. Thank you so much for trusting us on this show. I'm going to remember this moment for the rest of my life.""
Union spoke last, noting she's a new judge as well as a new mother, and chose to pound the show's golden buzzer for Lee — something each judge can do only once — which catapults him to the program's live shows.

Then came the confetti, as mother and son celebrated:

Anything else? Lee's bio indicates he's a ""musical prodigious savant"" and ""one of only approximately 25 in the world today."" His bio adds that he possesses perfect pitch and an ""audio photographic memory, in which he can recall music he hears after just one listen.""
He was born with optic nerve hypoplasia and had life-saving surgery when he was 5 days old, his bio also said, and was diagnosed with autism at an early age. But despite such challenges, the Lake Elsinore, California, resident presses on:
He has been performing his singing and piano expertise all across the globe for many years. He currently performs locally at a variety of venues including local restaurants, wineries, and music events all around town. Recently he was invited to perform at the prestigious Carnegie Hall in New York City. His musical repertoire ranges from rock to jazz, to R & B, and pop. Plus his mastery of the classics such as Bach, Chopin, Mozart and the list goes on. He literally has a library of songs in his mind that would rival any jukebox. But he doesn't stop there. He recently has picked up tap dancing and he continues to amaze with his musical expression through dance and vocalization. Here's the clip:

Navy investigating President Trump patch worn by service members — and Twitter is melting down over it,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/navy-trump-patch-investigation,"The Navy is investigating if service members violated Defense Department policy by wearing a patch on their uniforms with the words ""Make Aircrew Great Again"" and an image of President Donald Trump, The Associated Press reported .
The phrase is an altered form of Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" The service members in question were aboard the USS Wasp, which Trump visited Tuesday during his Japan trip, the AP said.

The military has dress codes and regulations against partisan political acts while in uniform, the outlet said, adding that the Navy said in a statement Tuesday that the issue was under review to ensure that the uniform patch doesn't violate policy or regulations.
How are people reacting? Wall Street Journal White House reporter Vivian Salama posted photos on Twitter of the service members wearing the patch, and more than a few commenters were none too pleased:
""They support a 5-time draft dodger with bone spurs? As a vet, I don't get it."" ""That's disgusting."" ""8 year Navy vet, this makes me want to puke. Nobody is allowed to wear political statements on their uniform nor make them while in uniform. Write these clowns up. Their allegiance is to the Constitution and the American people which they seem to have forgotten."" ""Pretty hard to respect the military when they are used as propaganda."" ""My grandfather went down with the original USS Wasp, this is a damn disgrace! Please tell me they were reported for this!"" ""Call me just a scared Libertarian, but this sure looks like what a process to a dictatorship looks like."" ""That is so Third Reich."" But not everybody was irked.

University refuses to offer ‘Conservative Political Thought’ course because the material apparently wasn’t inclusive enough,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/university-refuses-course-on-conservative-thought,"Portland State University has rejected a course on ""Conservative Political Thought"" because it's apparently not inclusive enough.
Professor Bruce Gilley offered to teach the course, which would have been part of a graduate curriculum at the Portland, Oregon, school.
What are the details? Gilley — who previously taught the course on conservative political thought on a rotating basis — proposed the concept of the course for the Fall 2019 semester on a more permanent basis.
However, administrators at Portland State University rejected the course, according to the Washington Examiner , because the material was reportedly not inclusive enough to foster a welcoming environment for all students at the university, and, more specifically, within the political science department.
Gilley insisted that the materials in the course would ""represent a broad diversity of voices"" and be ""culturally responsive.""
Such promises apparently weren't enough, because administrators felt that Gilley's application ""did not support the University commitment to access and inclusion"" and denied it on those grounds.
According to the outlet, Gilley taught the class two other times ""but under a different course number, which is associated with 'Selected Topics.'"" Gilley's fall proposal, if approved, would have made the course more regular.
In his application for the class, Gilley wrote, ""It is a crucial missing part of the political theory offerings of the department. The enrollment has justified a permanent course number.""
Gilley argued for the permanence of the course because current course offerings within the political science department ""as well as related normative courses in other departments tend to downplay, indeed generally ignore, conservative normative arguments, except as objects of ridicule.""
Gilley also added that such a course would help to ""enhance diversity of opinion, ideas, and political viewpoint offerings"" at the school and within the political science department.

AOC questions 'free speech' in reaction to video likening her to Kim Jong Un and Fidel Castro,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-free-speech-after-controversial-video,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has come out swinging after a minor-league baseball team aired a Memorial Day tribute video grouping her with the likes of communist dictators and other ""enemies of freedom.""
The freshman congresswoman reacted by saying such ""hateful messages"" provoke a ""flood of death threats"" against her and questioning ""those who believe in 'free speech.'""
What are the details? During a doubleheader Monday, the Fresno Grizzlies played a patriotic video that was set to the words of the late President Ronald Reagan's 1981 inaugural address. Ocasio-Cortez's image was displayed during a part where the president referred to ""enemies of freedom,"" along with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and deceased Cuban Communist leader Fidel Castro.
The baseball team promptly issued apologies to their fans, community, service members, and the New York Democrat herself.
Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter the next day, saying, ""What people don't (maybe do) realize is when orgs air these hateful messages, my life changes bc of the flood of death threats they inspire. I've had mornings where I wake up & the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it's always men) who want to kill me.""
The congresswoman did not address the baseball team, but said ""it happens whenever Fox [News] gets particularly aggressive + hateful.""
The lawmaker went on to posit the question: ""For those who believe in 'free speech': Whose free speech do you believe in?"" before asserting that ""some folks using free speech to defend racism are also supporting folks passing laws to allow running over protestors."""
"Mark Cuban wants to update the Second Amendment. 'I would do guns completely differently,' he says",www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mark-cuban-says-its-time-to-update-the-second-amendment-he-would-change-three-things,"Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said recently that he believes it's time to update the Second Amendment.
""I would do guns completely differently,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said during an interview with Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer that aired Thursday.
Cuban admitted that changing a constitutional amendment would be difficult, but he offered up his three ideas.
What changes would Cuban make? The ABC ""Shark Tank"" co-host said that he ""would change the Second Amendment in ways that people probably wouldn't expect.""
What I would do is this:
1. Every American citizen has the right to own a gun. Period End of story – written in the amendment.
2. The federal government will never be allowed to confiscate that gun from an individual. Period. End of story.
3. States have the right to manage the purchase and ownership and management of guns owned and within their borders. So that if you live in a state like Texas, if the law in Texas is open carry – so be it. If you live in Pennsylvania, where they're more stringent and they don't want you to be able to have a gun, other than in your own premise or you know under lock and key, or you have to do a background check, then that's up to them to decide. The more than 200-year-old ""Second Amendment has been analyzed up and down and backwards and forwards and it's created its own set of problems,"" Cuban added. ""Let's update it.""
Did he discuss politics? At this point, Cuban said he believes President Donald Trump will be re-elected in 2020.
He said he's not a fan of Trump's tariffs but that he understands the president's strategy.
""In terms of battling China, I would approach it differently because I think tariffs are a tax on the American people,"" Cuban said. ""But at the same time, I think we have a variety of other leverage points.""
Chinese companies have a market cap of more than $1.4 trillion on the American stock exchanges, he explained.
""They're raising money via IPO,"" Cuban said. ""It's something we can't do in China.""
And he had some advice for the president.
""I'd shut down all Chinese IPOs as a first step,"" Cuban continued. ""And given his propensity for using Twitter and just as a kind of throwing warning shots, you know, I would ... throw out there that we might put a halt on the trading of Chinese listed stock in the United States.""
That would create ""a lot of disruption for Chinese companies,"" he added.
As far Cuban making a bid for president, Cuban reiterated from a previous interview that it would take a certain set of circumstances to entice him to run.

Gucci jumps into abortion debate with line that features 'flowering uterus',www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/gucci-jumps-into-abortion-debate,"Gucci jumped into the abortion debate with its latest Cruise collection, and it's clear that Alessandro Michele, the high-end designer's creative director, supports abortion.
The line featured items including white dress embroidered with a flowering uterus, a purple sweater with the words, ""My Body, My Choice,"" written across the back, and a sweater with embellished with the date ""May 22, 1978,"" which marks the day abortion was legalized in Italy.
Michele said new abortion restrictions in some parts of the U.S. ""made me consider how much women should be highly respected,"" The Associated Press reported.
""Sometimes in life choices are difficult, but I believe that it is the most difficult decision for a woman. I respect that decision. I respect that decision as I respect the idea that the uterus is a garden,"" he told reporters after the show.
The luxury fashion label presented its 2020 Cruise Collection on Tuesday evening to a VIP crowd, including Elton John and Naomi Campbel at Rome's Capitoline Museum.
""I wanted to portray the idea that to interrupt a pregnancy does not wipe out the garden, the flower, that is the uterus of every woman,"" he said.
Also, included in the collection were T-shirts that read, ""Chime,"" short for Gucci's Chime for Change charity. The charity describes itself as a global campaign ""to convene, unite and strengthen the voices speaking out for gender equality.""
What else? In February, the designer label came under fire for its black balaclava sweater after receiving complaints that it looked like blackface makeup.
The company pulled the $890 ski-mask style top that featured large red lips that outlined the wearer's mouth.
It also issued an apology for the offense it may have caused."

""Satisfies my thirst for the truth. Exposes and catalogues what we already know about the mainstream media but goes much deeper.

"$90 million lawsuit: 'Toxic' whiteness purge at NYC education department sees 'totalitarian threat,' longtime execs demoted",www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/lawsuit-toxic-whiteness-purge-at-nyc-education-department,"A $90 million lawsuit claims the chancellor of the New York City Department of Education embarked on a mission to purge ""toxic"" whiteness from the city schools, which saw Richard Carranza issue a ""totalitarian threat"" against employees after he took over last year and the demotion of longtime executives in favor of less-qualified persons of color, the New York Post reported .
""On June 27, 2018, Carranza addressed the restructuring of his administration ... announcing to all DOE employees ... that 'if you draw a paycheck from DOE,' you will either 'Get on board with [my] equity platform or leave,' a totalitarian threat to his employees' salaries and financial future that Carranza used to silence Caucasian DOE employees impacted by his discriminatory actions for no reason other than their race,"" read the suit filed Tuesday in New York State Supreme Court.
The suit's plaintiffs are a trio of white executives — Lois Hererra, Jaye Murray, and Laura Feijoo — who were demoted after Carranza took over.
""Under Carranza's leadership, DOE has swiftly and irrevocably silenced, sidelined and punished plaintiffs and other Caucasian female DOE employees on the basis of their race, gender and unwillingness to accept their other colleagues' hateful stereotypes about them,"" the group's lawyer, Davida S. Perry, wrote in the filing, the Post said.
Lois Hererra
Herrera, who started at the DOE in 1986 as a guidance counselor and worked her way up to lead its Office of Safety and Youth Development, claims in the suit that she witnessed huge changes almost immediately after Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed Carranza in April 2018, the paper said.
One such instance involved executive LaShawn Robinson, who is black, the Post reported. Here's what the suit said:
Herrera learned from another senior administrator that Robinson expressed a discriminatory bias against her Caucasian colleagues on a number of occasions leading up to her promotion as Deputy Chancellor, including on or about May 4, 2018, while presenting at the ""Border Crossers"" training in her former role as Executive Director of the Office of Equity and Access, telling Caucasian colleagues that they ""had to take a step back and yield to colleagues of Color"" and ""recognize that values of White culture are supremacist,"" as well as saying ""We have all taken on Whiteness,"" while referring to being exposed to a society that has become toxic with Whiteness. Then — despite being Harvard-educated and having been recognized as recently as 2017 for contributing to the ""safest year on record"" in city schools — Herrera lost her title and was demoted three levels ""to essentially the bottom of the … group she formerly led,"" the suit says, according to the Post.
Herrera's replacement was Mark Rampersant, a black man who's ""demonstrably less qualified,"" the suit claims, the paper said, adding that Herrera said she was ""required"" to attend Rampersant's promotion ceremony and that her requests for a new workstation resulted in her belongings being stuffed into boxes and stashed under a headquarters stairwell before she was transferred to the Bronx.
Jaye Murray
Murray, another plaintiff who was executive director of the Office of Counseling Support Programs, was told she would now report to Rampersant, which also was a demotion, the Post said.
While Murray boasted a record of developing anti-bias workshops, the paper said she was soon demoted another two rungs and working for Gillian Smith, the new head of the Office of Counseling Support Programs, who ""began a campaign to degrade"" Murray by forcing her to report her work every 30 minutes and going over her head and behind her back to direct Murray's last two subordinates.
Laura Feijoo Feijoo, the final plaintiff, said when Carranza was appointing his first deputy chancellor, he chose Cheryl Watson-Harris, who is black, rather than Feijoo, who is white and was Watson-Harris' boss, the Post reported, adding that Feijoo wasn't even interviewed.
More from the paper:
While Feijoo supervised all 46 other DOE superintendents, Watson-Harris didn't even have the necessary license to be first deputy chancellor — so Carranza instituted a ""transition period"" so she could obtain it, the filing says.
Feijoo was not only leapfrogged by Watson-Harris but soon saw her underling replace her with Donald Conyers, who is black, and promote nine employees into a new role, ""executive superintendent.""
Some of the nine had no prior superintendent experience. None was a white woman. All were now above Feijoo. What did Carranza and the DOE have to say? Carranza declined to comment on the suit, the Post said, adding that the Department of Education said, ""We hire the right people to get the job done for kids and families, and these claims of 'reverse racism' have no basis in fact.""
Here's a clip that aired prior to the lawsuit being filed:

Uber announces ban on passengers who receive low ratings from drivers,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/uber-announces-ban-on-passengers-with-low-ratings-from-drivers,"Ride-hailing giant Uber rolled out new global Community Guidelines on Wednesday, and issued a warning that customers who ""develop a significantly below average rating"" from drivers will be booted from using the app.
What are the details? The company's head of safety brand and initiatives, Kate Parker, made the announcement in a blog post titled, ""Safety and respect for all.""
Parker explained the firm's original community guidelines from 2016 have been updated to ""make them simpler and clearer,"" and riders will need to confirm they understand the new rules ""or they may lose access to Uber.""
The major change outlined by Parker is that passengers may now be banned from utilizing the service ""if they develop a significantly below average rating,"" a move which the company sees as only fair since drivers are already beholden to maintaining a satisfactory feedback average from their customers.
""Respect is a two-way street, and so is accountability,"" Parker wrote. ""Drivers have long been expected to meet a minimum rating threshold which can vary city to city. While we expect only a small number of riders to ultimately be impacted by ratings-based deactivations, it's the right thing to do.""
TechCrunch reported that Uber is not disclosing the average rider rating, but customers at risk of being deactivated ""will receive several notifications and opportunities to improve"" ahead of being blacklisted, according to a company spokesperson.
Anything else? Parker also reassured testy customers that they would have ample opportunities to clean up their act before having their ride-hailing privileges revoked. Under the new terms, she said, ""riders will receive tips on how to improve their ratings, such as encouraging polite behavior, avoiding leaving trash in the vehicle and avoiding requests for drivers to exceed the speed limit."""
Man lights himself on fire near White House,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-lights-himself-on-fire-near-white-house,"A man has lit himself on fire across the street from the White House, according to the Secret Service.
What happened? In a tweet, the Secret Service said that the incident occurred at 12:20 p.m. ET. The National Park Service and U.S. Park Police administered first aid, and the man was reportedly taken to a nearby hospital.
The Ellipse, a 52-acre park, sits across the street from the White House. It is easily accessible to the public, and not protected by the White House's steel fence. This is the same area where the National Christmas Tree is lit every year.
Even outside of the White House grounds, Secret Service spokesman Jeffrey Adams told Politico that agents ""responded in seconds.""
According to WTOP , the man was doused by fire extinguishers. A helicopter arrived at the scene within minutes, in addition to several fire trucks.
""I can confirm that we've transported one patient with burns from the Ellipse and we're now on the scene assisting law enforcement,"" a spokesman for Washington's Fire Department told CNBC .
It is not yet clear if the man had been attempting to make some sort of a political statement. Officers are still trying to determine a motive. His name has not yet been released.
President Donald Trump returned to Washington, D.C., Tuesday after a diplomatic trip to Japan but is unlikely to have been in any danger from this incident."
'He's sending two signals': Glenn Beck breaks down Robert Mueller's Russia investigation statement,www.theblaze.com,TheBlaze Staff,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/glenn-radio/hes-sending-two-signals-glenn-beck-breaks-down-muellers-russia-investigation-statement,"In his first public statement on his investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, special counsel Robert Mueller, said that while his report did not accuse President Donald Trump of any crimes, it also did not exonerate him.
""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,"" Mueller said during his statement Wednesday.
""Under long-standing department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional,"" he continued. ""The special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.""
Mueller also announced his resignation and emphasized that he did not intend to testify before Congress about the investigation, adding, ""The report is my testimony.""
On Wednesday's radio program, Glenn Beck, Stu Burguiere, and Pat Gray discussed several of the key takeaways from Mueller's news conference.
""[Mueller] said if we would have known for sure that the president did not commit a crime, we would have said so. Now, he didn't say that [President Trump] did commit a crime,"" Glenn said. ""He said we couldn't charge him with a crime if we found a crime. Now, he didn't say they found a crime, but he also said that they didn't find him innocent of any crime.""
""What he's saying here is there's another judge and jury,"" he added. ""And that judge and jury is the American people through the impeachment process, because we can't go through the Justice Department. ""
Stu noted that the mainstream media and the left will interpret this as Mueller giving Congress a ""road map"" to impeach President Trump.
Glenn agreed, but emphasized Mueller's message that he would not provide Congress new information and that ""any testimony"" from the Department of Justice would not ""go beyond"" what has already been released to the public.
""[Mueller] just said there is no other information for [the Department of Justice] to give, we've given you all the information. Well, we've all read that information, with the exception of just a few tidbits [redacted] that don't seem like bombshells hidden behind those black bars,"" Glenn said. ""So, he's sending two signals. One, that there's a way, if you think the president committed a crime, you have to do it through impeachment. But, two, if you interview anyone of the team, we're all going to say the same thing. Everything we have is in the report.""

CNN's Chris Cuomo faces backlash after mocking a video about a pro-gun rape survivor,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnns-cuomo-faces-backlash-after-mocking-a-video-about-a-pro-gun-rape-survivor,"Wednesday afternoon, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo took issue with a recent online video posted by the National Rifle Association in which spokeswoman Kimberly Corban talks about defending her children by exercising her Second Amendment rights.
""I'm a mother of two, and if a predator or anyone else tries to harm me or my family, they have to come through my firearm first,"" Corban says in the video.
""Only in America,"" Cuomo responded in a Quote: Tweet.
The cable news personality might not have watched the minute-long video in its entirety, but it covers how Corban, a rape survivor, became a Second Amendment advocate following the horrific ordeal she endured while a college student. For those who aren't familiar with her story, here's a more detailed account .
""I will never be unarmed or utterly vulnerable ever again,"" Corban concludes.
In response to Cuomo's mocking tweet, Corban called the news anchor out by simply challenging him to talk about it.
But the pro-second amendment rape survivor was far from alone.
Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean challenged the rival network anchor to further explain what he meant to women who had actually had to defend themselves from predators.
He even got some pushback from House GOP Conference Chair Liz Chaney (R-Wyo.) who said that ""in America we believe women should be able to defend themselves.""
Another high-profile, Second Amendment-supporting woman, Antonia Okafor, responded with her own video.
Others simply criticized Cuomo for either willingly not knowing who Corban was before publicly mocking her testimony, or willingly mocking a rape survivor who chooses to keep her children save via the Second Amendment.
Cuomo's anti-gun politics have made headlines in the past. Last year, he was criticized for insinuating the false notion that nobody was calling for a repeal of the Second Amendment at the time. Last November, he criticized people who prayed for shooting victims but didn't call for gun control. And he recently got into a heated on-air exchange with a Republican House member over gun control policies."
CNN's Jim Acosta on charges he's biased against Trump: 'Neutrality for sake of neutrality' is useless under this president,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/jim-acosta-no-neutrality-for-trump,"CNN's chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta — who's gained notoriety through his often excessive questioning of President Donald Trump and being infamously called ""fake news"" by the commander-in-chief — appears to have all but answered charges that he's biased against Trump in a new book.
Acosta's ""The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America"" deals with his perceived bias against the president by noting ""neutrality for the sake of neutrality doesn't really serve us in the age of Trump,"" according to The Guardian , reporting that it acquired an early copy of book, which releases June 11.
In the book, Acosta admits to sometimes ""grandstanding"" and ""showboating,"" the Guardian added, and also that he ""opts for the bait"" when questioning Trump ""which bothers some people.""

'It was, in his mind, an act'
In a surprising excerpt, Acosta wrote that, after an early dust-up, close Trump aide Hope Hicks called to say the president wanted him to know he was ""very professional today,"" the paper said.
""He said, 'Jim gets it,'"" Hicks was Quote: d as telling Acosta, The Guardian reported, even though Trump had just referred to Acosta as ""fake news"" and ""very fake news"" after being asked about Russian election interference at a February 2017 news conference.
""When he called us 'fake news',"" Acosta wrote, according to the paper, ""it was, in his mind, an act.""
More from the Guardian:
At the start of Trump's presidency, the White House was frustrated by anonymously sourced stories and what it saw as the antagonistic stance of mainstream outlets from CNN and NBC to the Washington Post and the New York Times. Because Republicans controlled Congress and Trump needed an enemy that could be presented as dangerous and effective, Acosta writes, the president decided to attack the media.
The notion that the media was the "" enemy of the people "" emerged swiftly and caused great consternation among a press corps spooked by virulent abuse at Trump rallies . Acosta cites three unnamed sources who say the controversial line of attack originated with Steve Bannon, then Trump's chief White House adviser.
Acosta's own White House hard pass was revoked in November 2018, after he questioned Trump about his claims of migrant ""caravans"" from central America; Acosta refused to give up the microphone when pressed by a White House staffer. The confrontation, in which Trump called Acosta "" a rude, terrible person ,"" had been brewing for months. Is Acosta a reporter or pundit?
This week, Fox News cited an unnamed CNN employee as saying, ""Jim Acosta is, a lot of times, asking the right questions, but it doesn't always need to be about him and his grandstanding. Acosta is supposed to be a correspondent reporting the facts, but you can't tell the difference between him and a paid pundit,"" the Guardian added.
Anything else? Earlier this year, Acosta said Trump's ""enemy of the people"" rhetoric directed toward certain media outlets and reporters creates a climate in which "" journalists can get murdered .""
He also compared Trump to a playground bully: ""Are we supposed to roll over? Are we supposed to take it? Some colleagues say to just take it, but I'm still thinking about the folks at home, thinking about my own kids, are we supposed to let the bully beat us up at the playground every day?""

WTF MSM!? Mueller’s sole purpose was to give the media its impeachment sound bite,www.theblaze.com,Rob Eno,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/wtf-msm-muellers-sole-purpose-was-to-give-the-media-its-impeachment-sound-bite,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here .
The one reason is plain to see …
Ever since the Mueller report was submitted to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, the left and its media allies have been in an uproar over its findings and how Barr treated the section on obstruction. They've been unable to shift the narrative about obstruction and impeachment to get the American people to buy in. Enter Robert Mueller to save the day with a sound bite.
The given reason by Mueller for his televised statement Wednesday was that he is wrapping up and resigning and will let his report speak for itself. Except that's not all he did. He also gave the media the video clip it craved that will drive the news cycle for days.
After rehashing that he did not make a determination of innocence regarding obstruction, Mueller uttered these 25 words , ""And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.""
In his new book ""Unfreedom of the Press,"" LevinTV host Mark Levin exposed the media practice of manufacturing stories by getting others to say things that will drive a narrative. Mueller has delivered for the media, big time, and they've run with the ball.
The headline on CNN as I write this newsletter is, ""2020 Democrats seek impeachment hearings after Mueller speaks."" With a smaller headline, ""Calls for impeachment are growing after the special counsel addressed the public with a rare statement.""
And the leaders of the left are following suit, like the new soul of the Democratic Party, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who said of Mueller's 25 words, ""Mueller is playing a game of Taboo with Congress. His word is 'impeach.' ""
Back to Levin: He has been predicting this charade for nearly two years . In June 2017, Levin said, ""Mr. Mueller may be investigating individuals and so forth, but his purpose for being unleashed against the president of the United States is to make the case for impeachment, not indictment.""
Because the media couldn't make that case without a new sound bite, Mueller strode to the stage Wednesday to give them one. The entire reason for the Mueller investigation was to undo the results of the 2016 election.
Today, Mueller handed off the impeachment ball to the media. The media is now running with it .
Chris Cuomo's middle finger to American women …
On Wednesday morning, NRATV released a video statement by Kim Corban , who said, ""I'm a mother of two, and if a predator or anyone else tries to harm me or my family, they have to come through my firearm first."" The video also recounts Corban's story of her rape. CNN host Chris Cuomo quote tweeted the story with, "" Only in America .""
""Only in America?"" What does that even mean? Is he upset that ""only in America"" are women allowed to defend themselves?
Corban responded with , ""Hi @ChrisCuomo. Looks like you forgot to tag me. Care to chat about this?""
So far there have been crickets from Cuomo. Why would he want to have a powerful woman with her own agency on to share how to protect yourself from rape?

Brass knuckles will soon be legal to carry in Texas,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/brass-knuckles-legal-in-texas,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed a bill into law over the weekend that lifts the ban on carrying brass knuckles and other self-defense items in public.
Democratic state Rep. Joe Moody, who co-authored House Bill 446 , described its passage as ""another step toward getting rid of antiquated laws regarding weapons,"" according to KHOU-TV . Last month, the Texas House of Representatives approved the bill in a vote of 147-0, with one representative abstaining and two others absent. The state Senate passed the bill 31-0, two weeks ago.
Other items including clubs and wild kat keychains, sometimes known as kitty keychains, will also be legal to carry when the law takes effect on Sept. 1.
Self-defense expert Trea Drake of Krav Maga in Houston described the items as ""force equalizers.""
""It's something you can use against a larger opponent potentially to make you stronger in the process,"" Drake told KHOU.
Does the law affect those with prior offenses? Anyone who has committed or commits an offense before the law changes would still be held accountable if convicted of the crime.
""The changes in law made by this Act apply only to an offense committed on or after the effective date of this Act,"" the bill's text reads. ""An offense committed before the effective date of this Act is governed by the law in effect when the offense was committed, and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.""
Those convicted face a maximum punishment of up to one year in jail and a fine up to $4,000.
What other items are Texans allowed to legally carry? In 2017, Texas lawmakers revoked a 145-year ban on carrying knives in public. It also passed legislation allowing for openly carrying rifles and handguns."
‘Saturday Night Live’ alum Chris Kattan says Lorne Michaels pressured him to have sex with director. 'SNL' says it never happened.,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-kattan-says-lorne-michaels-pressured-him-to-have-sex-with-movie-director,"""Saturday Night Live"" alum Chris Kattan alleges in a new book that Lorne Michaels — the long-running comedy sketch show's creator — pressured him to have sex with a female director in order to keep her on a film project.
A spokesperson for the show, however, disputed Kattan's claim and said it never happened.
What are the details? In his new memoir, ""Baby Don't Hurt Me: Stories and Scars from Saturday Night Live,"" Kattan describes a moment that purportedly took place with Michaels during the production of ""A Night at the Roxbury,"" Page Six reported .
Michaels purportedly suggested that Kattan — who was just 27 years old at the time — sleep with Amy Heckerling, who was tapped to direct the 1998 film, in order to keep her interested in the project.
According to Kattan, Heckerling — who was then 43 years old — propositioned Kattan during the film's pre-production, but he reportedly didn't take her seriously and felt awkward because she was technically his boss.
The next day, Kattan wrote, an angry Michaels reportedly phoned Kattan and suggested he sleep with Heckerling to keep her ""happy"" and attached to the film.
""Chris, I'm not saying you have to f*** her, but it wouldn't hurt,"" Michaels purportedly told Kattan.
Kattan later added that he did end up having sexual relations with her.
""She thought it would be fun to have sex on Lorne's desk,"" he wrote. ""Wow, what a great idea! Jesus Christ. I said a polite 'F***, no!' to that, so we ended up going to her office and having sex on … yep, you guessed it, the 'casting couch.'""
Kattan said he was attracted to Heckerling but ""was very afraid of the power she and Lorne wielded over [his] career.""
What else? Heckerling did end up signing onto the production, but as a producer rather than director.
A spokesperson for ""SNL"" issued a brief statement to Page Six on Kattan's book.
""This did not happen,"" the spokesperson said."
Cornel West warns Joe Biden to 'get off his symbolic crack pipe' or lose black voters to President Trump,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cornel-west-warns-biden-to-get-off-his-symbolic-crack-pipe-or-lose-black-voters-to-president-trump,"Harvard University professor and progressive activist Cornel West says Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden needs to ""get off his symbolic crack pipe"" and admit his record on crime, or risk losing black voters to President Donald Trump in 2020.
What are the details? On Monday, President Trump declared on Twitter, ""Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing. That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!""
He added, ""Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!""
The Washington Examiner reached out to West for his reaction to the president's tweets and his assessment of Biden's recent claim that the 1994 Crime Bill he was instrumental in crafting ""did not generate mass incarceration.""
West told The Examiner, ""I hope and pray he is unable to do it. But if Trump comes out strong on criminal justice reform, he is going to get a slice of the black vote, because this is life or death.
""I think Biden is going to have to take responsibility and acknowledge the contribution he made to something that was not a force for good,"" he continued. ""We all make mistakes, but this was major, major bad judgment. And we have to tell the truth.""
""That Joe Biden was one of the architects, or core architects, is going to haunt him in a very serious way,"" West added. ""When he says it didn't contribute to mass incarceration, I tell him he has to get off his symbolic crack pipe.""
The philosopher went to say Biden ""should be ashamed of himself"" for using the word ""predator"" when pitching the sweeping tough-on-crime legislation ahead of its passage, and urged the former vice president to apologize.
Anything else? West — who supports Democratic socialist candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2020 race for the White House — threw in another suggestion for Biden in his conversation with The Examiner, reportedly saying with a laugh, ""My fundamental advice to Biden is to pull out of the race and pull into the port of Bernie."""
Joe Biden accuser leverages her media attention to get a talk show,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-accuser-talk-show,"Lucy Flores, who accused former Vice President Joe Biden of unwanted touching, announced that she is planning to start a talk show. Flores was relatively unknown before she published her accusations.
What's the story? While other #MeToo accusations have centered on things done in secret, most of the accusations against Biden have involved interactions that included unwanted touching that happened during televised events.
Flores's alleged interaction with Biden was one of the exceptions to this rule. She had been a Democratic member of the Nevada state Assembly, and Biden had gone to one of her campaign events in 2014.
In a piece for the Cut published in March, Flores said that during this event, Biden put his hands on her shoulders, ""inhaled"" her hair, and ""proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head."" Biden was still vice president at the time.
Following Flores' accusations, Biden promised to "" be more mindful "" about personal space. Since then, he has announced that he was entering the 2020 race for president, in which he currently holds a commanding lead over the other Democratic candidates.
What happened now? Flores announced Wednesday that she would be launching her own talk show on the Latino-millennial-focused network LATV after her accusations against Biden pushed her into the national spotlight. Her new show will be called "" Jefa Status, "" or ""Boss Status."" She said she hopes to use it to increase the number of Latino people on television.
In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter , Flores said, ""It may have started with Joe Biden but that wasn't the primary reason why I spoke out. Because it isn't just about Joe Biden and his behavior. Powerful men need to recognize when there's a power dynamic, because oftentimes the person on the receiving end doesn't feel like they can say anything about their discomfort."""

What did Vescovo say?
""As I continued going along the bottom cruising around, I did see what appeared to be one or two particles of manmade matter. I don't know if they were plastic or metal, but they definitely had sharp edges. One of them had what looked like a letter printed on it so they were definitely contamination,"" Vescovo said.

He also announced that since his investigation is now over, he will be resigning.
Here's what we know During a news conference on Wednesday, Mueller announced that he would be ""resigning from the Department of Justice to return to private life.""
He said that charging President Trump with a crime was never an option, because ""under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he's in office."" He added ""charging the president with a crime was not an option we could therefore consider.""
Mueller emphasized that while his report had not accused the president of any crimes, it had also not cleared him, saying ""if we had confidence that the president did not commit a crime we would have said so.""
Mueller said that no one had told him to speak further about this investigation. He said that any testimony he gave to Congress would not include any information that he had not already provided in his report.
""I would not provide information besides that which is already public in any testimony before Congress,"" he said.
He elaborated a bit further on this point, saying that it ""would be unfair to potentially accuse someone of a crime, when there could be no court resolution of the charge."" Based on this, he said, his office had concluded that the final report would not say whether or not the president had committed a crime.
He said he did not think it was ""appropriate"" for him to speak any more about this investigation. He did not take any questions.
Trump responded In a tweet following Mueller's announcement, Trump said ""Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.""
However, Mueller never once mentioned a lack of evidence, just the inability to legally charge a sitting president with a crime."

Liberals are furious at Nancy Pelosi after her response to Mueller's statement — here's why,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberals-are-furious-at-pelosi-over-mueller,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) offered a statement excoriating President Donald Trump after the public statement by special counsel Robert Mueller, and she was lambasted on social media over it — by liberals.
Pelosi released a statement after the briefing, but did not even mention the word ""impeachment"" in the text.
""[Mueller] stated that the decision not to indict stemmed directly from the Department of Justice's policy that a sitting President cannot be indicted,"" said Pelosi in the statement. ""Despite Department of Justice policy to the contrary, no one is above the law – not even the President.""
Although many Democrats have already called for impeachment proceedings to begin against Trump, Pelosi has cautioned them against moving too quickly.
In a public statement on Wednesday, she reiterated the point.
""We won't be swayed by a few people who think one way or another who are running for president as much as I respect all of them and they have the freedom to be for impeachment,"" Pelosi said . ""We have the responsibility to get a result for the American people and that's where we're going.""
Democrats and other opponents of the president fumed at Pelosi for not rushing headlong into impeaching the president.
""Something is VERY wrong w/ Pelosi's answers today,"" responded former Florida Democratic candidate Pam Kieth. ""Does she have no idea who she serves, who her base is, what her legacy will be, what the job demands?""
""Something is really off here. No way should we be BEGGING her to do what virtually every lifelong Dem would do insinctually,"" she added.
Progressive commentator Cenk Uygur went so far as to claim that Pelosi was not a progressive because even Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan was advocating impeachment more than she was.
""She has now proved my point spectacularly,"" Uygur tweeted . ""When [Rep. Justin Amash is to the left of you, you might not be a progressive!""
""So this is #Pelosi's 'secret plan/long game'? To convince Trump suck-ups like #MitchMcConnell and #LindseyGraham to do the right thing for America?"" complained former Clinton aide Peter Daou. ""This would be amusing if the stakes weren't our entire democracy.""
""Mueller gave you your orders and if you do nothing, your kegacy will be allowing the rape of democracy,"" responded comedian Christopher Titus. ""Political calculation aside, Act.""
""If no one is above the law, then how many laws and how many ethical and human rights violations would it take for you to stand up to this?"" asked feminist writer Jodi Jacobson. ""What does it take? Your inaction is unconscionable.""

Photographer proves AOC was badly mistaken about the alleged 'glamour shot' of Hope Hicks in the NYT,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-proven-totally-wrong-for-glamour-shot-hope-hicks-rant-by-nyt-photographer,"After The New York Times ran a story on former White House staffer Hope Hicks and whether she would comply with a congressional subpoena, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed displeasure with the photo accompanying the story. As it turns out, her outrage was based on a totally false assumption.
Ocasio-Cortez contrasted the so-called ""glamour shot"" with allegedly ""menacing"" photos used for stories about minority victims.
""Yup. Where's the 'no angel' take now?"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""In the immediate aftermath of shootings, media routinely post menacing photos of people-of-color victims + dredge up any questionable thing they'd ever done. But when Hope Hicks considers not complying w a subpoena, it's glamour shot time.""
Photographer Tom Brenner put a stop to that narrative Tuesday, posting the unedited photo showing that it was not a glamour shot at all—it was just a regular photo of Hicks from when she stepped into a meeting unannounced.
""From the 'Glamour Shoot' with Hope Hicks. Original frames from a Roosevelt Room meeting with the President and state/local officials regarding school safety on 2/22/18,"" Brenner wrote. ""One of the last images of Hope as an official before her resignation not long after.
""Also to further clarify the situation, I was also unaware that Ms. Hicks would enter the room to hear this meeting in person,"" Brenner continued. ""Officials are free to step into meetings, and at this instance she was standing quietly beside the door for only a few minutes.""

Wade .
Particularly over the past three months, Wen has used a line stating that before Roe , thousands of women died every year from abortion due to ""attacks on safe, legal abortion care"" or women not having ""access to essential health care.""
A Post reader requested that the organization check up on that claim, and the resulting research led The Washington Post to assign Wen's claim a grade of ""Four Pinocchios"" which is defined on their rating scale simply as a ""whopper."" For reference, a ""Three Pinocchio"" rating is for a claim with a ""significant factual error and/or obvious contradiction.""
""Wen is a doctor, and the ACOG is made up of doctors,"" the Post's Glenn Kessler wrote. ""They should know better than to peddle statistics based on data that predates the advent of antibiotics. Even given the fuzzy nature of the data and estimates, there is no evidence that in the years immediately preceding the Supreme Court's decision, thousands of women died every year in the United States from illegal abortions.""
As early as 1959, even pro-abortion researchers were acknowledging that thousands of women were not dying from illegal abortions, even though that may have been the case in the 1930s.
""Abortion is no longer a dangerous procedure,"" one researcher wrote in 1959. ""This applies not just to therapeutic abortions as performed in hospitals but also to so-called illegal abortions as done by physicians. In 1957, there were only 260 deaths in the whole country attributed to abortions of any kind. In New York City in 1921, there were 144 abortion deaths, in 1951 there were only 15.""
The conclusion is that while there was likely a point in history during which Wen's claim would've been true, in the years and possibly decades before Roe v. Wade as antibiotics became more common, there was not an epidemic of thousands of women dying because they had to seek illegal abortions."
"Beto O'Rourke says Democrats must act now and impeach, or 'lose our Democracy forever' - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/orourke-says-dems-must-impeach-trump,"Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke opined that Democrats would 'lose our Democracy forever' unless they began impeachment proceedings immediately against President Donald Trump.
O'Rourke was speaking to Chris Matthews on his MSNBC show Wednesday when he made the comments.
""Act now or lose our Democracy forever,"" said O'Rourke.
""That is the choice before us,"" he continued, ""and I'm grateful to those lawmakers including Republican [Rep.] Justin Amash [R-Mich.] who have put this country ahead of their own political careers. And I understand political considerations, I've held elected office, I'm campaign for one right now. But this moment demands more of us.
""And we will be judged by how we have faced these facts,"" O'Rourke added. ""For Robert Mueller to come forward today someone who is famously reticent and out of the hundreds of pages of his report, to focus on the fact that we were attacked by the Russians and that there is somebody who obstructed justice and lied to investigators, and then to say the criminal justice system is not the way to hold this person accountable, there's another process under the Constitution.
""He is clearly referring to impeachment, and he's demanding that we do this now or forever lose the opportunity to act,"" he concluded. ""So it's that clear to me I hope it is that clear to member of Congress who have the opportunity to act while there's still time.""
Special counsel Robert Mueller said in a media briefing Wednesday that because of Department of Justice guidelines that he could not indict Trump on any charges. Some Democrats took this to mean that Mueller was recommending to Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.

"Smallest recorded baby, born at 23 weeks, is now going home healthy - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/smallest-recorded-baby-born-at-23-weeks-is-now-going-home-healthy,"A baby who was born at less than a pound in San Diego, and who was the smallest-recorded surviving infant in the world, has gone home five months after being born as a healthy baby, according to The Associated Press .
Saybie (the name used by the doctors caring for the baby at the hospital) was born at 23 weeks and three days, and weighed in at a mere 8.6 ounces at birth. She was able to go home this month, weighing about five pounds after spending five months in neonatal intensive care.
""After experiencing severe pregnancy complications, Saybie's mother gave birth via emergency cesarean section at 23 weeks, 3 days gestation in the womb,"" a hospital representative said at a news conference . ""Doctors said the preterm birth was necessary after they found that the baby was not gaining weight and her mother's life was at immediate risk.""
After Saybie was born, doctors told the father that he had an hour to spend with his child before she died. The baby was small enough to fit in the palm of someone's hand.
Doctors said Saybie experienced ""virtually none"" of the medical complications that typically come when a baby is born as a ""micropreemie,"" which refers to babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy.
Saybie's inspiring story of survival comes during a time when the abortion debate is as contentious as it has ever been. States such as Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana have passed pro-life laws establishing the right to life for unborn babies and banning abortions at six weeks of pregnancy, or in Alabama's case, altogether (except to save the life of the mother).
Meanwhile, states like New York and Virginia have enacted laws this year that allow abortions even beyond 24 weeks in some circumstances, such as unspecified threats to the mother's mental and/or physical health.
Saybie's survival puts a real, human face on a fact that pro-life advocates consistently assert: A fetus in the womb is a human life, and deserves a chance to live.

Hillary Clinton bashes Facebook for 'sexist trash' video of Nancy Pelosi - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-bashes-facebook-over-pelosi-video,"Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton excoriated social media platform Facebook for allowing the spread of a doctored video mocking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
She made the comments during her commencement address Wednesday at the Hunter College Commencement ceremony in New York City.
""The big social media platforms know their systems are being manipulated by foreign and domestic actors to sow division, promote extremism and to spread misinformation but they won't get serious about cleaning up their platforms unless consumers demand it,"" Clinton claimed.
""And we saw why it's so important last week, when Facebook refused to take down a fake video of Nancy Pelosi. It wasn't even a close call, the video is sexist trash,"" she added.
""And YouTube took it down but Facebook kept it up,"" Clinton continued. ""So let's send a message to Facebook that those who are in Facebook's communities would really like Facebook to pay attention to doctored videos before we are flooded with them over the next months.""
Facebook was criticized for allowing the doctored video to continue on their platform even after it was confirmed that it had been slowed down at times to make Pelosi sound inebriated.
Clinton previously spoke out against the video and said that it was proof that the president was ""running scared.""
Here's the video of Clinton's comments:"
Pres. Trump just torpedoed Roy Moore's Alabama Senate campaign before it started: 'Roy Moore cannot win',www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pres-trump-just-torpedoed-roy-moores-alabama-senate-campaign-before-it-started-roy-moore-cannot-win,"Former judge and failed Senate candidate Roy Moore hasn't even officially announced his second attempt to run for an Alabama Senate seat, and President Donald Trump has already come out strongly against the idea.
Earlier this week, Moore was the recipient of a scathing rebuke from the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. Today, POTUS himself sent a clear message to Moore: Don't run.
""Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,"" President Trump tweeted. ""This time it will be for Six Years, not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win. But he didn't, and probably won't.""
""If Alabama does not elect a Republican to the Senate in 2020, many of the incredible gains that we have made during my Presidency may be lost, including our Pro-Life victories,"" he continued. ""Roy Moore cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating....Judges and Supreme Court Justices!""
The president brings up some valid points in his tweets. Moore, burdened by a scandal related to relationships with underage girls, lost a special election that should've been a sure thing for Republicans. And while the GOP was able to extend its control over the Senate in 2018, not regaining the Alabama seat in 2020 would be a blow to the party in a severely pro-Trump state.
Moore, for his part, seems to be undeterred by the heavy criticism that just the idea of him running again brings.
Ever wonder why the mere mention of my name scares the ""hell"" out of the Washington DC establishment, liberals, and LGBT?"" Moore tweeted Wednesday morning. ""Like Pres Trump I want to see America great again, but that is a job only God can do!""

Meghan McCain excoriates Pres. Trump over what he reportedly did to the USS McCain — and he just tweeted about it,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/uss-john-mccain-covered-up,"President Donald Trump denied a report claiming that he ordered the U.S. Navy to hide the USS John McCain during his trip to Japan, but not before Meghan McCain raked him over the coals for it.
""Trump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life,"" Meghan McCain tweeted. ""There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won't let him RIP. So I have to stand up for him.""
""It makes my grief unbearable,"" she added.
The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that they obtained an email that contained the order to keep the ship ""out of sight"" during the president's visit.
""USS John McCain needs to be out of sight,"" the email reportedly read, according to the WSJ. ""Please confirm #3 will be satisfied.""
A tarp was hung over the name of the ship and they were instructed to remove other displays of the name of the ship. Sailors were reportedly also told to stay home during the visit by the president. The report noted that they wear caps with the name of the ship normally.
Trump appeared to deny the report from his social media account.
""I was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan,"" Trump tweeted.
""Nevertheless, [first lady Melania Trump] and I loved being with our great Military Men and Women - what a spectacular job they do!"" he added.
After the president denied knowledge of the order, the official Twitter account of the U.S. Navy's Chief of Information denied the story and the photo which accompanied the report.
""The name of USS John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day,"" the account tweeted. ""The Navy is proud of that ship, its crew, its namesake and its heritage.""
The U.S. Navy is also looking into whether service members on the USS WASP, the ship that the president visited in Japan, violated Department of Defense policy by wearing pro-Trump patches.

'Drag 101' class for teens canceled at public library after 'veiled threats' and 'hostile' messages,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-101-class-for-teens-canceled,"An Ohio public library summer class for teenagers titled, ""Drag 101"" — to be led by a former Miss Gay Ohio America and local drag queen — has been canceled due to the ""veiled threats"" and ""hostile"" messages, ThisWeekNews reported .
What's the background? ""Curious about the art of drag and no idea where to start? Come learn the basics with former Miss Gay Ohio America and local queen, Selena T. West!"" the original class description at the Orange Branch of the Delaware County District Library read. ""We will learn about the application of makeup and creating characters, as well as the history of drag. All genders welcome! Teens only, please.""
West's goal for the class — which would have taken place next Wednesday afternoon — was to show that ""drag is for everyone"" and give youths an outlet they may otherwise not have had, ThisWeekNews said.
""It's going to be open to everybody, and I want people to come be able to express themselves and learn about drag,"" West said, according to the outlet. ""Drag is not scary; drag is not sexual. [Teens can] learn about what seem like trivial things like hair, nails, makeup, clothing. Those are the building blocks of a Drag 101 class I would teach.""
Here's a video report about the class:
Drag 101 class for teens sparks controversy at Delaware County library youtu.be
Backlash But library spokeswoman Nicole Fowles said ""hundreds"" of phone calls and emails came in regarding the class — a large portion from out of state — and were ""interfering with our librarians' ability to do their daily jobs,"" the outlet said.
""A small number of [the phone calls and emails] were hostile,"" she added to ThisWeekNews. ""A smaller number were veiled threats.""
So library leaders met with Delaware County Sheriff Russell Martin, who also shared his concerns, the outlet said, and that led to the class cancellation.
'It really does break our hearts' Fowles said library leadership was upset about the cancellation. ""It really does break our hearts,"" she told ThisWeekNews.
Library Director George Needham added that ""our mission statement ensures that we will provide lifelong learning in a friendly environment. Threats of protests, hate and violence stand in direct conflict with that mission and we cannot sacrifice the safety of the public we serve,"" the outlet added.
The library issued a statement that said, in part, that other messages supported the ""Drag 101"" class taking place:
Our hearts overflowed with the stories people told us. Stories that said they wished a program like this had been offered when they were a teen living in Delaware County. Stories from parents and grandparents who said they were proud to live in a community with a library that supported them and their children. Stories from teens who would attend the program and are excited for the library's offerings of inclusive and diverse programming. New location for class West told ThisWeekNews that the ""Drag 101"" class will now take place at the same time — 2 to 3 p.m. June 5 — but instead at Secret Identity Comics in Delaware, Ohio.
""The owner of that shop approached me,"" West told the outlet. ""He was one of the people who spoke at the [library] board meeting in favor of the program and was really for it for all the teens to get involved and learn about the building blocks of what drag is.""
Here's a clip of West speaking at that board meeting, which took place last week:
