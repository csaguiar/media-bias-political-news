5 unresolved mysteries about Russian meddling in Mueller’s report Even in a 448-page report, the special counsel left several big questions unaddressed or only partially answered.

Former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig set for Aug. 12 trial The case spun out of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Week 100: The Real Disappointment of the Mueller Report Magazine,www.politico.com,Jack Shafer,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/19/week-100-mueller-disappointment-226670,"For all the deep-dish sleuthing and prosecutorial imagination Robert S. Mueller III threw at his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections, the 448-page report that is its capstone ultimately poses bigger questions than it answers.
Not to disparage the industry of Mueller and his team and their encyclopedic findings of Trump’s delinquency, but except for the twin revelations that prosecutors found no evidence of Trump campaign conspiracy with the Russians and the “Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion,” I feel let down. Maybe I’ll change my mind when the redactions get filled in, but reading today all the base and low things Trump has done in the past three years, I still don’t know the whys behind his behavior. Why did Donald Trump lie so tirelessly about the status of the Trump Tower Moscow project? Why did he attempt to conceal the true purpose of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a gaggle of Russians? Why did he suggest the hackers behind the stolen Democrats emails could have been China or a “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds“ when it was so obviously Russia? Why did he lie about his request to get White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller in June 2017 and then demand that McGahn lie about issuing the directive?
Why did he ask FBI Director James Comey to abort the bureau’s investigation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had lied to investigators about his talks about sanctions with the Russian ambassador? Why did he switch stories on why he fired Comey? Why did he ask Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to hold a presser about the firing and tell the lie that the sacking was Rosenstein’s idea? Why did he try to throttle the special counsel’s investigation? Why did he tease Paul Manafort with the promise of a pardon? Why did he shout “fake news“ so many times when he was the faker? Why did so many of the players in the Trump orbit—Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Erik Prince, Sarah Sanders, Donald Trump Jr., Michael Cohen and Roger Stone—appear to have told lies in the president’s service?
If Mueller were a seer and his report the oracular readings of entrails, we would be within our rights as news consumers to demand the sacrifice of an additional animal for a new omen. You might say I’m being unfair, and you’d be right. Mueller isn’t a psychiatrist. He was assigned to scour campaign 2016 (and then Trump’s efforts to undermine him) for ringing evidence of crime, and he succeeded, winning his case against Manafort and compelling Flynn, Gates and others to confess. When it came to Trump, Mueller appears to have had the evidentiary goods to charge the president with obstruction but held his fire because of the legal obstacles to indicting a sitting president. Instead, he chose a third path, saying he could not “conclude that the president committed a crime” but he could also “not exonerate him.” If the dots of his obstruction investigation can be connected, the Mueller report seems to imply, Congress and not the courts should do the connecting with articles of impeachment.
Except for pausing to explain that Trump suppressed information that would call into question the legitimacy of his election—and that he feared that incessant probing might uncover criminal activity by him, his campaign or his family—the Mueller report offers no firm theory on what motivated Trump’s constant deceptions. Likewise, Mueller’s assessment that Trump obstructed his investigation on at least 10 occasions lacks a firm explanation for why he would engage in such risky acts. For instance, why did Trump, whose sense of loyalty usually runs one way, put his neck out so far for Flynn by instructing Comey to lay off? Consider a counterfactual in which Trump dumps Flynn at the first opportunity and doesn’t interfere with Comey’s Russia investigation. No Comey sacking, no Mueller, hence no pattern of obstruction. Obviously, Comey probably would have uncovered some damaging Trump information, but those revelations would have been limited compared with what Mueller revealed because so much of the damning information in the report is about Trump's efforts to undermine Mueller.
When Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Trump in May 2017 that a special counsel had been appointed to investigate the Russia business, the report tells us, “the president slumped back in his chair and said, ‘Oh, my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.’” One way to read this lamentation is that Trump understood that he was guilty of great crimes and that the special counsel’s dragnet was going to collect them all and send him and his cronies to jail. Another is that the backstage Trump captured in the “I’m fucked” anecdote is a lot like frontstage Trump: He overdramatizes and overreacts to everything. If you were to stick Trump’s finger with a pin, he would scream that he was being fed into a woodchipper.
Maybe this hysterical bearing, fueled by Trump’s imperfect knowledge of the law, prompted him to regard any legal scrutiny as a potential Armageddon. The idea that confronting controversy by telling the truth—like admitting secret payoffs to your mistresses, for example—makes better political sense than uncoiling a batch of lies to conceal the facts seems beyond Trump. One takeaway from the report is that given his druthers, Trump would rather be maimed by the backlash of one of his lies than suffer the sting of telling a simple truth.
The watchword of the Obama administration, formulated by Obama himself, was “Don’t do stupid shit.” The corresponding watchword in Trumpworld, as observed by White House counsel McGahn, was “do crazy shit.” Trump’s sustained appetite for duplicity, his brinkmanship, and his ceaseless chaos-making, thoroughly documented in the report, appear to have prevented Mueller from formulating a greater theory of the case against him. Having made dishonesty his careerlong policy, Trump encourages us to believe that his lies don’t necessarily point to any definable goals. His lies exist primarily to shield the earlier lies he’s told, making his life’s work an endless weave of fraud and falsehood. That makes anybody who punctures these lies—the “fake news media,” for example, or Democrats on the Hill, investigators like Comey or Mueller, or intelligence agencies—the enemy. And the best way to counteract their critiques is with additional lies and new vitriol, Trump surmises.
Today, with Trump dodging an indictment, it looks like he won. But that victory might be temporary. Dispassionate almost to a fault, the Mueller report punctures with legal precision Trump’s ugly methods. The report’s final use might not be as the legal cornerstone to a Trump impeachment but as a political text to guide voters in the 2020 election.

Appeals court orders EPA to act on demands to ban chlorpyrifos,www.politico.com,JESSE CHASE-LUBITZ,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/19/epa-chlorpyrifos-court-3115794,"A federal appeals court on Friday has given the EPA 90 days to take action on demands by environmental groups to ban a widely used pesticide.
Groups are hoping that the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco will mean that the government will soon prohibit the use of chlorpyrifos. The EPA, under the Obama administration, decided to ban it in 2015 after scientific evidence showed the pesticide has the potential to damage brain development in children.
The EPA, however, reversed the prohibition under then-Administrator Scott Pruitt, in a move that was an early step in carrying out President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda.
The agency now has three months to decide what to do in light of the appeals court ruling. “We are reviewing the court’s order and will be taking final action on the administrative objections before the agency within 90 days,” EPA spokesperson James Hewitt said in an email to POLITICO.
Environmental groups are hopeful that a ban will soon be in place.
“It is hard to be optimistic when EPA has delayed for a dozen years, but based on the record before the agency, the science and the law, we think that the only thing that EPA can do is ban the use of chlorpyrifos on food,"" said Marisa Ordonia, an attorney for Earthjustice, one of the groups suing the EPA.
The long-running case dates back to 2007 but the latest phase re-examined a ruling also on the 9th Circuit.
In 2018, three appellate judges of the court ruled that the EPA unlawfully postponed the agency's efforts to ban chlorpyrifos. But in the fall, the 9th Circuit took the rare step of granting the EPA's request to have the full panel of the appeals court rehear oral arguments.
That hearing took place in March, and several judges seemed exasperated by the delays.
""You've had 10 years or more to look at this,"" one of the judges, Margaret McKeown, told a Justice Department attorney during the hearing. ""We've changed administrations, apparently we've changed science — how much more time do you need?""
Seven states and the District of Columbia stood on the side of the environmental groups in the case. But some groups, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation and CropLife America supported the government’s decision to life the ban, arguing that chlorpyrifos is necessary to protect crops from pests.
Environmental groups said it’s possible that the Trump administration will continue to drag out the case.
“EPA’s response to the objections could result in them finalizing the ban that they proposed in 2015, or they could uphold its denial of the 2007 petition and try to justify that decision (despite their own scientists finding that chlorpyrifos is unsafe),” Ordonia said. “Either way, once EPA issues a decision on the objections, we can go back to the court and make our case on the merits for why EPA must ban this toxic nerve agent.”
Corteva Agriscience sells the pesticide under the trade name Lorsban. Chlorpyrifos is sprayed by farmers on fruits and vegetables to kill pests, among a total of more than 50 crops grown in the U.S.
“It is long past time to take action to protect people, particularly children, from a highly toxic chemical,” Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told POLITICO. “EPA’s own science review found the pesticide dangerous but Administrator Pruitt sided with chemical companies to allow its continued dangerous use. Time to redress that wrong.”

State Republicans challenge Democrats with ‘born-alive’ bills,www.politico.com,RENUKA RAYASAM,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/20/republicans-state-born-alive-bills-1365192,"Republican legislators across the country are rallying behind President Donald Trump's efforts to link Democrats with ""infanticide,"" daring Democratic governors to veto ""born alive"" bills animating the party's base before the 2020 elections.
Bills approved by GOP-run legislatures in Montana and North Carolina this week would penalize health care providers for failing to care for an infant who survives an abortion attempt. The measures, which are also winding through legislatures in Texas and elsewhere, are being pushed by anti-abortion groups that quickly seized on bills in New York and Virginia aimed at loosening restrictions on third-trimester abortions.
""Pro-life activists in the legislature are really making things uncomfortable for the governors,"" said Mallory Quigley, a spokesperson with Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group allied with the Trump administration. ""Now they have a tricky situation politically with these pro-life bills headed to their desk.""
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who faces reelection next year in a state Trump won by 3.6 percentage points, on Thursday vetoed the bill state lawmakers passed two days earlier. A spokesperson for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who is mulling a presidential run as a bridge-building moderate, indicated he will likely do the same.
“This needless legislation would criminalize doctors and other healthcare providers for a practice that simply does not exist,” Cooper said in a statement after vetoing the bill.
Democrats and abortion rights activists say the GOP and Trump — who said Democrats ""don't mind executing babies AFTER birth"" — are using inflammatory language to spread misinformation about third trimester abortions, which are rare and often involve serious health problems for either the pregnant woman or the fetus. Democrats argue the law already prevents doctors from killing babies, and the so-called ""born alive"" measures would prevent doctors from providing appropriate care and add emotional pain to already tough medical decisions.
Similar bills in Congress have been defeated or stalled, but Republicans plan to press the issue heading into the 2020 election. Trump has won over evangelicals, a key GOP constituency, with his strong anti-abortion position and attempts to cut funding for Planned Parenthood. Conservatives, seeking to paint Democrats as so extreme on abortion that they tolerate ""baby-killers,"" believe the issue can motivate their voters and appeal to Hispanics — who are divided on abortion — and suburban women who helped fuel Democrats’ midterm election gains.
Cooper’s veto emerged as an immediate flashpoint in North Carolina, a 2020 battleground for the presidency and control of the Senate — Democrats believe they must topple Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) next year to have a shot at retaking the chamber. The state GOP accused Cooper of aligning with “infanticide and extremist” abortion providers.
Cooper, who in 2016 just narrowly defeated an unpopular Republican incumbent, is betting his veto won’t hurt his reelection effort.
“Two decades ago you’d never have seen a North Carolina politician take this kind of step,” said Mitch Kokai, a senior political analyst with the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank in Raleigh. “But I’m guessing Cooper is making the political calculation that there are enough supporters of the pro-choice movement concerned about this legislation and its ties to the pro-life cause that he thinks it’s not going to hurt him.”
Texas and six other states are debating similar bills based on model legislation from National Right to Life that would impose fines and prison sentences on physicians and nurses who neglect an infant surviving an abortion. The Texas bill is on the verge of passage — the state House and Senate must reconcile slightly differing versions of the bill before it's sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has tweeted his support .
The political firestorm over third trimester abortions was ignited earlier this year by a vote in the New York legislature to ease restrictions on the procedure and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's graphic comments defending a similar bill in his state. Democratic presidential candidates have faced questions about the issue on the campaign trail.
""What happened in New York and Virginia is seen as very extreme,"" Quigley of SBA List said. ""You've got Beto [O'Rourke] and Bernie [Sanders] and people running for president, having to speak on late-term abortion. This is going to be an issue that hurts them.""
Democrats are largely united on abortion rights and have tried to highlight Trump administration actions undercutting access to Planned Parenthood and contraception. Still, some Democrats worry about their party's strategy to counteract Republican messaging on these bills.
""[Democrats] should be increasingly concerned, not just about this policy but about ... a model that takes a national message, often a muddled one, and figures out a way to localize and it and weaponize it,"" said a Democratic Senate aide. ""The moment you take a national thing and localize it and it makes Democrat governors uncomfortable, Republicans win.""
Senate Democrats earlier this year blocked an attempt to bring up a ""born alive"" bill from Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), before the measure was defeated largely along party lines in late February. Three Democrats — Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama and Joe Manchin of West Virginia — voted for it. House Republicans, meanwhile, have been gathering signatures to force a vote on the floor.
The state measures so far have passed largely with GOP votes. However, they got some support from Democratic lawmakers in conservative parts of the country.
""The picture painted by [the bill] is horrific,"" said Texas state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, one of two Senate Democrats who voted for the bill in a statement. ""The idea that a doctor would, in the aftermath of a failed abortion, witness a newborn child struggle for life and do nothing to assist is incomprehensible and abhorrent.""
But many Democratic state lawmakers argued the bills were meant to score political points or to discourage doctors from providing abortions. Democrats in North Carolina argued that Republicans never pushed for a vote when they held legislative supermajorities as recently as last year.
""Let me just say that not a single one of us in this room supports infanticide,"" said Texas state Rep. Donna Howard, a Democrat who organized a boycott of the state's bill on the House floor Tuesday. ""The misinformation perpetuated by this bill is dangerous and is the exact type of rhetoric that leads to threats of violence against providers.""
Democrats say Republicans are misrepresenting how often and why abortions happen later in pregnancy. In Texas, for example, no infants survived an abortion attempt between 2013 and 2016, the only years that state health department data is available. And if a doctor does harm to a baby, charges can be filed under existing the law — as was the case with abortion provider Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted of murder in 2013.
The ""born alive"" bills would criminalize negligence, meaning that prosecutors would not necessarily have to prove a premeditated intent to harm to bring a case. Second, they establish harsh penalties — in Montana's bill, for example, physicians and nurses could face up to 20 years in prison.
Anti-abortion groups are confident the measures would withstand legal challenges, unlike other state laws that have sought to ban abortion before fetal viability — the standard set by Roe v. Wade. Some abortion rights groups said they likely wouldn’t try to block these measures in court, decrying the bills as a “scare tactic.”
“Newborns are already protected under existing law, so this legislation is completely unnecessary,” said Elisabeth Smith, chief counsel for state policy at the Center for Reproductive Rights."
Fears grow Trump will abandon Afghan women to the Taliban,www.politico.com,NAHAL TOOSI,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/20/afghanistan-women-shaheen-1279707,"Fears grow Trump will abandon Afghan women to the Taliban Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is waging a campaign to keep the once prominent issue in the spotlight. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Jeanne Shaheen was facing down Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — and not too pleased about it.
The senator asked Pompeo to push the Afghan government and the Taliban to include Afghan women in peace talks. But he wouldn’t fully commit to doing so. Story Continued Below
“Senator, there are lots of issues that we’re working our way through,” Pompeo told her during the exchange in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week.
“I understand that, but this is half of the population in the country,” Shaheen shot back.
“Yes, ma’am, and I hope they will make their voices heard,” Pompeo said.
Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and the only woman on the committee, was not reassured.
The Trump administration says it cares about the future of women in an Afghanistan where the Taliban — who have a history of repressing women — may again have political power. State Department officials even hint that the country could lose out on aid funds if women’s rights aren’t protected.

But asked this week if she believes President Donald Trump and his top aides are genuinely serious about the issue, Shaheen was quiet for several seconds, then finally said: “We don’t know the answer to that yet.”
As the peace talks move forward, Shaheen is determined to keep pressing the issue of women. She visited the country last weekend, where she assured worried Afghan women that she’s not giving up on them.
In many ways, though, Shaheen cuts a lonely figure in Washington.
Protecting Afghan women once had vocal bipartisan support in D.C. — it was, after all, a cause célèbre among people ranging from former first lady Laura Bush to feminist heroine Gloria Steinem. But such public declarations have been notably sparse in recent months as the ongoing peace talks offer a shot at a U.S. exit from a war many Americans are eager to end after nearly 18 years.
The relative dearth of U.S. politicians speaking out has some activists fearing that Trump will compromise with the Taliban in ways that will threaten the gains Afghan women have made since 2001, including being allowed to attend school and work outside the home.
“The very fact that we have to say ‘Where are the women? Will women’s rights be protected?’ instead of understanding that all of that is integral to the future of Afghanistan highlights the problem,” said Andrea Prasow of Human Rights Watch.
“It’s Afghanistan fatigue,” she added. “Everyone wants to be done in one way or another.”
One telling moment came in late January, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, proposed a measure that warned Trump against a “precipitous withdrawal” from Syria or Afghanistan.
The Republican president, who has an isolationist streak, has made it clear he wants to withdraw U.S. troops from both countries as soon as feasible.
McConnell’s measure passed the Senate, but nearly every Democrat considering running for president in 2020 voted against it. Some accused McConnell of wanting to perpetuate a “forever war.”
The 2020 Democrats’ dissent was a reflection of the exhaustion with the Afghan war even among liberals who see themselves as champions of women’s rights.
Shaheen, who voted in favor of the McConnell measure and is up for re-election in 2020, acknowledged the political realities. On the women’s issue, “I think we need more support. It needs to be bipartisan,” she told POLITICO in a phone interview after her visit to Afghanistan. By LAURA BARRÓN-LÓPEZ
As part of her campaign to keep the issue in the spotlight, Shaheen in early February wrote a letter , cosigned by fellow Democratic senators Bob Menendez and Patrick Leahy, that urged Pompeo to include and prioritize Afghan women in the peace talks.
In early April, Shaheen invited Roya Rahmani, Afghanistan’s ambassador to the U.S. — the first woman in that role — as her guest for NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s speech to Congress.
Shaheen keeps reminding the administration that Trump in 2017 signed a bill , which she spearheaded, that commits the U.S. to bolstering women’s roles in resolving global conflicts. She further points to research that shows peace deals are more likely to succeed when women are involved in crafting them.
Shaheen, 72, told POLITICO that she plans to ask other lawmakers heading to Afghanistan in the coming months to make sure to meet with women while there to understand the progress they’ve made thanks in part to the U.S. presence.
“The culture in Afghanistan has changed in some ways, certainly in the cities,” she said.
Inside Afghanistan, women have mobilized to the extent that they can in a country where men still dominate the power structure. They have held conferences and protests demanding they get a seat at the table.
And there are some signs that their voices are being heard.
On Monday, some news organizations quoted a Taliban spokesman as saying the group’s delegation to “intra-Afghan” peace talks originally planned for this weekend would include women. But soon afterward the Taliban walked that back.
The Taliban representatives had been due to meet in Doha, Qatar, with a delegation of prominent Afghans, many of whom were expected to be women. The talks were scuttled at the last minute over several issues.
Such discussions, while important, nonetheless carry less weight than the direct talks that have taken place between the U.S. and the Taliban. The U.S. delegation is led by Zalmay Khalilzad, the Afghan-born former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan.
In his talks with the Taliban, Khalilzad has focused primarily on security issues, including paving the way for an eventual U.S. troop withdrawal while convincing the Taliban to agree not to shelter terrorist groups.
But Khalilzad has insisted that no peace deal is final until the “intra-Afghan” portion is inked. That potentially could include a power-sharing deal between the Taliban and the current Afghan government, or at least pave the way for the Taliban to formally enter the political realm.
Khalilzad did not respond to a request for comment, but a State Department spokesperson noted that his team includes women, and that his deputy, Ambassador Molly Phee, has “led portions of the talks with the Taliban.”
The spokesperson also alluded to some leverage that the U.S. can wield down the line if the Taliban take political power in impoverished Afghanistan: international aid dollars.

“We have made clear to Afghans that the success of our future bilateral relationship and Afghanistan’s relationship with the international community will rest in part on what it does to maintain civil rights of women,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
Khalilzad himself has assured women’s groups of his sympathies: “While #Afghans alone will decide the composition of their delegation for talks, #women must be at the table during all negotiations about #peace & #Afghanistan’s future,” he tweeted on April 1.
But Khalilzad and other U.S. officials have said little to suggest that Afghan women’s participation in the talks, or the safeguarding of their rights in the long-run, is of such importance that the U.S. would be willing to abandon a deal because of it.
Activists worry that non-committal statements from Khalilzad, Pompeo and others Trump aides will open the door to a deal in which women’s rights are embraced in words but not in reality. That’s all the more likely if Taliban leaders gain substantial political power and interpret Islamic law more severely than the current Afghan leadership.
When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, before being ousted by the U.S. invasion in 2001, they forbid girls from going to school, barred women from working, and forced women to wear all-encompassing burqas outside the home. Women who disobeyed were severely punished.
In the years since the U.S. invasion, millions of Afghan girls have enrolled in school and many Afghan women have joined the workforce, especially in cities.
The debate over the peace talks today somewhat echoes concerns voiced during President Barack Obama’s tenure as he, too, tried with little success to engage in negotiations with the Taliban and get the U.S. out of Afghanistan.
At the time, Obama aides downplayed the issue of women’s rights, casting America’s primary geostrategic interest in the country as one of security and stability, not human rights.
That’s not unusual for any presidential administration’s view of any conflict. The U.S., after all, didn’t initially invade Afghanistan because of the Taliban’s brutality toward women. It invaded because the Taliban were sheltering 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida followers.
And if a peace deal fails, “we are not going to re-invade Afghanistan because of girls’ education,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former State Department official under Obama now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Despite the lack of Afghan female voices at the negotiating table under Trump so far, many Afghan woman are hopeful about the overall arc of the talks. "

Five Questions From a Former Spy About the Chinese Woman Arrested at Mar-a-Lago - POLITICO Magazine,www.politico.com,msn.com,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/20/mar-a-lago-chinese-woman-226671,"What was a Chinese woman doing at Mar-a-Lago with her pockets full of passports and cellphones? The March 30 arrest of Chinese national Yujing Zhang at President Donald Trump’s vacation home certainly reads like a juicy spy drama. At the time she was arrested, after changing her story about why she was there, she had on her, in addition to two Chinese passports and four cellphones, a laptop and USB drive later found to contain some kind of malware. More devices and $8,000 in cash were later found in her room at a nearby hotel. Is Chinese intelligence attempting to infiltrate Mar-a-Lago? The answer to that is almost certainly yes. And so is every other foreign intelligence service. That’s just business as usual.
Story Continued Below
But is Zhang part of the Chinese effort?
U.S. law enforcement is still trying to figure that out. Earlier this month, Zhang was charged with lying to a federal officer and entering restricted property, but prosecutors have said more charges might follow. For now, prosecutors are treating Zhang’s case as a national security matter, according to the Miami Herald , adding that a team of FBI counterintelligence officers is on the case. According to the Herald , federal investigators were already looking into Chinese intelligence operations in South Florida before this incident occurred. Zhang’s arrest “has sent the counterintelligence probe into overdrive.”
As a former CIA officer, I am intrigued by Zhang’s role but wary of jumping to conclusions about it, given the limited facts we know so far. Here are five questions that might help us determine whether Zhang is a bumbling Chinese spy who got caught trying to infiltrate the president’s vacation lair or if she is simply an innocent tourist who loves her hi-tech devices.
Why did her cover story fall apart so quickly?
The most basic tradecraft any intelligence officer or asset learns is how to build a decent cover story—an explanation of what you are doing and why, in order to cover what you are really up to—and be ready to maintain it under questioning. Any cover story will eventually fall apart under enough scrutiny (because it is, in fact, a lie), but people trained in espionage know how to protect their story from collapsing too quickly or too easily.
So how did Zhang do with this? At the first Secret Service security checkpoint at Mar-a-Lago, she said she was there to use the pool. Her story initially worked; the agent waved her in. But she did not have a swimsuit with her, and the Colony Hotel, where she was staying, had its own pool. Then, when questioned again later, Zhang explained she was at the resort for a social event, which was not, in fact, scheduled for that day.
If this was an attempt to present a story to cover nefarious actions, it fell apart incredibly quickly. Maybe she was sloppy or poorly prepared? That seems odd for a professional intelligence officer.
Perhaps Zhang’s pool excuse was a quick and casual line to pass through the first security perimeter without many questions. Did she actually have a better cover story, or maybe a verifiable true story, she was able to present under more intense questioning? Zhang reportedly underwent 4&frac12; hours of questioning by the Secret Service. How did this go? What explanation did she give for her visit to Mar-a-Lago in this high-stakes setting? Did her explanation fit with answers she gave when applying for a visa to enter the country? Zhang reportedly traveled to the United States in 2016 and 2017. Does her explanation for those trips match information she gave when applying for a visa, and how do those trips fit with her current itinerary and actions?
If Zhang isn’t a spy, or up to other nefarious things, why is it that she “lies to everyone,” as the prosecutor said in court? Could she simply be confused or did she communicate poorly because English is not her native language? Investigators, particularly those who questioned her, know better than we do about Zhang’s command of English. The Miami Herald reported that she “appeared to speak English” to a lawyer in court and she took notes during the hearing, but a translator was also present.
How would Zhang have operated inside Mar-a-Lago?
The president’s vacation abode is a target-rich environment. There are the obvious marks: The president and his inner circle. But those people are hard to access. Better targets might be the multitudes of people at Mar-a-Lago who aren’t in the president’s inner circle but who have access to those who are and can influence and glean information from them.
A casual observer could also gather a load of information simply by being present at Mar-a-Lago. Who is there? Who is trying to get access and influence people? Who interacts with whom? What activities do they participate in? What schedule do they follow? This could help a foreign intelligence service target people for recruitment as assets. It could also tell a foreign intelligence service what other countries are running operations there and which individuals they are targeting using what methods. This is important counterintelligence information for any spy agency, a window into other countries’ priorities and how close they are to achieving them.
It’s also possible Zhang wanted to observe the security situation at the resort, laying the groundwork for some future operation. She might have witnessed how Secret Service and resort security worked (or didn’t work) together and how freely Trump and his people moved around, to determine what kind of access might be available.
Even without taking some deep cover, clandestine action, simply being present at Mar-a-Lago provides a wealth of information to anyone who is looking.
Or, maybe Zhang just wanted a glimpse of the president?
What’s with all the cash?
In some cases, espionage is a cash business. Spies often pay assets for information, and cold, hard cash is an easy way to pay people while hiding the source of the funds. Perhaps the Chinese government already has assets at Mar-a-Lago—among the staff, for example—and Zhang was there to pay them.
But Zhang’s more than $8,000 in U.S. and Chinese currency was found in her hotel room at the Colony Hotel about 2 miles from Mar-a-Lago, not on her person. Unless she planned to enter the resort a second time, it seems very unlikely she was there to pay an asset for information.
Some tourists do indeed travel with loads of cash. Although Zhang has a Wells Fargo account in the United States that she could have accessed. And that account raises new questions. When and why did she set up this account and how has she used it in the past? Is her use of this bank account consistent with the investor and consulting business she claims to run? Or did she set it up years ago in an attempt to build her cover story while laying the groundwork for an intelligence operation? Investigators will try to find answers to those questions.
Is this a spy’s collection of devices?
When she was picked up at Mar-a-Lago, Zhang was carrying four cellphones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive later found to carry malware. In her hotel room, investigators found nine USB drives, five SIM cards and a “signal detector” device, which could possibly be used to detect hidden cameras.
OK, that seems a little strange. It’s true that all kinds of professionals (including many in the financial sector) do go to great lengths to keep their activities secure from prying eyes or simply to separate out business activities and personal activities. Some people, for example, have a work phone and a private phone. And if someone travels internationally, they might have multiple SIM cards to allow them to have local phone numbers.
But an intelligence officer also might have multiple phones and SIM cards. Good spies follow the “one phone, one operation” rule. That is, they don’t call different assets using the same phone, because then they become linked, and key in any intelligence operation is to keep information compartmented. Much like you don’t want to send private texts on your work phone, you don’t want communications with multiple assets on a single device.
There is also the question of what kinds of phones these are. Are they burner phones, which are pay-as-you-go and not registered to an individual and therefore not easily traced to the purchaser and user? A spy would most likely use a burner phone. Or, maybe she was delivering burner phones to assets inside the resort to make communication easier? Or are these regular phones, registered in Zhang’s name or her company’s name? Investigators will certainly run traces on the phones and SIM cards to see if they link to anyone of interest or if they suggest a strange pattern of behavior, such as communicating with someone in a way that is meant to hide the contact.

‘When Deported, You Become Nothing’ By Raul Roman and Rafe H. Andrews
Thumb drives are pretty normal in business, but malware isn’t. The fact that the first thumb drive Secret Service looked at had malware on it does not look good for Zhang.
It’s possible that a spy would want to use malware to destroy a network at the resort. But a foreign intelligence service would more likely be interested in using it to gather useful information. There is very little chance (if any) that Zhang could have gotten the malware anywhere near a government computer. But to slip a program into the resort’s network that would allow an intelligence service to see guest lists, schedules and itineraries, room assignments, and who is coming and going? Yes, that would be of interest.
Is Zhang just one part of a larger spy scheme?
What the heck is the “United Nations Chinese Friendship Association”? This is perhaps the most intriguing part of Zhang’s story.
Zhang explained that she was at Mar-a-Lago to attend a “United Nations Friendship Event” and that she had been invited by a Chinese friend named “Charles.” As the Miami Herald reports, a Chinese national named Charles Lee promotes events at Mar-a-Lago through his United Nations Chinese Friendship Association, which has no actual ties to the United Nations. No such event was scheduled at Mar-a-Lago that day, however.
By the way, Li “Cindy” Yang , the former owner of a massage parlor that has been caught up in a sex trafficking sting who possibly sold access to Trump, promoted many of the same events as Lee. A spokeswoman for Yang told the Herald she has done nothing wrong.
Is Zhang a private individual who, like others, used the association to get into Mar-a-Lago to help her business? Or is Zhang an isolated case of Chinese intelligence using the association for the same purpose? Or worse, is the Chinese government using the “friendship association” and its travel packages to funnel spies into Mar-a-Lago (and perhaps elsewhere)?
This wouldn’t be unheard of: Intelligence agencies often use front companies or “associations” to make their activities look benign and disguise any involvement by the government.
In that case, it’s likely that Zhang’s arrest (along with scrutiny of Yang and Lee) just blew the association’s cover.
For now, it is impossible to say if Zhang was a confused tourist, who just wanted a glimpse of the president, or a bumbling Chinese intelligence officer whose cover story cracked. But one thing is for sure: Mar-a-Lago is target-rich environment for any real spy."
Trump team’s newest scapegoat: Don McGahn … Biden starts taking 2020 cash,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/04/20/trump-teams-newest-scapegoat-don-mcgahn-biden-starts-taking-2020-cash-426840,"Former White House counsel Don McGahn cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller's team of federal prosecutors. | Melina Mara-Pool/Getty Images DRIVING THE DAY THE LATEST MUELLER FALLOUT … DONALD VS. DON -- “Giuliani Attacks McGahn’s Account to Mueller,” by NYT’s Mike Schmidt and Maggie Haberman: “President Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, attacked the credibility of a former White House counsel on Friday, saying his account of how Mr. Trump told him to remove the special counsel was inaccurate. Mr. Giuliani’s statement was the most extensive pushback by the president’s lawyers against the former counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who cooperated extensively with the special counsel’s investigators. The report detailing the findings of the investigation, released on Thursday, also included several damning examples of how Mr. Trump tried to interfere with the investigation, like Mr. McGahn’s account.
“‘It can’t be taken at face value,’ Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. ‘It could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.’ Mr. McGahn’s lawyer, William A. Burck, pushed back on Mr. Giuliani’s attack. ‘It’s a mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to relitigate incidents the attorney general and deputy attorney general have concluded were not obstruction,’ Mr. Burck said. ‘But they are accurately described in the report.’” NYT
UP NEXT -- “After Mueller report, Democrats divided over end game — investigate Trump or impeach,” by WaPo’s Karoun Demirjian and Rachael Bade: “Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report gave House Democrats a road map for investigating President Trump and the cue they were waiting for — but the party was divided Friday over what, ultimately, should be their end game. In one camp, a faction of Democrats determined to pursue impeachment of Trump was emboldened by the report, seizing on Mueller’s detailed findings about 10 potential instances of obstruction of justice to revive calls for delivering the ultimate congressional censure.
“Ramping up the pressure for impeachment Friday were two presidential hopefuls — Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Julián Castro, former Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Obama administration. ‘The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,’ Warren said. ‘That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States.’” WaPo
TOP TWEETS -- @mj_lee: “Am told that Warren, who was flying back to Boston from Salt Lake City [Thursday], began reading the redacted Mueller report on the plane. She continued reading into the night after getting home, and when she was finished, felt it was her ‘duty’ publicly say what she just tweeted”.
-- Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti): “Warren just sent out an email to her supporter list explaining her call for Trump’s impeachment. Usually, such an email would end with a big fat DONATE button at the bottom. Not this one.”
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT … WARREN stepping up calls for impeachment comes as SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI and other Democratic leaders have tried to urge caution and tread carefully over whether to pursue impeachment. This will only increase pressure on Democratic leadership to take action.
MEANWHILE … DOWN IN MAR-A-LAGO -- @realDonaldTrump at 7:53 a.m.: “Despite the fact that the Mueller Report should not have been authorized in the first place & was written as nastily as possible by 13 (18) Angry Democrats who were true Trump Haters, including highly conflicted Bob Mueller himself, the end result is No Collusion, No Obstruction!”
… at 8:02 a.m.: “The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the Mueller Report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA. The Russia Hoax is dead!”
… at 8:07 a.m.: “United States weekly jobless claims just hit a 50 year low. The economy is doing GREAT!”
… at 8:15 a.m.: “The end result of the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history is No Collusion with Russia (and No Obstruction). Pretty Amazing!”
TRUMP has nothing on his public schedule today. He arrived at Trump International Golf Club at 9:04 a.m., per pooler Thomas Howell of the Washington Times.

Good Saturday morning. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- STEVE CLEMONS has been hired by The Hill to be editor-at-large and help expand the publication’s editorial platforms, particularly their events, write a biweekly column and take The Hill to more of a national level of prominence in the events space, according to two sources familiar with his hiring. He started this past week. He most recently was Washington editor-at-large at The Atlantic. Last month, Clemons was due to start a new job at Axios but didn’t end up joining the company after the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple reported that some AtlanticLIVE employees had some “unfortunate interactions” with him.
Clemons is also working on a book project that is looking at the political theater and drama of Washington politics and how Washington really works. He has described it to people as a hybrid of Mark Leibovich’s “This Town” and Eric Redman’s “Dance of Legislation.” Clemons, who does not have a publisher yet, has written a third of the book, which will take another year to complete. He declined to comment.

THE MONEY CHASE -- “Joe Biden Begins Taking Money for a 2020 Presidential Campaign,” by NYT’s Alex Burns and Shane Goldmacher: “Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has begun accepting financial donations for a 2020 presidential campaign, an unambiguous sign that he intends to begin his challenge to President Trump within days. Several Democratic donors and party fund-raisers received emails in recent days encouraging them to write sizable checks to support Mr. Biden’s planned candidacy, and to mail them to a Democratic consulting firm in Northern Virginia.
“Two fund-raising solicitations, circulated by Democratic donors in California and Pennsylvania, said Mr. Biden’s campaign committee would be called ‘Biden for President.’ … In an email to Democratic donors in the Philadelphia area earlier this week, David Cohen, a former party operative who is now a Comcast executive, outlined plans for a major fund-raising event in the city shortly after Mr. Biden’s announcement, likely in the middle of next week, and encouraged potential attendees to mail their checks to Mr. Biden’s operation even before he joins the race.” NYT

2020 WATCH … THE BIG QUESTION FOR DEMOCRATS: “Should a White Man Be the Face of the Democratic Party in 2020?” by NYT’s Astead W. Herndon and Matt Flegenheimer in Council Bluffs, Iowa
-- “Warren approaches breakout with black voters,” by Laura Barrón-López in Beaufort, S.C.: “When Elizabeth Warren got a question on housing discrimination at a campaign event this week, she went into full wonk mode — and the diverse crowd packed into a middle school auditorium ate it up.
“The Massachusetts senator launched into a brief history lesson on African-American homebuyers getting rejected outside of designated areas, black families getting hit hardest by subprime mortgages and foreclosures during the 2008 crash, and black homeownership still lagging far behind whites. ‘That’s a problem, and it’s a race problem,’ Warren thundered, emphasizing ‘race’ as the crowd erupted into applause. ‘And we need to attack it head on.’
“Warren is stuck in single digits in national polls and is getting overshadowed by white male rivals like Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. But her consistent attention to racial disparities — and her truck-full of policy proposals to fix them across every economic issue — is drawing praise from a critical voting bloc that could eventually pay dividends: African-Americans, and especially African-American women.” POLITICO
-- NATASHA KORECKI in Sioux City, Iowa: “‘The Democratic base is angry as hell’: Cory Booker’s message of love falls flat”: “Sen. Cory Booker launched a bid for the White House in February on a message of love and unity, painting himself as an inspirational leader who would help a polarized America find common ground. Just 10 weeks later, Booker is discovering that so far love just isn’t enough.
“Polling in the single digits and lagging top-tier competitors in fundraising, Booker this week sought to reboot his campaign, launching a ‘Justice For All’ two-week, national tour heavy on economic policy proposals and social justice messaging. In Iowa, he rolled out an expansive proposal for a new income tax credit and talked about the need for rural infrastructure investment. In Georgia, he unveiled a voting rights plan, vowing to make Election Day a national holiday and talked about restoring voting rights to ex-felons.
“The recent steps aim to invigorate a presidential bid that has underwhelmed some Democrats who are questioning whether Booker’s message is one that resonates in the Trump era.” POLITICO

“Bills approved by GOP-run legislatures in Montana and North Carolina this week would penalize health care providers for failing to care for an infant who survives an abortion attempt. The measures, which are also winding through legislatures in Texas and elsewhere, are being pushed by anti-abortion groups that quickly seized on bills in New York and Virginia aimed at loosening restrictions on third-trimester abortions.” POLITICO
DEEP DIVE -- “Pete Buttigieg Fired South Bend’s Black Police Chief. It Still Stings,” by NYT’s Trip Gabriel and Alex Burns in South Bend, Ind.: “Pete Buttigieg had been mayor just 13 weeks when he faced a leadership crisis. It was March 2012, and 300 residents of South Bend, Ind., solemnly marched to the Martin Luther King Center to protest the killing in Florida of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin. A prominent figure at the demonstration was Darryl Boykins, South Bend’s first black police chief. Admired for teaching tennis and boxing to young people, he had been promoted to chief five years earlier after winning the respect of both black and white officers in a department that sometimes divided along racial lines.
“Mr. Buttigieg addressed the protesters, but seemed not to interact with Mr. Boykins. What no one in the crowd knew was that the police top brass were in turmoil — shaken by allegations that Mr. Boykins had improperly taped phone calls of senior white officers who were said to have used racist language, including about him.” NYT
SPY GAMES -- “U.S. authorities make first arrest in mysterious raid of North Korea’s Embassy in Spain,” by WaPo’s John Hudson: “U.S. authorities have made the first arrest related to the mysterious raid of North Korea’s Embassy in Spain in which masked assailants tied up staff, stole computers and fled to the United States, according to two people familiar with the matter. On Thursday, federal authorities arrested Christopher Ahn, a former U.S. Marine and a member of Free Joseon, a group dedicated to the overthrow of North Korea’s Kim Dynasty.
“He appeared in a federal-district court in Los Angeles on Friday where his attorney requested that the case be sealed.

What's an interesting book/article you’re reading now or finished? And why? “The last book I really enjoyed was probably ‘ Killing Patton’ by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard. One of my grandfathers served in the Army Corps of Engineers in WWII following behind his army re-building bridges. I’ve always found Patton fascinating and it was a great read. We also read Ernest Cline’s ‘Ready Player One’ on audio book during a recent road trip, and it was a fun take for kids in the Fortnite era.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn't get enough attention? “The U.S. birth rate is at a 30-year low, and D.C.’s is the lowest in the country. In general, Americans are having kid(s) later, and are not currently keeping up with replacement rates. This trend impacts everything from workforce, to schools, to Social Security and other programs, but it doesn’t seem to get much attention. We have five boys (and a girl on the way), so are pretty attuned to the fact that we are an anomaly to this broader trend.”
How is the Trump presidency going? “I always appreciate the perspective I get when I talk to friends and family outside of the beltway bubble, in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania. The President has made great strides at growing the economy, cutting taxes, leveling the playing field for American workers, and implementing foreign policy strategies that make us more secure. These types of things positively impact Americans who aren’t following the day-to-day drama in D.C.”

Pope during Easter vigil: Reject the ‘glitter of wealth’ - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/20/pope-easter-vatican-glitter-wealth-1283780,"Pope during Easter vigil: Reject the ‘glitter of wealth’ By ASSOCIATED PRESS Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
VATICAN CITY — At an Easter vigil in St. Peter’s Basilica, Pope Francis on Saturday encouraged people to resist cynicism or pursuing the “glitter of wealth,” and to avoid seeking life’s meaning in “things that pass away.”
“Do not bury hope!” Francis exclaimed, after noting that when things go badly, “we lose heart and come to believe that death is stronger than life.” Story Continued Below
“We become cynical, negative and despondent,” Francis added.
For Christians, Easter is a day of joy and hope, as they mark their belief that Jesus triumphed over death by resurrection following crucifixion.
“Sin seduces; it promises things easy and quick, prosperity and success, but leaves behind only solitude and death,” the pope said. “Sin is looking for life among the dead, for the meaning of life in things that pass away.”
Encouraging the faithful, Francis said: “Why not prefer Jesus, the true light, to the glitter of wealth, career, pride and pleasure?” Playbook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

At the start of the ceremony on Easter’s eve, Francis, dressed in white robes, slowly carried a lit candle up the aisle of a darkened St. Peter’s Basilica. At the chant in Latin for “light of Christ, the basilica’s lights were suddenly switched on in a dramatic tradition.
Arrayed before the steps of the altar was a row of cardinals, wearing ivory robes. Behind them in the pews sat diplomats with their spouses and thousands of rank-and-file Catholics, tourists and pilgrims among them.
Among those in the basilica were eight adults who were baptized by the pope during the Mass. The Vatican said these new faithful are from Italy, Albania, Ecuador, Indonesia and Peru. From a shell-shaped silver dish, Francis poured holy water over the bowed heads of the three men and five women, after they walked up to him, one by one, and listened to him calling their first names.
On Sunday, Francis celebrates Easter Mass in late morning in St. Peter’s Square and gives a speech from the basilica balcony. Known by its Latin name “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and to the world), the speech is an occasion to reflect on the world’s war-ravaged and other tense spots while paying tribute to Catholics’ practicing their faith sometimes in the face of persecution or other difficulties.

Interior’s Bernhardt worked closely on matters he promised to avoid - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Annie Snider,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/21/david-bernhardt-water-law-interior-department-1370107,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt began working on policies that would aid one of his former lobbying clients within weeks of joining the Trump administration, according to a POLITICO analysis of agency documents — a revelation that adds to the ethics questions dogging his leadership of the agency.
Bernhardt’s efforts, beginning in at least October 2017, included shaping the department's response to a key portion of a water infrastructure law he had helped pass as a lobbyist for California farmers, recently released calendars show. The department offered scant details at the time about meetings that Bernhardt, then the deputy secretary, held with Interior officials overseeing water deliveries to the farmers, leading many observers to believe he was steering clear of the issues he had previously lobbied on.
Story Continued Below
But newly disclosed schedule ""cards"" prepared by Interior officials for Bernhardt show more than three dozen meetings with key players on California water issues, including multiple lengthy meetings on specific endangered species protections at the heart of his previous work. Those appointments were only vaguely identified on his official calendars.
Interior's inspector general is probing whether Bernhardt violated ethics rules by working on policies he had pushed as a lobbyist for the Westlands Water District, a job that earned his former firm more than $1.3 million in the five years before he returned to government service.
Bernhardt's ethics agreement barred him from participating in any ""particular matters"" involving Westlands until August 2018, one year after he arrived at the agency, and it was only after that recusal period ended that then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke publicly tasked him with working on California water issues. But the newly released information shows that Bernhardt had weighed in on discussions around Westlands' policy priorities for nearly a year by that point.
""They were creating the perception that he was not involved in these issues that his former client had a major stake in, when we now know he was deeply involved in them,” said Doug Obegi, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council who works on California water issues.
One previously undisclosed meeting likely to draw new scrutiny is a fall 2017 briefing on the implementation of the very provision of water law he won for the agricultural district after years of lobbying. The meeting adds to issues around Bernhardt's relationship with Westlands that have been flagged to the inspector general by outside groups like the Campaign Legal Center , a nonpartisan watchdog, and congressional Democrats.
""I think with this calendar entry saying that he sat in on a meeting that is actually implementing the precise regulation that he lobbied on, I mean, that is really, really problematic,"" said Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel for the Campaign Legal Center. "" You cannot participate in the development, the implementation, the interpretation, the application of the regulation in individual cases if you lobbied on it prior to joining government.""
Interior argues Bernhardt handled ethical matters diligently, and that information about Bernhardt’s meetings, including numerous ones with industry officials, was kept off his official calendars due to security concerns, scheduling and convenience.
“Secretary Bernhardt is in complete compliance with his ethics agreement and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,” spokesperson Faith Vander Voort said in a statement.
Transparency issues have dogged Bernhardt, who won Senate confirmation as secretary on April 11. Environmental groups and Democrats charge that the former lobbyist for energy and agricultural interests has failed to disclose who he has met with while shaping policy.
The National Archives and Records Administration has an ongoing investigation into whether the department violated the Federal Records Act by failing to keep detailed records of his meetings and actions.
From 2011 to 2016, Bernhardt lobbied Congress on various iterations of drought legislation aimed at relaxing endangered species protections that restrict pumping from California’s main water hub, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to farms and cities in central and southern California. Westlands, which delivers water to about 700 farmers in California's Central Valley, holds junior water rights on the federal water project and is among the first to see its deliveries curtailed when supplies are low. For that reason, the changes stood to benefit its farmers disproportionately.
Bernhardt deregistered as the group’s lobbyist in November 2016, although records show he continued to advise Westlands on legislation and other legal matters through at least April 2017 — the month President Donald Trump nominated him to be deputy secretary.
The final version of the drought legislation Bernhardt had lobbied on passed in December of 2016 as part of a broader water infrastructure bill, with the key California provisions directing Interior to take a looser interpretation of existing endangered species protections for a five year period.
Shortly after being confirmed as deputy interior secretary in July 2017, Bernhardt launched work on a process on the same endangered species and pumping issues that could bring an even bigger and longer-lasting win for Westlands.
In October 2017, Bernhardt's calendars show he had begun directing a series of specific steps to rewrite the underlying protections for the Delta smelt, a 3-inch-long fish that lives only in the Bay-Delta and which scientists say is teetering on the brink of extinction in large part because of water pumping. He also directed a rewrite of protections for winter-run Chinook salmon, which also restrict water exports. Those changes are aimed at cementing far looser species protections than the drought bill secured, and for years going forward.
Although Bernhardt was recused from working on “particular matters” affecting Westlands until August 2018, agency ethics officials gave him verbal approval to work on some issues that affect the agricultural district before then, including endangered species protections. But written guidance from the ethics officials did not come until this past February, more than a year after his calendars indicate he began work on those issues, and several days after a New York Times report on his involvement in Westlands-related policies.
The Interior Department ethics officials concluded that Bernhardt did not have to recuse himself from the process for rewriting endangered species protections. It said the steps he directed Interior to take were not “particular matters” because they affect parties beyond just Westlands.
But independent ethics officials disagree.
Virginia Canter, a long-time federal ethics attorney who now serves as chief ethics counsel at the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it does not appear that ethics officials got all the necessary details about Bernhardt’s work for Westlands before drafting what she described as a “very generic” memo.
She argued that the lack of detailed analysis in the ethics memo means it will offer Bernhardt less of a shield in the inspector general's investigation.
“This is a complicated issue,” she said. “ If he was relying in good faith on advice of an ethics official, there should be evidence of what advice he was given. It should have been documented either in a memo to him or a memo in the ethics department’s files. They have produced none of that evidence.”
The Interior ethics officials determined that the overall infrastructure bill does not qualify as a ""particular matter."" But Canter said that the fact that the drought provisions had previously been in stand-alone bills means they may have qualified as “particular matters” from which Bernhardt should be recused.
That Bernhardt could go, in less than a year, from lobbying on a specific provision for a client to directing its implementation “seems to undercut the very purpose of the ethics pledge,” Canter said.
Indeed, Bernhardt's calendars indicate he was directly involved in the provision's implementation, with a Nov. 22, 2017 briefing on “WIIN Act Winter Operations.” The highly controversial California drought provision governs pumping operations in the Delta during heavy rains, which occur primarily in the winter in California.
And while much of Westlands’ federal lobbying has focused on endangered species protections and Delta pumping operations, the district also has an interest in a number of other, interrelated California water issues in which Bernhardt has played a role. Those include former Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal to build a pair of massive tunnels under the Delta, the coordination of federal and state water project operations and a state plan to improve Delta water quality by requiring farms and cities to leave more water in the rivers.
Interior and state officials announced a grand bargain on some of these issues in late December, including a deal allowing the federal water project — which delivers water to Westlands and other largely agricultural users — to pump as much as 65 billion gallons more from the Delta, while requiring the state project — which serves largely municipal users — to pump an equal amount less.
The calendars also show that Bernhardt met with at least one Westlands farmer, Mark Turmon of Sierra Valley Almonds. That meeting, on Feb. 12, 2018, was about fires, Vander Voort said.
Another meeting, with former Westlands Board President Jean Sagouspe, appears on the calendars two weeks later, although both Interior and Sagouspe say it was canceled. Instead, Sagouspe said he met with Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman and Jason Larrabee, the political official overseeing the Fish and Wildlife Service — two key officials in the smelt protection rollbacks.
In February 2017, Sagouspe, a co-owner of Sierra Valley Almonds, published a column in the Wall Street Journal criticizing the “scorched-earth campaign by environmentalists” that restricts water deliveries to his farm. That column was published one day before Bernhardt, described as a member of the Trump transition team, spoke at a meeting of The Steamboat Institute, on whose board Sagouspe sits.

When the Washington Easter Egg Roll Was Chaos - POLITICO Magazine,www.politico.com,Jack Shafer,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/21/when-the-washington-easter-egg-roll-was-chaos-226669,"The White House Easter Egg Roll is upon us again, with its usual lighthearted fanfare and wholesome traditions. There will be bunny costumes, live music performances and senior government officials reading from picture books. And most of all, there will be lots and lots of children, with crowds expected to number up to 30,000. According to Smithsonian, it’s the largest annual White House event. While the modern tradition is closely associated with the presidency, Easter egg rolling in Washington started on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, beneath the shiny white shell of the Capitol dome. But the activity was once so scandalous and spun so far out of control that an angry Congress outlawed it on its turf. On Monday, if lawmakers look across the National Mall with envy of the president’s annual worry-free photo op, they have nobody to blame but their own predecessors.
Story Continued Below
Egg rolling originated hundreds of years ago in the United Kingdom, where, as an Easter tradition, children would take eggs, hard-boiled and decorated, to the top of an English hillside and compete to see whose would roll the farthest without cracking. Doing so on the U.S. government’s grass dates back to the 1870s, when extensions of the Capitol’s north and south wings were nearing completion and the western lawn was used for little more than construction staging. The building’s marble terrace did not yet exist, and Congress had just recently employed the consulting services of a young landscape architect by the name of Frederick Law Olmsted to beautify the area. It was a high-profile project, and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, Justin Morrill, admonished him “not to have it botched.”
It was on to this scene that hundreds and later thousands of children would annually descend in a demolition derby of egg-throwing chaos. While the modern White House egg roll is a tightly organized event, the early tradition was a much more informal affair. There were no permits, tickets or security to speak of. Newspapers would write of the hordes of unsupervised children that spontaneously converged on Capitol Hill, “racing, and tumbling and rolling, regardless alike of limbs and dress, or what nurses or mas’ said or thought. The sport was exhilarating, although the re-ascent and incidents of tumble and roll became so exciting that the shouts of laughter and the merry cries of comrade to comrade made a glad chorus which swelled along the line.”
The celebration of 1876 drew an unusually boisterous crowd, with a reporter for the National Republican describing the Capitol grounds as “thronged with lads and lassies, aye, and many older heads congregated to witness the pranks and capers of the boys and girls in rolling the eggs from the crest of the hill to the lawn below.” Poorly timed morning rainfall that year “had the effect of dampening the grass somewhat,” but could not deter the stampede of tiny feet sprinting across the soggy lawns.
The next day, lawmakers arrived at the Capitol to a scene resembling an abandoned carnival ground. Little bits of eggshells covered everything. Spoiled hard-boiled eggs attracted opportunistic birds and bugs. But worst off was the grass: The thousands of tiny foot prints had torn up the muddy lawn more effectively than a tractor.
Morrill was incensed and began drafting legislation the very same day.
“I suppose the great pleasure of seeing 10,000 children here on Easter Monday has prevented the police from doing their duty,” Morrill lamented on the Senate floor. “Although it is a very great pleasure to see these children enjoying themselves here on Easter Monday, it is deemed important that we should protect the grounds.”
Some of Morrill’s colleagues spoke up in favor of the children, noting that “they are generally from a class of citizens who have little opportunity for enjoying themselves.” Indeed, the annual event was celebrated by newspapers as “the festival of the poor” for being open to all races and classes. The chairman was adamant, however, about kicking the kids off Congress' backyard. Urging passage of his bill, Morrill insisted, “I know that the Russian government in the winter season provide places for their citizens to slide; but I hardly think it is proper that here, in the spring of the year, at so large an expense both of money and of the appearance of the public grounds, we should allow these terraces to be entirely ruined by the process that was witnessed last Monday.”
Morrill got his votes the next week, and President Ulysses Grant signed the following one-sentence Turf Protection Act into law.
“Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That it shall be the duty of the Capitol police hereafter to prevent any portion of the Capitol grounds and terraces to be used as play-grounds or otherwise, so far as may be necessary to protect the public property, turf and grass from destruction or injury.”
Olmsted had just the solution for what he deemed the “broken, confused and unsatisfactory” appearance of the Capitol grounds. A huge wraparound marble terrace constructed over the muddy embankment would eliminate the eyesore and would act as a visual pedestal for the building’s shiny new dome. This stunning platform and stairway would go on to host presidential inaugural activities and form the backdrop for millions of modern photographs.
The Egg Roll in 1877 was precluded by heavy rainfall, so the Turf Protection Act went untested by Washington children its first year. However, the next year, a few days before Easter, President Rutherford B. Hayes reportedly encountered a young boy while he was out walking. “Say! Say!” the child is said to have asked, “Are you going to let us roll eggs in your yard?” Uninformed about the tradition, the former Ohio governor responded: “I don’t know. I’ll have to see about that.” But by the time flocks of children appeared at the White House gates, having been just turned away from the Capitol grounds by police on Easter Monday morning, the president had already “good-humoredly instructed the officer in charge of the grounds to make no objection,” according to the New York Evening Post .
The same paper reported that the subsequent year another boy asked Hayes if the children could make his backyard their playground that Easter Monday, to which he expressed no objection. And by 1880, the Evening Post wrote, “the little people seem to have taken executive clemency for granted, for no small spokesman has accosted the president.” While 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. may not be as well-suited as the Hill to the original egg-rolling custom, the children did feel more welcome there, and successive presidents have continued the Easter tradition of playing host to the capital’s children on the South Lawn ever since—and probably will so as long as the now-142-year-old law remains in full force."
Meet the Democrats’ new voice on foreign policy,www.politico.com,ANDREW DESIDERIO,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/21/democrats-foreign-policy-tom-malinowski-1283785,"M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Continue to article content Facebook Twitter Email Comment Print Continue to article content SOMERVILLE, N.J. — It was a Friday in March at 5:00 p.m. on the dot. Rep. Tom Malinowski and I had just sat down in his largely empty temporary congressional office here when special counsel Robert Mueller informed Attorney General William Barr that his 22-month investigation was complete, prompting a dizzying whirlwind of speculation about what comes next.
Malinowski, a Democrat, took his iPhone out of his pocket to quickly glance at the update but appeared largely disinterested — and disappointed. He put his phone on his desk and immediately changed the subject to something that had happened a mere three hours ago and was clearly at the top of his mind.
Story Continued Below
President Donald Trump had just reversed — via tweet, no less — his own Treasury Department’s decision to impose new sanctions on North Korea, with the White House press secretary explaining that Trump personally “likes” Kim Jong Un and therefore believes the harsh new financial punishments would be unnecessary.
But suddenly, the world’s attention shifted to the news that Mueller had wrapped up his investigation, and to the attorney general’s sparse, four-page summary of Mueller’s findings. Trump’s stunning reversal of North Korea sanctions would soon be forgotten, a fact that clearly irked Malinowski, who was enraged by the president’s decision.
“We’re inured to this. The president ‘likes’ the leader of an adversary state and therefore will not take action against him?” Malinowski said soberly in his characteristic deep, monotone voice that he almost never raises. “You don’t wait for your Treasury Department to sanction people and then the next day theatrically overturn them. You don’t do that.”
Malinowski, 53, is just one of nearly 100 members of the freshman class in the House — but he’s quickly becoming one of the Democrats’ most influential voices on foreign policy, educating his fellow members about key issues and aggressively pushing the Trump administration to prioritize global human rights issues and re-orient its often chaotic foreign policy.
“He's brought to the committee a wealth of experience and a list of good ideas a mile long,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, one of Malinowski’s committee assignments. “He's going to play a big role in our work in the years ahead.""
It’s all the more surprising because Malinowski wasn’t supposed to be here. Born in Poland and having emigrated to the U.S. at age 6, he spent 12 years as a top official at Human Rights Watch before joining Barack Obama’s State Department as head of the bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor — hardly the usual launching pads for a congressional career. In the 2018 midterms, he narrowly defeated a GOP incumbent in a Republican-leaning central-north New Jersey district, winning in part by flipping longtime Republicans in a year that saw a “blue wave” react fervently to the president’s first 21 months in office.
Building a public profile around foreign policy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era. And in a freshman class that includes firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, it often seems impossible to jerk the media spotlight over to sobering topics like the incipient famine in Yemen. Yet that’s exactly what Malinowski is aiming to do — while assiduously tending to the needs of his constituents: Officially, his top issue is pushing for the construction of the proposed Gateway Tunnel linking New Jersey with Manhattan.
“You know my job in Congress: Dig a tunnel and save the world — in that order,” he often says, ranking his spot on the Transportation Committee above membership on the Foreign Affairs panel. But it’s clear that human rights — not bridges and tunnels — remains his true passion.
Calling out and punishing human-rights abusers is one of the few actions that routinely brings Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill — and Malinowski has a history of finding allies on the other side of the aisle. Over his years in Washington, he has cultivated relationships with Republicans like the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona, with whom he found common ground despite McCain’s stinging criticisms of Obama’s policies. They worked together during the George W. Bush administration to oppose the CIA’s use of enhanced interrogation tactics, and McCain vouched for Malinowski at his Senate confirmation hearing in September 2013. Malinowski highlighted McCain’s praise in a campaign advertisement shortly after the senator’s death.
The two men often butted heads over Obama’s foreign policy, even as they often agreed in private. Malinowski revealed to POLITICO that he worked behind the scenes to fight some of Obama’s most criticized foreign-policy decisions — most notably, the initial intervention into Yemen’s civil war by providing aid to Saudi Arabia despite the kingdom’s poor record on human rights, and Obama’s refusal to set up a no-fly zone over Syria despite his “red line” on chemical-weapons attacks.
McCain was, for decades, the go-to authority for congressional Republicans on foreign policy and national security matters — and a vocal critic of autocratic regimes. Democrats had their own hawkish eminence grise until his death in 2008: Rep. Tom Lantos of California, who, like Malinowski, grew up in the Eastern bloc and learned to despise Soviet-style governance. But few figures in either party command that kind of authority today — which presents an opportunity for someone with the gravitas and media-savvy to step into the vacuum.
In 2019, Republicans maintain a national-security edge over Democrats, though recent polls show that the gap is narrowing. Many on Capitol Hill believe the gap can be reversed entirely if Democrats can effectively take advantage of Trump’s disjointed and often haphazard approach to world affairs.
It seems unlikely a freshman House member who’s never held elected office before could become a real irritant to the White House on foreign policy — especially in an age when America is turning inward, consumed by debates over health care, inequality, race and immigration. And in this “Romney Republican” congressional district, there’s no guarantee that Malinowski will be able to stick around longer than just one term. In fact, he already has a viable Republican challenger for 2020: the son of former New Jersey governor Tom Kean.
But Malinowski is betting that Americans still care deeply about the world beyond their borders, and he projects more worry about the substance of Trump’s foreign policy — his praise for dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, his erratic Twitter statements on the use of nuclear weapons, his disdain for NATO — than he does about the politics.
“I think Americans still care. I think the State Department still cares. I think our armed forces still care,” he said.
“Every institution cares apart from the White House,” Malinowski added. “And unfortunately, the president speaks for the United States, so the world gets a warped impression of what the United States is all about right now because of one man. And that is consequential. But it can be reversed.”

For a freshman lawmaker who doesn’t dance on social media or tangle with the president over Israel, Malinowski’s ability to get attention is impressive. During a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, he cornered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the disconnect between the president calling out Venezuela’s socialist government while praising communist North Korea for its economic potential. The clip went viral on Twitter, causing many to ask: Who’s Tom Malinowski?
“If we’re going to be so forceful in denouncing socialism, why is the administration so high on communism?” Malinowski asked.
“Yeah, I mean, the very statement there is outrageous,” Pompeo responded, going on to defend the Trump administration's strict sanctions against Pyongyang.
“Why is ‘liking’ Kim Jong Un a sufficient reason to cancel or not to pursue sanctions against companies helping his nuclear program?” Malinowski retorted, referring to Trump’s reversal of Treasury-approved sanctions — the same decision that vexed Malinowski so much that he shrugged off the completion of the Mueller investigation.
He later brought up Trump’s glowing comments about Kim, and asked Pompeo if Kim is responsible for the country’s labor camps and the assassinations of his uncle and brother, among other human-rights abuses.
“He’s the leader of the country,” Pompeo said each time.
“What’s to ‘like’ about Kim Jong Un?” Malinowski pressed.
“Sir, don’t make this a political football. It’s inappropriate,” an angry Pompeo responded.
It hasn’t always been this easy for Malinowski to grab the spotlight, though. Only a few weeks into his tenure, he did something almost unheard of on Capitol Hill in the era of social media virality: He walked up to a reporter after a press conference and asked if the confused scribe had any more questions for him.
“Nothing bores me more than people complaining about press coverage and not getting attention,” he later explained. “It’s our job to do things that are worthy of attention. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job. And I’m satisfied that I’m getting my message out.”

Before I arrived at his office, Malinowski was preparing his remarks for a vigil later that night for the victims of the mosque attack in New Zealand, where a white supremacist gunned down 50 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch. As I walked into his office, he asked a staffer to find the names of the victims who were living in New Zealand as refugees.
Speaking in a gymnasium at Mount Olive High School later that night, Malinowski said those refugees came from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan because they thought they would be safe in New Zealand. Without mentioning Trump by name, Malinowski harangued politicians who employ language about an “invasion” of migrants — as Trump did the day after the shooting, in addition to during the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. At the vigil he implored attendees to “call out anyone in this country who uses language that is in any way similar to the language that those terrorists use.” The crowd did something that rarely happens at vigils: They stood up and applauded for nearly a minute before Malinowski could continue speaking.
“The shooter in New Zealand said exactly the same thing: Immigrants are invading Western countries,” Malinowski told me in his office. “And when the president responds the next day after the massacre in New Zealand by repeating that immigrants are invading America, that does not make people in my district feel more safe any more than they would have felt safe if Barack Obama had echoed the propaganda of ISIS after an ISIS attack. So this isn’t politics. This is serious business. This is about protecting our country and protecting our people. It’s about defending our law enforcement institutions, defending our intelligence community.”
He recently introduced a resolution condemning white-supremacist rhetoric and those who amplify or repeat it. The legislation doesn’t mention Trump specifically, but it’s an implicit dig at the president with a twist: The resolution almost entirely Quote: s conservative darling Ronald Reagan from his final speech as president. It was an address Malinowski described as a “love letter” to immigration. It’s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself.
“The idea would be to ask Republicans to choose between Reagan and Trump,” Malinowski said. “This is becoming a national security issue and I want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the American population in ways that are dangerous to all of us.”
“It’s scary,” he said at another point in our interview. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before in our country. And it’s a problem we’re going to be dealing with, I fear, after Trump is gone.”
***
As alarmed as Malinowski can sound about Trump, he finds himself in a curious political position: In his historically Republican district, he could not have won by bashing the president all the time. On domestic issues, he positions himself as a moderate Democrat, rejecting progressive goals like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal as irresponsible and unrealistic.
At the same time, he viewed 2018 as a turning point for the two political parties. In Malinowski’s view, Republicans had all but abandoned the core principles that Americans had instinctively associated with the party of Lincoln.
“I felt like I was running as the candidate of the party of patriotism in America, the party of law enforcement in America, the party that wants to defend our country against foreign adversaries, the party of family values — since our presidents don’t pay off porn stars while they’re in the White House,” he said. “These are all principles that used to be associated with the Republican Party. And I proudly embrace them and believe that my party stands for them today.”
The Democratic congressional campaign arm advised Malinowski that to win his race against Republican incumbent Leonard Lance, the safest thing to do was to run on the party’s health care message. Don’t take the bait, the Democratic strategists in Washington warned, on Trump’s late-stage rhetoric about a migrant caravan coming to “invade” the country.
The New Jersey Democrat ignored that counsel.
One of his final ads of the campaign cycle, titled “Rejecting Fear,” featured Malinowski explicitly pushing back on Trump’s closing message: “They want you scared — scared of your neighbors, scared of me.” Malinowski thinks the message resonated in part because of the ethnic diversity in New Jersey’s 7th congressional district, and the fact that 20 percent of its residents were born outside the U.S.
“Democrats can talk about these issues so long as we frame them in the right way,” Malinowski insisted to me. “I’m not an alarmist. I speak calmly and precisely about what’s happening in our country and to our community.”
***
Malinowski’s presence on Capitol Hill — particularly his perch on the Foreign Affairs Committee — irks some of his Republican colleagues.
“Anything to do with the horrid foreign policy of President Obama, it’s not healthy for our country so we can’t support that,” said Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a longtime member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, naming the Iran nuclear deal and other cornerstones of Obama’s foreign policy. “The bad policies that [Obama] did have really damaged this country.”
But Malinowski has also used his State Department experience to his advantage on the panel.
During a committee debate about a War Powers resolution to withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi coalition in Yemen , Republicans were arguing that the effort was ill-conceived because the U.S. is not engaged in “hostilities” in Yemen. Malinowski fired back, explaining that he was involved in the discussions when the Obama administration decided to get involved in Yemen in the first place. The Obama administration considered the U.S. to be formally engaged in hostilities in Yemen, Malinowski countered.

“If a foreign power was bombing Washington, D.C., and a second foreign power was refueling the first power’s aircraft over Chesapeake Bay on their way to drop ordinance on the Capitol building, we’d consider both countries to be at war with us, obviously,” Malinowski told me. “And if we’re refueling Saudi aircraft, if we’re servicing them on the tarmac, helping them get back into the air, we’re part of this conflict. And therefore need to make responsible decisions.”
Most — if not all — first-time members of Congress have never been in a classified briefing. Malinowski’s fellow freshman lawmakers often lean on his executive-branch experience when drawing their own conclusions. Every Democrat ended up voting in favor of the Yemen War Powers resolution , a remarkable and rare show of Democratic unity on a fraught foreign-policy issue.
“Witnesses can’t get things by him,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a fellow Foreign Affairs Committee member. “He’s able to provide a lot of knowledge for the members of the committee, but he also uses it on the floor.”
***
Despite the GOP criticisms, Malinowski is far from an Obama sycophant. During his tenure as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, he was often a dissenting voice among the Obama foreign policy brass. Republicans like McCain took notice.
“We fought together in the trenches to do something that we both passionately believed in,” Malinowski said of his work with McCain on banning the use of torture. “He won my lifelong loyalty and admiration in that fight.”
But McCain, an ardent critic of Obama’s foreign policy, often used Malinowski as a punching bag to vent about what he viewed as a disjointed and dangerous series of foreign-policy decisions — including the last time they saw each other, in McCain’s Senate office in 2017.
“He reamed me out about my support for banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia. He said, ‘Are you one of those people who think we should stop selling [precision-guided munitions] to Saudi Arabia?’ And he gave me a look that could kill,” Malinowski said with a laugh. “I tried to shift the subject as quickly as I could.”
“I loved him. And he liked a good fight and always — he jumped into the toughest fights and was never afraid of taking a strong position on a difficult issue. And I try to be the same way. And sometimes that meant we were on opposing sides. And it did not and could not have affected our friendship.”
Malinowski actually agreed with one of McCain’s central critiques of Obama’s foreign policy: that the U.S. should have done more to stem the bloodshed in Syria after Obama’s so-called “red line.” But Malinowski, who at the time was a senior official on the president’s national security team, couldn’t project his views publicly; instead, he tried to change Obama’s course from the inside.
“When I was working with the president, for the president, I made my opinions known in a way that one responsibly does as a member of the administration,” he said.
On Syria, though, Malinowski completely struck out. Obama was reluctant to do anything that would drag the U.S. into a prolonged conflict in the region, even as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was deploying chemical weapons on his own people. Malinowski wanted to set up a no-fly zone well before Russia staged a military intervention in 2015; the idea would have been to prevent Syrian fighter jets from flying over cities like Aleppo and threaten to shoot down aircraft that crossed into opposition-held areas. But once the Russians got involved, all bets were off.
Malinowski argues that had his view prevailed, the cascading and disastrous global effects of the Syrian civil war would have been mitigated — even prevented.
“The 5 million refugees, the rise of ISIS, chemical weapons attacks, the Russian intervention — I think we had a chance to prevent those things, and they had an impact well beyond Syria,” Malinowski said. “I don’t think Brexit would have happened if not for Syrian refugees flooding Europe and creating this fear of an immigrant invasion. It affected our politics in ways that can’t be quantified, but it certainly affected our politics. The fear of ISIS and the fear of refugees have been a powerful driver in western politics for the last few years. And both of those problems came to us courtesy of Syria.”
***
Searing foreign-policy dilemmas like Syria — when, and how, America should intervene abroad — have been dividing the Democratic Party for generations. During the Cold War, the left clashed with hawks like Washington Sen. Henry “Scoop” Jackson over how seriously to take the Soviet threat; after the Cold War ended, it was conflicts like Bosnia and Iraq that fueled heated intra-party debates. But even though Trump has scrambled the usual trench lines on national security through his mix of isolationism and pugnacious nationalism, the Democratic Party is surprisingly unified on these issues — for now.
House Democrats would be wise to take advantage of that unity, Malinowski argues, especially as the liberal firebrands fuel intra-party divisions that often grab headlines and drive unfavorable media coverage of the House Democratic majority.
His advice: Eyes on the prize.
“We have the same basic vision for the general direction the country should go in,” Malinowski told me in closing. “We have interesting differences about how to do it. But those differences are not going to play out in a meaningful way in the House in the next two years. Because Donald Trump is the glue that holds us all together. We know the country’s in crisis. We know that this is not a time for transforming America. This is a time for saving America, preserving America. And there will be plenty of time, if we succeed in preserving our institutions, preserving our democracy, there will be plenty of time in the coming years to argue about differences in policy.”"

“Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena, who described the blasts as a terrorist attack by religious extremists, told reporters Sunday evening that seven suspects had been arrested, though no one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he feared the violence could trigger instability in the country and its economy.” AP

SUNDAY BEST -- CHUCK TODD spoke with RUDY GIULIANI on NBC NEWS’ “MEET THE PRESS”: TODD: “Let me start with some of the front line conclusions from the report itself, which is square one. The first one is this. ‘The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systemic fashion.’ Do you and the president accept that as a fact from this report?” GIULIANI: “We do. There’s no reason not to accept it.” TODD: “And the president accepts it as well?” GIULIANI: “I’m sure he does.”
TODD: “All right. The next fact they put in here is this one. ‘The special counsel’s investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two opportunities. First, a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.’ Do you and the president accept the idea that the Russian interference was designed to help President Trump?” GIULIANI: “I believe it was. I can’t tell you for sure. I mean, I haven’t examined all that evidence. But I have no reason--” TODD: “Does the president accept that?” GIULIANI: “No reason to dispute it. I think he does.”
-- JAKE TAPPER also spoke with GIULIANI on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: GIULIANI: “Any candidate in the whole world in America would take information … negative [information].” TAPPER: “From a foreign source, from a hostile foreign source?” GIULIANI: “Who says it’s even illegal.”
-- MARTHA RADDATZ interviewed KELLYANNE CONWAY on ABC NEWS’ “THIS WEEK”: RADDATZ: “You have seen what the Mueller team concluded and I want to go to that ending line, while the -- this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him. So how does the president call this complete exoneration?”
CONWAY: “The president says that because he’s known from the beginning that there was no collusion. There’s no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin to try to disrupt and spread disinformation about our elections, and that really was the central premise here.”
-- RADDATZ also spoke with HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN ADAM SCHIFF (D-CALIF.): RADDATZ: “Congressman Schiff, Kellyanne Conway has said you should resign as committee chair, I assume you will not. But what about the evidence? You just heard her, you have said there is ample and abundant evidence of collusion leaving the very strong impression there was illegal activity.”
SCHIFF: “Well, you heard another display of alternate facts from Kellyanne Conway today where she could not even acknowledge that the Russians tried to help the Trump campaign and did provide substantial help to the campaign. But look, I’ve been very clear [for a] year, year and a half, that there is ample evidence of collusion in plain sight.
“And I use that word very carefully because I also distinguish time and time again between collusion, that is acts of corruption that may or may not be criminal, and proof of a criminal conspiracy. And that is a distinction that Bob Mueller made within the first few pages of his report. In fact, every act that I’ve pointed to as evidence of collusion has now been borne out by the report.”
-- CHRIS WALLACE also spoke with SCHIFF: @FoxNewsSunday: “.@RepAdamSchiff on impeachment: I think it’s a very difficult decision and we’re going to have a caucus about this over the next couple of weeks to try to figure out what the best course is, not for the party, but what’s the best course for the country. #FNS”
MORE MUELLER FALLOUT -- “Mueller Witnesses Who Once Served in White House Now Fear Trump’s Ire,” by NYT’s Mike Schmidt and Maggie Haberman: “[S]ome of the witnesses named in the report, who have departed the White House but rely on access to Mr. Trump for their livelihoods, fear his ire. Some have begun calling current and former administration officials and others in the president’s orbit to seek clues about Mr. Trump’s state of mind, according to four special counsel witnesses who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
“One called friends and colleagues in the days before the report was released to see whether he could have the Justice Department redact his name from Mr. Mueller’s report, according to two people told of the matter. The idea went nowhere.” NYT
NYT’S PETER BAKER: “‘I Do Not Remember’: Trump Gave a Familiar Reply to the Special Counsel’s Queries”: “The answers Mr. Trump provided sounded more like lawyer speak than the blunt-talking president’s usual colorful language.

“‘If @MittRomney spent the same energy fighting Barack Obama as he does fighting Donald Trump, he could have won the race (maybe)!’ Trump tweeted. Attached to the president’s post was a 40-second video contrasting election night footage and CNN news coverage from Romney’s White House loss six-and-a-half years ago to Obama with Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was unclear whether the White House produced the brief clip, or if it was crafted by one of the president’s supporters.” POLITICO

TICK TOCK – “How Michael Cohen Turned Against President Trump ,” by NYT’s Ben Protess, William K. Rashbaum and Maggie Haberman: “Michael D. Cohen was at a breaking point. He told friends he was suicidal. He insisted to lawyers he would never go to jail. Most of all, he feared that President Trump, his longtime boss, had forsaken him. ‘Basically he needs a little loving and respect booster,’ one of Mr. Cohen’s legal advisers at the time, Robert J. Costello, wrote in a text message to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s lead lawyer. ‘He is not thinking clearly because he feels abandoned.’ That was last June. The ‘booster’ from Mr. Trump never arrived.
“And by August, Mr. Cohen’s relationship with him had gone from fraught to hostile, casting a shadow on the Trump presidency and helping drive multiple criminal investigations into the president’s inner circle, including some that continued after the special counsel’s work ended. ... Now, as Mr. Cohen prepares to head to prison in two weeks, dozens of previously unreported emails, text messages and other confidential documents reviewed by The New York Times suggest that his falling out with Mr. Trump may have been avoidable.
“Missed cues, clashing egos, veiled threats and unaddressed money worries all contributed to Mr. Cohen’s halting decision to turn on a man he had long idolized and even once vowed to take a bullet for, according to the documents and interviews with people close to the events.” NYT

HEATHER CAYGLE and LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: “‘How do we make amends?’: House Dems debate reparations”: “Democrats have sidestepped the debate over reparations for African-Americans for decades. But now the issue is bubbling up in the House, and the new majority is wrestling with how to tackle it ahead of the 2020 campaign. Sparked in part by the support of several presidential contenders, the topic has been discussed multiple times by top House Democrats, including at their retreat in the exurbs of Virginia earlier this month. But the issue is likely to divide the party — not just by race, but by generation.
“The Congressional Black Caucus is notably split, with some younger African-American lawmakers clamoring to force the conversation into the open while more senior members worry about alienating moderate voters.” POLITICO
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- ANNIE SNIDER: “Interior’s Bernhardt worked closely on matters he promised to avoid”: “Interior Secretary David Bernhardt began working on policies that would aid one of his former lobbying clients within weeks of joining the Trump administration, according to a POLITICO analysis of agency documents — a revelation that adds to the ethics questions dogging his leadership of the agency.
“Bernhardt’s efforts, beginning in at least October 2017, included shaping the department’s response to a key portion of a water infrastructure law he had helped pass as a lobbyist for California farmers, recently released calendars show. The department offered scant details at the time about meetings that Bernhardt, then the deputy secretary, held with Interior officials overseeing water deliveries to the farmers, leading many observers to believe he was steering clear of the issues he had previously lobbied on.” POLITICO
CASH DASH -- “Republican National Committee raises $15.5 million in March,” by Maggie Severns: “The [RNC] raised $15.5 million in March and spent almost as much — $13.5 million — as the committee prepares for the campaign for President Donald Trump’s reelection.
“The RNC ended the month with $33.1 million cash on hand. It has raised close to $46 million this year, a staggering sum compared to the [DNC], which has not yet released its fundraising totals for the month of March but had raised $12.7 million as of the end of February.” POLITICO
2020 WATCH -- “For Bernie Sanders, 2016 gets in the way of 2020,” by WaPo’s Sean Sullivan: “[T]here is growing uncertainty among Democrats about the Vermont independent’s desire to unite a party whose fissures have deepened and multiplied since his insurgent campaign against Hillary Clinton. In key respects, Sanders has been unable or unwilling to move beyond that bruising race, a posture that gives him a kinship with President Trump but has limited his embrace by Democrats. He frequently revisits his biggest 2016 triumphs and obstacles in speeches.
“He recently criticized a Democratic-leaning think tank helmed by a Clinton ally, in part because of its conduct in 2016. And he has kept Clinton and other prominent Democrats at a distance, vexing some associates who hoped warmer relations would send a positive signal across the party.” WaPo

HMM -- “Claims of Shoddy Production Draw Scrutiny to a Second Boeing Jet: Workers at a 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina have complained of defective manufacturing, debris left on planes and pressure to not report violations,” by NYT’s Natalie Kitroeff and David Gelles in North Charleston, S.C.: “When Boeing broke ground on its new factory near Charleston in 2009, the plant was trumpeted as a state-of-the-art manufacturing hub, building one of the most advanced aircraft in the world.
“But in the decade since, the factory, which makes the 787 Dreamliner, has been plagued by shoddy production and weak oversight that have threatened to compromise safety. A New York Times review of hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records, as well as interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees, reveals a culture that often valued production speed over quality.
“Facing long manufacturing delays, Boeing pushed its work force to quickly turn out Dreamliners, at times ignoring issues raised by employees. Complaints about the frenzied pace echo broader concerns about the company in the wake of two deadly crashes involving another jet, the 737 Max. Boeing is now facing questions about whether the race to get the Max done, and catch up to its rival Airbus, led it to miss safety risks in the design, like an anti-stall system that played a role in both crashes.” NYT
BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “Capitalism in crisis: U.S. billionaires worry about the survival of the system that made them rich,” by WaPo’s Greg Jaffe in Palo Alto: “For the first time in decades, capitalism’s future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America’s business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.” WaPo
BORDER TALES -- “The Stay Here Center: A U.S.-funded school gives young Guatemalans job skills to find success in their own country. Will it keep them from migrating north?” by WaPo’s Kevin Sieff in Santa Maria Visitacion, Guatemala: “The United States spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year on programs such as the Stay Here Center, aimed at improving the lives of would-be migrants in their own communities so they don’t leave home in the first place. It’s the softer side of migration enforcement: rehabilitation programs for prisoners in El Salvador, business training for young Hondurans, funding for the corn and bean farmers of Guatemala.” WaPo
-- “Trump administration says immigrants working in legal marijuana industry lack ‘moral character’ for citizenship,” by WaPo’s Colby Itkowitz: “Immigrants who use marijuana or who work in the cannabis industry can be denied citizenship, even if they are doing so in states where it is legal, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Friday. The guidance, issued — coincidentally or not — just before pot advocates’ national celebration of their 4/20 holiday, confirms what immigration and marijuana advocates have cautioned is a legal gray area that penalizes would-be citizens because they’ve broken a federal law.” WaPo

M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Meet the Democrats’ New Voice on Foreign Policy Tom Malinowski is an unlikely member of Congress. But he's fast becoming a force on Capitol Hill. Continue to article content
SOMERVILLE, N.J. — It was a Friday in March at 5:00 p.m. on the dot. Rep. Tom Malinowski and I had just sat down in his largely empty temporary congressional office when special counsel Robert Mueller informed Attorney General William Barr that his 22-month investigation was complete, prompting a dizzying whirlwind of speculation about what comes next.
Malinowski, a Democrat, took his iPhone out of his pocket to glance at the update but appeared largely uninterested — and disappointed. He put his phone on his desk and changed the subject to something that had happened a mere three hours ago and was at the top of his mind. Story Continued Below
President Donald Trump had just reversed — via tweet, no less — his own Treasury Department’s decision to impose new sanctions on North Korea, with the White House press secretary saying Trump “likes” Kim Jong Un and therefore believes the harsh financial punishments would have been unnecessary.
But suddenly, the world’s attention shifted to the news that Mueller had wrapped up his investigation and the attorney general’s sparse, four-page summary of Mueller’s findings. Trump’s stunning reversal of North Korea sanctions would soon be forgotten, a fact that irked Malinowski, who was enraged by the president’s decision.
“We’re inured to this. The president ‘likes’ the leader of an adversary state and therefore will not take action against him?” Malinowski said in his characteristic deep, monotone voice that he almost never raises. “You don’t wait for your Treasury Department to sanction people and then the next day theatrically overturn them. You don’t do that.”
Malinowski, 53, is just one of nearly 100 members of the freshman class in the House — but he’s quickly becoming one of Democrats’ most influential voices on foreign policy, educating his fellow members about key issues and aggressively pushing the Trump administration to prioritize global human rights issues and reorient its often chaotic foreign policy.
“He's brought to the committee a wealth of experience and a list of good ideas a mile long,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Malinowski sits. “He's going to play a big role in our work in the years ahead.""
It’s all the more surprising because Malinowski wasn’t supposed to be here. Born in Poland and having immigrated to the U.S. at 6, he spent 12 years as a top official at Human Rights Watch before joining Barack Obama’s State Department as head of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor — hardly the usual launching pads for a congressional career. In the 2018 midterms, he narrowly defeated a GOP incumbent in a Republican-leaning central-north New Jersey district, winning in part by flipping longtime Republicans in a year that saw a “blue wave” reaction to the president’s first 21 months in office.
Building a public profile around foreign-policy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era. And in a freshman class that includes firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, it often seems impossible to jerk the media spotlight over to sobering topics like the famine in Yemen. Yet that’s exactly what Malinowski is aiming to do — while assiduously tending to the needs of his constituents: Officially, his top issue is pushing for the construction of the proposed Gateway Tunnel linking New Jersey with Manhattan.
“You know my job in Congress: Dig a tunnel and save the world — in that order,” he often says, ranking his spot on the Transportation Committee above membership on the Foreign Affairs panel. But it’s clear that human rights — not bridges and tunnels — remains his true passion.
Calling out and punishing human-rights abusers is one of the few actions that brings Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill — and Malinowski has a history of finding allies on the other side of the aisle. Over his years in Washington, he has cultivated relationships with Republicans like the late Senator John McCain of Arizona, with whom he found common ground despite McCain’s stinging criticisms of Obama’s policies. They worked together during the George W. Bush administration to oppose the CIA’s use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", and McCain vouched for Malinowski at his Senate confirmation hearing in September 2013. Malinowski highlighted McCain’s praise in a campaign advertisement shortly after the senator’s death.
The two men often butted heads over Obama’s foreign policy, even as they often agreed in private. Malinowski revealed to POLITICO that he worked behind the scenes to fight some of Obama’s most criticized foreign-policy decisions — most notably, the initial intervention into Yemen’s civil war by providing aid to Saudi Arabia despite the kingdom’s poor record on human rights and Obama’s refusal to set up a no-fly zone over Syria despite his “red line” on chemical-weapons attacks.
McCain was, for decades, the go-to authority for congressional Republicans on foreign policy and national security matters — and a vocal critic of autocratic regimes. Democrats had their own hawkish eminence grise until his death in 2008: Rep. Tom Lantos of California, who, like Malinowski, grew up in the Eastern bloc and learned to despise Soviet-style governance. But few figures in either party command that kind of authority today — which presents an opportunity for someone with the gravitas and media savvy to step into the vacuum.
In 2019, Republicans maintain a national security edge over Democrats, though recent polls show that the gap is narrowing. Many on Capitol Hill believe the gap can be reversed if Democrats can take advantage of Trump’s disjointed and often haphazard approach to world affairs.
It seems unlikely a freshman House member who’s never held elected office before could become a real irritant to the White House on foreign policy — especially in an age when America is turning inward, consumed by debates over health care, inequality, race and immigration. And in this “Romney Republican” congressional district, there’s no guarantee that Malinowski will be able to stick around longer than just one term. In fact, he already has a viable Republican challenger for 2020: the son of former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean.
But Malinowski is betting that Americans still deeply care about the world beyond their borders, and he projects more worry about the substance of Trump’s foreign policy — his praise for dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim, his erratic Twitter statements on the use of nuclear weapons, his disdain for NATO — than politics.
“I think Americans still care. I think the State Department still cares. I think our armed forces still care,” he said.
“Every institution cares apart from the White House,” Malinowski added. “And unfortunately, the president speaks for the United States, so the world gets a warped impression of what the United States is all about right now because of one man. And that is consequential. But it can be reversed.” ***
For a freshman lawmaker who doesn’t dance on social media or tangle with the president over Israel, Malinowski’s ability to get attention is impressive. During a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, he cornered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the disconnect between the president calling out Venezuela’s socialist government and his praising communist North Korea for its economic potential. The clip went viral on Twitter, causing many to ask: Who’s Tom Malinowski?
“If we’re going to be so forceful in denouncing socialism, why is the administration so high on communism?” Malinowski asked.
“Yeah, I mean, the very statement there is outrageous,” Pompeo responded, going on to defend the Trump administration's strict sanctions on Pyongyang.
“Why is ‘liking’ Kim Jong Un a sufficient reason to cancel or not to pursue sanctions against companies helping his nuclear program?” Malinowski retorted, referring to Trump’s reversal of Treasury-approved sanctions — the same decision that vexed Malinowski so much that he shrugged off the completion of the Mueller investigation.
He later brought up Trump’s glowing comments about Kim and asked Pompeo if Kim is responsible for the country’s labor camps and the assassinations of his uncle and brother, among other human rights abuses.
“He’s the leader of the country,” Pompeo said each time.
“What’s to ‘like’ about Kim Jong Un?” Malinowski pressed.
“Sir, don’t make this a political football. It’s inappropriate,” Pompeo responded.
It hasn’t always been this easy for Malinowski to grab the spotlight, though. Only a few weeks into his tenure, he did something almost unheard of on Capitol Hill in the era of social media virality: He walked up to a reporter after a news conference and asked if the confused scribe had any more questions for him.
“Nothing bores me more than people complaining about press coverage and not getting attention,” he later said. “It’s our job to do things that are worthy of attention. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job. And I’m satisfied that I’m getting my message out.” ***
Before I arrived at his office, Malinowski was preparing his remarks for a vigil later that night for the victims of the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a white supremacist killed 50 Muslim worshippers and wounded dozens more. As I walked into his office, he asked a staffer to find the names of the victims who were living in New Zealand as refugees.
Speaking in a gymnasium at Mount Olive High School later that night, Malinowski said those refugees came from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan because they thought they would be safe in New Zealand. Without mentioning Trump by name, Malinowski harangued politicians who employ language about an “invasion” of migrants — as Trump had the day after the shootings and during the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. At the vigil, he implored attendees to “call out anyone in this country who uses language that is in any way similar to the language that those terrorists use.” The crowd did something that rarely happens at vigils: It stood up and applauded for nearly a minute before Malinowski could continue speaking.
“The shooter in New Zealand said exactly the same thing: Immigrants are invading Western countries,” Malinowski told me in his office. “And when the president responds the next day after the massacre in New Zealand by repeating that immigrants are invading America, that does not make people in my district feel more safe any more than they would have felt safe if Barack Obama had echoed the propaganda of ISIS after an ISIS attack. So this isn’t politics. This is serious business. This is about protecting our country and protecting our people. It’s about defending our law enforcement institutions, defending our intelligence community.”
He recently introduced a resolution condemning white supremacist rhetoric and those who amplify or repeat it. The legislation doesn’t mention Trump specifically, but it’s an implicit dig at the president with a twist: The resolution almost entirely consists of quotes from conservative darling Ronald Reagan's final speech as president. It was an address Malinowski described as a “love letter” to immigration. It’s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself.
“The idea would be to ask Republicans to choose between Reagan and Trump,” Malinowski said. “This is becoming a national security issue and I want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the American population in ways that are dangerous to all of us.”
“It’s scary,” he said at another point in our interview. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before in our country. And it’s a problem we’re going to be dealing with, I fear, after Trump is gone.” ***
As alarmed as Malinowski can sound about Trump, he finds himself in a curious political position: In his historically Republican district, he could not have won by bashing the president all the time. On domestic issues, he positions himself as a moderate Democrat, rejecting progressive goals like ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal"" as irresponsible and unrealistic.
At the same time, he viewed 2018 as a turning point for the two political parties. In Malinowski’s view, Republicans had all but abandoned the core principles that Americans had associated with the party of Lincoln.
“I felt like I was running as the candidate of the party of patriotism in America, the party of law enforcement in America, the party that wants to defend our country against foreign adversaries, the party of family values — since our presidents don’t pay off porn stars while they’re in the White House,” he said. “These are all principles that used to be associated with the Republican Party. And I proudly embrace them and believe that my party stands for them today.”
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advised Malinowski that to win his race against Republican incumbent Leonard Lance, the safest thing to do was to run on the party’s health care message. Don’t take the bait, the Democratic strategists in Washington warned, on Trump’s late-stage rhetoric about a migrant caravan coming to “invade” the country.
The New Jersey Democrat ignored that counsel.
One of his final ads of the campaign cycle, titled “Rejecting Fear,” featured Malinowski explicitly pushing back on Trump’s closing message: “They want you scared — scared of your neighbors, scared of me.” Malinowski thinks the message resonated in part because of the ethnic diversity in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District and the fact that 20 percent of its residents were born outside the U.S.
“Democrats can talk about these issues so long as we frame them in the right way,” Malinowski insisted to me. “I’m not an alarmist. I speak calmly and precisely about what’s happening in our country and to our community.” ***
Malinowski’s presence on Capitol Hill — particularly his perch on the Foreign Affairs Committee — irks some of his Republican colleagues.
“Anything to do with the horrid foreign policy of President Obama, it’s not healthy for our country so we can’t support that,” said Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a longtime member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, naming the Iran nuclear deal and other cornerstones of Obama’s foreign policy. “The bad policies that [Obama] did have really damaged this country.”
But Malinowski has also used his State Department experience to his advantage on the panel.
During a committee debate about a War Powers Resolution to withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen , Republicans were arguing that the effort was ill-conceived because the U.S. is not engaged in “hostilities” in Yemen. Malinowski fired back, explaining that he was involved in the discussions when the Obama administration decided to get involved in Yemen in the first place. The Obama administration considered the U.S. to be formally engaged in hostilities in Yemen, Malinowski countered.

“If a foreign power was bombing Washington, D.C., and a second foreign power was refueling the first power’s aircraft over Chesapeake Bay on their way to drop ordnance on the Capitol building, we’d consider both countries to be at war with us, obviously,” Malinowski told me. “And if we’re refueling Saudi aircraft, if we’re servicing them on the tarmac, helping them get back into the air, we’re part of this conflict. And therefore need to make responsible decisions.”
Most — if not all — first-time members of Congress have never been in a classified briefing. Malinowski’s fellow freshman lawmakers often lean on his executive branch experience when drawing their own conclusions. Every Democrat ended up voting in favor of the Yemen War Powers Resolution , a remarkable and rare show of Democratic unity on a fraught foreign-policy issue.
“Witnesses can’t get things by him,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a fellow Foreign Affairs Committee member. “He’s able to provide a lot of knowledge for the members of the committee, but he also uses it on the floor.” ***
Despite the GOP criticisms, Malinowski is far from an Obama sycophant. During his tenure as assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor, he was often a dissenting voice among the Obama foreign-policy brass. Republicans like McCain took notice.
“We fought together in the trenches to do something that we both passionately believed in,” Malinowski said of his work with McCain on banning the use of torture. “He won my lifelong loyalty and admiration in that fight.”
But McCain, an ardent critic of Obama’s foreign policy, often used Malinowski as a punching bag to vent about what he viewed as a disjointed and dangerous series of foreign-policy decisions — including the last time they saw each other, in McCain’s Senate office in 2017.
“He reamed me out about my support for banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia. He said, ‘Are you one of those people who think we should stop selling [precision-guided munitions] to Saudi Arabia?’ And he gave me a look that could kill,” Malinowski said with a laugh. “I tried to shift the subject as quickly as I could.”
“I loved him. And he liked a good fight and always — he jumped into the toughest fights and was never afraid of taking a strong position on a difficult issue. And I try to be the same way. And sometimes that meant we were on opposing sides. And it did not and could not have affected our friendship.”
Malinowski agreed with one of McCain’s central critiques of Obama’s foreign policy: that the U.S. should have done more to stanch the bloodshed in Syria after Obama’s “red line.” But Malinowski, who at the time was a senior official on the president’s national security team, couldn’t project his views publicly; instead, he tried to change Obama’s course from the inside.
“When I was working with the president, for the president, I made my opinions known in a way that one responsibly does as a member of the administration,” he said.
On Syria, though, Malinowski struck out. Obama was reluctant to do anything that would drag the U.S. into a prolonged conflict in the region, even as Syrian President Bashar Assad was deploying chemical weapons on his own people. Malinowski wanted to set up a no-fly zone well before Russia staged a military intervention in 2015; the idea would have been to prevent Syrian fighter jets from flying over cities like Aleppo and threaten to shoot down aircraft that crossed into opposition-held areas. But once the Russians got involved, all bets were off.
Malinowski argues that had his view prevailed, the cascading and disastrous global effects of the Syrian civil war would have been mitigated — even prevented.
“The 5 million refugees, the rise of ISIS, chemical weapons attacks, the Russian intervention — I think we had a chance to prevent those things, and they had an impact well beyond Syria,” Malinowski said. “I don’t think Brexit would have happened if not for Syrian refugees flooding Europe and creating this fear of an immigrant invasion. It affected our politics in ways that can’t be quantified, but it certainly affected our politics. The fear of ISIS and the fear of refugees have been a powerful driver in Western politics for the last few years. And both of those problems came to us courtesy of Syria.” ***
Searing foreign-policy dilemmas like Syria — when, and how, America should intervene abroad — have been dividing the Democratic Party for generations. During the Cold War, the left clashed with hawks like Washington Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson over how seriously to take the Soviet threat; after the Cold War ended, it was conflicts like Bosnia and Iraq that fueled heated intraparty debates. But even though Trump has scrambled the usual trench lines on national security through his mix of isolationism and pugnacious nationalism, the Democratic Party is surprisingly unified on these issues — for now.House Democrats would be wise to take advantage of that unity, Malinowski argues, especially as liberal firebrands fuel intraparty divisions that often grab headlines and drive unfavorable media coverage of the House Democratic majority.
His advice: Eyes on the prize.
“We have the same basic vision for the general direction the country should go in,” Malinowski told me in closing. “We have interesting differences about how to do it, but those differences are not going to play out in a meaningful way in the House in the next two years because Donald Trump is the glue that holds us all together.

Facing an insurmountable funding shortage that has plunged the city’s public housing stock into disrepair, the de Blasio administration is considering demolishing and rebuilding some of its New York City Housing Authority properties in partnership with private developers, according to five people familiar with the proposal.
City officials want to enact the concept at the Fulton Houses in Chelsea, where they believe the land is valuable enough to earn them a substantial profit that would pay for capital needs at the 11-building complex. Repairs at the development are estimated to total $168 million over five years. Story Continued Below
The idea is to tear down two of Fulton’s smaller buildings and replace them with a larger one. During construction, residents would be relocated into two buildings the city would erect on an underutilized parking lot in the complex.
Seventy percent of the apartments would be rented to tenants paying market rates, and the remaining 30 percent would be affordable enough for the public housing residents, according to people briefed on the plans.
The entire project would become part of the federal Rental Assistance Demonstration program, which converts traditional public housing subsidies to Section 8 vouchers and turns over management of the sites to private operators. They make a profit, and in turn they renovate and repair the buildings much faster than the city would.
It is part of the administration's 10-year plan to generate $24 billion for the housing authority, whose five-year capital needs assessment totals $31.8 billion .
Kathryn Garcia, the interim NYCHA chairwoman, briefed Chelsea politicians at City Hall about a month ago. Several people familiar with the meeting said Council Speaker Corey Johnson, who represents the area, seemed open to the idea but has yet to formally embrace it.
Others were less enthusiastic.
“I have a lot of unanswered questions about NYCHA’s plan,” said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, who attended the meeting.
He said he is awaiting further details and wants to assess how Fulton’s residents feel about the proposed changes. A tenant association leader did not respond to calls for comment.
“The city says that all of the rights and rent protections of the tenants will be preserved, but I think there is always concern about the strength of guarantees like that going forward,” Gottfried said.
State Sen. Brad Hoylman, who represents the area, said the Rental Assistance Demonstration program has proven successful elsewhere in the city. But he said he is nevertheless “very concerned about the movement toward privatization in New York City’s public housing stock.”
“The success of this approach is really dependent on the continued strength of the housing market,” he added. “What happens if a developer goes belly up?”
Under the tentative arrangement, the housing authority would retain an ownership stake in the development and would be able to reclaim control over the complex if the private operator bails out, said one source familiar with the plans.
""The administration has made an unprecedented commitment to renovating tens of thousands of apartments and improving residents' quality of lives,"" said Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio. ""This is an ambitious plan, and we will work with local elected officials and residents to discuss different paths to achieve this.""
The city employed the Rental Assistance Demonstration program for the 1,395-unit Ocean Bay complex in Queens. Residents there have spoken in favor of the initiative, which they say has sped up repairs to their homes.
But building market-rate housing on public land is certain to spark controversy. Just last week, THE CITY reported that the housing authority shelved a 14-year-old proposal for a private affordable housing project next to the public housing development called Harborview Terrace in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan.
The income-restricted housing was intended to be a trade-off for the development of Hudson Yards, but last year the de Blasio administration shifted plans to a development that would be primarily market-rate apartments as a way to raise money for the beleaguered housing authority.
Residents and elected officials came out against the plan.
And Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer is suing the city over a separate housing authority plan to turn public land over to a private developer, Fetner Properties, for a mix of market-rate and affordable apartments."

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print KIEV — Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian and political novice, scored a crushing victory over incumbent Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine’s runoff presidential vote Sunday, in a resounding rebuke to the country’s political establishment.
With nearly all votes counted, Zelenskiy won 73.2 percent of the vote compared to Poroshenko’s 24.4 percent — a margin of victory of nearly 49 percentage points — according to the Central Election Commission .
Zelenskiy’s triumph was fueled by a wave of anti-establishment sentiment, similar to other populist insurgencies sweeping across the West.
But the comedian, who has promised to clean house among Ukraine’s ruling elite, will likely find fulfilling his supporters’ high expectations difficult — not the least due to his dearth of political knowledge: His only brush with Ukrainian politics has been to play the president in a popular television show called “Servant of the People.”
“I promise all of you, I will never let you down,” Zelenskiy told a jubilant crowd of supporters at his campaign headquarters upon hearing the exit poll results.
Zelenskiy thrashed Poroshenko in the first round of the election at the end of last month, setting the stage for Sunday’s runoff.
His meteoric political rise is largely due to being a new face in the political arena of a country where voters have grown tired with establishment politicians, and feel frustrated about issues such as corruption, the country’s unresolved war and a sluggish economy.
Zelenskiy's TV character, Vasily Goloborodko, is a modest high school teacher unexpectedly catapulted into the presidency overnight to confront the crooked political establishment and fight corruption.

Meet the Democrats’ New Voice on Foreign Policy,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/21/democrats-foreign-policy-tom-malinowski-226695,"M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Continue to article content Facebook Twitter Email Comment Print Continue to article content SOMERVILLE, N.J. — It was a Friday in March at 5:00 p.m. on the dot. Rep. Tom Malinowski and I had just sat down in his largely empty temporary congressional office when special counsel Robert Mueller informed Attorney General William Barr that his 22-month investigation was complete, prompting a dizzying whirlwind of speculation about what comes next.
Malinowski, a Democrat, took his iPhone out of his pocket to glance at the update but appeared largely uninterested — and disappointed. He put his phone on his desk and changed the subject to something that had happened a mere three hours ago and was at the top of his mind.
Story Continued Below
President Donald Trump had just reversed — via tweet, no less — his own Treasury Department’s decision to impose new sanctions on North Korea, with the White House press secretary saying Trump “likes” Kim Jong Un and therefore believes the harsh financial punishments would have been unnecessary.
But suddenly, the world’s attention shifted to the news that Mueller had wrapped up his investigation and the attorney general’s sparse, four-page summary of Mueller’s findings. Trump’s stunning reversal of North Korea sanctions would soon be forgotten, a fact that irked Malinowski, who was enraged by the president’s decision.
“We’re inured to this. The president ‘likes’ the leader of an adversary state and therefore will not take action against him?” Malinowski said in his characteristic deep, monotone voice that he almost never raises. “You don’t wait for your Treasury Department to sanction people and then the next day theatrically overturn them. You don’t do that.”
Malinowski, 53, is just one of nearly 100 members of the freshman class in the House — but he’s quickly becoming one of Democrats’ most influential voices on foreign policy, educating his fellow members about key issues and aggressively pushing the Trump administration to prioritize global human rights issues and reorient its often chaotic foreign policy.
“He's brought to the committee a wealth of experience and a list of good ideas a mile long,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on which Malinowski sits. “He's going to play a big role in our work in the years ahead.""
It’s all the more surprising because Malinowski wasn’t supposed to be here. Born in Poland and having immigrated to the U.S. at 6, he spent 12 years as a top official at Human Rights Watch before joining Barack Obama’s State Department as head of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor — hardly the usual launching pads for a congressional career. In the 2018 midterms, he narrowly defeated a GOP incumbent in a Republican-leaning central-north New Jersey district, winning in part by flipping longtime Republicans in a year that saw a “blue wave” reaction to the president’s first 21 months in office.
Building a public profile around foreign-policy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era. And in a freshman class that includes firebrands like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, it often seems impossible to jerk the media spotlight over to sobering topics like the famine in Yemen. Yet that’s exactly what Malinowski is aiming to do — while assiduously tending to the needs of his constituents: Officially, his top issue is pushing for the construction of the proposed Gateway Tunnel linking New Jersey with Manhattan.
“You know my job in Congress: Dig a tunnel and save the world — in that order,” he often says, ranking his spot on the Transportation Committee above membership on the Foreign Affairs panel. But it’s clear that human rights — not bridges and tunnels — remains his true passion.
Calling out and punishing human-rights abusers is one of the few actions that brings Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill — and Malinowski has a history of finding allies on the other side of the aisle. Over his years in Washington, he has cultivated relationships with Republicans like the late Senator John McCain of Arizona, with whom he found common ground despite McCain’s stinging criticisms of Obama’s policies. They worked together during the George W. Bush administration to oppose the CIA’s use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", and McCain vouched for Malinowski at his Senate confirmation hearing in September 2013. Malinowski highlighted McCain’s praise in a campaign advertisement shortly after the senator’s death.
The two men often butted heads over Obama’s foreign policy, even as they often agreed in private. Malinowski revealed to POLITICO that he worked behind the scenes to fight some of Obama’s most criticized foreign-policy decisions — most notably, the initial intervention into Yemen’s civil war by providing aid to Saudi Arabia despite the kingdom’s poor record on human rights and Obama’s refusal to set up a no-fly zone over Syria despite his “red line” on chemical-weapons attacks.
McCain was, for decades, the go-to authority for congressional Republicans on foreign policy and national security matters — and a vocal critic of autocratic regimes. Democrats had their own hawkish eminence grise until his death in 2008: Rep. Tom Lantos of California, who, like Malinowski, grew up in the Eastern bloc and learned to despise Soviet-style governance. But few figures in either party command that kind of authority today — which presents an opportunity for someone with the gravitas and media savvy to step into the vacuum.
In 2019, Republicans maintain a national security edge over Democrats, though recent polls show that the gap is narrowing. Many on Capitol Hill believe the gap can be reversed if Democrats can take advantage of Trump’s disjointed and often haphazard approach to world affairs.
It seems unlikely a freshman House member who’s never held elected office before could become a real irritant to the White House on foreign policy — especially in an age when America is turning inward, consumed by debates over health care, inequality, race and immigration. And in this “Romney Republican” congressional district, there’s no guarantee that Malinowski will be able to stick around longer than just one term. In fact, he already has a viable Republican challenger for 2020: the son of former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean.
But Malinowski is betting that Americans still deeply care about the world beyond their borders, and he projects more worry about the substance of Trump’s foreign policy — his praise for dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim, his erratic Twitter statements on the use of nuclear weapons, his disdain for NATO — than politics.
“I think Americans still care. I think the State Department still cares. I think our armed forces still care,” he said.
“Every institution cares apart from the White House,” Malinowski added. “And unfortunately, the president speaks for the United States, so the world gets a warped impression of what the United States is all about right now because of one man. And that is consequential. But it can be reversed.”
***
For a freshman lawmaker who doesn’t dance on social media or tangle with the president over Israel, Malinowski’s ability to get attention is impressive. During a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, he cornered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the disconnect between the president calling out Venezuela’s socialist government and his praising communist North Korea for its economic potential. The clip went viral on Twitter, causing many to ask: Who’s Tom Malinowski?
“If we’re going to be so forceful in denouncing socialism, why is the administration so high on communism?” Malinowski asked.
“Yeah, I mean, the very statement there is outrageous,” Pompeo responded, going on to defend the Trump administration's strict sanctions on Pyongyang.
“Why is ‘liking’ Kim Jong Un a sufficient reason to cancel or not to pursue sanctions against companies helping his nuclear program?” Malinowski retorted, referring to Trump’s reversal of Treasury-approved sanctions — the same decision that vexed Malinowski so much that he shrugged off the completion of the Mueller investigation.
He later brought up Trump’s glowing comments about Kim and asked Pompeo if Kim is responsible for the country’s labor camps and the assassinations of his uncle and brother, among other human rights abuses.
“He’s the leader of the country,” Pompeo said each time.
“What’s to ‘like’ about Kim Jong Un?” Malinowski pressed.
“Sir, don’t make this a political football. It’s inappropriate,” Pompeo responded.
It hasn’t always been this easy for Malinowski to grab the spotlight, though. Only a few weeks into his tenure, he did something almost unheard of on Capitol Hill in the era of social media virality: He walked up to a reporter after a news conference and asked if the confused scribe had any more questions for him.
“Nothing bores me more than people complaining about press coverage and not getting attention,” he later said. “It’s our job to do things that are worthy of attention. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job. And I’m satisfied that I’m getting my message out.”
***
Before I arrived at his office, Malinowski was preparing his remarks for a vigil later that night for the victims of the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a white supremacist killed 50 Muslim worshippers and wounded dozens more. As I walked into his office, he asked a staffer to find the names of the victims who were living in New Zealand as refugees.
Speaking in a gymnasium at Mount Olive High School later that night, Malinowski said those refugees came from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan because they thought they would be safe in New Zealand. Without mentioning Trump by name, Malinowski harangued politicians who employ language about an “invasion” of migrants — as Trump had the day after the shootings and during the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. At the vigil, he implored attendees to “call out anyone in this country who uses language that is in any way similar to the language that those terrorists use.” The crowd did something that rarely happens at vigils: It stood up and applauded for nearly a minute before Malinowski could continue speaking.
“The shooter in New Zealand said exactly the same thing: Immigrants are invading Western countries,” Malinowski told me in his office. “And when the president responds the next day after the massacre in New Zealand by repeating that immigrants are invading America, that does not make people in my district feel more safe any more than they would have felt safe if Barack Obama had echoed the propaganda of ISIS after an ISIS attack. So this isn’t politics. This is serious business. This is about protecting our country and protecting our people. It’s about defending our law enforcement institutions, defending our intelligence community.”
He recently introduced a resolution condemning white supremacist rhetoric and those who amplify or repeat it. The legislation doesn’t mention Trump specifically, but it’s an implicit dig at the president with a twist: The resolution almost entirely consists of Quote: s from conservative darling Ronald Reagan's final speech as president. It was an address Malinowski described as a “love letter” to immigration. It’s something close to his heart as an immigrant himself.
“The idea would be to ask Republicans to choose between Reagan and Trump,” Malinowski said. “This is becoming a national security issue and I want us to stop playing defense on immigration and start playing offense and point out that this demonization of immigrants and this spreading of outright paranoid lies about invasions of rapists and killers is radicalizing a portion of the American population in ways that are dangerous to all of us.”
“It’s scary,” he said at another point in our interview. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before in our country. And it’s a problem we’re going to be dealing with, I fear, after Trump is gone.”
***
As alarmed as Malinowski can sound about Trump, he finds himself in a curious political position: In his historically Republican district, he could not have won by bashing the president all the time. On domestic issues, he positions himself as a moderate Democrat, rejecting progressive goals like ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal"" as irresponsible and unrealistic.
At the same time, he viewed 2018 as a turning point for the two political parties. In Malinowski’s view, Republicans had all but abandoned the core principles that Americans had associated with the party of Lincoln.
“I felt like I was running as the candidate of the party of patriotism in America, the party of law enforcement in America, the party that wants to defend our country against foreign adversaries, the party of family values — since our presidents don’t pay off porn stars while they’re in the White House,” he said. “These are all principles that used to be associated with the Republican Party. And I proudly embrace them and believe that my party stands for them today.”
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee advised Malinowski that to win his race against Republican incumbent Leonard Lance, the safest thing to do was to run on the party’s health care message. Don’t take the bait, the Democratic strategists in Washington warned, on Trump’s late-stage rhetoric about a migrant caravan coming to “invade” the country.
The New Jersey Democrat ignored that counsel.
One of his final ads of the campaign cycle, titled “Rejecting Fear,” featured Malinowski explicitly pushing back on Trump’s closing message: “They want you scared — scared of your neighbors, scared of me.” Malinowski thinks the message resonated in part because of the ethnic diversity in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District and the fact that 20 percent of its residents were born outside the U.S.
“Democrats can talk about these issues so long as we frame them in the right way,” Malinowski insisted to me. “I’m not an alarmist. I speak calmly and precisely about what’s happening in our country and to our community.”
***
Malinowski’s presence on Capitol Hill — particularly his perch on the Foreign Affairs Committee — irks some of his Republican colleagues.
“Anything to do with the horrid foreign policy of President Obama, it’s not healthy for our country so we can’t support that,” said Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a longtime member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, naming the Iran nuclear deal and other cornerstones of Obama’s foreign policy. “The bad policies that [Obama] did have really damaged this country.”
But Malinowski has also used his State Department experience to his advantage on the panel.
During a committee debate about a War Powers Resolution to withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen , Republicans were arguing that the effort was ill-conceived because the U.S. is not engaged in “hostilities” in Yemen. Malinowski fired back, explaining that he was involved in the discussions when the Obama administration decided to get involved in Yemen in the first place. The Obama administration considered the U.S. to be formally engaged in hostilities in Yemen, Malinowski countered.

“If a foreign power was bombing Washington, D.C., and a second foreign power was refueling the first power’s aircraft over Chesapeake Bay on their way to drop ordnance on the Capitol building, we’d consider both countries to be at war with us, obviously,” Malinowski told me. “And if we’re refueling Saudi aircraft, if we’re servicing them on the tarmac, helping them get back into the air, we’re part of this conflict. And therefore need to make responsible decisions.”
Most — if not all — first-time members of Congress have never been in a classified briefing. Malinowski’s fellow freshman lawmakers often lean on his executive branch experience when drawing their own conclusions. Every Democrat ended up voting in favor of the Yemen War Powers Resolution , a remarkable and rare show of Democratic unity on a fraught foreign-policy issue.
“Witnesses can’t get things by him,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a fellow Foreign Affairs Committee member. “He’s able to provide a lot of knowledge for the members of the committee, but he also uses it on the floor.”
***
Despite the GOP criticisms, Malinowski is far from an Obama sycophant. During his tenure as assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights and labor, he was often a dissenting voice among the Obama foreign-policy brass. Republicans like McCain took notice.
“We fought together in the trenches to do something that we both passionately believed in,” Malinowski said of his work with McCain on banning the use of torture. “He won my lifelong loyalty and admiration in that fight.”
But McCain, an ardent critic of Obama’s foreign policy, often used Malinowski as a punching bag to vent about what he viewed as a disjointed and dangerous series of foreign-policy decisions — including the last time they saw each other, in McCain’s Senate office in 2017.
“He reamed me out about my support for banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia. He said, ‘Are you one of those people who think we should stop selling [precision-guided munitions] to Saudi Arabia?’ And he gave me a look that could kill,” Malinowski said with a laugh. “I tried to shift the subject as quickly as I could.”
“I loved him. And he liked a good fight and always — he jumped into the toughest fights and was never afraid of taking a strong position on a difficult issue. And I try to be the same way. And sometimes that meant we were on opposing sides. And it did not and could not have affected our friendship.”
Malinowski agreed with one of McCain’s central critiques of Obama’s foreign policy: that the U.S. should have done more to stanch the bloodshed in Syria after Obama’s “red line.” But Malinowski, who at the time was a senior official on the president’s national security team, couldn’t project his views publicly; instead, he tried to change Obama’s course from the inside.
“When I was working with the president, for the president, I made my opinions known in a way that one responsibly does as a member of the administration,” he said.
On Syria, though, Malinowski struck out. Obama was reluctant to do anything that would drag the U.S. into a prolonged conflict in the region, even as Syrian President Bashar Assad was deploying chemical weapons on his own people. Malinowski wanted to set up a no-fly zone well before Russia staged a military intervention in 2015; the idea would have been to prevent Syrian fighter jets from flying over cities like Aleppo and threaten to shoot down aircraft that crossed into opposition-held areas. But once the Russians got involved, all bets were off.
Malinowski argues that had his view prevailed, the cascading and disastrous global effects of the Syrian civil war would have been mitigated — even prevented.
“The 5 million refugees, the rise of ISIS, chemical weapons attacks, the Russian intervention — I think we had a chance to prevent those things, and they had an impact well beyond Syria,” Malinowski said. “I don’t think Brexit would have happened if not for Syrian refugees flooding Europe and creating this fear of an immigrant invasion. It affected our politics in ways that can’t be quantified, but it certainly affected our politics. The fear of ISIS and the fear of refugees have been a powerful driver in Western politics for the last few years. And both of those problems came to us courtesy of Syria.”
***
Searing foreign-policy dilemmas like Syria — when, and how, America should intervene abroad — have been dividing the Democratic Party for generations. During the Cold War, the left clashed with hawks like Washington Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson over how seriously to take the Soviet threat; after the Cold War ended, it was conflicts like Bosnia and Iraq that fueled heated intraparty debates. But even though Trump has scrambled the usual trench lines on national security through his mix of isolationism and pugnacious nationalism, the Democratic Party is surprisingly unified on these issues — for now.
House Democrats would be wise to take advantage of that unity, Malinowski argues, especially as liberal firebrands fuel intraparty divisions that often grab headlines and drive unfavorable media coverage of the House Democratic majority.
His advice: Eyes on the prize.
“We have the same basic vision for the general direction the country should go in,” Malinowski told me in closing. “We have interesting differences about how to do it, but those differences are not going to play out in a meaningful way in the House in the next two years because Donald Trump is the glue that holds us all together. We know the country’s in crisis. We know that this is not a time for transforming America. This is a time for saving America, preserving America. And there will be plenty of time, if we succeed in preserving our institutions, preserving our democracy, there will be plenty of time in the coming years to argue about differences in policy.”"

AP Photo/Evan Vucci The Big Idea The One Trait That Predicts Trump Fever Oostburg, Wis., and Chevy Chase, Md., couldn’t be more different. But in the 2016 primary, they both rejected Trump. They have something else in common, too. By TIMOTHY P. CARNEY
Timothy P. Carney is commentary editor at the Washington Examiner and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute . He is the author of Alienated America: Why Some Places Thrive While Others Collapse , from which this is adapted .
“Sadly, the American dream is dead.”
After rambling, off script, for most of his 50-minute speech to announce his presidential candidacy in June 2015, Donald Trump returned to his written remarks for the final section. He delivered these somber words slowly, pausing for emphasis. Story Continued Below
“Sadly ... the American dream is dead,” he said.
In the cavernous lobby of Trump Tower, an eager supporter filled that pregnant silence. “Bring it back!”
Sure enough, that was Trump’s promise and the final line, the bottom line, of his candidacy: “But if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again!”
This became his mantra. ""Make America Great Again."" The premise of that motto—the American dream is dead—carried the day in state after state, and it drew boisterous crowds at rallies in places like Lowell, Mass.; Beaumont, Texas; Mobile, Ala.—“We’re running on fumes. There’s nothing here.""—and Springfield, Ill.
“These rally towns,” the Washington Post reported in an early effort to decode Trump’s meaning, “lag behind the country and their home states on a number of measures. Their median household incomes are lower, and they often have lower rates of homeownership or residents with college degrees.”
On April 26, 2016, my own state of Maryland, along with four other states, voted for Trump in the primary election, putting him on the doorstep of the Republican nomination. “Every single place I go is a disaster,” Trump said in his victory remarks that night.
Trump obviously didn’t go where I had gone on a reporting trip that morning:to Chevy Chase Village Hall, off of Connecticut Avenue, just outside Washington, D.C. Chevy Chase, Md., is a Democratic stronghold, but a place that liked Trump in the general election in 2016 far less than it did Mitt Romney in 2012. Trump also got only 16 percent of Republican primary votes in Chevy Chase; 64 percent of primary Republican voters preferred then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
Chevy Chase’s rejection of Trump in the primary election could be chalked up as liberal Beltway Republicans rejecting Trump. But if we look deeper, we see parallels to Trump’s performance in some very conservative places in Middle America, and the conditions that might have led to both of those places’ rejections of him.
In the case of Chevy Chase, the key to understanding Trump opposition in the primary has a lot to do with understanding the strength of the community, just as it does in a Wisconsin town called Oostburg. Oostburg is different from Chevy Chase in almost every way except for one crucial similarity: Both of these villages are knit together by the kind of community institutions and civil society that have disintegrated in most of the United States in the past several decades. These places illustrate a kind of social cohesion that undermines what Trump says about the direction of the American dream. And so the stories of Chevy Chase and Oostburg, two places that rejected Trump, help us to understand why so many other places in the United States embraced him and why they might do so again in 2020.
When I arrived at Chevy Chase’s Village Hall, which is the polling place for the village, I found a parking spot between a BMW and a Porsche SUV. That was unsurprising. Chevy Chase Village is the wealthiest municipality in the D.C. region, which is probably the highest-income region in the country. The mean household income in the Village of Chevy Chase is $420,000. Only about 2 percent of America makes that much. Chris Matthews and George F. Will are just two of the well-known residents of the village. Ambassadors, lawyers, bankers and lobbyists populate the beautiful massive homes off Connecticut Avenue, almost all of which are worth more than $1 million. The median home costs $1.52 million.
Chevy Chase Village isn’t merely wealthy in material things. To the extent we can measure the good life, Chevy Chase has it. About 95 percent of Chevy Chase’s families had two parents at home in 2015. The Village Hall hosts a monthly speaker series, which kicked off in April 2017 with a talk by documentary filmmaker Tamara Gold. CIA veteran David Duberman was slated for the next month. A committee of volunteers throws regular parties for the whole village. Saint Patrick’s Day included a “Father/Daughter Pipe/Harpist Team and True Scottish Piper,” according to the Crier , the village’s own newsletter. Children and toddlers can take ballet and musical theater classes at Village Hall. Adults can take tai chi.
The community is engaged. At a village meeting I observed, there were presentations by the volunteer members or chairmen and chairwomen of the Community Relations Committee, the Ethics Commission, the Financial Review Committee, the Public Safety Committee, the Traffic Committee, the Local Advisory Panel to the Historic Preservation Commission, the Western Grove Park Friends Group, the Environment and Energy Committee and the Parks and Greenspaces Committee.
Chevy Chase is “the village” Hillary Clinton said it tookto raise a family. And Clinton tookthe village. The day I was there for the 2016 primary, Clinton raked in 85 percent of the vote. She would a few months later also dominate the general election at this polling place, beating Trump by 56 points. This tells us something rather obvious to anyone who knows the area: that wealthy, white Chevy Chase is very liberal.
But a closer look tells us something more specific. Compare Clinton’s 56-point margin with 2012, when President Barack Obama defeated Romney by 31 points. There is something about Chevy Chase that makes it like Trump so much less than it liked Romney. Chevy Chase’s aversion to Trump appears much more clearly when we set aside the general election, which is a choice between a Republican and a Democrat. We need to focus instead on the Republican primary, where Trump got a fraction of Kasich’s vote share.
Chevy Chase’s wealth is extreme, but the phenomenon in play here—wealthy, highly educated people in affluent communities eschewing Trump and his proclamation that the American dream is dead—is common. Chevy Chase is in Montgomery County, Md., which is the third-most-educated county in the nation, measured by advanced degrees—31.6 percent of adults older than 25 have a graduate or professional degree. Nationally, the rate is less than 12 percent. The rest of the top four—Arlington and Alexandria counties in Virginia, and the District of Columbia (functionally a countyfor our purposes)—areamong Trump’s 35worst counties inAmerica. You can spot the suburbs, chock-full of advanced degrees and six-figure salaries, by looking at a primary election map for counties that voted for Kasich or Marco Rubio.
The best explanation of why these pockets of elites rejected Trump is found in Trump’s own words. He was selling a sense of decline and a desperate need to turn things around. In Kasich Country, though—in college towns and prosperous suburbs—people believed the American dream was alive. These people also believed America was great already, while much of the electorate didn’t.
This isn’t a universal rule, and it doesn’t apply as well to the general election, in which voters picked between Trump and Clinton. But, as a general rule, you can use Trump’s electoral strength in the early Republican primaries as a proxy for pessimism. Trump Country, by this definition, is the place where hope is lowand where the good life appears out of reach. So the flip side is this:Where Trump bombed—especiallyin the GOP primaries, but alsocompared with Romney in 2012—are the places where you can sniffout confidence, optimism, hope and, if you’ll pardon the treacle, theAmerican dream.
If we start our search for the American dream in Clinton’s Village, the Village of Chevy Chase, it’s tempting to come to a materialistic conclusion: People with money have hope, and the American dream is alive and well in wealthy neighborhoods.
But a closer look at the primary map reveals other pockets of Trump opposition in the early days—another model of the good life. There’s a different sort of village out there.
There’s Oostburg.
Oostburg couldn’t be more different from Chevy Chase. While Chevy Chase borders the District of Columbia, the village of Oostburg sprouted up in the farm fields of Wisconsin. It’s an outlying suburb of Sheboygan, Wis.—which is not a booming metropolis.
The median home in Oostburg is worth $148,000, meaning youcould buy 10 homes in Oostburg for the price of one in Chevy Chase. Oostburg is not poor: The average household earns $58,000, whichis slightly above the national average. Even that slight advantage inhousehold income has a clear—andsalient—demographicexplanation:Oostburg is a family town.
Different types of households nationwide have very different median incomes. Married-family households on average have higher incomes than nonmarried or nonfamily households. Oostburg is much denser with married-family households than the rest of the country—two-thirds of households in Oostburg; less than 50 percent nationwide—and that difference explains Oostburg’s advantage over the national median. In other words, Oostburg’s wealth is literally its family strength.
And if you ask Oostburgers, they’ll say their family strength is community strength. A few weeks before that Maryland primary, I spent a couple of days in Oostburg to cover the Wisconsin primaries. Just as I would visit Chevy Chase because of what made it stand out—its wealth—I picked Oostburg because of what made itstand out: its Dutchness and the strong community that the Dutch are known for, even centuries after they immigrated to the United States.
Forty-five percent of Oostburg claims Dutch heritage according to the census. Another 42 percent are German. “Oostburg” is Dutch for East town. Dutch settlers arrived there in the 1840s, and the signs of the Netherlands, like tulips and miniature windmills, are everywhere. “If you ain’t Dutch, you ain’t much,” was a phrase I first heard at the lunch counter of Judi’s Place, a family-owned diner.
On Sunday morning at Judi’s, I saw the truest manifestation of the town’s Dutch heritage, and it wasn’t the diner cuisine: Dozens of families streamed in to eat with their neighbors after service at one of the four Reformed churches in the village. While there’s no speaker series highlighting famous residents, the community’s strength is unquestionable. Neighbors all greet each other at Judi’s. Customers prepared and delivered frozen meals to the waitress, who was scheduled to have surgery the next day.
One man—a mechanic named Dan—complained to me about a recent Christmas concert at the public school. He couldn’t get a seat in the gym for the concert because all of his neighbors, even those with no school-age children, were there. One neighbor shrugged at Dan’s plight. “We gotta come see our kids,” the neighbor said. The neighbor had no children singing that day, but Oostburgers consider the kids of Oostburg “our kids.” It takes a village, and Oostburg fits the bill of that village.
But this isn’t Clinton’s type of village politically. Trump won it 80 percentage points to her 13 points in the general election. In 2014, one blogger suggested Oostburg was the most conservative town in Wisconsin. But just as in Chevy Chase, Oostburg’s Republicans had no use for Trump in the primary election. Trump, who dominated most of Wisconsin’s rural areas, scored only 15 percentage points in the Republican primary in this village. That’s a familiar number—it’s only one point off from his total in Chevy Chase.
What made Oostburg so immune to Trump’s appeal? It’s inadequate to say Christian conservatives rejected this twice-divorced New York playboy who had supported abortion rights until recently. In South Carolina, a few weeks earlier, Trump won the evangelical vote with the same amount, 33 percent, that he won the rest of the state, according to exit polls.
Oostburg wasn’t an outlier, either. If you wanted to predict which rural, Christian counties would buck the Trump train when they had a choice among Republicans like Ted Cruz, Rubio and Kasich, you could have done a lot worse than looking at a county’s Dutch population.
Here’s the common thread between the Oostburgs and the Chevy Chases and among analogues around the country: Both villages have strong institutions of civil society—local governments, churches, country clubs, garden clubs, good public schools and, in Oostburg’s case, Judi’s Place.
Those community institutions constitute the infrastructure that is necessary to support families.
And the institutions in turn are supported by families. Strong families are the precondition for the good life and mobility—the dream, grounded in realistic hope, that no matter your starting point, you can succeed and your children can do even better. *** New Window
When data show that the white working class was Trump’s base, it’s easy to see the phrase “white working class” as a statement of race and income. It’s more important, though, as a description of a social class—even a way of life. “White working-class Americans of all ages,” writes Emma Green in the Atlantic , citing research by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Atlantic , “were much less likely than their college-educated peers to participate in sports teams, book clubs, or neighborhood associations—55 percent vs. 31 percent said they seldom or never participated in those kinds of activities.”
This had political salience. That poll, taken in midprimaries, when Cruz was the last viable challenger, found Trump leading among GOP voters 37 to 31. But among GOP voters who were “civically disengaged,” Trump led 50 to 24. Oostburg voted Cruz and Chevy Chase voted Kasich. Within the context of Republicans, churchgoing white Christians are conservative while the wealthy, highly educated white suburbanites are moderates.
You could see these two things as opposites, but the stories of Kasich Country and Cruz Country are the same story: People enmeshed in strong communities rejected Trump in the early primaries while people alienated, abandoned, lacking social ties and community rushed to him.
Trump’s best large county in the Iowa caucuses, Pottawattamie, had the weakest civil society—churches, neighborhood groups, volunteering, voting—of any large county in Iowa and is known for its neon-lighted casinos erected to bring in out-of-state gamblers. His best small county is notable mostly for church closures and the shuttering of its largest employer in early 2016. It also ranks at the bottom of the state in widely used measures of civil society.
His other best places in those early primaries—places like Buchanan County, Va.; and Fayette County, Pa.—looked similarly vacant.
Why do so many people believe the American dream is dead? I think the answer is this: Because strong communities have crumbled and much of America has been abandoned without the web of human connections and institutions that make the good life possible. More of America is a wasteland of alienation. Less of America is the “village.”
Can this change?
America has more Chevy Chases today than it did a generation ago, but that’s because wealthy people are clustering more. Making more Chevy Chases is a zero-sum game: It means drawing the skilled, the active, the educated, the leaders out of other communities and concentrating them in places where normal folk can’t afford a house. There is also a clear limit on how many pockets of elites America can have, because, by definition, the elites are few.
But remember the second village, Oostburg. The raw material is more renewable there, and arguably it used to be more plentiful and could be again. It’s a sense of duty to one’s neighbors—a duty that includes a sense of duty to one’s family. It’s a sense of both being looked after and being needed. It’s a sense of a common, higher purpose. It’s shared, resilient mediating institutions. And frankly, in America at least, that common purpose is a common faith, and those mediating institutions are really the church. There could be more Oostburgs, too.

How Stephen Miller made immigration personal,www.politico.com,GABBY ORR,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/22/stephen-miller-immigration-trump-1284287,"White House How Stephen Miller made immigration personal The White House policy aide has involved himself in specific immigration cases and pressed to publicize more personal information about migrants. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
In the summer of 2017, a group of White House aides were in Paris, enjoying some rare downtime during Donald Trump’s first trip to France as president.
As the Trump officials soaked up a July evening along the banks of the Seine, one stepped away to take a phone call from the U.S. It was Stephen Miller, the president's then-31-year-old chief policy adviser, speechwriter and hard-line immigration policy advocate. Story Continued Below
As the other officials looked on, Miller spent several minutes loudly pressing administration officials on the other end of the line to deport an individual who had been detained by immigration authorities.
The episode, recounted by two former administration officials with direct knowledge of the matter, struck some of Miller’s colleagues as bizarre. They were familiar by then with Miller’s volatile temper, and of his central role in Trump’s immigration policy. Even so, the effort by a young White House aide to dictate the fate of a single detainee was a startling sign of his deep involvement in the federal government’s immigration system.
The one-time Senate aide is a key architect of Trump’s tough immigration policies — a controversial role affirmed when he helped engineer a recent purge of Department of Homeland Security officials deemed too soft on border security. Miller has helped shape several explosive Trump actions, including an early 2017 executive order banning travel from several Muslim-majority nations and Trump’s crusade for a wall on the border with Mexico. Most recently, he has backed an idea to relocate undocumented immigrants to “sanctuary cities” within the U.S., a scheme that has been described as political retribution by Democratic opponents. By KATY O'DONNELL
While Miller’s influence over immigration policy is well-known by now, less understood is his granular interest in the people crossing the U.S. border, and the seemingly unprecedented steps he has taken to reveal information about their personal backgrounds.
Soon after Trump took office, for instance, Miller began calling U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to insist that they include more details — such as full names and pending criminal charges — in press releases about immigrants they had apprehended, detained or planned to deport, according to three current and former DHS officials.
“At one point, he wanted us to be releasing press releases every day about the people we had detained and their criminal status. We were constantly doing a dance just to remain in a legal place,” recalled a former DHS official.
U.S. officials say that such a thing had never been done. Unless the individuals had been convicted or charged, releasing such information could constitute a breach of privacy and possibly deprive them of a fair hearing, according to Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney and senior Justice Department official under President Barack Obama.
But a little-noticed provision in a January 2017 executive order crafted during the presidential transition with Miller’s input gave the administration a potential defense against accusations that the government was violating undocumented immigrants’ privacy rights. The provision required that federal agencies write new rules that “exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents” from protections under a federal privacy law. DHS subsequently updated its policies in April 2017.
Administration officials largely resisted Miller’s efforts. But there were nonetheless signs that his push to more vividly illustrate what he views as the threat of undocumented immigrants had an impact. In July 2017, for example, DHS and Justice Department officials participated in a White House press briefing in which they displayed images of tattoos belonging to MS-13 gang members, including enough of the face of one alleged gang member to identify him. The officials also discussed specific ongoing criminal cases involving alleged gang-related violence.
Former acting ICE Director Tom Homan told POLITICO that he and his colleagues often participated in discussions “at the department level about what we could and could not release about people.”
But Homan, who is in the mix of candidates currently being considered to lead DHS, said he did not recall specific requests for more information from Miller during his previous tenure at the agency.
Others describe a different reality, saying Miller’s interest in fine-grain elements of immigration policy lead him to pressure mid- and low-level bureaucrats who would not ordinarily be hearing from one of the president’s most senior White House aides.
A former DHS official said Miller was often on the phone with administration officials at all levels. He typically pressures them about changes to immigration rules and regulations, and demands stepped-up enforcement. But he also sometimes takes interest in individual cases. By TED HESSON
“We tried to protect as many people from Miller and his requests as possible,” said the former DHS official. “When he started going lower and calling random career officials, we would have to go and say, ‘If Stephen calls you, elevate it immediately and do not answer.’”
Miller has personalized immigration policy in White House debates as well. As POLITICO reported in August, the Trump aide has often launched meetings with specific horror stories about innocent Americans assaulted or murdered by noncitizens. “‘We must save Americans from these immigrant criminals!’” a former National Security Council official recalled Miller saying in an internal meeting.
One Miller demand that rankled DHS officials involved a Trump administration program known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) created for such instances. A former administration official said Miller was adamant that DHS elevate the office and dispatch Barbara Gonzalez, a public affairs official charged with overseeing the VOICE office, to participate in White House events more frequently.

Several officials protested Miller’s efforts, arguing that the office was intended to support victims and their families — not to demonize immigrants by disclosing details about the crimes some committed.
Year-end figures provided by ICE showed that the agency conducted 158,581 arrests during fiscal year 2018, which included 105,140 individuals with criminal convictions and another 32,977 with pending criminal charges. However, the agency does not differentiate between violent and nonviolent offenses.
The White House has repeatedly cited arrest figures from ICE in attempts to draw a link between undocumented immigration and violent crime. Trump even claimed during his February State of the Union address that “thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country,” though he offered no data to support the claim.
Some White House allies who support Trump’s immigration agenda say there’s nothing troubling about Miller’s enormous involvement in DHS affairs. His supervision is necessary, they claim, since many career DHS officials appear bent on subverting the president. They add that Miler isn’t freelancing; he’s implementing an agenda outlined by the president himself.
“The only reason this might be unusual for immigration is because prior White Houses didn’t care about it to the extent that Trump’s does,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.
Krikorian added that “direct pressure from the White House is even more important because so much of the bureaucracy on the immigration issue is attempting to prevent the president's goals from being carried out.”
The White House and Miller did not respond to requests for comment.
Miller’s defenders at ICE and other parts of the administration say the 2017 executive order changing privacy law made it easier to defend the arrest or deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal histories."
Turmoil consumes White House team guiding feds’ tech strategy,www.politico.com,ERIC GELLER,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/22/federal-tech-strategy-spies-cybercriminals-1283773,"The White House team that ensures federal agencies build better technology and defend networks from hackers is plagued by cratering morale — jeopardizing efforts to modernize the government and protect sensitive data from spies and cybercriminals.
Few Americans may have heard of the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer , but the unit inside the Office of Management and Budget coordinates tech improvements across the government, helping agencies boost cybersecurity and manage technology and cybersecurity budgets that totaled $105 billion in the past fiscal year.
But many OFCIO employees are overwhelmed by unclear and changing priorities, while others are simply checked out or feeling increasingly marginalized, according to an internal February staff survey that POLITICO obtained, along with data from an annual governmentwide report and interviews with a current OMB employee, five former OFCIO employees and three former senior federal officials familiar with the office.
The unit is grappling with “high turnover,” “a lot of infighting,” a “crushing workload” and “inaction from leadership,” said the current employee, who — like others interviewed for this story — requested anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters.
“Things do slip through the cracks,” the OMB employee said. OFCIO’s guidance “impacts the long-term implementation strategy out in the agencies,” and if that’s lacking, there will be “a debilitating effect on overall cybersecurity in the long run,” the person said, adding that there was “real concern at the staff level that if this continues, something bad will happen and we won’t be ready for it.”
This employee is hardly a lone voice of discontent. Only 19 percent of OFCIO’s 30 employees expressed satisfaction with their workplace in February, down from 50 percent in October, one month before a reorganization that staff said “failed to address underlying problems,” according to the survey summary obtained by POLITICO.
By comparison, in a governmentwide 2018 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, no agency received a combined “satisfied” and “very satisfied” rating below 57.7 percent. The average for all agencies was 68.3 percent.
While the nature of the job — protecting federal computer networks from hackers — means that OFCIO can be a high-stress environment, people familiar with the office say the situation has become untenable.
“This organization looks like it’s in free fall,” said a former senior federal IT official who worked closely with the office.
OMB declined to make Federal CIO Suzette Kent available for an interview.
In a statement, OMB deputy director of communications Jacob Wood said recent changes at OFCIO “have not affected the team’s ability to produce results” and that the office has been “transparent and accessible with federal agencies, industry leaders, as wells as stakeholders.” He declined to respond to nearly a dozen specific concerns about the current situation.
Federal Chief Information Security Officer Grant Schneider, who reports to Kent, dismissed the reports of debilitating morale issues. “I don’t necessarily agree with it,” he said after a national security conference this week.
“There has been some confusion” in the office, he said, but the way to fix it is to get the “relatively small team” together and “focus on the important work and the opportunities that we have in front of us.”
“I think we’ve got an exciting mission,” Schneider added. “I think it’s a great place to work.”
But POLITICO’s reporting revealed just the opposite consensus, based on interviews and the survey.
In particular, a November reorganization appeared to cause significant confusion and discontent among employees. It replaced a structure built around three core units — agency oversight, cybersecurity and policy development — with one centered on “ workstreams ” for activities such as cybersecurity risk and data strategy.
But the reorganization was “built on the fly” and poorly explained, said a former staffer. More than 80 percent of survey respondents said it was unclear how the reorganization improved office communication.
Adding to these woes is significant frustration with OFCIO’s senior leaders, especially Kent, a former Ernst & Young consultant who took over the office in March 2018 after the team went more than a year without a leader.
Kent, who lacks a cybersecurity or IT background, has fostered “a closed-door culture,” the current OMB employee said.
“You are not allowed to email Suzette directly. You are not allowed to engage senior leadership directly. So, it’s very hard to move things up,” this person said. Employees are told not even to walk by Kent’s office and knock on her door to talk. “You can say hi to her, but that’s the extent of it.”
More than 80 percent of survey respondents said senior leaders didn’t regularly share information about their mission and failed to establish a clear direction for the office. Employees overwhelmingly said senior leaders didn’t effectively communicate priorities or inspire “confidence and enthusiasm.”
The staffer contrasted the current situation to the environment under Tony Scott, the Obama administration’s final federal CIO. “You could stop by, you could interact with him,” said the staffer. “He would, on a weekly basis, take people to get froyo in the Navy Mess Hall. That’s night [and day] compared to what Suzette does.”
Distance between OMB senior executives and career employees has always existed, said a former senior federal cyber official, but “the more successful officials” were able to “bridge that divide.”
With a staff of only 30 people, OFCIO cannot formulate every policy, complete every project, oversee every agency IT program and help fix every security issue in the federal government. Certain tasks must be put on the back burner; other tasks need more or fewer resources. But Kent hasn’t made these priorities clear, according to the people interviewed by POLITICO, who added that because so few employees can talk to her, the rest are left wondering how to triage their work.
One former senior OMB IT official, who speaks regularly with current OFCIO employees, reported “a sense in the staff that today one thing’s a priority and then the wind blows a different way and the next day something else is a priority.”
The uncertainty is having real consequences, said the former senior federal IT official. “When folks keep on hearing that everything’s the No. 1 priority, nothing gets done.”
The poor communication inside OFCIO has led to some surprising indignities.
“You have to look in the news to find out someone’s been appointed,” said the current OMB staffer. They and another source said OFCIO employees learned about Schneider’s appointment through a Nextgov article .
The same is true of policy changes, according to sources and survey data. Some policies have reached OFCIO through their OMB budget colleagues.
“I’ve heard from more than one person that they might get a call the night before or the morning of some major announcement and they’re asked to support it,” said the former senior OMB IT official, “and it comes as a total surprise to them.”
“It’s frustrating to be marginalized or to be surprised constantly by things that are going on around you,” this person said, “and in some cases things that you’re supposed to be directly responsible for.”
In the survey, 69 percent of employees said they lacked “the opportunity to be involved in decisions that affect my work.”
The turmoil follows more than a year of efforts to make improvements. OMB hired a consulting firm to study the office, according to two people. OFCIO also created a Staff Advisory Committee, which produced the February survey and plans to do others every few months.
“There’s been so much effort put into this,” said the current employee. “And this is the end result. It’s bewildering to say the least.”
The February survey, which includes data from 16 of OFCIO’s 30 employees, mirrors data gathered for the 2018 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. OFCIO employees consistently reported the most negative answers of any OMB unit in response to statements such as “I know what is expected of me on the job” and “My agency is successful at accomplishing its mission.”
Beyond OMB, other agencies also reported significantly more positive answers.
A few former OFCIO employees downplayed complaints. “Some folks are going to be disgruntled no matter where they are,” said one. “It’s part of the bumps that come along with any transition to something else.”
But others said the latest problems are particularly acute. The 19-percent satisfaction level in the February survey “is extraordinarily low,” said one former staffer.
Given the current woes, it’s unclear whether OFCIO will be able to recruit the best IT and cyber experts, several people told POLITICO.
“Either you don’t fill [open spots] and the work just gets spread around to fewer people ... or you end up recruiting people who don’t have the right skill sets for those positions,” said the former senior federal cyber official. “That harms the effort to modernize federal IT systems and to do it in an effective and a secure way.”
The survey summary said that “[w]ithout a substantial improvement in morale, these responses appear to predict significant challenges with retention of current staff and recruitment of new talent.”
OFCIO is “losing people every month,” the current OMB employee said. Kelly Morrison, who leads the “business management” workstream that oversees agencies’ IT capital planning and data reporting, is leaving at the end of April, according to the employee. (Morrison declined to comment.)
“People will always want to come and get the experience,” this person said. “But it will take [OFCIO] longer to recruit and hire folks.”
A former staffer predicted that Kent, a veteran of corporate transformations, would “address these issues head-on.”
Until that happens, the current employee said, “this is going to either get even worse or stay dysfunctional like it is right now.”"

“What followed, generally, was conspicuous silence — and not just from her colleagues in Congress. After sidestepping the explosive issue of impeachment for months by citing the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, most of the other 17 Democratic presidential candidates have responded to the special counsel’s report with tentative remarks about impeaching Mr. Trump, demands for the unredacted Mueller findings, calls for further hearings or attempts to simply change the subject.
“Anything, that is, to avoid clearly answering the question of whether lawmakers should remove the president from office. … ‘We reinforce his Teflon-ness by buying into this,’ said Jennifer Palmieri, a former senior aide to Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama. ‘Whether or not he’s Teflon is up to you, as a member of Congress.’” NYT … A1 PDF
OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND ON CAPITOL HILL, where this is a reality, not a theoretical exercise for people looking to curry favor with a narrow electorate, this issue will come to the fore today when Speaker NANCY PELOSI gathers House Democrats on a conference call to discuss the Mueller report. Inevitably, whether it’s brought up directly or not, their impeachment dilemma will be top of mind for many Democrats.
OF COURSE, Pelosi has been exceedingly cautious about the prospect of impeachment, partially as a tool to help her lawmakers fend off endless questions -- and pressure -- about removing the president.
JMART AND MATT laid out the practical and political considerations for 2020 candidates, and there’s a similar incentive structure for Democrats on the Hill:
PRACTICALLY, there’s next to zero chance Congress will be able to remove President DONALD TRUMP from office. We already know what’s in the Mueller report, and not a single Senate Republican seems put off. (Even MITT ROMNEY urged everyone to move on.) Twenty of them would need to have their hair on fire to remove Trump from office.
POLITICALLY, impeachment would be a messy, all-consuming process that would grind legislation to a halt. Democrats have said on repeat that they were elected not to impeach the president, but rather to lower prescription drug prices and enact other policies to help working Americans. All of that would go nowhere if Democrats were impeaching Trump.
IT WILL BE TEMPTING to listen to every Democrat opine about impeachment. Don’t. Only a few matter.
WHO TO WATCH … Outside of PELOSI and House Majority Leader STENY HOYER (D-Md.), a few voices will carry real heft:
-- 1. House Judiciary Chairman JERRY NADLER (D-N.Y.). His committee would conduct impeachment.
-- 2. House Oversight Chairman ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-Md.). Cummings is one of the most measured and well-respected members of the caucus. He is a public face, but not a TV blowhard.
-- 3. House Democratic Caucus Chairman HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-N.Y.). Jeffries is seen by some as the speaker in waiting. He’s on Judiciary and in the leadership, and a top messenger for Democrats. He won’t go out on a limb without knowing what the leadership thinks.
TRUMP RESPONDS -- @realDonaldTrump at 6:35 p.m.: “How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

SCOOP -- ALEX ISENSTADT: “Trump wins over big donors who snubbed him in 2016”: “Deep-pocketed Republicans who snubbed Donald Trump in 2016 are going all in for him in 2020, throwing their weight behind a newly created fundraising drive that’s expected to dump tens of millions into his reelection coffers.
“The effort involves scores of high-powered businessmen, lobbyists and former ambassadors who raised big money for George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney — and who are now preparing to tap their expansive networks for Trump after rebuffing his first presidential bid.
“The project, which is closely modeled after the famed Pioneers network that helped to fuel Bush’s 2000 campaign, is slated to be formally unveiled on May 7, when well-connected Republican fundraisers from around the country descend on Washington for a closed-door event with Trump 2020 aides. Under the plan, which was described by more than a half-dozen party officials, high-performing bundlers who collect at least $25,000 for Trump Victory, a joint Trump 2020-Republican National Committee fundraising vehicle, will earn rewards like invitations to campaign-sponsored retreats, briefings and dinners.

“Welcome to the campaign of Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old Indiana mayor who has suddenly become one of the hottest names in the Democrats’ presidential primary season.

“In an interview, Buttigieg conceded that his supporters across the country have essentially had to ‘organize themselves’ so far. ‘We need to make sure we have the organizational strengths to sustain this wave of support that we’ve been getting for the last almost month and a half now,’ he said. ‘It’s created some challenges to rise this far this fast, but I would put those in the category of a good problem to have.’” AP

Reagan’s Supply-Side Warriors Blaze a Comeback Under Trump - Magazine,www.politico.com,Ben Schreckinger,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/22/reagan-trump-economy-226704,"On a Tuesday evening earlier this month, several dozen Washingtonians gathered in a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel, ostensibly to enjoy an open bar and watch a new PBS documentary about money. In reality, the event also served as a rally for a small clique whose fierce devotion to supply-side economics made them influential figures in the 1980s, and has won them renewed clout and access under President Donald Trump.
Invitations listed the hosts as Stephen Moore, a habitué of conservative think tanks, and Art Laffer, the supply-side economist, who did not end up attending. Larry Kudlow, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council and one of the president’s closest advisers, showed up in a pinstriped suit. “Larry Kudlow is my best friend in the world,” gushed Moore in opening remarks, noting that Laffer and Kudlow served as co-best men at his wedding to his second wife, Anne, who sat in the front row. Taking the floor next, Kudlow gazed out at the room and offered a shoutout to Adele Malpass, a RealClearPolitics reporter and former chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party, whose husband, David, has just taken over as president of the World Bank on Trump’s say-so.
Next up came publishing executive Steve Forbes, co-author of the book that inspired the evening’s documentary, “In Money We Trust,” which lays out a case for a hard money system, such as the gold standard, that its devotees believe is less susceptible to government manipulation. Forbes thanked Kudlow, adding, “We've been co-conspirators now for about 35 years.”
Those decades of free-market machinations are now paying off, as a quintet of Ronald Reagan administration alumni — Kudlow, Laffer, Forbes, Moore and David Malpass—united by undying affection for each other and for laissez-faire economics, have the run of Washington once more. Members of the tight-knit group have shaped Trump’s signature tax cut, helped install each other in posts with vast influence over the global economy, and are working to channel Trump’s mercantilist instincts into pro-trade policies. Blasted by their critics as charlatans and lauded by their acolytes as tireless champions of prosperity, there’s no denying that the quintet has had an enduring impact on decades of economic policy.
Most recently, in late March, and partly at Kudlow’s urging, Trump announced his intention to nominate Moore to one of two open seats on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the body that sets the tempo of the global financial system.
The announcement prompted protests from economists across the ideological spectrum—George W. Bush’s top economist, Harvard’s Gregory Mankiw, said Moore lacked the “intellectual gravitas” for the job—who warned that appointing Moore, a think-tanker with no Ph.D., would politicize the Fed. Soon, it emerged that Moore had made a mistake on a 2014 tax return that led the IRS to place a disputed $75,000 lien against him, and CNN dug up scathing comments Moore had made about Trump during the presidential primary.
Whether Moore can survive the scrutiny and pass muster with the Senate will be a test of the supply-siders’ renewed cachet. They believe they can pull it off.
“I understand there are imperfections,” Kudlow told POLITICO. “I think it can be worked out.""
***
While he undergoes vetting, Moore, over coffee at the Kimpton George Hotel on Capitol Hill, held forth with surprising candor about his pals and their relationship with Trump.
In the past, Moore has been openly critical of Trump’s trade and immigration stances, and as late as last fall wrote that Trump could be “sophomoric, impulsive and hurtful,” in a book, “Trumponomics,” that was co-authored by Laffer and featured a foreword by Kudlow.
Why could he get away with such criticism, when others in the president’s orbit often face reprisals?
“Because it’s true!” exclaimed Moore, who mostly lavished praise on Trump, and credited the president with bringing him around to a more confrontational approach to trade policies with China and Europe.
Moore described some of his recent conversations with Trump, which often turn to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
“I think his criticism of Powell is excessive and could be counterproductive,” Moore said, because it could actually provoke Powell to prove his independence by defying Trump’s wishes. Generally speaking, Trump wants Powell to keep interest rates low to decrease the chances of any economic slump before the president faces voters again next November.
Moore also recounted how he and Laffer, who began advising Trump in 2016, helped place Kudlow in his current posting.
Roughly a year into Trump’s term, as Trump’s first NEC director, Gary Cohn, prepared to depart the post, the duo sprang into action. Moore said that during this period, whenever he and Laffer engaged in their semiregular consultations with Trump, they would have some version of the following exchange:
“You know, Mr. President, you’re missing one thing,” Laffer or Moore would say.
“What is that?” Trump would ask.
“Larry Kudlow,” Laffer or Moore would tell him.
“We just drilled the message over and over,” Moore recalled. “‘Larry, Larry, Larry, Larry.’”
Laffer declined to detail his discussions with Trump, other than to confirm the pro-Kudlow campaign. ""I don’t think Steve should've told you that,” he said. “But that's true, yes.""
At the same time, Moore said, the pair worked the press. “We made a concerted effort to make it seem like a fait accompli that Larry would get the job.”
That included knifing a few of Kudlow’s rivals. “We had a campaign to say ‘this person’s completely unqualified,’” he said, though he declined to name their targets. “I think we took them down,” he added.
“It proves that in Washington, appearance is reality, sometimes,” Moore continued. “So that was highly effective.”
***
In various combinations, the group has been pushing the same agenda for decades.
Laffer, 78, said he first befriended Forbes, 71, in the 1970s at a series of weekly discussion gatherings at restaurants in New York that featured then- Wall Street Journal associate editor Jude Wanniski, a late apostle of supply-side theory.
During that same period, following the 1974 midterms, Laffer first drew his famous Laffer Curve — a representation of the idea that at a certain level of taxation, lowering taxes would theoretically spur enough growth that government revenue would actually rise—at a meeting near the White House with Wanniski, Dick Cheney, then an aide to President Gerald Ford, and Grace-Marie Arnett, another free marketeer active in Republican politics.
Reagan would go on to fully embrace supply-side theory, a shift from the party’s traditional emphasis on fiscal discipline, appointing Laffer to his Economic Policy Advisory Board.
Then as now, supply-side economics was criticized for favoring the rich and derided by critics as unrealistic “Voodoo Economics.” The critics got an early boost from a 1981 Atlantic cover story in which Reagan’s budget director, David Stockman, aired his doubts that this novel theory was working in practice.
The piece ruined Stockman’s standing with Reagan—Laffer calls him “the traitor of all traitors”—but Stockman’s young aide, Kudlow, now 71, remained a loyal supply-sider and struck up a relationship with Laffer.
Reagan would go on to appoint Forbes as the head of the Board of International Broadcasting, which oversaw Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe, and Moore worked as the research director for Reagan’s privatization commission. Malpass, meanwhile, worked in Reagan’s Treasury department. Representatives for Forbes and Malpass said they were not available for interviews.
In the 1988 presidential primary, another supply-sider, the late New York congressman Jack Kemp, lost out to George H.W. Bush, curtailing the crew’s influence within the party.
But they stuck together. Moore, now 59, first became close with Laffer and Kudlow in 1991, after he recruited them to participate in an event celebrating the 10-year anniversary of Reagan’s first tax cuts for the libertarian Cato Institute.
In 1993, Kudlow and Forbes teamed up to craft a tax cut plan for New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Christine Todd Whitman, who went on to unseat incumbent Democrat James Florio.
Meanwhile, Kudlow hired Malpass to work for him at Bear Stearns, where he had been flying high as the investment bank’s chief economist.
The next year, Kudlow crashed to earth—he left the bank and entered rehab for alcohol and cocaine addiction. Laffer stuck by Kudlow, hiring the investment banker to work for his consulting firm in California when he emerged.
In 1996, Forbes, backed by Moore, entered the Republican primary and lost out to Bob Dole, but the group takes credit for getting Kemp picked for the bottom half of that year’s ticket, which lost to incumbent Bill Clinton.
At some point, Forbes, Kudlow, Moore and Laffer became inseparable in the eyes of their peers.
""You could call them the Four Musketeers of the supply-side movement,” said Avik Roy, an editor at Forbes involved in some of the group’s advocacy. Or you could call them the “the supply-side Beatles,” as Moore does—or ""the four amigos,"" as anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist does. “There’s a fourness to them,” observed Jack Fowler, vice president of the conservative National Review.
Malpass, 63, who has maintained a lower public profile over the years, qualifies as something of a fifth musketeer.
""They're a little rat pack. There's no doubt about that,” said one New York financial world player who keeps in touch with the group. “They're all pretty straight guys. They're not criminals. They don’t do anything weird, outwardly. You know what I’m saying? They like talking about supply-side economics. They get hard talking about tax cuts.""
Whatever you call them, there’s no denying their impact on American society. The group has argued that the best way to manage the economy is to make life easier for the producers of goods and services—by limiting taxes and regulations—so that producers are incentivized to supply more of these goods and services to the market, and that taming deficits is less important than spurring growth.
Before Reagan took office and empowered the supply-siders, the top marginal federal income tax rate in the U.S. had remained somewhere north of 60 percent since the Great Depression. Under their influence, Reagan briefly pushed the top rate below 30 percent, and it has not returned to anything near the pre-Reagan status quo since then.
Before Reagan, the national debt-to-GDP ratio had been declining since World War II, thanks in large part to the old Republican school of fiscal discipline. Since Reagan, the debt ratio has been climbing back toward its wartime peak. Trade and migration barriers have also come down. American society has become both wealthier in real GPD terms and more unequal. These trends have persisted thanks to a post-Cold War, bipartisan free market consensus, and to the bipartisan Keynesian response to the last financial crisis—but it was the supply-siders who really got the party started.
And they have not stopped partying since. Members of the group have continued to actively socialize with each other over the decades, with some spending New Year’s eves together. At one birthday party for Laffer in New York, they presented the aging economist with a signed poster of the Jedi master Yoda. ""I’m short, a little bit fat. I've got big, green ears,” Laffer explained. “I look sort of like Yoda.""
In 2015, Forbes, Laffer, Kudlow and Moore created the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, a group intended in part to counter the emergence of the “Reformicons,” a rival gang of Republican eggheads who felt the party had gone too far in the direction of laissez-faire policies favoring the rich.
Among the other 29 committee members listed in a press release were both Malpasses, Kevin Hassett, now chairman of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, and Andy Puzder, who was Trump’s initial pick for labor secretary until allegations of domestic abuse unearthed by POLITICO derailed his nomination.
The group sought, with considerable success, to vet Republican presidential candidates for their supply-side credentials and to influence their platforms, holding large private dinners at Manhattan venues such as the Four Seasons and the 21 Club, so that committee members and other notable invitees—like Rudy Giuliani and Roger Ailes—could feel out the candidates.
Before meeting with the larger group, candidates would huddle with the committee’s founders to receive economic tutorials. Or in the case of Ohio Governor John Kasich, to give one. “We were all sitting there, and he would talk for an hour,” Moore recalled. “We’re like, ‘No, we’re supposed to be talking to you,’ and he’s talking to us.” Moore called the episode “Classic John Kasich.”
Though the events were supposed to be off the record, journalists often attended, and an otherwise lackluster February 2015 dinner for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker made headlines when Giuliani barged in, proclaimed he did not believe that President Barack Obama “loves America,” and insisted a POLITICO reporter could print the quote.
Almost every serious Republican candidate participated in the dinners—but when Trump’s campaign first came calling early in the mogul’s bid, Moore said the committee passed.
“It just seemed like a joke to me that he was even running. I was like, ‘No, we’re a serious organization,’” he recalled. In hindsight, Moore said, “That was stupid.”
Meanwhile, Trump defied the committee’s free market orthodoxy on issues like trade and immigration, drawing public criticism from both Moore and Kudlow, and feuded with the laissez-faire Club for Growth, which Moore had co-founded in the late ’90s.
At the same time, Kudlow—who spent two decades in media as a National Review editor and CNBC host—was also eyeing a 2016 Senate run in Connecticut, but he did not jump in.
As the voting started, it became clear that Trump was emerging as the likely nominee, but he continued to have trouble attracting experienced advisers. In March 2016, then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski invited Kudlow and Moore to meet with Trump at the candidate’s midtown office. (Laffer—who moved from California to Tennessee in 2006 for tax reasons—had already met with Trump and begun advising the campaign on a tax plan.)
The duo hit it off with the apparent nominee, and Trump asked them to help refine his tax proposal, which he had first unveiled in September 2015. According to “Reagonomics,” Trump wanted the pair to make his plan “bigger and more beautiful” than Reagan’s tax cut, but he also needed to trim the projected cost of his original proposal, which was about $9 trillion. The populist Steve Bannon, the book says, pushed Trump to trim the cost by jacking up his original plan’s top income tax rate. The supply-siders fought back, making charts for Trump that showed when Reagan slashed taxes on the wealthy, the share of tax revenue paid by the top 1 percent actually went up. Ultimately, Trump’s new proposal reflected a compromise position between the two camps, with a top tax rate that was higher than the original plan’s, but lower than the current effective rate.
At the March meeting, Trump also mentioned he was planning a trip to Capitol Hill to confer with congressional Republicans. Moore had heard a similar recent meeting with lawmakers had gone badly—they complained Trump was “arrogant”—and suggested that he and Kudlow, who personally knew much of the caucus, accompany the candidate to help “break the ice.”
Apart from a confrontation between Trump and Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, Moore said the approach “worked like a charm.”
After Trump won, the trio continued to advise on the tax plan. Kudlow and Moore pushed the plan on Capitol Hill, drawing on the same relationships with Senate Republicans that they hope will ensure a smooth nomination process for Moore. Malpass, who had begun advising Trump during the campaign and then went into the Treasury Department, also helped craft the plan.
After the tax bill’s passage in December 2017, Laffer and Moore turned their attention to their campaign to install Kudlow in the White House, which succeeded last March. (Two other members of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, the grocery and real estate billionaires John and Margo Catsimatidis, were dining with Kudlow and his wife at the Italian restaurant Cipriani when Trump called to formally offer Kudlow the job.)
Once inside, Kudlow returned the favor, ensuring that Moore’s and Laffer’s writings regularly made their way to Trump’s desk.
The supply-siders began pushing Trump on trade, advising him to encourage a lowering of trade barriers on all sides, rather than raising them. Last June, Kudlow persuaded Trump to float the idea of the world governments eliminating all tariffs at a G-7 summit in Quebec.
Last month, Kudlow showed Trump an op-ed co-authored by Moore in the Wall Street Journal that criticized Powell. The op-ed reportedly pleased Trump so much that it prompted him to offer Moore the Fed job.
Kudlow also championed his former Bear Stearns protege’s World Bank ascension. “For Malpass, I worked very, very hard,” he said.
Moore has predicted that Malpass will gradually bring the supply-side gospel to the World Bank, which influences the economic policies of governments around the world.
***
To their friends, the prospect of the rat pack getting back at the economic levers is wonderful. ""The economy is the best it's been in a long time!"" John Catsimatidis exclaimed.
But critics deride the group as intellectually inconsistent, water-carriers for the rich, and just plain wrong.
“At least Trump, [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell, and [House Minority Leader Kevin] McCarthy will have one less thing to have to worry about—whether their economists will be sufficiently supportive of what they decide the plan that holds their political coalition together will be,” wrote the University of California, Berkeley economist Brad DeLong, who served in Clinton’s Treasury Department, in an email.
DeLong described Moore as “execrable,” saying he has changed his tune on interest rates since the Obama administration to accommodate Trump’s agenda.
Critics also contend that supply-side is little more than a euphemism for “pro-rich” economics. ""They all have the same line of thinking and they all support the same line of argument,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic consultant in New York. “The end result has been the greatest level of toxic inequality since the Great Depression.""
And proof of the group’s core claim—that slashing taxes and regulations is the best path to growth—remains elusive.
The fund manager Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management, has long been friends with Kudlow, who attended his son’s wedding. ""I'm a great fan of Larry 'Kuddles' Kudlow,"" said Kass, alluding to the former investment banker’s warm personality. But he is not impressed with the predictive power of the group’s ideas.
“The core foundation, the concept of supply-side economics, at least based upon the empirical evidence,” Kass said, “is something between no success and a disaster.”
***
Though the group has failed to win over most academics and practitioners, it has had far more luck with its constituency of one inside the Oval Office. Part of the group’s success stems from its tendency to play nice with all sides of the president’s fractious orbit.
Kudlow has butted heads with Peter Navarro, Trump’s director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, over Navarro’s anti-Wall Street rhetoric and hawkish approach to trade negotiations with China. But in general, the supply-siders get high marks for affability, even from those who believe their theories are baloney.
Laffer and Kudlow thank both Bannon and Ivanka Trump in the acknowledgement of “Reagonomics.” And though Bannon’s populist impulses clash with the musketeers' pro-market views, Bannon’s public relations manager, Republican operative Alexandra Preate, has simultaneously been instrumental in running the Committee to Unleash Prosperity.
“I don’t do factions, man,” Kudlow explained. “We're the faction that's in favor of Trump's policies. That's the faction I identify with."""

QUICK FIX The impeachment conundrum — Wall Street may not take the idea of a Donald Trump impeachment seriously. Because even if House Democrats do it, Trump would almost certainly win a Senate trial. But it’s a real dilemma for Democrats. The base demands Democrats at least hold impeachment hearings on Robert Mueller’s obstruction findings.

But Trump warned on Sunday that Democrats would pay “big time” if they continue to investigate issues brought out in the Mueller report. And he could be right. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll found Trump’s approval rating down to 37 percent after the Mueller report but just 40 percent said Trump should be removed.
The Democrats likely move — Impeachment would be a huge risk. Doing nothing would be dangerous as well. So expect hearings and lots of efforts to keep the focus on Mueller and obstruction. But do not expect the House to formally vote out articles of impeachment. So far Sen. Elizabeth Warren is the only 2020 Democrat to call for impeachment but others will be under pressure to take a stand as well. (More below).
Solid GDP coming? — Friday brings the first look at Q1 GDP and after initially looking bad it should come in above 2 percent. So not a terrible headline for Trump. Q2 could be a different story.
Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “The U.S. consumer is back on track, almost. … We have never bought the idea that the past few months represent the end-of-cycle weakening in consumption. That idea is impossible to square with robust growth in payrolls, increasing wage gains and elevated confidence.”

WHAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD DO — Veteran consultant Paul Equale emails: “Impeachment is a mistake. In 1973, there were 56 Democrats in the U.S. Senate. The path to Nixon’s conviction was not certain, but clearly within reach and Republican Leader Hugh Scott was no Mitch McConnell . Today there are 48 Democrats in the Senate and we are in a far more partisan and polarized political environment, making it extremely difficult to gain a conviction.
""The best argument for not impeaching him is that it serves Trump’s interests to be a political martyr. A far better strategy, both for short-term politics and history, is for him to be defeated at the polls in 2020 and forced to face the delayed justice surely awaiting him when he leaves office. Nancy Pelosi knows all of this and more. Dems could have no better field general for the current moment.”

WAGE GROWTH KEY FOR TRUMP — The Hill’s Niv Elis: “Trump’s re-election prospects may turn on one key economic indicator: wages. Trump has argued that the 2020 election will come down to the economy, and even tweeted this week that his eventual Democratic opponent will have ‘to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)!' …

HUD LOOKS TO REIN IN DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE — Our Victoria Guida: “The Department of Housing and Urban Development is moving to rein in government entities that provide homebuyers with down payment assistance for Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages, citing the rising risk of defaults.
“In a letter to lenders … HUD said it would require new documentation to verify that any entity offering such assistance is acting in its ‘governmental capacity,’ a move that effectively limits the scope of assistance they can offer. … Down payment assistance is designed for homebuyers who can afford monthly payments but don’t have enough money to put down for the initial purchase” Read more .
FLY AROUND INVESTORS WONDER WHEN TO GET OUT — WSJ’s Ira Iosebashvili: “Major U.S. stock indexes are approaching fresh records, leaving investors with a difficult choice: Lock in this year’s startling gains or hang on for the ride. The S&P 500 is on track for the best four-month start to the year in more than three decades, gaining 16 percent to be less than 30 points from a record. The index’s surge surprised many Wall Street banks that expected a much slower rebound from 2018’s turbulent finish.
“Yet the gains have stalled in recent weeks, with swings and trading volumes dropping to their lowest levels in months. Many fund managers are holding back from adding to stock allocations or even reducing them, worried that the volatility that buffeted markets at the end of last year could return if a recent cautious shift by central banks fails to bolster global growth or if global trade frictions rise.” Read more .

THE TECH IPOS DELIVERING THE MOST FOR INVESTORS — WSJ’s Rolfe Winkler: “Consumer-focused businesses may have more cachet, but technology startups that cater to companies are what is really hot. Until recently, few people outside the corporate IT department had heard of Zoom Video Communications Inc., a specialist in videoconferencing software for companies.
“Still, the company, which counts tens of thousands of business customers, overshadowed better-known Pinterest Inc., which claims some 265 million monthly users of its online pinboards, when the two companies made their debuts on the stock market Thursday.” Read more .
FINANCIAL MARKET ‘PAUSE PARTY’ MAKES RATE CUT LESS LIKELY — Reuters’ Howard Schneider and Trevor Hunnicutt: “Risk-taking has been the rage since the Federal Reserve quit hiking interest rates at the end of last year. U.S. stocks are back near record highs and investors are stockpiling the lowest-grade corporate bonds with only a smidgen of extra compensation for the added risk.
“That rebounding mood on Wall Street may be welcomed by a president that has been demanding the Fed cut rates after markets fell sharply last year, and complaining that even pausing at the current level is the wrong call. But if anything the ‘pause party’ on Wall Street makes it even less likely that the U.S. central bank will cut rates.” Read more .
FED OFFICIALS WEIGH THRESHOLDS FOR RATE CUTS — WSJ’s Nick Timiraos: “Federal Reserve officials are starting to talk about the conditions under which they would cut interest rates, including a scenario where inflation drifts lower even if the economic growth doesn’t falter.
“Such a scenario isn’t seen as particularly likely, and a rate cut isn’t imminent or under consideration for their meeting April 30-May 1. But the thresholds for such action have been a topic of conversations in recent interviews and public remarks.” Read more .

DEMS PLOT NEXT MOVES AFTER MUELLER -- More freshmen jump on the impeachment bandwagon -- SETH MOULTON JOINS 2020 RACE -- Reparations debate gains steam in House,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2019/04/22/dems-plot-next-moves-after-mueller-more-freshmen-jump-on-the-impeachment-bandwagon-seth-moulton-joins-2020-race-reparations-debate-gains-steam-in-house-427235,"with an assist from Andrew Desiderio MAKING MUELLER MOVES -- Now that the dust has started to settle after last week’s release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, Democrats will try to figure out how to move forward. House Democrats, who are in the middle of a two-week recess, will hold a conference call later today so the caucus can start to plot their next steps and sharpen their strategy in a post-Mueller world. Per a Dem aide, the call is expected to focus on the ""need to see the full report and need to hear from Mueller ASAP.""
Story Continued Below
Democrats have already made some strategic moves, formally issuing a subpoena on Friday for the full report and all its underlying materials — an immediate top priority for the caucus. And (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also rejected an offer from the DOJ to view a less-redacted version of the report, arguing that every lawmaker has a right to view the entire report, including sensitive grand jury information. Democrats don’t want to give the DOJ any ammo in court to block the report’s full release.
And Democrats have also got the ball rolling on some congressional hearings. Attorney General William Barr is already slated to testify on Capitol Hill May 2 and 3, while Democrats are in preliminary talks to bring in Mueller, reports Kyle. And House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he will call in former White House counsel Don McGahn, who emerged as a central figure in the report’s section on potential obstruction of justice.
But Democrats still need to tackle some thornier questions, such as: How hard will they go after Barr and Mueller in hearings? Would Democrats be willing to put any of Trump’s family members in the hot seat? And how do they handle the stickiest question of them all: impeachment? “I think it's a very difficult decision, and we're going to have a caucus about this over the next couple of weeks to try to figure out what the best course is, not for the party, but what's the best course for the country,” House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said of impeachment on Fox News Sunday.

(SOME) NEED TO IMPEACH -- The reactions to Mueller’s report are still trickling in, and several new Democrats have jumped on the impeachment bandwagon. That includes Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), though as the New York Times notes , none of her fellow 2020 hopefuls have joined her yet. And the entire progressive “squad” of House freshmen are now all on board with impeachment, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.). While it’s still a small contingent calling for the “I” word in the House, the group collectively has a huge megaphone and tremendous star power on the left — and that could create some serious headaches for Pelosi.
Meanwhile, on the GOP side, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah gave the harshest rebuke of Trump, saying he was “sickened” by the president’s actions that were detailed in the report. (Trump, of course, hit back on Twitter.) Other Republicans have proceeded more cautiously, with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) saying the findings offered “an unflattering portrayal of the president” and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) saying the report “documents a number of actions taken by the president or his associates that were inappropriate.” More from Quint Forgey: https://politi.co/2Iyv8p0 .

MEET MR. MALINOWSKI -- In a freshman class that includes liberal firebrands like AOC and Ilhan Omar, it can often be difficult for some lesser known members to break through the noise. But Tom Malinowski is trying to do just that, on the complicated issues of foreign policy and national security. The former Obama State Department official has already clashed with Mike Pompeo over the Trump administration’s foreign policy.
Now, he’s seeking to become the Democrats’ go-to authority on foreign-policy issues, while also tending to the signature need of his red district: the Gateway Tunnel. Building a public profile around foreign-policy and national security issues is a daunting task in any era.

Why lawmakers, lobbyists and officials are optimistic: Pelosi and the White House have already been in talks over the issue, while the GOP’s politics around drug pricing have evolved over the years.

Should authenticity matter in politics?,www.politico.com,MARY NEWMAN,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/22/should-authenticity-matter-in-politics-1284288,"As the list of Democrats running in 2020 continues to grow, candidates will be trying all kinds of tricks to stand out. The idea of “authenticity” always pops up during election cycles, and in the age of social media, when voters want to get to know politicians on a more personal level, being seen as authentic has become even more important.
“It’s a little hard to say what an ‘authentic’ politician is,” said Richard Skinner, who has a Ph.D. in American politics and has written about authenticity for the Brookings Institution and Vox. “Most of the time people just use it as a rationalization for liking or disliking a candidate.”
Former President George W. Bush was able to create a relatable image as a regular Texas cowboy, despite being the son of a president and the grandson of a senator, and having degrees from Yale and Harvard universities. The term authentic is defined as being true to one’s own character, spirit or personality — and in politics, voters have traditionally viewed charismatic white men as the most authentic.
“There's a long history of female politicians being portrayed as calculated and stiff because the script that we have for politicians is a male script,” Skinner said. “Oftentimes, woman candidates feel that they have to live up to expectations that were framed for men.”
As the 2020 candidates define their campaign messaging, voters can count on seeing the usual photo-ops at New Hampshire diners, the sports activities in ties and a big dose of awkward social media posts from home."

Trump ratchets up pressure campaign on Iran,www.politico.com,NAHAL TOOSI,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/22/trump-iran-sanctions-1284408,"President Donald Trump is no fan of high oil prices, knowing that pain at the gas pumps could cost him votes at the ballot box.
But on Monday, Trump took a step that risks that very scenario.
Story Continued Below
The Trump administration announced that it will no longer waive sanctions on any countries that import oil from Iran, one of the world’s top petroleum producers. The decision means that eight governments that had earlier been granted waivers, including China, India and Turkey, may face U.S. sanctions if they keep buying Iranian oil beyond May 2.
The move is designed to further weaken the Islamist regime in Iran, which Trump views as global menace. But it also illustrates how Trump‘s foreign and domestic priorities can sometimes clash.
Oil prices rose 3 percent Monday morning, hitting the highest level so far this year after news of the sanctions decision. The move is also expected to push U.S. gasoline prices up at least 10 cents a gallon in the lead up to the summer driving season, market analysts said.
The administration said it had prepared for such a scenario. To avoid a shortage in oil markets, the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia will adjust their own oil production, the White House said in a statement.
Trump, who just two months ago tweeted that oil prices were too high, downplayed the risks of his latest move on Monday.
“Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil,“ the president tweeted, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, an intergovernmental body that controls much of the world's oil production.
Still, there are any number of factors in play that could make Trump think twice in the months ahead.
For one thing, Saudi Arabia may decide higher oil prices would boost shares price for its giant state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, which is preparing for an initial public offering on the stock market. As a result, the Saudis may eventually choose not to ramp up production to offset the losses from Iran.
“There’s no mystery that Saudi Aramco is looking to file an IPO,” said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at fuel analyst website GasBuddy.com. “Keeping prices in check might clash with their own agenda.“
Even if Saudi Arabia increases its oil output, the light type of oil it exports isn’t the same “heavy oil” that flows out of Iran and would be needed by many refiners to replace the crude oil blocked by the sanctions.
Still, one of Saudi Arabia’s priorities is reducing Iranian influence in the Middle East, where Tehran backs an array of militias. The Saudi royal family has thus backed U.S. efforts to contain Iran.
In a statement Monday, a Saudi official said the country is “closely monitoring the oil market developments following the recent statement from the U.S. government regarding oil export sanctions on Iran. The Kingdom would like to reiterate its long-standing policy of working towards oil market stability at all times.
It promised, however, that: “Saudi Arabia will coordinate with fellow oil producers to ensure adequate supplies are available to consumers while ensuring the global oil market does not go out of balance.“
Other factors could affect oil prices in the coming months.
Refineries along the East Coast were already experiencing a spate of unplanned outages that have choked back gasoline production in the region to its lowest in years, according to government data. The new Iran sanctions could drive up competition — and the price — for the type of crude oil favored by refineries in Texas and Louisiana.
Then there’s the upcoming summer driving season, which means higher demand for gas in the United States.
“We’re going to see higher gasoline prices,” said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at financial analyst group Morningstar, adding that if prices rise too far and spark public outcry, the Trump administration may decide “they didn’t mean it after all” on the sanctions.
There’s also the possibility that some of the countries being told to cut off their Iranian oil imports may choose to ignore the sanctions threat. That could add confusion to the markets. China, for one, has given no indication of whether it will respect the U.S. demand.
“China opposes the unilateral sanctions and so-called ‘long-arm jurisdictions‘ imposed by the U.S.,“ the country’s foreign ministry spokesman said Monday. “Our cooperation with Iran is open, transparent, lawful and legitimate, thus it should be respected. Our government is committed to upholding the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and will play a positive and constructive role in upholding the stability of global energy market.“
State Department officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, would not say Monday exactly what sorts of sanctions they plan to impose on countries that ignore the U.S. demands. They kept insisting the waivers would not extend beyond May 2, and noted they’ve warned for months that this day was coming.
Pompeo pledged, however, that the U.S. will enforce sanctions in its quest to bring Iranian oil sales to zero. Foreign governments or companies that choose to do business with Iran risk the possibility of fines and being cut off from the U.S. market.
Those risks, Pompeo said, are “simply not going to be worth the benefits.“
He also painted the move as one aimed at ultimately helping the Iranian people rid themselves of their Islamist oppressors, despite the economic pain that the country, which has recently experienced devastating floods, is feeling as a result of U.S. economic pressure.
“I want the Iranian people to know that we are listening to them and standing with them,” the secretary of State said. He added that a decision to lift the sanctions will come once Iran‘s government stops its negative activities, such as its support for terrorism.
Since taking office, Trump has pursued a sanctions-heavy strategy aimed at undermining the Islamist leaders in Iran. As part of that, Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, a pact that rolled back global economic sanctions on the country in exchange for limits to its nuclear program.
The Trump administration also recently designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization, marking the first time the U.S. had named an element of a foreign state as a terrorist entity.
The Iranian government has denounced the sanctions. But even as the economic penalties have badly hurt its economy, Tehran has stuck to its commitment under the nuclear deal to restrict its atomic activities in the hopes that European partners can help it weather the U.S. blows.
Trump’s decision Monday got applause from Republican lawmakers, some of whom had urged him not to extend the waivers he’d already granted. Some noted that the move against Iran could benefit U.S. workers in the energy industry.
Nearly two dozen Republican senators — several of whom represent the major oil-producing states of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota — had sent a letter to Trump earlier this month asking him to end the sanctions waivers.
Bringing Iran oil exports to zero would hurt the regime “while promoting democracy and ushering in the era of American energy dominance,” the lawmakers wrote to Trump on April 4.
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas followed up with a statement of his own Monday.
“This decision will deprive the Ayatollahs of billions of dollars that they would have spent undermining the security of the United States and our allies, building up Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and financing global terrorism,” Cruz said, praising Trump."

Story Continued Below
— The latest clash brewing between and the states is over campus sexual assault , as legislators in multiple states push back against plans by DeVos to write a federal policy that would govern investigations at thousands of U.S. colleges and universities.
— State lawmakers are targeting teen vaping and Congress could soon join them , as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will make raising the age to buy tobacco a “top priority” when Congress returns next week.
WELCOME TO THE WORKING WEEK. THIS IS MORNING EDUCATION. Tips? Feedback? Let me know: bwermund@politico.com or @BenjaminEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES A LOOK AT EDUCATING INCARCERATED STUDENTS: The today is holding a day-long event in which Trump administration officials will hear from state and local officials about successful education initiatives for incarcerated students. It’s part of the “administration-wide goal of rethinking education for incarcerated individuals,” according to the announcement.
— That drive most notably includes support for expanding Pell Grants to students in prisons , something Congress outlawed in the 1990s. But there’s bipartisan growing support to scrap the ban as Congress rewrites the federal higher education law. The Obama administration began a pilot program to expand aid to some prisoners, and DeVos has continued it.
— Expected at today’s event are: Deputy Education Secretary Mitchell Zais; Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson; Heidi E. Washington, director, Michigan Department of Corrections; Amy Lopez, deputy director, D.C. Department of Corrections; and Steve Good, executive director, Five Keys Schools. It starts at 10 a.m. in the Barnard Auditorium in the Lyndon B. Johnson Building, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Watch a livestream .
MEANWHILE AT THE WHITE HOUSE: Frank Brogan, the department's assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education, is among officials slated to read to kids at the White House’s annual Easter Egg Roll today.
TITLE IX STATE CAMPUS SAFETY BILLS COULD CONFLICT WITH DEVOS’ TITLE IX RULES: Legislators in 19 states , from California to Massachusetts, are acting at the same time as a high-profile drive by that would for the first time create formal regulations for schools responding to sexual harassment and assault claims. Lawmakers are pushing bills on campus safety that in some cases are set to conflict with proposed federal regulations.
— The moves in state capitals again will test DeVos’ constant refrain that education issues are best left to the states. DeVos and state officials notably parted ways when she told them told they lacked the authority to crack down on predatory practices by some of the nation’s largest student loan companies. Elsewhere, has been at odds with states over everything from marijuana legalization to offshore drilling.
— If the bills cracking down on sexual assault pass, though, they could put colleges in those states in the difficult position of picking whether they obey state laws or federal rules. “That is a significant problem,” especially when there is “flat out conflict between what the state requires and what the proposed regulations require,” said Scott Schneider, a higher education attorney in Austin. We have the full story .
K-12 LAWMAKERS TARGET TEEN VAPING: When Congress returns next week, McConnell hopes to put teen vaping in lawmakers’ crosshairs as the Senate majority leader has said he plans to introduce legislation to raise the legal age to buy tobacco from 18 to 21, calling it a “top priority.”
— McConnell said he wants to change the law to discourage vaping and teenage nicotine addiction. “Their vaping products … these young people may not know what chemicals they are putting in their bodies,” he said recently in Louisville, Ky. “Far too often, 18-year-olds in high school can legally buy vaping devices and share them with their classmates.” Burgess Everett has more .
— It’s not just Congress. Lawmakers in several states — most recently Illinois and Washington — have passed bills to raise the age to buy tobacco products. Oklahoma’s governor recently signed a bill to ban vaping in schools.
— The moves come after the surgeon general called for “aggressive steps” to curb teen vaping. A recent survey showed 37 percent of high school seniors have tried vaping, up from just under 28 percent in 2017.
NEW THIS MORNING: Most K-12 teachers believe climate change is real and that it should be taught in schools, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll. Eighty-two percent of teachers think that the world’s climate is changing, compared to 74 percent of all Americans. However, more than half — 55 percent — of teachers don't teach or talk about climate change in their classrooms.
— Most parents also support their children learning about climate change , but just 45 percent say they have talked about the topic with their own children. There's somewhat of a partisan divide, though two-thirds of Republicans and 91 percent of Democrats support children learning about the issue in school. More .

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
Social shutdown in Sri Lanka — The government’s blocking of Facebook and other tech platforms following the Easter bombings is emblematic of the larger techlash across the globe.
Biden around the bend — With former Vice President Joe Biden likely to announce a 2020 run in the coming days, we’re taking note of the tech and telecom leaders supporting him.
New Markey pressure point — While Congress is in recess, Sen. Ed Markey called on tech CEOs to reflect on whether their companies encourage youth smoking.
GOOD MONDAY MORNING AND WELCOME BACK TO was sad to lose in my search for the afikomen and hunt for Easter eggs. (Sad realization that I am, perhaps, too old to compete.)
 , or follow my reporting on Instagram @alexandra.levine TRAGEDY IN SRI LANKA — The Sri Lankan government’s decision to block Facebook, WhatsApp and other social sites in the aftermath of the bombings on Sunday is another sign of global skepticism about the tech industry’s ability to moderate dangerous content, particularly amid the chaos of a national emergency. The explosions, which killed more than 200 people and injured hundreds more on Easter, came a month after the Christchurch mosque attack in New Zealand was livestreamed — leaving Facebook, Twitter and YouTube scrambling to react — and less than a week after the fire at Notre Dame in Paris triggered a rapid spread of misinformation and hoaxes across the same platforms. In each instance, technology exacerbated the chaos.
— What was different about the events in Sri Lanka was that the government took control of technology before technology could take control the situation. By shutting down Facebook and the like, authorities acted to prevent problems the world had witnessed many times recently (the viral spread of misleading information, graphic content and hate speech, inciting more violence) before they could happen. It was precautionary, not reactionary. “This was a unilateral decision,” Harindra Dassanayake, a presidential adviser in Sri Lanka, said, according to The New York Times .
— Even so, the takedown of a handful of social sites in Sri Lanka could only go so far; the conversation shifted instead to Twitter. “Please avoid propagating unverified reports and speculation,” said Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. “The government is taking immediate steps to contain this situation.” The Red Cross there, wrongly rumored to have been attacked, posted : “Please refrain from spreading unauthentic and false information on Social Media.” Finally, President Donald Trump responded with a tweet — to his 60 million followers — expressing condolences for the “ 138 million ” people killed in the bombings. (The population there is about 21 million.) The tweet stayed up for 20 minutes .
— We’re watching to see if the blockage could set a precedent for other countries in times of emergency. A statement on the Sri Lankan government’s official news portal said “the blockage would be effective until investigations were concluded.”
2020 CHATTER — Joe Biden is expected to announce his presidential campaign this week, and big-name supporters — including Comcast executive David Cohen — are already coming out of the woodwork to cheerlead. Cohen, a senior executive vice president and the chief diversity officer of the cable giant, is putting together a fundraiser in Philadelphia, likely to take place when Biden makes his run official, according to a report in The New York Times. What we’re watching: Who else from the tech and telecom world may back Biden’s run, and what that means for his stance on those industries’ major policy issues.
— Meanwhile, on the trail, with the release of the redacted Mueller report still fresh and details about Russia’s use of the internet to influence the 2016 election still top-of-mind, 2020 contenders are drawing attention to voter security and technology. “We must embrace paper ballots and upgrades to our election infrastructure in 2020,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “Russia and other foreign adversaries cannot hack a piece of paper like they can a computer.” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) echoed that sentiment, tweeting that the “first & most important thing we must do is institute b/up paper ballots by passing my Securing America’s Elections Act so no one can manipulate our votes & hack our elections #MuellerReport .”
MARKEY FOR THE KIDS — Sen. Markey (D-Mass.), a longtime advocate for protections around children and technology, sent letters during the congressional recess to a dozen tech CEOs questioning them about promoting youth smoking. (Among them were Larry Page at Google’s parent company, Alphabet; Jeff Bezos at Amazon; Tim Cook at Apple; and others at Netflix, Hulu and Disney.) The letters , signed also by Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), raise concern about the prevalence of tobacco imagery in on-demand digital content popular with young audiences, “especially on streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu.” They also highlight the fact that movie rating criteria do not take tobacco content into account. Markey’s letters come just a month after he and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) proposed expanding safeguards offered under COPPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
— The issues: “79 percent of shows popular with individuals aged 15 to 24 depict tobacco use,” the letters state, citing a 2018 report by the anti-tobacco nonprofit Truth Initiative. “The worst offenders, based on the number of tobacco incidents in 2016, include the widely watched shows Stranger Things, the Walking Dead, Orange Is the New Black, and House of Cards.” It continued: “These [youth tobacco use] findings have led the CDC and other public health experts to conclude that individual companies’ tobacco depiction policies are insufficient and that additional industry-wide measures are warranted.”
— The ask, 2 weeks away: The letters asked companies to provide comprehensive details about their policies around tobacco content and documentation of the shows’ or movies’ ratings, use of smoking imagery or dialogue, and viewership numbers by age. The due date: May 6.
WANTED BY GOOGLE: CONTENT EXPERTS — Google is expanding its roster of policy staff who contend with increasing calls from governments around the world to regulate online content. Derek Slater, Google’s global director of information policy, wrote in a LinkedIn post that his “new-ish” team will deal with issues including harmful content, disinformation, consumer protection, child safety and copyright. The company has so far posted job openings at its California headquarters and Singapore office, but Slater will be “canvassing for hires” in Washington and London, too. “The function of the team is to provide best-in-class subject matter expertise to our government affairs teams around the world.”

Coming today: HHS to announce new payment pilots,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2019/04/22/coming-today-hhs-to-announce-new-payment-pilots-592202,"With help from Rachel Roubein
QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— HHS is announcing new payment pilots today as the Trump administration continues to put its stamp on value-based care.
— Democrats' ""Medicare for All"" proposals would hammer the nation's hospitals , which rely on private insurance payments to help stay afloat.
— CMS is planning pay increases for nursing homes and hospices under proposed rules released on Friday.
WELCOME BACK TO MONDAY PULSE — Where your author is feeling a bit misty-eyed after last night's terrific episode of ""Game of Thrones."" (A spoiler-packed review .) What's not a spoiler: PULSE is expecting a lot of ICD-10 code W26.1 on next week's edition.
Winter is coming here. So is PULSE. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com .
Driving the Day COMING TODAY: NEW PAYMENT PILOTS FROM HHS — The Trump administration is unveiling more experiments intended to better reward health care providers for high-value care, Rachel Roubein and your PULSE scribe scooped.
HHS Secretary Alex Azar, alongside CMMI Director Adam Boehler and CMS Administrator Seema Verma, will make the announcement at the American Medical Association's Washington headquarters this afternoon. More for Pros .
— What will be announced: The administration will use CMMI to launch a new direct contracting model that effectively replaces the Next Generation ACO model — which was intended for providers experienced with coordinating care for populations of patients — and expands the range of potential participants.
HHS also is launching a project to care for seriously ill patients, which is intended to be part of an existing program, Comprehensive Primary Care Plus . Expect this idea to get considerable attention, given that it represents a novel effort to target some of the most complex — and expensive — Medicare patients.
— How to interpret today's news: HHS says that payment reform is among its major priorities — a point underlined by the presence of top political appointees at today's presser.
HHS also is facing a time factor: The window is shrinking for the Trump administration to announce projects, recruit participants and officially get them underway before the 2020 election. That's one reason why Boehler has tried to speed up CMMI's delivery and testing of models.
— What CMS says: An agency spokesperson confirmed that new payment models will be announced today, although declined to offer details.
""Building on the lessons learned from and experiences of prior models, the new initiative will reduce administrative burdens and empower primary care providers to spend more time caring for patients while reducing overall health care costs,"" the spokesperson told POLITICO.
— PULSE's question: Who will participate? It's hard to transform health care payments, given the industry's inertia — and it gets even harder when those payment pilots are optional.
HHS already has faced challenges when trying to recruit participants for recent payment demonstration projects. We'll be watching to see what kind of predictions HHS makes about participation.
— Meanwhile: More participants have left the Next Generation ACO model. There are 41 participants in the CMS model for 2019, down from 58 participants at the start of 2018, Maria Castelluci writes for Modern Healthcare.
HOW 'MEDICARE FOR ALL' WOULD HAMMER HOSPITALS — The proposals offered by Sen. Bernie Sanders and other Democrats to do away with private insurance could mean a major hit to thousands of hospitals if all payments are lowered to Medicare rates. As NYT's Reed Abelson writes , Medicare can often pay 40 percent less for the same procedures as private insurance.
Among the possible implications flagged by policy experts:
— Some rural hospitals and other financially vulnerable organizations ""would close virtually overnight,"" Abelson writes.
— Other hospitals would try to offset the cuts by laying off ""hundreds of thousands of workers"" or abandoning services like mental health, that offer relatively low reimbursement.
— But 'Medicare for All' advocates see it differently. Adam Gaffney, the president of Physicians for a National Health Program, argued that the plan will simplify hospital billing and operations by eliminating the complications of private insurance. As a result, Gaffney said, hospitals could save by scaling back administrative costs.
It's also possible that hospital payment could be structured in a way that wouldn't cut as deep.
— Reminder: 'There’s a hospital in every congressional district,' Stanford professor Kevin Schulman told the NYT, adding that those hospitals will fight efforts to see their pay cut.
— 'The politics may be harder than the policy,' Jonathan Cohn concurs in his own look at the issue in HuffPost.
INSIDE THE HUMPHREY BUILDING Medicare planning pay increases for nursing homes, hospices. CMS is proposing to raise Medicare payments for skilled nursing facilities by 2.5 percent, about $887 million, in fiscal year 2020, the agency announced Friday.
Last year, the agency finalized a new payment model set to take effect Oct. 1. Instead of paying for the amount of services provided, Medicare will instead determine payment by focusing on the patient’s condition and the level of care needed.
CMS in a separate rule proposed a 2.7 percent increase in hospice payments next year, or about $540 million. More for Pros .
BRENDAN FULMER to join HHS as an adviser to the secretary for value-based reform , working under Adam Boehler, POLITICO's Rachel Roubein reports. Fulmer, whose first day is April 29, previously was a senior legislative assistant to Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.).
AROUND THE NATION Florida: Opioid lawsuit imperiled as bill stalls in state Senate. A business lobbyist has moved to block a bill that would help a state opioid lawsuit against drugmakers and pharmacies — including Purdue Pharma, Walgreens and CVS — jeopardizing a potentially billion-dollar case against the industry, POLITICO Florida's Alexandra Glorioso reports.
With only two weeks left in the legislative session, a bill to give Attorney General Ashley Moody access to certain patient-level information from the state's drug database is stuck after Senate President Bill Galvano expressed concerns about patient privacy. Without the data, it could take Moody years and millions of dollars to gather evidence against the pharmacies.
IN THE COURTS The ACA markets were close to being struck down in King v. Burwell. That's one takeaway buried inside ""The Chief,"" a new biography of Chief Justice John Roberts written by CNN's Joan Biskupic. Roberts and then-Justice Anthony Kennedy initially ""vacillated"" on how to rule in the case, Biskupic writes .
King v. Burwell turned on language to allow private insurance subsidies in federally run exchanges; critics of the case said plaintiffs were essentially suing over a typo. Roberts and Kennedy ultimately sided with the court's liberal wing, ruling 6-3 to preserve the ACA's marketplaces in 2015.
… Scholars say it's a reminder that the Supreme Court's health care rulings remain unpredictable, even as the latest challenge to the ACA — which many legal experts have derided as baseless — heads to a lower appeals court.
""This is partially why people should not be overly confident that the Court will decisively reject the current challenge to the entire ACA,"" Leah Litman of UC Irvine School of Law tweeted .
WHAT WE'RE READING A measles outbreak in Northern California is testing health workers who were already stretched thin by the recent Camp Fire, Soumya Karlamangla writes for the Los Angeles Times.
UnitedHealth Group would be a more credible critic of ""Medicare for All"" if the health insurance giant hadn't largely abandoned the ACA markets too, the Star Tribune's Lee Schaefer writes .
Real policy — or just political cover? Republicans' promises to protect patients with pre-existing conditions pale next to current ACA coverage, the NYT's Robert Pear reports .
In Health Affairs, a team of researchers offers lessons from hospitals' voluntary price disclosure.

Who is the FBI talking to about backdoors? - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2019/04/22/who-is-the-fbi-talking-to-about-backdoors-592501,"With help from Eric Geller The FBI isn’t revealing which cryptography experts it claims to have spoken to about creating encryption backdoors. That just drew more criticism for the bureau.
— The Mueller report continues to reverberate. Subsequent revelations include details about a hacked voting vendor and Florida county breach.
— A man credited with neutralizing the WannaCry attack pleaded guilty to writing malware. He said he now uses the skills he misused when he was younger for good.
HAPPY MONDAY But where did it go? Send
Encryption NO THANKS — The FBI considers it inappropriate to identify the cryptography experts who allegedly told Director Christopher Wray that it is possible to build secure encryption backdoors. “Doing so might place those individuals or entities at greater risk, or undermine other security-focused efforts,” an FBI official told Sen. Ron Wyden , who asked Wray about those experts in January 2018 after Wray briefly mentioned hearing from them. The FBI’s refusal to elaborate, first reported by Gizmodo, is the latest defiant move by the agency on encryption, an area where it has recently suffered numerous embarrassments .
Cybersecurity experts were baffled about the FBI’s refusal to release the names of Wray’s sources, especially given that several of the researchers trying to accommodate the FBI’s demands — including former Microsoft executive Ray Ozzie — have publicly discussed their work. “They’ve put THEMSELVES out there,” tweeted Stanford cryptography expert Riana Pfefferkorn. “FBI’s professed concern about naming them is nonsense.” Johns Hopkins computer science professor Matthew Green offered one possible explanation to Gizmodo: “The biggest threat I can see is that a bunch of nerds might make fun of them on Twitter.”
IT’S A PARTY — The Atlantic Council on Tuesday is holding a big cybersecurity confab featuring top names from DHS, the FBI, the State Department and more. Former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, co-chair of the Global Commission for the Stability of Cyberspace, delivers the evening keynote. Chertoff will “emphasize the need to recognize the global reliance on cyberspace, the increasing dependence of other infrastructures on its reliability, and the potentially dramatic consequences of its disruption,” according to a summary of his remarks provided to MC.
MUELLER LEFTOVERS — The Russian intelligence breach of a Florida county government during the 2016 election, revealed in the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, wasn’t serious, The Washington Post reported, citing five current and former cybersecurity officials. The FBI notified the county, which decided against disclosing the breach, according to those officials. Florida Gov. Rick Scott demanded information from the FBI about what happened.
In a separate incident, VR Systems confirmed that it was the voting vendor that the Mueller report referenced as the victim of a Russian intelligence breach. The company makes electronic polling books. Still, some mysteries remain after the report’s release, and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler subpoenaed the unredacted version.
On Sunday, President Donald Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani defended the idea of campaigns receiving hacked materials . “There’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians,” he said, arguing that the public benefited from the disclosures. Despite the idea being hunky dory, Giuliani said he would have advised against it.
MALWARE BITES — The British cyber expert credited with stopping the WannaCry outbreak, Marcus Hutchins, pleaded guilty to charges that he created the Kronos malware. ""I regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes,” he said in a statement late last week. “Having grown up, I’ve since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes.” Hutchins faced 10 charges, but the plea agreement reduces that number to two.
HOW TO TEST YOUR APP — The technical standards agency NIST late last week released a new version of its publication on mobile application security. Revision 1 of Special Publication 800-163 “expands on the original document by exploring resources that can be used to inform an organization’s requirements for mobile app security,” NIST said . It also adds more details to the vetting system that the original document introduced: “Specifically, it better defines the inputs and outputs of each step involved in the process of app vetting” and “details how the process might be integrated into an organization’s general security posture.” The revision adds more information about current cyber threats to mobile apps and “aligns itself” with the latest industry and government best practices.
CYBERSPACE OF THE RISING SUN — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late last week that cyberattacks “in certain circumstances” count as armed attacks under a security treaty with Japan. Under the 1952 treaty, “Each Party recognizes that an armed attack against either Party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional provisions and processes.” At the joint press conference , Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said, “This is significant from the perspective of deterrence.”
 The Democratic National Committee appointed its first female chief technology officer, Nellwyn Thomas. … The inspector general of Health and Human Services issued a damning report on the department’s programs to protect sensitive data and networks.

Judge rebukes Trump on coal moratorium - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-energy/2019/04/22/judge-rebukes-trump-on-coal-moratorium-427276,"With help from Alex Guillén A federal judge delivered another blow to the Trump administration's energy agenda on Friday, ruling the administration failed to consider the environment when it lifted an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases.
— Hallador Energy Company , whose subsidiary is Rail Point Solutions, offered up new details over the weekend into Scott Pruitt's new lobbying role.
— The State Department will end the waivers that allowed some countries to skirt U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports, according to media reports.
HAPPY EARTH DAY! Stephen Brown of RBJ Strategies was the first to correctly name Harrisburg, Pa., as the city former President Barack Obama held a Passover Seder before he became president. For today: Which president was the first to send his child to public school? JUDGE SAYS LIFTING OF COAL LEASING MORATORIUM VIOLATED NEPA: A federal judge on Friday ruled that the Interior Department wrongly lifted the Obama-era coal leasing moratorium in 2017 without first studying the environmental impacts, a big blow for the Trump administration's efforts to support coal production.
Interior ""failed to take even the initial step of determining the extent of environmental analysis,"" wrote Judge Brian Morris of the U.S. District Court for Montana. Morris — who also recently blocked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline — said he would not prescribe what level of environmental review is required or what the outcome should be, but he said Interior can't just ignore the National Environmental Policy Act.
Despite Interior's misstep, Morris declined to immediately block federal coal leasing. Instead, he called on the Trump administration to negotiate a remedy with the environmentalists and blue states that brought the lawsuit. If they can't reach a deal — ME rates that as a distinct possibility — then Morris said he'll need more information on the current state of affairs, including how leases are affected by the moratorium, before deciding what to do, a process that will take some months. A spokesperson said Interior is reviewing the decision. She did not answer questions about how many federal leases have been granted in the past two years.
The ruling is the latest in a series of recent legal setbacks for the Trump administration, including the earlier order from Morris halting the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, and another that blocked the move to undo an Obama-era ban on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean and specific parts of the Atlantic Ocean.
AROUND THE AGENCIES EGG ON: EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is expected to be among the Trump administration officials at the White House today for the annual Easter Egg Roll.
SOME PRUITT QUESTIONS ANSWERED: Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's new gig as a lobbyist in Indiana on behalf of Rail Point Solutions LLC will center on protecting ratepayers from rate increases as Vectren and NIPSCO, two of the state's utilities, plan to retire coal-generating plants over the next few years.
Hallador Energy Co., the parent of Rail Point, said in a recent release that Pruitt was added ""to attempt to protect the ratepayers"" since both utilities ""are proposing policies that will increase their customers' electricity bills.""
According to the energy company: ""The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission ultimately will decide the outcome of these policies, but Vectren and NIPSCO are arguing that the IURC should close plants based on Obama era rules that Trump and his EPA are in the process of unwinding. ... Who better than Scott Pruitt to aid the Indiana legislature on what Trump energy policy will look like?""
The company says it hopes the state legislature will ""add two sentences to the budget bill that prevent the IURC from making decisions based on rules that the EPA is currently reconsidering, and in some instances has already reversed.""
REPORT: POMPEO TO ANNOUNCE END OF IRAN WAIVERS: The State Department will announce today the end of all sanctions waivers for any country importing Iranian crude oil or condensate, columnist Josh Rogin writes in The Washington Post. According to Rogin, who cites two State Department officials, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will this morning announce all countries will have to end their imports of Iranian oil or be subject to sanctions.
The move aims to cut off the shipments of May 2, ending the 180-day waivers that the Trump administration put in place to allow eight nations to wean themselves of Iranian supplies or crude and condensate.
ON THE HILL HURRICANE RECLASSIFICATION RENEWS DISASTER FUNDING CALLS: State-level Florida Republicans and Democrats are calling for more federal aid following NOAA's reclassification of Hurricane Michael, which hit the state last year, to a Category 5 storm. Lawmakers say the storm's upgrade is just further proof of the Panhandle's dire need for financial assistance, Pro Florida's Bruce Ritchie reports . ""This reclassification to a [Category] 5 quite frankly comes at a good time for us pushing for more money,"" state Sen. Bill Montford of Tallahassee told POLITICO.
On the federal level, both of the state's senators re-upped their calls for more disaster aid to the Sunshine state. Sen. Marco Rubio (R) said on Twitter Friday: ""I will continue fighting for disaster relief funds for Florida communities devastated by this storm. Each day Congress fails to act comes at the expense of people recovering. The time for political games is over."" Sen. Rick Scott (R) meanwhile also weighed in that disaster funding can't be delayed any longer. ""The Panhandle is strong, but they need help,"" he tweeted .
On the other side, all Democratic members of the Florida delegation signed onto a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby , and Scott, to encourage support for a disaster relief package. The Democrats call on senators to pass either ""the disaster relief package provided in H.R. 268 (116) , the recently introduced H.R. 2157 (116) , or the Senate proposal with the Leahy-Schumer Amendment.""
BEYOND THE BELTWAY CALIFORNIA AGAINST TRUMP ON WATER REVISIONS: California water regulators are planning to pursue their own endangered species permits for operating the state's water-delivery projects, Pro California's Debra Kahn reports — a signal that the Trump administration's revision of water-pumping rules may violate state law. The California Department of Water Resources "" announced Friday it would update its environmental permit for long-term operations of the State Water Project, which jointly with the federally owned Central Valley Project delivers water supplies to 70 percent of the state's population and about 40 percent of its farmland.""

Trump says he won't nominate Herman Cain for Fed seat,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/22/trump-says-he-wont-nominate-herman-cain-for-fed-seat-1285640,"President Donald Trump announced Monday he would not nominate Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve, a decision he said was made at the former GOP presidential candidate’s request.
Senate Republicans had warned the White House against naming the former pizza executive and 2012 presidential hopeful to serve on the Fed's board of governors, and four were already on record in opposition to his candidacy, leaving him without a path to confirmation.
But as recently as Wednesday, Cain, a Trump political ally who has been dogged by sexual harassment allegations, said he would not withdraw his name.
“My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board,” Trump tweeted . “I will respect his wishes. Herman is a great American who truly loves our Country!”
Cain emerged as Trump’s stated choice for an open Fed seat earlier this month, though the administration has been considering him since at least January.
The president’s push for both Cain and conservative commentator Stephen Moore to join the central bank comes after Trump has spent months bashing the Fed for hiking interest rates and for shrinking its bond holdings, a process that can also put upward pressure on rates.
Four of the five current Fed board members are Trump appointees, including Chairman Jerome Powell, who has received the brunt of the president’s criticism.
Cain’s candidacy pushed back into the spotlight sexual harassment allegations that tanked his 2012 presidential campaign.
GOP lawmakers had also expressed worry about the prospect of putting the businessman on the Fed, which is designed to be independent from short-term political considerations, given that he recently founded a pro-Trump super PAC.
“Do you seriously want a guy on the Fed that has a whole organization, the only purpose of it is to encourage Republicans to do whatever the president says he’d like you to do?” one Republican senator distressed about the nomination said earlier this month.
Cain, in a post on conservative news site The Western Journal, said the reason he chose to withdraw is because it would limit his ability to speak publicly and make money.
“I was told what the ethical restrictions would be,” he wrote. “I would have to let go of most of my business interests. I could not serve on any boards. I could not do any paid speeches. I could not advocate on behalf of capitalism, host my radio show or make appearances on Fox Business.”
“Without getting too specific about how big a pay cut this would be, let’s just say I’m pretty confident that if your boss told you to take a similar pay cut, you’d tell him where to go,” he said, adding that he “started wondering if I’d be giving up too much influence to get a little bit of policy impact.”
Notably, Cain’s recent pledge to support low rates is at odds with his past statements. He spent a few years on the board of the Kansas City Fed, including as chairman, during a time when that branch of the central bank was “hawkish,” or in favor of higher interest rates to stave off inflation. The boards of regional Fed banks do not have a direct say in rate decisions, but they advise the bank president, who does.
In recent years, Cain also repeatedly cited rising rates as a welcome development and has said he supports a strong dollar. He also advocated for returning to a gold standard, in which the value of the dollar is tied directly to the supply of the precious metal, an idea rejected by almost all mainstream economists.
The Fed candidacy of Moore, who has received a slightly warmer welcome in the Senate than Cain, still faces an uncertain future over his tax troubles and a range of past controversial statements .
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that Moore’s candidacy should also be rejected.
“Herman Cain was woefully unqualified to be on the Federal Reserve and his failure to garner adequate support should not be used as a pathway by Senate Republicans to approve Stephen Moore, who is equally unqualified, and perhaps more political,” Schumer said in a statement.
“Mr. Moore, like Mr. Cain, poses a danger to the economic stability of our country,” he added. “Mr. Cain clearly saw the writing on the wall and withdrew his name from consideration; hopefully Senate Republicans will again voice their deep concerns and force Mr. Moore to do the same.”"
