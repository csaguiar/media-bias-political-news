Northamptonshire Police call handler 'unsatisfactory' over death - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-48475238,"Northamptonshire Police call handler 'unsatisfactory' over death 2 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption The investigation found the call handler had not completed a thorough review of the man's records on the computer database A call handler's performance was ""unsatisfactory"" when dealing with the case of a suspected suicidal man who was later found dead, a report says.
Northamptonshire Police was told in March 2018 that a man had failed to attend work and was a suicide risk.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the case was graded ""medium-risk"", but the call handler had not fully reviewed records on the man.
The force said the call handler would receive ""management action"".
The IOPC, which assesses police conduct, said following the missing person report an officer called at the man's home, but there was no reply.
The case was subsequently classified as ""medium-risk"".
However, Northamptonshire Police later received intelligence that led to the grading being increased to high.
Officers went back to the man's home, forced entry and found the man dead.
The IOPC said it did not find anything to justify the bringing of disciplinary proceedings, or that anyone had committed a criminal offence.
However, it found the ""call handler had not completed a thorough review of the man's record on the computer database, which would have highlighted some warning markers at an earlier stage"".
""We were of the opinion that the performance of the call handler may be considered to be unsatisfactory,"" it added.
The IOPC said Northamptonshire Police agreed with the investigation's findings. Related Topics"
Nanda Devi: Helicopters join search for eight missing climbers - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48488802,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The group went missing while climbing Nanda Devi in the Indian Himalayas Indian rescuers say the chances of finding eight climbers missing in the Himalayas are ""bleak"".
Two Indian air force helicopters were searching the mountains, but officials said the operation had to be suspended due to unfavourable conditions.
The missing group, including four Britons, two Americans, an Australian and an Indian, began climbing Nanda Devi on 13 May.
The British group leader's family said they were ""deeply saddened"".
Earlier, officials said four other British climbers had been rescued. They have been named by India TV as Mark Thomas, Ian Wade, Kate Armstrong and Zachary Quain.
They were airlifted to safety after being spotted early on Sunday at a base camp near Nanda Devi.

The larger group headed for the summit of another unnamed peak, government official Vijay Kumar Jogdanda said.

In a statement, his family said they were pressing for the search area to be widened, and wanted it to continue until they had firm evidence of the ""wellbeing or otherwise of all those in the climbing group"".

But he warned the monsoon season was now moving into the area, bringing with it heavy rain and fresh amounts of snow in the mountains.
""We are worried there's an avalanche involved and no matter how experienced you are, the mountain doesn't know that,"" he added.
'Extremely concerned' Mr Moran is also a member of the Torridon Mountain Rescue Team in Scotland, which said: ""The Team are deeply concerned by the news that our member, Martin Moran, is missing on Nandi Devi.
""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the families of the others missing.""
The rest of the group have been named locally as John McLaren, Rupert Whewell and Richard Payne from the UK; US nationals Anthony Sudekum and Ronald Beimel; Australian Ruth McCance and Indian guide Chetan Pandey.

""The first aerial recce has concluded,"" said Mr Jogdanda earlier on Sunday, confirming an avalanche was feared to have caught the group in the area around India's second-highest peak.
He added: ""There were only tents spotted, but no human presence. The second helicopter has left for the recce. Chances of survival are bleak.""
A team of 10 to 15 rescuers, comprising police, disaster response personnel and administrators, has also fanned out to find survivors, said Tripti Bhatt, an official of the Uttarakhand State Disaster Response Force (SDRF).
Authorities warned it could take days to trek to the area where the missing climbers were last known to have been.
Moran Mountain confirmed on Saturday that it was working with authorities and the British Association of Mountain Guides to ""gather information regarding the Nanda Devi East expedition team"" .
""Out of respect for those involved and their families, we will be making no further comments at this time,"" it added.
Photos posted to Moran Mountain's Facebook page the day before the start of the climb showed the group ""starting their journey into the hills at Neem Kharoli Baba temple, Bhowali"".
An update on 22 May, posted from their second base camp at 4,870 metres, suggested that the group would attempt to summit a previously unclimbed peak on the mountain.
The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed it was in contact with Indian authorities about the missing climbers.
""We will do all we can to assist any British people who need our help,"" a spokesman said.
Nanda Devi is the world's 23rd highest mountain and was first scaled in 1936.
Considered one of the toughest Himalayan peaks to summit, it attracts fewer climbers than other mountains in the region."
Honduras protests- Buildings burn during clashes over reforms,www.bbc.com,,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-48103857,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Police fired tear gas at protesters, who threw rocks and fire bombs Riot police and protesters have clashed in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, during protests against planned reforms of the health and education sector.
Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from a number of buildings in the city after they were set alight.
The protesters fear that the reforms could lead to mass lay-offs of teachers and doctors.
They have been on strike since Congress approved the reforms. Demonstrations were also held outside the capital. What happened?
A largely peaceful march against the reforms turned violent when a small group of hooded protesters clashed with riot police in the historic city centre of Tegucigalpa. Image copyright AFP Image caption Military police blocked the roads around the university Image copyright AFP Image caption Students are among those opposing the reforms Image copyright AFP Image caption The offices of the Honduran communications company Hondutel were among those set alight
At least four buildings were set alight, among them Tegucigalpa's city hall. Shop fronts were smashed and burning barricades erected to block key roads. Demonstrators also occupied the campus of the National Autonomous University in Tegucigalpa.
Riot police fired tear gas and charged at demonstrators with batons. Dozens of people were injured in the clashes and one of them is in a serious condition.
Police evacuated more than 250 people from the city hall after it was set alight by demonstrators throwing petrol bombs.
Outside the capital, a woman gave birth in a crowd in the town of La Ceiba after being caught up in protests. What are the protesters' demands?
The demonstrators want to stop two bills from coming into force which aim to restructure the ministries of education and health. The bills were passed on 25 April by the Honduran Congress in a tense sitting which saw some rival lawmakers push and shove each other. They still require one more voting session to become law. Image copyright AFP Image caption The clashes came after doctors and teachers went on strike and students occupied the university's buildings
Doctors and teachers have gone on strike in protest at the proposed reform, which they say will lead to mass sackings in the public sector. They say that the restructuring is the first step towards the privatisation of education and health services.
The government denies that the reform will lead to privatisation and layoffs. It says that the restructuring will provide savings of more than $300m (£231m) which it plans to invest in primary education, the construction of two hospitals and the improvement of neonatal care. What's the political background?
Backers of the reform say the opposition Libre party is stoking opposition to the law for political purposes. The bills have the backing of conservative President Juan Orlando Hernández.
During the protests, many of the demonstrators also demanded the resignation of President Hernández, who won a second term in 2017 in a disputed election in which his party was accused of fraud. Related Topics"

Tiananmen Square: China minister defends 1989 crackdown - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-48489002,"
Tuesday marks 30 years since six weeks of demonstrations ended with the Beijing massacre of 3-4 June. What did the minister say? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Workers and students shouted pro-democracy slogans
Public discussions of the 1989 pro-democracy protests and their suppression are strictly taboo in China.
But after a wide-ranging speech about trade and security at a regional forum in Singapore, General Wei Fenghe was asked about Tiananmen by a member of the audience.
Mr Wei questioned why people still said China had not handled the events properly.
""That incident was a political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence, which is a correct policy,"" he told the forum.
""The past 30 years have proven that China has undergone major changes,"" he said, adding that because of the government's action at that time ""China has enjoyed stability and development"".
His remarks came after Twitter issued an apology for suspending a number of accounts posting about China ahead of the Tiananmen Square anniversary.
A tweet on their public policy account said the company was working to challenge accounts that engage in ""platform manipulation, including spam and other inauthentic behaviours"".
""Sometimes our routine actions catch false positives or we make errors,"" the tweet read, adding that Twitter was trying to correct the mistakes.
Users had criticised the platform for blocking the accounts, using the hashtag #TwitterMassacre. Republican Senator Marco Rubio accused the company of becoming a Chinese government censor . 'Acts of forgettance'
There are no official acts of remembrance for the events of 1989 in Beijing. But that statement, although factually correct, is far too neutral.
In truth, what happened in Tiananmen Square is marked faithfully each year by a massive, national act of what might more properly be called ""forgettance"".
In the weeks leading up to 4 June, the world's biggest censorship machine goes into overdrive as a huge dragnet of automated algorithms and tens of thousands of human expurgators cleanse the internet of any reference, however oblique.
Those deemed to have been too provocative in their attempts to evade the controls can be jailed - with sentences of up to three and a half years recently handed down to a group of men who had tried to commemorate the anniversary with a product label. "

No fixed timetable for Max 737 grounding to be lifted 'Restore order'
The decision by the European Union, China, and others to ground the Max - before the US did so - created an unusual split in the global regulatory system. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg says steady progress is being made to get the 737 Max back into the skies
EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the European Aviation Safety Agency would take a very close look at Boeing's proposed design changes.
""We always work together with other regulators and we certainly will take joint moves, but EASA will reserve the right to take an individual look at the results and then of course engage with the rest of the regulators,"" she told Reuters media agency.
There is currently no agreed time frame on the plane's return to service, with Iata saying it was unlikely to take to the skies before August. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Ethiopian Airlines crash killed all 157 on board
Asked how long it would take to resolve the Boeing crisis, Violeta Bulc said: ""I hope as soon as possible because we do need to restore order and trust and move on.""
In late May Canadian regulators suggested they may look to work more closely with European regulators, rather than the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), on the issue of the 737 Max's safety. 'Trust damaged'
The two crashes - in Indonesia in October 2018 and Ethiopia in March 2019 - killed a total of 346 people.
Until then, airline regulators worldwide generally accepted certifications issued in the country where the aircraft had been built, which in this case was the FAA.
Following the crashes however, it emerged the FAA had delegated part of the certification process for the plane to Boeing, putting pressure on the US regulator.
There is still no broad agreement among global regulators on how and when Boeing's software fixes, which have yet to be completed, will be approved. Image copyright Rex Features Image caption Boeing's 737 Max aircraft was grounded in March
Airline trade body, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) is meeting in South Korea for its biggest gathering since the two disasters.
""Trust in the certification system has been damaged - among regulators, between regulators and the industry and with the flying public,"" said Iata boss Alexandre de Juniac.
""While Boeing and the US Federal Aviation Administration are at centre stage, the close collaboration of counterpart manufacturers and civil aviation authorities around the world are essential,"" he said. "

Smaller companies cannot afford the necessary preparations for leaving without a plan, Carolyn Fairbairn says in an open letter to the growing number of Conservatives bidding to be the next prime minister. It's the latest in a series of warnings from the lobby group, which has claimed some sectors face ""extinction"" without a close trading relationship to Brussels.
The first of the dozen candidates (so far) to enter the race, Esther McVey, believes the UK needs to ""actively embrace leaving the EU without a deal"", while ex-cabinet colleagues Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab want to renegotiate the terms agreed by Theresa May but would enforce the 31 October deadline either way. However, Ms Fairbairn's letter argues: ""Short-term disruption and long-term damage to British competitiveness will be severe if we leave without [a deal].""

Shamima Begum, who at 15 ran away to Syria to join Islamic State rebels, was ""groomed"" by the terror group, her family's lawyer has claimed . Tasnime Akunjee says Home Secretary Sajid Javid's decision to revoke Ms Begum's citizenship in February was a ""politically-driven abuse of power"" to try to further his ""own personal political objective"" of becoming prime minister. The lawyer says the family was not told she had been interviewed by police when a fellow school pupil left for Syria the previous year.

The man who might have stopped Sri Lanka's Easter bombings
By Secunder Kermani, BBC News
Lying on a hospital bed, Mohammad Razak Taslim's face contorts with pain. The left side of his body is completely paralysed, but he reaches out with his right hand, trying to clutch at his wife and brother-in-law who stand anxiously over him. His wife, Fatima, presses a handkerchief to his head. One side of his skull has caved in. It's where he was shot in the head in March. Ever since, he's been unable to speak, unable to walk.
Police believe Taslim was one of the first victims of the Sri Lankan extremist network, linked to the Islamic State group, that would go on to kill more than 250 people in a series of suicide bombings on churches and hotels on Easter Sunday in April. According to officials he was shot on the orders of the ringleader of the attacks, Zahran Hashim.

Venice crash reignites calls for cruise ship ban - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48489158,"Venice crash reignites calls for cruise ship ban 02 June 2019 Share this with Whatsapp Image copyright Reuters Video caption The MSC Opera, its horns blaring, crashes into a boat moored at a wharf in San Basilio-Zattere. A cruise ship crash in Venice has reignited calls for large vessels to be banned from the city's Giudecca canal. Four people were injured on Sunday when the MSC Opera - a 275m long (900ft) ship - collided with a dock and a small tourist boat after losing control. Critics say such ships pose a conservation risk to the lagoon city, pollute its waters and mar its beauty. Ministers said the crash proved the need for a ban on liners, and that they were working to resolve the problem. Infrastructure Minister Danilo Toninelli agreed, writing on Twitter (in Italian) that the incident was proof that big ships should not travel on the Giudecca. ""After many years of inertia, we are finally close to a definitive solution to protect both the lagoon and tourism,"" he said. The Giudecca, which leads to the popular St Mark's Square, is one of Venice's major waterways. Advertisement Critics say waves created by cruise ships on the canal erode the foundations of the city, which regularly suffers from flooding. Some have also complained that they detract from the beauty of Venice's historic sites and bring too many tourists.

"" Now is the time to handle the situation ... to work to understand what happened and to find solution, once and for all,"" Pino Musolino, president of the North Adriatic Sea Port Authority wrote on Twitter (in Italian). The government has previously tried to resolve the cruise ship debate. In 2013, it banned ships weighing more than 96,000 tonnes from the Giudecca canal but the legislation was later overturned. In 2017, the government announced that it would divert larger ships away from the historic centre. However, the plans were expected to take four years to come into force. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro on Sunday urged immediate action to open the alternative channel, known as the Vittorio Emanuele. More on this story "

At a ceremony in the town of Blaj on the last day of his visit to the nation, the pontiff said the men had given ""their lives to oppose an illiberal ideological system"".
Communist officials detained the men in 1948 for treason after they refused to convert to Orthodox Christianity.
All seven died in confinement and were buried in secret.
""With great courage and interior fortitude, they accepted harsh imprisonment and every kind of mistreatment, in order not to deny their fidelity to their beloved Church,"" Pope Francis told tens of thousands of worshippers at the open-air Mass on Sunday.

Image copyright EPA Image caption An icon showing the seven bishops appeared during the mass Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tens of thousands of people attended the open air ceremony in Blaj Image copyright EPA Image caption Eager fans took pictures of Pope Francis
The seven bishops were part of the Eastern Catholic church - a religious group that practises Orthodox Christian rituals but recognise the Pope's authority.
When a Communist regime took power in Romania following the end of World War II, the authorities outlawed Eastern Catholicism and demanded worshippers convert to Orthodoxy.
According to 2011 census data, only about 150,000 Eastern Catholics remain in Romania - roughly one 10th the number who followed the church in 1948.
Historians believe thousands of Romanians were executed by Communist authorities, with many more imprisoned or tortured for opposing the regime.

""They've been placed under house arrest, we want to insist on their freedom,"" she said.
The crisis first started in April when demonstrations against changes to the country's social security system widened into calls for the resignation of President Ortega, who has been in power for the past 12 years.
Talks to find a solution to the crisis broke down seven months ago after President Daniel Ortega ruled out calling early elections, which had been the opposition's chief demand.
Since then, hundreds of people have been jailed and opposition activists speak of ""persecution"" and ""the most severe crisis in generations"" for human rights. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Nicaragua's human rights 'in crisis,' says Maradiaga Related Topics"
The wealthy businessman who paid just £35.20 in tax - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48481320,"The wealthy businessman who paid just £35.20 in tax 3 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright BBC Panorama A wealthy businessman who lived a life of luxury paid just £35.20 income tax, a BBC investigation has discovered.
Frank Timis rented a £14,000-a-month penthouse and spent thousands dining in London's finest restaurants.
But his personal tax return for 2017 shows he paid just £35.20 in tax, after claiming that he had hardly any income from his worldwide business empire.
Mr Timis's lawyers say he has fully complied with all of his tax obligations.
Documents leaked to BBC Panorama and Africa Eye also reveal how Mr Timis managed to do this.
They show that in 2017, Mr Timis received payments totalling £670,000 from his offshore trust.
These were mainly payments called distributions, which should have been taxable. But shortly before he submitted his tax return, Mr Timis allegedly asked the trust to turn the distributions into untaxable loans.
A backdated loan agreement was created making the loans look legitimate.
John Christiansen, from the Tax Justice Network, said it looked like Mr Timis was dodging tax: ""It all points to this being a manoeuvre to cheat the tax man. And, if that is the case, because it's been done retrospectively, there seems to be prima facie evidence that this is tax fraud and it should be investigated."" Leaked documents
The BBC investigation has also spoken to the man who ran the trust that helped Mr Timis with the apparent tax dodge.
Philip Caldwell is named as chairman at the meeting in Switzerland that agreed to backdate the suspicious loans.
His signature is on the minutes, but he says the meeting never happened and that the minutes of the meeting are fake: ""It has my signature on it but what I can say is that no such meeting ever took place. I wasn't there. I wasn't in Switzerland at the time.""
The leaked documents also suggest that Mr Timis didn't pay a single penny in UK income tax in 2016.
Mr Timis's lawyers say the allegations are denied in the strongest possible terms: ""Mr Timis has fully complied with all of his tax obligations and at all stages has taken professional advice to ensure that he has done so.""
The Romanian businessman is no stranger to controversy. He has two convictions for supplying heroin in the 1990s and has been involved in a series of failed mining ventures in Africa.
Frank Timis has floated two mining companies on the junior stock exchange in London.
One of them - Regal Petroleum - was hit with the exchange's biggest ever fine in 2009 after misleading investors about an oil discovery.
Regal Petroleum told investors it expected to find oil in Greece, even though it knew the well in question was dry.
Mr Timis's lawyers said he only held a minority stake in Regal and was not on the board at the time the company received the fine.
They said: ""Mr Timis was personally investigated and cleared by the FCA in relation to his role in Regal Petroleum.""

PM to challenge Trump's approach on climate - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48473658,"Image copyright JIM WEST/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption Protestors at President Trump's inauguration in 2017 following his comments while campaigning that climate change was a ""hoax"" Theresa May will raise the issue of climate change with Donald Trump during his upcoming visit to the UK, Downing Street has told BBC News.
The confirmation coincides with UK climate researchers asking the prime minister to ""robustly challenge"" President Trump on the topic.
In a letter to Mrs May, 250 academics say the president's ""reckless approach is a threat to the whole world"".
In 2018, the president accused climate experts of having a ""political agenda"" .
A spokesperson for the UK government said: ""The prime minister has raised climate change with the president before and will do so again during his visit.
""Tackling climate change is a priority for the UK. We are driving forward international action through our work at the UN and with our Commonwealth partners, and we're proud to have offered to host COP26 (the UN climate summit in 2020).
""As the prime minister has said previously, we were disappointed by the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017 and continue to hope they will return.""
Queen welcomes President Trump to palace
The academics' letter was organised by Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics (LSE). He welcomed the news that the prime minister would talk to President Trump about climate.
""The prime minister can robustly challenge President Trump about his inaction on climate change with the knowledge that she has the extremely strong support of all the experts who signed the letter,"" Mr Ward commented.
""We all stand behind her on this issue. I hope she will raise the issue with him in public, as well as privately, so that Americans can see how much the president's climate change denial is damaging the international standing of the United States.
""It would be a tremendous legacy for Theresa May if she can shift Mr Trump from his position of stubborn denial of the risks of climate change.""
Image copyright Matt Cardy Image caption A letter signed by 250 climate researchers has urged Theresa May to ""robustly challenge"" President Trump on his climate change stance The letter was signed by academics and policy analysts from 35 universities and research institutes across the UK.
In it, they ask the prime minister to urge the US president to accept ""the overwhelming scientific evidence which shows that climate change is driven by human activities and poses a serious threat to the lives and livelihoods of people all across the world"".
More stories like this: Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' 'Climate change moving faster than we are' What could disappear on 'Hothouse Earth' They want Mrs May to ask President Trump to initiate and support policies to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions in the US to zero by the middle of this century, and to reverse the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. They also want America to fully support international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The scientists are concerned that President Trump has taken a series of decisions that apparently undermine efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the US and internationally.

His administration, they say, has removed large amounts of information about climate change from the websites of the White House, government departments and federal agencies.
""The President has publicly stated his rejection of the scientific evidence for climate change and the White House is considering the creation of a committee to cast doubt on the robust and rigorous analysis presented in the United States Fourth National Climate Assessment,"" they write.
The experts add that they believe honouring the US president with a state visit is ""incompatible"" with Britain's leadership on climate change.

Clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian worshippers broke out at Al Aqsa mosque compound, the holy site also known to Jews as Temple Mount.
It comes as thousands of Israelis have taken part in their annual ""March of Flags"" in Jerusalem, marking 52 years since Israel took control of the whole city. It included Jewish nationalists marching through the Muslim quarter of the Old City, and this year coincided with the final days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

India is reeling from an intense heat wave with temperatures crossing 45C in many parts of the country.
Churu, in the northern state of Rajasthan, is India's hottest city - temperatures there soared to 50.8C on Sunday, the meteorological department said.
It has put Rajasthan and the central state of Madhya Pradesh on alert for ""severe heat wave conditions"". Both states often record some of the highest temperatures at the peak of summer.
But this year has been particularly scorching in other places, too, from the northern plains to the Deccan plateau in the west and the south.

Merkel’s coalition set for crisis talks amid SDP turmoil in Germany - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48496582,"Merkel’s coalition set for crisis talks amid SDP turmoil in Germany 3 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AFP Image caption German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (R) coalition government is in turmoil Germany's embattled coalition will hold crisis talks on Monday after the resignation of the leader of its junior partner, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), left the government in turmoil.
Andrea Nahles said she was stepping down following her party's poor performance in the European elections.
Her resignation has raised concerns that Chancellor Angela's coalition government could collapse.
Mrs Merkel said she respected her ""far-reaching"" decision. Merkel dismisses rumours of party rift
Rolf Mutzenich, deputy chairman of the SPD, put himself forward to serve as the party's interim leader after an initial meeting on Sunday.
Ms Nahles' long-term replacement is yet to be determined, leaving the coalition hanging in the balance while further talks take place.
The 48-year-old's centre-left party came third, behind Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Greens, in the elections. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Outgoing Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Andrea Nahles spoke to reporters outside her party's HQ in Berlin
The disappointing result has caused disquiet in the party, whose left-wing members have criticised Ms Nahles for remaining in the coalition.
Ms Nahles became SPD leader in April 2018, replacing Martin Schulz who had also resigned following the party's poor performance in elections. She had been expected to run for the position again and her resignation took analysts by surprise.
The coalition between the CDU and the SPD is due to last until federal elections in 2021, but correspondents say Ms Nahles's resignation could lead to the SPD leaving, triggering a snap poll. How will the talks unfold?
Parties in Ms Merkel's fragile government are set to hold separate crisis talks about the fate of the coalition on Monday.
A first round of talks was held by the SDP's leadership on Sunday, but the question of who would succeed Ms Nahles was not resolved.
Several senior party figures, including Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Lower Saxony's Prime Minister, Stephan Weil, have ruled themselves out. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Merkel's coalition is holding crisis talks after Ms Nahles' resignation imperilled her coalition
Former SDP leader Thomas Oppermann said it could take ""one, two months"" to choose Ms Nahles' replacement.
He said the political instability was ""not a good overall situation"" and warned his party against ""waiting for further defeats"", alluding to the forthcoming elections in three East German states in September and October.
Polls suggest the SDP may suffer losses in those elections. In the Forsa survey, the SPD dropped by five percentage points to 12%, its lowest-ever score on a national level. No obvious choice
Analysis by BBC Berlin Correspondent Damien McGuinness
Many never wanted the SPD to be in government again in the first place.
Party left-wingers blame plummeting support on years of messy compromise with Angela Merkel's conservatives.
Now pressure is growing on the SPD to quit the coalition and bring down the government, in the hope that fresh elections would help them ditch the conservatives and build a left-wing coalition.
The problem is new elections are unlikely to help. Current polls place the SPD in third place after the Greens. There is no leader-apparent ready to take over. And the party's message on many big issues, from climate change to migration, remains unclear.
In 2017 it took six months of wrangling to form this government. That was followed by half a year of internal bickering that exasperated voters.
The only parties that would benefit from more struggles for power within Germany's two big parties would be the Greens and the right-wing populist AfD. What did Andrea Nahles say?
Ms Nahles said she would stand down as party leader on Monday and as head of its parliamentary group on Tuesday.
In a statement by the SPD on Sunday she said: ""The discussions within the parliamentary faction and feedback from within the party have shown me that I no longer have the necessary support to carry out my duties.""
She had earlier announced that the leadership contest would take place on Tuesday. Where does this leave the coalition?
If the SPD were to leave the coalition, the fall of the government would be likely to trigger fresh elections.
But the left wing of the SPD has been urging the party to pull out since it entered government last year. They say that compromising with conservatives has been costing them support.
Mr Scholz told the Tagesspiegel newspaper he had ruled out entering another such coalition.
""Three grand coalitions in a row would not do democracy in Germany any good,"" he said in the interview before Ms Nahles announced her resignation. Image copyright AFP Image caption CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer urged the SPD to support the coalition
On Sunday, Mrs Merkel's successor as CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, warned the SPD not to endanger the coalition.
""I assume the SPD will undergo a succession in short order without hindrance to the functioning of the grand coalition,"" she said.
""In the CDU we believe that this is not the time to play politics. We want to serve our country with good governing policies."" "

Spanish vlogger Kanghua Ren ""violated the moral integrity"" of the victim of his 2017 prank, the New York Times reported the Barcelona court as saying.
The court also ruled Ren's YouTube channel, ReSet, must be shut down - and he must not post any videos until 2024.
Ren has also been ordered to pay his victim €20,000 (£17,700) compensation.
The New York Times said Ren was unlikely to spend any time in jail, though, as Spanish courts typically suspend sentences of under two years for first-time offenders found guilty of committing non-violent crimes.
The homeless man was identified by Spanish media as Gheorge L - a Romanian who worked as a shepherd before moving to Barcelona. Cruel tricks
Court documents excerpted in Spanish newspapers show Ren made about €2,000 from adverts that ran on the film of the prank.
They said the prank was not an ""isolated act"" - Ren had carried out other ""cruel"" tricks on other vulnerable victims.
The filmed prank, which left the homeless man vomiting, brought widespread condemnation for Ren.
He deleted the video from his channel following the criticism, went to see the man again and offered him €20.
Later, he offered to pay the man €300 if he did not start legal action over the stunt.
Ren undertook the prank after being challenged by one of his 1.2 million followers to eat a toothpaste-filled biscuit himself. Related Topics"

They have launched a criminal inquiry into the death of Walter Lübcke, the 65-year-old head of the regional council in the city of Kassel.
Suicide has been ruled out but police say they have no motive.
""We are deeply shocked by the sudden death of our friend,"" said Hesse state premier Volker Bouffier.
Lübcke's body was found at 00:30 on Sunday morning (22:30 GMT Saturday) on the terrace of his home in the village of Istha, police revealed. He was declared dead two hours later and leaves a wife and two grown-up children. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police say they have no indication of a motive for the killing in the quiet village of Istha
""We still have no clues about perpetrators and above all no motive either,"" said crime bureau chief Sabine Thurau. Prosecutors declined to give much more information but they did say the weapon used in the killing was a short-range firearm aimed at the victim's head.
Lübcke was a leading local member of Mr Bouffier's ruling centre-right CDU in the central German state, running the authority in one of Hesse's three regional areas for the past decade.
He came to national prominence in October 2015 when he spoke out in favour of providing accommodation for refugees. Germany had decided to let in Syrians fleeing the civil war, and big numbers of asylum seekers were crossing Germany's borders on a daily basis.
He reportedly received death threats and was given personal protection after telling a rowdy town hall meeting they had to stand up for Christian values. ""Whoever does not support these values can leave this country any time, if he doesn't agree. This is the freedom of every German,"" he said.
However, a council spokesman told Süddeutsche Zeitung that the threats against him had fizzled out. His party praised him as a ""bridge-builder who could not have been better""."

Landlocked Bolivia lost access to the sea in 1884 after a war with Chile and has tried to regain it ever since.
The court said Chile was not obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia access.
The ruling, which comes after five years of deliberations, is final and binding.
Despite the final nature of the ruling, Bolivian President Evo Morales said ""Bolivia will never give up"". Background to the dispute: After its defeat by Chile in the War of the Pacific, Bolivia lost 120,000 sq km of land and became a landlocked country Bolivia said that Chile had an obligation to ""negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia"" It brought the territorial dispute in 2013 to the International Court of Justice in The Hague Chile and Bolivia have not had full diplomatic relations since 1978
Source: BBC Monitoring
Judges at the United Nations' top court did not rule on whether Chile or Bolivia had the rights to the disputed coastal stretch, it only ruled on whether Chile had an obligation to negotiate with Bolivia.
Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf announced that the court found by 12 votes to three that Chile did not have such an obligation.
The ruling is a major setback for President Evo Morales, who was present at the court in The Hague as the ruling was read out.
As the judge dismissed Bolivia's arguments one by one, Mr Morales's face turned increasingly sombre. Image copyright Reuters Image caption President Morales said Bolivia would not give up
The president, who has been in power since 2006, is running for a fourth consecutive term in 2019 and the issue of the access to the Pacific Ocean is an emotive issue for Bolivians.
Despite having no access to the sea, Bolivia maintains a small navy and celebrates the Day of the Sea every year. 'False expectations'
Chilean President Sebastián Piñera has welcomed the ruling. Speaking in the capital, Santiago, he stressed that ""Chile has no obligation to negotiate"".
""President Morales raised false expectations among his people (...) and made us waste five years which could have been spent building a healthy relationship between the two countries,"" he said.
The borders between the two neighbours date back to the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship, signed after Bolivia lost 400km (250 miles) of coastline to Chile during the War of the Pacific (1879-1884).

Whale washed up in Caithness tangled in Canadian fishing gear - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-48497046,"Image copyright Karen Munro Image caption The whale's body came ashore near Scrabster last week A humpback whale may have become entangled in fishing gear thousands of miles away from where it was found dead on Scotland's north coast.
It came ashore close to Scrabster, near Thurso, in Caithness, on Thursday.
Scientists who have examined the carcass said it was likely the juvenile male, which was tightly wrapped in creel rope attached to a buoy, drowned.
Contact details for the owner of the gear, a fisherman in Nova Scotia, Canada, was on the buoy.
Scientists from the Inverness-based Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (Smass) said the fisherman in Nova Scotia was ""devastated"" to learn of the whale's death.
Image copyright Karen Munro Image caption The Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme examined the whale's carcass Smass said it was possible the whale had dragged the gear 2,500 miles (4,023km) from the lobster fishery to the location where it was found.
They added that another theory was that the creel rope and buoy had been ""ghost gear"", lost or abandoned fishing equipment that can drift in the sea for miles, and that the humpback became entangled off Scotland.
The scheme said the humpback's tail had scars on it left by ropes from a separate entanglement. The identifying marks could help the scientists find out where the whale had previously been seen."

""Everything that we are hearing from the people we are dealing with there is positive.
""We are bringing something to the people there that they have never experienced and I think what we can give to that country is a positive.""
Mellors Group manages theme parks and fairs in the UK and abroad, including Fantasy Island parks in Dubai and Skegness.
Saudi Arabia had for many years banned entertainment, or often those that existed were for men only.
Mr Mellors said the contract would create the ""biggest touring event in the world"", taking on 80 more staff, both in Nottingham and Saudi Arabia.
They will be responsible for getting rides on to 700 trailers and moving them up to 900 miles from city to city.
Mr Mellors said the scale of the operation was reflected in a log flume ride which needs 50 trailers to move it - the largest in the UK requires five.
Some rides have already been shipped with the first fair to open in the capital Riyadh in October.

A motion, tabled by Lord Provost Frank Ross, called for it to be removed with immediate effect. Myanmar Rohingya - what you need to know about the crisis
The motion noted ""the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Northern Rakhine and in the refugee camps of neighbouring Bangladesh"" as well as calls from the United Nations, Amnesty International and international governments to stop the violence.
Mr Ross told a meeting of the full council: ""It has been 10 months since this chamber discussed the status of this award for Aung San Suu Kyi.
""It did so in the light of the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar (Burma), which was and continues to be broadcast around the world.
""At that time this chamber instructed me to write to Aung San Suu Kyi, making it very clear that as a recipient of the Freedom of our City, we urged her to use her powers to alleviate this human crisis.""
Mr Ross added: ""I did so and we have tried every route that we possibly have available to us to make contact, via our armed forces, through diplomatic means, by writing directly - yet we have seen the situation in Myanmar continue to deteriorate.
""This award is granted rarely and only to those individuals who are held in the highest esteem by the citizens of Edinburgh. It was presented to Aung San Suu Kyi in recognition of her personal courage and relentless pursuit of justice.
""I no longer believe her receipt of this award or the reasons it was presented are appropriate or accurate. It is not a decision we take lightly to revoke the honour granted to her in 2005.""

The 73-year-old leader of Myanmar - formerly Burma - was hailed as a beacon of democracy when she was given the city's highest honour 13 years ago.
She was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1991 while under house arrest in Rangoon.
After elections in 2015 she became Myanmar State Counsellor, the de facto head of the country's civilian administration.
Two years later violence broke out in Rakhine province after Rohingya militants attacked police posts, killing 12 members of the security forces.
In response, Myanmar's army has been accused of killing Rohingya civilians and burning their villages, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee to Bangladesh. Fell into disrepute
While it is acknowledged that Ms Suu Kyi does not control the military, she has faced international pressure to condemn the army's alleged brutality towards the Rohingya, a Muslim minority which is stateless in majority-Buddhist Myanmar.
Other cities including Oxford, Glasgow and Newcastle have also acted to strip Ms Suu Kyi of similar honours.
The last time Edinburgh revoked a Freedom of the City honour was in 1890 when the Irish politician Charles Parnell fell into disrepute over a scandalous love affair.
A collage portrait of Ms Suu Kyi by the artist David Mach, made up of postcards of political prisoners, that was previously displayed on rotation at the council's offices, is currently in storage. Related Topics"

Canada complicit in 'race-based genocide' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48503545,"Victims' voices finally heard
By Jessica Murphy, BBC News in Ottawa
The document released by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is dense, at well over 1,000 pages.
But - as is often the case - it's the personal stories that cut through the formal language.
The voices of some of the families were included in the report, bringing emotional weight to the two phone directory-sized volumes.
""Tamara Lynn Chipman stole her daddy's heart from the moment she was born,"" begins a foreword by Gladys Radek.
""She grew into a tall, lanky, charming, beautiful young lady with a smile that would brighten anybody's day.""
Tamara vanished on 21 September, 2005, along the Highway of Tears in the province of British Columbia, a route notorious for the number of women who have gone missing or died along its 724 km (450 miles).
Or the words of Jeremiah Bosse - widower of Daleen Bossee - who admits to early doubts about the inquiry: ""Will this actually work or help?""
He writes: ""Today I feel hopeful for the first time that as victims of violence our words will be heard. The words of our loved ones are spoken."" What's the reaction?
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - who has made reconciliation with indigenous peoples a priority for his government - thanked those that shared stories with the commission, and vowed to enact the inquiry's recommendations.
""This is an uncomfortable day for Canada, but it is an essential day,"" he said.
Mr Trudeau did not mention genocide in his speech - a fact that was not lost on Michèle Audette, one of the report's commissioners.
""I was hoping that he would have that courage,"" she said during a press conference.
Today was a long time coming for many victims and their family. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Schoolgirl Tina Fontaine was found dumped in Winnipeg's Red River in August 2014
""This journey has been emotional but also uplifting, because I've been able to share this day with all these families,"" Shelia LeDoux told the BBC.
Her niece went missing in 1992, but her remains were not found until four years later.
""Her voice is silent but I feel like I'm her voice, and I feel like I've carried forward with what I've promised.""
Barbara Sevigny, whose sister was murdered 33 years ago, said today validated the pain she and her family have experienced.
""Our lives matter too. That became very real,"" she told the BBC, her voice cracking.
She said she is has been disillusioned by broken promises in the past, and is waiting to see what steps the government will take. What does the report recommend?
The chief commissioner said that nothing short of a ""paradigm shift"" is necessary to dismantle colonialism in Canadian society.
Ms Buller urged Canadians: ""Read the report, speak out against sexism, racism, and misogyny. Hold government to account and decolonise yourself by learning about indigenous people and the true history of Canada.""
The inquiry called on the federal government to create an independent mechanism for reporting annually on how the recommendations are being implemented.
Other recommendations include: Develop a national action plan to tackle violence against indigenous women and girls and ensure equitable access to public services Establish a National Indigenous and Human Rights Ombudsperson For governments to recognise and protect indigenous language rights and give them official language status For all levels of government to ensure support for programmes and services for indigenous women and girls in the sex industry Related Topics"

He Jiankui: Baby gene experiment 'foolish and dangerous' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,James Gallagher Health,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48496652,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Jiankui He The first people to be gene-edited - a pair of baby twin girls - may have been mutated in a way that shortens life expectancy, research suggests.
Prof He Jiankui shocked the world when he genetically altered the twins to try to give them protection against HIV.
But a study in Nature Medicine shows people who naturally have the mutation he was trying to recreate were significantly more likely to die young.
Experts said He's actions were ""very dangerous"" and ""foolish"". What was Prof He trying to do?
Prof He was targeting a gene called CCR5.
It is a set of genetic instructions that are important for how the immune system functions.
However, they are also the doorway that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) walks through to infect cells.
Mutations to CCR5 essentially lock the door and give people resistance to HIV.
So, Prof He made embryos in an IVF clinic and then used gene-editing technologies on them to alter the CCR5 gene.
The resulting girls - known as Lulu and Nana - were born last year. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The human immunodeficiency virus uses CCR5 to gain entry into cells What does this have to do with life expectancy?
The problem is CCR5 has a bigger role in the body than just making people vulnerable to HIV.
It is active in the brain and in fighting off other infections, particularly flu.
The study, at the University of California, Berkeley, looked at nearly 410,000 people in the UK.
It showed those who had only the mutated version of CCR5 were 20% more likely to die before they turned 78.
""In this case, it is probably not a mutation that most people would want to have,"" said Prof Rasmus Nielsen, from UC Berkeley.
""You are actually, on average, worse off having it.""
Fellow researcher Dr Xinzhu Wei said the gene-editing technology, known as Crispr, was still too risky to be using on children.
""The Crispr technology is far too dangerous to use right now for germ-line editing,"" she said. What does this mean for the twins?
The implications for Lulu and Nana are still unclear.
""It is impossible to predict if the mutations carried by the twin girls will have any effect,"" said Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute.
Not everyone who carried the mutations in the study died young but it was more likely.
And life expectancy depends on a complex mix of the DNA you are born with and the world you live in.
To further complicate things, Prof He mutated CCR5 in a similar rather than identical way to people who have HIV resistance.
Prof Lovell-Badge said the study ""shows once more that He Jiankui was foolish to choose CCR5 to mutate"". What was the reaction to Prof He doing this?
There was universal condemnation by scientists when Prof He made the announcement in November.
Some described the experiment as ""monstrous"" .
And he was criticised for experimenting when the risks to otherwise healthy children were unclear and for acting against Chinese law.
There was also anger because HIV can be treated and there was barely any risk of it being passed from the HIV-positive father to his children.
The Chinese authorities investigated and concluded that Prof He had acted illegally in pursuit of ""fame and fortune"" .
Prof He has always defended his experiments and at a summit in Hong Kong said he was ""proud"" of his gene-editing work. "
Kenya's new banknotes and the battle against corruption - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48497353,"Kenya's new banknotes and the battle against corruption 3 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kenyans will exchange the old 1,000 shilling notes for the new tender Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced that the country's currency is to be replaced with a new generation of banknotes.
Kenyans must return their 1,000 shilling ($10; £8) notes to banks by 1 October, in a bid to fight money laundering, counterfeits and corruption.
New currency is to be brought in over the coming months with other denominations being phased out gradually.
Some Kenyans have expressed anger over the new banknote design, which features an image of a statue of Kenya's first President, Jomo Kenyatta - the current president's father.
The decision on the design, as well as the clampdown on the 1,000 shilling notes, has been challenged in court. Why is Kenya replacing its currency?
Kenya is withdrawing the note to crack down on embezzlement and tackle a wave of counterfeit 1,000 shilling notes.
The governor of Kenya's central bank, Patrick Njoroge, also expressed ""grave concern"" over larger banknotes being used for ""illicit financial flows in Kenya and also other countries in the region"".
The 1,000 shilling note is the highest value note in Kenya and according to Mr Njoroge, the Kenyan shilling is the equivalent to the US dollar in east Africa, in terms of its recognition.
President Kenyatta promised to stamp out corruption when he was elected in 2013.
But his critics say there have been few convictions since then, especially of high-profile people.
BBC Africa business reporter Georgie Ndirangu says the demonetisation - the withdrawal of a coin, note, or precious metal from use as legal tender - is seen as a direct response to this criticism.
Officials and well connected businessmen in corrupt cartels are believed to hold hundreds of millions of illegally obtained shillings in cash, and withdrawing the 1,000 shilling note is expected to close many money-laundering avenues, as they have to be exchanged for the new currency, he said. Kenya coins replace leaders with animals How will the changeover happen?
Mr Njoroge said the four-month transition period should allow enough time for Kenyans to exchange their old 1,000 shilling notes.
Those exchanging less than 5m shillings would be able to do so at their local bank but any higher amounts will need approval from Kenya's central bank.
Mr Njoroge said he would be holding talks with managers of foreign-exchange bureaux and money-remittance providers to put in place controls to prevent illicit financial flows.
He said he would communicate with banks across the region so that illegal money did not get exchanged in their countries. Why are Kenyans angry about the new currency?
As well as showcasing Kenya's wildlife, the new banknote design features the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) with a statue of Jomo Kenyatta in the middle.

He played a major role in leading Kenya to independence and went on to become the country's first president.
The Constitution of Kenya 2010 says that money - both coins and banknotes - should not feature a portrait of an individual. Report
Human Rights Activist Okiya Omtatah is challenging the decision in court, arguing that there has been a lack of public participation in designing the notes, as well as the demonetisation of the current 1,000 shilling note.
But some Kenyans back the decision to put Kenyatta on the note. One man said it was a ""sign of respect"" for the ""founding father"" of Kenya. What other countries have demonetised? "
Julian Assange: Swedish judge rejects detention of Wikileaks founder - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48503730,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Swedish prosecutor reopened a rape investigation after Assange's arrest A Swedish judge has rejected a request to detain Julian Assange in absentia, complicating hopes to extradite him from the UK.
Prosecutors said Assange had not co-operated with their investigation into a 2010 allegation of rape against the Wikileaks founder, and so should be remotely held for questioning.
This would have allowed them to move forward with steps to extradite him.
But the judge rejected the motion, as Assange is already detained in the UK.
Detention in absentia is an ordinary procedure in Swedish law if a person is abroad or in hiding, and would allow the prosecution to issue a European Arrest Warrant and bring him to Sweden.
Speaking after the ruling, Eva-Marie Persson - Sweden's deputy director of public prosecutions - said the rape investigation would continue, and she would instead issue a European Investigation Order to question Assange. Timeline: Julian Assange saga

Hammond: I reject idea millions live in dire poverty - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48503170,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Philip Hammond speaks to Newsnight The chancellor has rejected claims there are millions of people living in dire poverty in Britain.
""Look around you; that's not what we see in this country,"" Philip Hammond told Newsnight.
Mr Hammond accepted that some people were struggling.
But he said the government had worked to tackle the causes of poverty and rejected a United Nations report that claimed austerity had increased poverty.
Published last month, the rapporteur accused the government of plunging millions into poverty, in some instances with ""tragic consequences"".
Mr Hammond said: ""I reject the idea that there are vast numbers of people facing dire poverty in this country.
""I don't accept the UN rapporteur's report at all. I think that's a nonsense. Look around you, that's not what we see in this country.
""Of course there are people struggling with the cost of living. I understand that. But the point being is that we are addressing these things through getting to the root causes.""
System must 'evolve' The chancellor said that for many people, the market economy was not working as it was ""supposed to"", and the idea the economy is ""generating and distributing wealth is at odds with the practice that they are experiencing"".
He said the government should be ensuring the market was ""delivering in the way that the textbooks tell us it will work.
""To deliver through competition, the best deal for consumers and to distribute wealth in a way that is fair.
""To the extent that it's not working, we have got to evolve the system.""
The UN report cites independent experts saying that 14m people in the UK - a fifth of the population - live in poverty, according to a new measure that takes into account costs such as housing and childcare.
According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 1.5m people experienced destitution in 2017 - meaning they had less than £10 a day after housing costs, or had to go without at least two essentials such as shelter, food, heat, light, clothing or toiletries during a one-month period.
'High horses' Mr Hammond's comments came during an interview on Monday with Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, in which he warned MPs vying to be leader of the Conservative Party that they risked becoming ""Theresa May mark two"" unless they accepted the realities of Brexit.
The chancellor, who has yet to reveal who he will support in his party's leadership race, laid down a challenge for the candidates.
""Explain to me how you will avoid becoming Theresa May mark two, stuck in a holding pattern,"" he said.
He criticised some of the candidates' Brexit plans.
""An extension of time to try to renegotiate, when the EU have already said they have finished the negotiation and, indeed, have disbanded their negotiating team, strikes me as a not very auspicious policy.""
Watch: McVey outlines her plans for Brexit Matt Hancock proposes Irish border council Gyimah backs referendum in leadership bid Hammond: Another EU referendum possible He added: ""The debate we're having now is here, in the UK, about whether we are going to sign the Withdrawal Agreement or not, and about what kind of future relationship we then want to have - because the European Union is willing to talk to us about the shape of the future relationship.""
Mr Hammond also said he believed that MPs from all sides should ""stop pontificating and get off their high horses"" in an effort to resolve the Brexit impasse.
Asked whether he would prefer a no-deal outcome or no Brexit, he replied: ""Neither is an acceptable outcome, because no deal would be catastrophic for the country and its economy - and no Brexit would be seen as a gross breach of faith with the public.""
He added: ""So we as democrats and we as parliamentarians should be absolutely clear that we cannot tolerate either of those outcomes,"" and said ""we have a solemn obligation to find a solution which avoids"" either.
He said that meant a deal was required.
""We will all be grumpy about it, we will all be dissatisfied. But in many ways that is the only way forward for the country,"" he said.
""If we end up with a deal that means half the people in this country think they achieved total victory and the other half think they have been totally defeated, that is not the recipe for unity in the future. And countries that are not unified are not successful.""
The full interview with Chancellor Philip Hammond will be broadcast on Newsnight at 10.30pm Monday on BBC2.

Why is intermittent fasting so popular? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48478529,"Why is intermittent fasting so popular? 3 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Intermittent fasting is becoming an increasingly popular way to lose weight. What's its appeal and is it safe to fast?
Whether it's eating in a 5:2 or 16:8 pattern, losing weight is as much about when you eat as about what you eat these days.
Recently, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey hit the headlines when he claimed to eat just one meal a day. Social media was abuzz, with many critics calling it an extreme diet. But perhaps he was just following the latest trend.
According to a survey by the International Food Information Council Foundation intermittent fasting (IF) was last year's most popular diet.
Intermittent fasting can take many different forms but it always involves periods of time where you are taking in very little food, at regular intervals. Fasting patterns The 16:8 diet involves fasting for 16 hours per day and eating within an eight-hour window. This is usually done by only eating from midday till 8pm. The 5:2 diet involves eating only 25% of a normal calorie intake on two non-consecutive days per week. A 24 hours fast involves consuming no calories on one day of the week or month.

Fans of intermittent fasting claim it's a good way to lose weight, and a summary of studies into the method, published in the Annual Review of Nutrition in 2017, found that 11 out of 16 trials reported some weight loss.
''The reason for that is simple mathematics, as you are restricting calories,'' says Dr Linia Patel, a registered dietician and spokeswoman for the British Dietician Association.
However, the study found that some patterns of fasting were not advisable: alternate-day fasting led to intense hunger and was therefore considered impractical. Enforced fasting periods
Fasting has been practised throughout history for religious, cultural and spiritual reasons, but as a way of eating it goes back much further.
Dr Patel explains that if we look at our ancestors, they had periods of enforced fasting. Hunter-gatherers only had food when they killed or collected it, so fasting was part of their everyday reality.
But nowadays we are constantly exposed to plentiful foods. We also lead far less active lives. Together, these factors have caused an obesity epidemic. 'People love rules'
Simply telling people to eat a healthy, balanced diet doesn't seem to work, according to Dr Patel.
""People love rules,"" she says. ""I think bringing in a little discipline and having periods where we are not eating is a positive thing.""
Unlike most diets, IF doesn't exclude specific food groups, such as fat, sugars or carbohydrates. All you need is a clock. Perhaps that is part of its appeal.
For Shanae Dennis, a 26-year-old journalist, it was the simplicity that appealed.
""I started intermittent fasting because I really wanted a quick, simple and easy diet. Being told to just eat between 12 and 8pm was really easy to follow so I was interested.""
""In the beginning I thought I could really eat whatever I want, but soon I realised that for it to work I had to eat healthily,"" says Shanae. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables to get enough dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals. 'Feast and famine'
This is a common misconception, says Dr Patel.
""In my clinical practice I find that a lot of people are not doing intermittent fasting properly,"" she says. ""For example they might keep the calories below 500 on fasting days but then they go and feast on the other days.
''That's dangerous from two points of view: you are not going to get the calorie deficit and lose weight. You need to eat sensibly.""
So it's not a feast and famine thing. That's not going to work.
In order for it to be a safe, effective and healthy way of eating, the food consumed during ""eating windows"" needs to be of high nutritional value.
Scientists emphasise that those on IF diets should include essential fats from oily fish, nuts and seeds, lean sources of protein, whole-grains and starchy carbohydrates and plenty of fruit and vegetables to supply enough dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals. Can you keep it up?
Calorie-controlled diets all have a similar impact on weight loss, but the diet that is really successful is one that people can sustain in the long-term.
One of the difficulties with sticking to a diet is craving forbidden foods, and with IF that is perhaps less of a problem.
""When I am on a no-carbohydrate or low carbohydrate diet all I see is pasta and rice everywhere, but now I don't crave certain food groups because nothing is restricted,"" says Shanae.
She has been following the 16:8 diet for four months now and finds it easier to keep up than the 5:2 diet, during which she gets very hungry.
""The hardest thing is to not reach for the breakfast muffin,"" says Shanae. Image copyright Imahn Robertson Image caption Imahn likes the discipline that comes with intermittent fasting
Imahn Robertson, 26, has been following an IF diet for over four years.
""When I first started I did struggle, the body naturally craves foods at all times. But after I got into a routine it was okay,"" says Imahn.
""There is temptation, don't get me wrong. If I am tempted I will occasionally break my fast and adjust my fasting period the next day.""
However, Imahn admits that her diet has affected her social life.
""I only eat between 12 and 8pm - if someone schedules a dinner for nine o'clock, I will go to the dinner but just drink water.
""What makes it difficult is that people are very judgemental,"" she says. ""I find it easier to do intermittent fasting when I am single, not when I am in a relationship."" Sugar rush
Freelance cameraman Colum O'Dwyer, 27, has been practising IF for a couple of years now. He eats two large meals a day, between 12 and 8pm.
""I like the discipline that comes with it,"" says Colum. ""It gives me a structure which is sorely needed when you manage your own time.
""I feel I'm always at risk of procrastinating by having overly elaborate breakfasts or lunches, so going from three meals a day to two frees up time and allows for greater productivity.""
For Colum it's also important to minimise sugar, to avoid a sugar rush - and subsequent crash. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Certain foods can have an impact on insulin levels
Dr Patel says that mood swings - caused by a change in insulin levels - can be a consequence of fasting, depending on what you are used to eating.
""If you have a diet that is very high in refined carbohydrates and you snack a lot, of course fasting is going to mean that you will be irritable,"" says Dr Patel. 'Not for everyone'
IF can be unsuitable for people with certain health conditions.
People with advanced diabetes, history of eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, those suffering from chronic diseases and pregnant or breastfeeding women should not attempt intermittent fasting. Fasting should not be attempted unless they are under the close supervision of a physician.
People who have stomach ulcers, should not fast either.
This kind of dieting has gained popularity in the last 10 years or so, but it has not been around for long enough to prove that it's any better or worse than other diets, says Dr Patel.
""We don't have massive trials but the evidence in this area is increasing. It's not black and white yet but what we are seeing from the existing human studies that we have is that there are positive attributes when done properly."" Related Topics "

The petition was started by Yumi Ishikawa who says she was made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour.
Her tweets on the issue went viral with more than 30,000 shares.
In 2015, a London receptionist was sent home from work without pay after she refused to wear high heels. High heels-row firm changes policy
Campaigners say that wearing high heels is seen as obligatory when applying for jobs.
Ms Ishikawa, also an actress, said: ""I hope this campaign will change the social norm so that it won't be considered to be bad manners when women wear flat shoes like men.""
She added that she had met a ministry official who was ""sympathetic"" towards the petition.
It's not the first time that a campaign has been launched to change dress codes at work for women.
Nicola Thorp set up a petition calling for UK dress code laws to be changed after she was asked to wear high heels at finance company PwC.
She was hired as a temporary member of staff and refused to comply with the dress code. Following coverage in the media, outsourcing firm Portico announced that female colleagues could ""wear plain flat shoes"" with immediate effect.
In 2017, a Canadian province scrapped the dress code which requires female employees to wear high heels.
The government of British Columbia said that high heel wearers face a risk of physical injury from slipping or falling as well as possible damage to the feet, legs and back. Related Topics "
Virginia Beach killings: Suspect 'resigned hours before mass shooting' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48504640,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Those killed leave a void, Virginia Beach manager Dave Hansen said A Virginia Beach city employee accused of killing 12 people and injuring four others at a municipal building resigned hours before the attack, police say.
DeWayne Craddock, 40, gave his two weeks' notice in an email on Friday morning, just before he allegedly opened fire on his colleagues.
Officials have yet to give a motive, but say the suspect was ""in good standing"" and was not forced to resign.
The gunman shot indiscriminately before dying in a gun battle with police.
A city official told the Associated Press on Monday the resignation letter had been brief and had not contained any indication of his plans to attack the office building.
""I will tell you, he was not terminated, and he was not in the process of being terminated. So hopefully we're going to put that piece of this to rest,"" Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said on Sunday, referring to reports that the gunman had attacked the office over his termination.
Chief Cervera said police were further examining his employment status.
But a person close to the city's government told the New York Times on Saturday that the suspect had recently been involved in physical altercations with other employees , and had been told disciplinary action would be taken over a violent incident last week. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The shooting was at Building 2 in Virginia Beach Municipal Center
The person said he had had no history of behavioural problems.
Officials have identified the 12 victims, 11 of whom were city employees and one a contractor at the municipal centre. Authorities said they would only refer to Craddock by name once, in order to focus attention on the victims. What is known about the victims?
The municipal workers killed were Laquita Brown; Tara Gallagher; Mary Louise Gayle; Alexander Gusev; Katherine Nixon; Richard Nettleton; Christopher Kelly Rapp; Ryan Keith Cox; Joshua Hardy; Michelle Langer and Robert Williams.
Robert Williams had worked for the authority for 41 years, the news conference was told, while Christopher Rapp had been there for only 11 months.
The contractor was identified as Herbert Snelling.

Four people were wounded, including a police officer whose life was saved by his bulletproof vest.
Outside the municipal centre on Monday, residents visited a makeshift memorial displaying flowers, stuffed animals and crosses emblazoned with victims' names. What about the gunman?
Police said Craddock had been employed as an engineer with the city's public utilities department for 15 years.
According to AP, he had served in the military and was described by neighbours as quiet and ""rarely smiling"".
Some US media had reported that the gunman had recently been fired, or was about to be fired.
But Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen said that he had been ""in good standing within his department and there were no issues of discipline ongoing"".
Two .45-calibre pistols were recovered at the scene and appeared to have been legally purchased, according to Ashan Benedict, the regional special agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
At least one of the guns was equipped with a sound suppressor. How did the shooting unfold?
The attack began shortly after 16:00 (20:00 GMT), at Virginia Beach Municipal Center. The area was put into lockdown by police and employees were evacuated. "

The aid is being stockpiled at the request of the Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, who declared himself interim president last month.
President Nicolás Maduro has alleged that the aid is part of a US plot to disguise an invasion into Venezuela.
Mr Guaidó said some 600,000 Venezuelan volunteers would carry the aid across the border on 23 February.
""We will mobilise within and outside our borders,"" he said in a tweet on Saturday, adding: ""Our struggle continues to yield results!""
It remains unclear if the aid will be allowed to enter Venezuela.
One road bridge between Venezuela and Colombia remains blocked on the Venezuelan side by shipping containers.
Speaking at a news conference in Cucuta, USAID administrator Mark Green said the aid had been requested by Mr Guaidó because Venezuela was in the grip of a growing humanitarian crisis.
""Children are going hungry, and nearly every hospital in Venezuela is experiencing serious medicine shortages."" Report
He said the crisis had reached regional proportions, with three million Venezuelans migrating to neighbouring countries in search of food and medicine.

Mr Guaidó said that preparations were being made for a mass mobilisation - dubbed Operation Freedom - to try to force Mr Maduro to step down. The event is intended to culminate in a huge march through Caracas.
No date has been set but Mr Guaidó said a rehearsal of the operation would be held on 6 April. He promised to travel across Venezuela to help preparations.
Mr Guaidó, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim leader on 23 January, saying Mr Maduro's re-election last May was illegitimate. Blackouts worsen crisis
Caracas was first plunged into darkness on Monday. Power was restored four hours later, before a second blackout struck. The government told workers and students to stay at home as the power cuts continued.

He had gone on state TV earlier to repeat the now-familiar assertion that opposition sabotage rather than a lack of maintenance had caused the afternoon blackout, saying hackers had attacked computers at the country's main hydroelectric dam.
The minister boasted that the first power cut had been fixed in ""record time"". Since the second outage, power has still not been restored.

Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the attempt to deliver aid could spark violence and be used as a pretext by the US to remove Mr Maduro.
Citing unspecified information, she also accused the US and its Nato allies of discussing how to arm the Venezuelan opposition and claimed US special forces and equipment were being deployed near the country. Genuine help or Trojan horse?
By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent in Caracas
There is no doubt this has become a political issue. Juan Guaidó and his supporters want to spread the word about how important the foreign humanitarian aid is. President Maduro accuses it of being a Trojan horse.
There is a feeling of optimism among many Venezuelans at the moment - an energy that has not existed in the country for a long time. And the hope that Saturday may be the start of a new path.
But if the stand-off drags on, the fear is that this positive energy that has revived Mr Maduro's critics will wane, as will the interest of the international community, and that's what Mr Guaidó needs to achieve regime change.
People want to know about a plan B - if indeed Mr Guaidó has thought of one. Otherwise, the hope here will soon turn to despair. Read more from Katy Guaidó heads to Cúcuta
Mr Guaidó is leading a convoy that left the capital, Caracas, on Thursday, to Cúcuta, some 800km (500 miles) away.
He has said 600,000 volunteers have already signed up to help carry aid into Venezuela while the Venezuelan government said it would deliver 20,600 of its own food boxes to the Colombian border area.
Venezuela's military has so far resisted calls to abandon Mr Maduro, in power since 2013.
However, former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal called on the military to break with the president and to allow aid in. In a video posted online, the congressman recognised Mr Guaidó as ""president in charge"" and issued a stinging rebuke to Mr Maduro.
""You've killed hundreds of young people in the streets for trying to claim the rights you stole - this without even counting the dead for lack of medicines and security.""
Mr Guaidó's aides in Washington said 11 Venezuelan diplomats based in the US had defected and declared their support for him. Related Topics"
Sudan crisis: Security forces condemned for violence against protesters - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48503408,"
But the TMC's head, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said in a statement broadcast on state television that they had decided to ""stop negotiating with the Alliance for Freedom and Change and cancel what had been agreed on"".
An election in nine months time would take place under ""regional and international supervision"", he added.
The announcement came after leaders of the pro-democracy movement, who demand that a civilian government take over the running of the country, said they were stopping all contact with the TMC and called a general strike. What happened at the protest sites?
The security services moved on the main protest site early on Monday, activists said, and heavy gunfire could be heard in video footage.
The demonstrators have been occupying the square in front of the military headquarters since 6 April, five days before Mr Bashir was overthrown.
In a statement read on national television, the military council expressed its ""sorrow for the way events escalated"", saying the operation had targeted ""trouble makers and petty criminals"" .
""During the execution of the campaign, large numbers of these groups took shelter in the sit-in square, which led some of the square's officers, based on their judgment, to follow and chase them, which led to losses and injuries.""
The military, the statement added, was dedicated to protecting civilians. Image copyright AFP Image caption Protesters set ablaze tyres to try to stop Sudan's security forces
Earlier, activists said the security forces had surrounded one hospital in Khartoum and had opened fire at another.
The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, which is close to the protesters, said 30 people - including an eight-year-old child - had been killed, and that the toll was likely to rise as not all casualties had been accounted for.
Hundreds of people had been injured, it added.
Some residents blame the notorious paramilitary unit known as the Rapid Support Forces, set up to help keep Mr Bashir in power and with roots in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan, which began in 2003.
Then known as the ""janjaweed"", this militia carried out frequent massacres.
The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which is spearheading nationwide protests, called for a campaign of ""sweeping civil disobedience to topple the treacherous and killer military council"". What has the reaction been?
The UN secretary general urged the Sudanese authorities to facilitate an independent investigation and to hold those responsible accountable.
UN Secretary General António Guterres called for an independent investigation saying he was ""alarmed"" by reports that officers had opened fire in a hospital.
""He condemns the use of force to disperse the protesters at the sit-in site and he is alarmed by reports that security forces have opened fire inside medical facilities,"" a statement for Mr Guterres said.
In other reaction: UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said this was ""an outrageous step that will only lead to more polarisation and violence"" and that the military council ""bears full responsibility"" Tibor Nagy, US assistant secretary of state for Africa, said: ""This was a brutal and coordinated attack, led by the Rapid Support Forces militia, that mirrors some of the worst offenses of the Bashir regime"" The African Union called for an immediate and transparent investigation A closed-door meeting at the UN Security Council was due to be held on Tuesday at the request of the UK and Germany
Sudan's state news agency said the public prosecutor had set up a committee to investigate the violence. 'People power' takes big hit
Analysis by Tomi Oladipo, BBC's Africa security correspondent
It is back to square one for Sudan's political process. The hardening stances that stalled the talks between the protest groups and the TMC have been further cemented on both sides.
Expect more resolute protests and a possibly even more ruthless crackdown from the men in uniform. It is the latter who are governing right now. What matters is which faction of the security forces has the upper hand in the TMC.
The hardliners, particularly the Rapid Support Forces - led by the deputy head of the regime, Mohamed ""Hemeti"" Hamdan Dagalo - appear to be leading the way and could display more ruthlessness than has been seen so far.
There has been a total lockdown in Khartoum, indicating something has shifted within the regime. ""People power"" is taking a big hit, but protesters could be willing to take greater risks to force the military's hand, if possible.

Caster Semenya: Olympic 800m champion can compete after Swiss court ruling - BBC Sport,www.bbc.com,,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/48504205,"Read more about sharing. Caster Semenya has won the Olympic 800m title twice and the world title three times Caster Semenya will not need to take testosterone-reducing medication to compete after a Swiss court temporarily suspended a new IAAF ruling.
The Olympic 800m champion, 28, last month lost her challenge to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) against the implementation of a restriction on testosterone levels in female runners.
The ruling would have affected women competing from 400m to the mile.
""I hope following my appeal I will once again be able to run free,"" she said.
""I am thankful to the Swiss judges for this decision.""
Following the decision by Cas, the South African took her appeal to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, citing the need to defend ""fundamental human rights"".
Her legal representative Dr Dorothee Schramm said: ""The court has granted welcome temporary protection to Caster Semenya.
""This is an important case that will have fundamental implications for the human rights of female athletes.""
In a statement to BBC Sport, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland said it had ""super-provisionally instructed the IAAF to suspend the application of the 'Eligibility Regulations for the Female Classification for athletes with differences of sex development' with respect to the claimant, until the decision on the request for issuance of provisional measures"".
It added: ""At present, it is not known when the Swiss Federal Supreme Courts will issue an interlocutory order concerning these provisional measures.""
The IAAF said it had yet to receive notification of the new decision from the Swiss court.
In its initial judgement Cas found that the new rules proposed by the IAAF - athletics' world governing body - for athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) were discriminatory, but concluded that the discrimination was ""necessary, reasonable and proportionate"" to protect ""the integrity of female athletics"".

It was confirmed in a statement from police on Monday the case had been dropped.
They were arrested on 31 August over the suspected theft of confidential documents from the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman's office.
Durham police were the lead investigators brought in by the PSNI to examine the case against the men.
The investigative journalists had been involved in a documentary film, No Stone Unturned.
It examined the Royal Ulster Constabulary's handling of the 1994 Loughinisland killings by the UVF.
Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption The attack in Loughinisland took place in June 1994 at the Heights Bar Six Catholic men were shot dead at Loughinisland, Co Down, after UVF gunmen opened fire in a village pub as their victims watched a World Cup football match.
The journalists said they were ""delighted and relieved"", but their first thoughts were with the Loughinisland families.
""The attack on us was an attack on them. We call on the PSNI and Durham to apologise to them for putting them through this unlawful charade,"" they said.
PSNI 'made huge error' in journalist raids Warrants set to be quashed Police told to return journalists' papers Raids on journalists 'like police state' Trevor Birney said: ""At a time when police could have reopened the investigation into those responsible for the murder of six men, instead they used the resources to go after journalists in what the court described as an unlawful investigation.""
Mr Birney said this was an ""absolutely daft investigation"" conducted by ""those who could not deal with the truth around Loughinisland.""
""We are also asking questions why would the PSNI unleash this assault on press freedom and local journalism at this time?"" he said.
""They decided to go after us rather than the killers.""
Image caption Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey had mounted a legal challenge against the police raids The two journalists' homes were raided at the time of their arrests last August.
They were detained, questioned and released during an operation undertaken by detectives from Durham Constabulary, supported by PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) officers.
On Monday evening, PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton thanked Durham Constabulary and Chief Constable Mike Barton for their part in what he called a ""sensitive investigation"".
He said he fully concurred with the decision not to progress the investigation adding that ""the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts"".
He said the fact that no-one had been brought to justice was ""a matter of huge regret for policing"".
Durham Chief Constable Mark Barton said some final lines of inquiry had still to be assessed, but these did not include the journalists.

Lawyers, KRW Law, said in a statement they had been instructed to make a complaint to the Police Ombudsman in respect of the ""'warped' investigation which led to the arrests"".
The firm said it was ""delighted for our clients Fine Point Films and Trevor Birney and their esteemed colleague Barry McCaffrey, who have received the news tonight that the investigation that led to their arrest is to be discontinued.
""We are obliged to the court for their urgent attention to the issues engaged in this case"".
A lawyer for Mr Birney and documentary maker Fine Point Films told the court last week that the case had ""set off alarm bells"" among media organisations in Britain, Ireland and the United States.
He said the police search operation was ""nothing less than outrageous"" and was the kind of operation associated with a police state.

Earlier on Monday, it was confirmed in court that computers, phones and documents seized by police would be handed back.
The material was taken from the two journalists' homes and offices.
Items seized include memory cards, cameras, phones, computers, cassettes and thousands of files containing millions of pages.
High Court judges last week ruled that the search warrants issued against the two journalists last year were ""inappropriate"".
The High Court judicial review was heard by Lord Chief Justice Morgan, Lord Justice Treacy and Mrs Justice Keegan.
Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey attended the hearing throughout, along with a number of supporters including fellow journalists.

The investigation started in late March when life jackets, wet pullovers and a rubber dinghy were discovered on a beach in northern France.
According to the prosecution, the imam was in contact with organised gangs of traffickers and took a commission on the sale of each boat.
Police found two boats, three outboard engines and life jackets in the imam's house. The two men confessed to buying seven boats between December 2018 and April 2019.
The imam claimed he visited a shop in Deulemont, on the border with Belgium, to purchase dinghies for a person he identified only as Kamal. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Thousands of migrants are still losing their lives trying to reach Europe by boat.

Prosecutors said their explanations ""did not reflect reality"" and that the Iranian national was often in the areas where the boats were discovered.

'There is no word for Down’s syndrome in my language' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48252939,"'There is no word for Down’s syndrome in my language' 4 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Clare Spencer Image caption Elly Kitaly takes her son Chadron swimming in place of the physiotherapy he needs for his Down's syndrome When Elly Kitaly gave birth to her son she found out he had Down's syndrome. She realised that the condition was so ignored in her country, Tanzania, that there was not even an adequate word in her language, Swahili.
This is Elly's account of her journey to find out why.
Waiting for an internal flight at Dar es Salaam's airport, a young accountant started making conversation with me.
""Why are you flying to Arusha?"" he asked.
I told him I was going to meet a friend I had made on Instagram. She is a mother, like me. Her son is four, like mine, and just like my son Chadron, he has Down's syndrome.
""What's Down's syndrome?"" he asked.
This is a question I get often in Tanzania. It doesn't matter how educated you are, no-one seems to know what it is.
I geared myself up to give my well-practised explanation.
I wanted to switch into our language, Swahili, but I knew I had to keep to English because there isn't a good-enough word for Down's syndrome in Swahili. From dwarf to zombie: the problematic terms used in Swahili to describe Down's syndrome
Mlimbuko dalili dumazi - this term is used in the Swahili dictionary for disabled people but I never hear anyone use it in real life. Doctors aren't even aware of it. ""Dumazi"" translates as dwarf and I have a suspicion that is because that is a translation of the word down - as in down low or short. This is a mistranslation because, while one of the symptoms can be stunted growth, Down's syndrome actually gets its name from the doctor who first observed all its characteristics together - John Langdon Down.
Taahira - this is the term I hear used most often. Its English equivalent is retard. Just like retard it is a highly offensive insult. But unlike in English, it hasn't been replaced by a term like ""learning disability"". Other insults with a similar meaning are ""mazazeta"" and ""zuzu"".
Mtindio wa ubongo - this is the most socially acceptable term and you'll hear officials use it, but it isn't accurate as it means cerebral palsy.
Ndondocha - this slang loosely means zombie, as in someone who has been possessed. It refers to the belief that witch doctors can cast spells to make people mentally disabled. It can also be used to mean someone who has been cursed by their ancestors.
My language is a reflection of my country - it can sometime feel like Down's syndrome (DS) doesn't exist in Tanzania.
Take my fellow passenger at the airport.
I explained to him that there are some common physical signs of DS, like slanted eyes and a flat nose.
He looked blank. So I showed him pictures and he said he hadn't seen people like this before.
We boarded our flight and the conversation came to an end but it got me thinking.
Looking back, I realised that growing up, I'd never seen a person with DS either. Not at school, not in the market, and not at church.
I was barely aware of the condition until I gave birth to my own son.
I remember frantically Googling it in my hospital bed. Find out more
Listen to Don't Hide My Son , on The Documentary, on the BBC World Service, on 4 June

I learnt that the most common form of Down's syndrome is trisomy 21, trisomy meaning third chromosome. You can think of chromosomes as the instruction manuals for how to build your body. It's typical to have 23 instruction manuals, each in duplicate, but people with trisomy 21 have an extra, third, copy of manual 21.
Crucially, I learnt that this extra chromosome comes about as a result of random events during the development of the embryo, egg or sperm cells.
If it's random, it can occur just as much in Tanzania as any other country.
Given that, why hadn't I, or my new accountant friend, seen anyone with DS in public?
With this question in mind, I arrived in Arusha and met my Instagram friend, Magreth Paschal, for the first time in real life. Image copyright Clare Spencer Image caption Magreth, right, showed me the devestating text message she received about her son Jotham, left
As we sat at her home admiring her plants from her floristry business, she told me the first she had heard of the condition was when her son was diagnosed.
Like me, she hadn't seen people with DS at all when she was growing up.
She suspected that this was because parents had been shamed into hiding their children.
The reason she held this suspicion was because of something that happened to her when her son Jotham was a baby.
A customer of hers had made a shocking accusation in a text message.
She'd kept the message and read it out loud to me: ""Shame on you for going to the witch doctor and sacrificing your son just so that you can get rich.""
I had heard of this idea before because I had been told that people had said similar things about me.
It's a complicated belief to get your head around.
Some people in Tanzania think that people have DS because their parents have gone to the witch doctor to cast a spell to make themselves rich and have given their own child's mental capabilities as a sacrifice. More on Tanzania and witchcraft: "
Oil and gas industry 'listening' to Greta Thunberg - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-48505692,"Image copyright PA Image caption Greta Thunberg sparked an international movement fighting against climate change The UK's offshore oil and gas sector ""is listening"" to teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, according to a leading industry figure.
Oil and Gas UK chief executive Deirdre Michie has told a conference climate change ""is a real and present danger that we must deal with together"".
She claimed the sector ""can find and deliver"" solutions to tackle the issue.
Miss Thunberg sparked an international youth movement after she staged a ""School Strike for Climate"" last year.
Since then school students around the world have gone on strike to demand action on climate change.
In a recent speech to MPs , the 16-year-old Swede criticised the UK for supporting new exploitation of fossil fuels and exaggerating cuts to carbon emissions.
UK is 'irresponsible' on climate, says Greta Greta Thunberg: 'Climate fight will never stop' Who is Greta Thunberg? In her speech at an industry conference in Aberdeen, Ms Michie said: ""I would like to reassure Greta Thunberg - we are listening, because we want the world to be a better place too.
""And while we believe that our industry's global contribution has improved the lives of billions of people, we are clear that climate change is a real and present danger that we must deal with together.""
She described the climate activist as an ""impressive young woman we can all take inspiration from"".
Image caption Ms Michie will tell delegates that the industry wants ""the world to be a better place too"" Ms Michie also responded to Ms Thunberg's contention, made at the UN climate conference in Poland in December, that ""if solutions within the system are so impossible to find, maybe we should change the system itself"".
Ms Michie said: ""I would like to suggest that as the UK's offshore oil and gas industry has so many talented people...we can find and deliver the solutions needed while at the same time positioning ourselves to be at the heart of an energy system that also needs to change - whether it is by the sector working to reduce its operational emissions as well as supporting the advancement of low carbon and abatement technologies.
""Indeed, along with our sector delivering from exploration through to decommissioning, it's already unlocking the energy transition with some operators extending their portfolios into other energies - Equinor, Total, Shell and BP.
""And of course, the downstream and utilities sectors are doing a lot of work in this too.""
'Greatest failures' In her speech to MPs in April, Miss Thunberg said the UK was supporting shale gas fracking, greater exploitation of North Sea oil and gas fields and expanding airports.
""This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind,"" she said.
She also described the UK's carbon emissions reduction as the result of ""very creative"" accounting.

Sewn on to the heart, the 3cm (1in) by 2cm patch, grown in a lab from a sample of the patient's own cells, then turns itself into healthy working muscle.
It also releases chemicals that repair and regenerate existing heart cells.
Tests in rabbits show it appears safe, Imperial College London experts told a leading heart conference in Manchester.
Patient trials should start in the next two years, the British Cardiovascular Society meeting heard.
A heart attack happens when a clogged artery blocks blood flow to the heart muscle, starving it of oxygen and nutrients.
This can damage the heart's pumping power and lead to incurable heart failure.

Is it time to treat sugar like smoking? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Nick Triggle Health Correspondent,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48499195,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Over the past decade, smoking has become marginalised and stigmatised.
From the smoking ban in 2007 to the introduction of plain packaging a decade later, everything has been done to discourage people from taking up the habit.
And there are signs sugar is heading the same way.
Sugary drinks are already taxed - and now a leading think tank has even suggested sweets, snacks and sugary drinks should be wrapped in plain packaging to make them less appealing, given the excess consumption of the sweet stuff.
The call has been made by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) in a new report.
IPPR director Tom Kibasi believes it could make a real difference.
""Plain packaging would help us all to make better choices and reduce the hassle of pester power for busy parents,"" he said.
He wants to see it adopted alongside a range of other measures, including a ban on junk food advertising.
That is something that has already been looked at by ministers.
But would plain packaging be a step too far? Industry against the move
Industry has been quick to object, with trade body the Food and Drink Federation arguing that branding is a ""fundamental commercial freedom"" and ""critical to competition"".
The same sort of arguments were put forward by the tobacco industry, but successive governments have still increasingly shown an appetite to get tough.
Interestingly, the government has not ruled the idea of plain packaging for sugar products entirely.
Instead, the Department of Health and Social Care is saying it is waiting to hear what England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has to say.
Why? There is a recognition that bold moves are needed if the ambition to halve the child obesity rate by 2030 is to be achieved.
Dame Sally has been asked to review the steps that are being taken to ensure no stone is left unturned.
In fact, she has already suggested that another measure floated by the IPPR - extending the tax on sugary drinks to other unhealthy foods - is a real option .
And she is said to be open to the idea of plain packaging, which of course would be an even more radical step. Image copyright PA Image caption All cigarettes must be sold in plain green packaging with health warnings
But what is clear from the last decade is that the unlikely can soon become likely.
During the early noughties, health campaigners and academic bodies were pushing and pushing for a ban on smoking in public places to be introduced.
Time after time, the government poured cold water on the move.
But then things slowly began to change once Patricia Hewitt became health secretary, paving the way for even more radical measures.
The approach seems to be working - smoking rates have fallen by a third in just over 10 years.
Some of the credit is clearly because of the growth of vaping as an alternative.
But tough public health tactics have no doubt played some part.
Evidence from Australia - the first nation to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products - suggests a quarter of the subsequent reduction in smoking rates could be attributed to the move.
As the debate rages about obesity, expect to hear much more about the merits of radical action on sugar. "
BBC - Future - Why is ADHD missed in girls?,www.bbc.com,Kelly Oakes,06-04-2019,2019,6,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190530-why-is-adhd-missed-in-girls,"Emily Johnson-Ferguson’s mind has been racing for as long as she can remember. The eating disorders she began suffering from as a teenager were her attempt to slow down her brain. Doctors tried to blame them on family problems and stress, but she knew that wasn’t it.
It was only last year, aged 42, that she finally got to the root of her problems: ADHD.
Johnson-Ferguson is not alone. Though the stereotypical image of ADHD is a boy bouncing around a classroom, that’s not the whole picture. Girls can have ADHD, too – and many go without diagnosis, and without treatment that could change their lives.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that comes in three types: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, or a combination of both. People with inattention may forget things, struggle to get organised, and find themselves easily distracted. Those with hyperactivity and impulsivity might struggle to stay sitting down, constantly fidget, and interrupt conversations.
View image of Some adults with ADHD rely on multiple reminders and calendars to stay organised (Credit: Credit: Getty Images)
The condition is usually first diagnosed in childhood, but most people don’t grow out of it. For those whose symptoms are missed as children, living with undiagnosed ADHD as they move into adulthood causes problems.
“When I was left to my own devices at university I just couldn't concentrate at all,” says Johnson-Ferguson. She switched courses, but it didn’t help. Her bulimia persisted throughout university, and for the next 20 years she also used alcohol, caffeine, and sugary drinks to self-medicate – common among adults with ADHD.
As her marriage broke down, she started to find life even more difficult. In an effort to start afresh, Johnson-Ferguson gave up her bad habits, but found no respite from her symptoms; instead, they got worse. At her lowest point she was spending days on end in bed. “At that time I couldn’t focus on anything,” she says.
Attention deficit
There is a concrete difference between the prevalence of ADHD in boys versus girls. In one study of 2,332 twins and siblings, Anne Arnett, a clinical child psychologist at the University of Washington, found that a sex difference in diagnosis could be explained by differences in symptom severity : boys tended to have more extreme symptoms, and a broader distribution of symptoms, than girls.
“It's an actual neurobiological difference that we're seeing,” says Arnett. It’s not clear why that’s the case, but it could be that girls have a protective effect at the genetic level, she says.
View image of Boys tend to have more severe ADHD symptoms
But the true size of the difference is unclear.
When it comes to real-world diagnoses, boys far outweigh girls. In studies that look at who meets ADHD criteria in the population as a whole, however, the ratio still favours boys, but less so. Depending on which research you look at, the ratio of boys to girls with ADHD could be anywhere between 2:1 and 10:1 .
“It would seem to suggest that there's actually a lot more females who are affected by ADHD,” says Florence Mowlem, an associate at healthcare consultancy Aquarius Population Health. “Yet, for some reason that we don’t quite understand, they don't seem to be getting the clinical diagnosis as often as males.”
Research suggests that girls need to have more severe, and more visible, symptoms than boys before their ADHD will be recognised. In one study of 283 children aged between 7 and 12 years old, Mowlem and colleagues looked at what differentiated both boys and girls who met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD from those who had a lot of ADHD symptoms, but not enough to be diagnosed.
Parents seemed to play down girls’ hyperactive and impulsive symptoms, while playing up those of boys
Mowlem, who was PhD candidate at King’s College London at the time, found that parents, in their own ratings, seemed to play down girls’ hyperactive and impulsive symptoms, while playing up those of boys. They also found that girls who did meet the criteria tended to have more emotional or behavioural problems than girls who didn’t. This was not the case for boys.
In a similar study of 19,804 Swedish twins published last year, Mowlem and her colleagues found that girls, but not boys, were more likely to be diagnosed if they suffered from hyperactivity, impulsivity, and behavioural problems .
Girls could also be better at compensating for their ADHD symptoms than boys, similar to how girls with autism mask their symptoms .
View image of Because of social norms, girls with ADHD are less likely to ‘bounce around the classroom'
“Girls are far less likely to bounce around the classroom, fighting with the teachers and their colleagues,” says Helen Read, a consultant psychiatrist and ADHD lead for a large London NHS Trust. “A girl who did that would be so criticised by peers and other people that it is just far harder for girls to behave in that way.”
Even when they are hyperactive, girls are more likely to be over-talkative, or rebellious – a bit of a wild child, she says. That might not be recognised by parents or teachers as being caused by ADHD, especially as we expect girls to be more sociable than boys anyway.
But more research is needed before we’ll know how big a problem this is .
Symptom similarity
If girls are losing out because they have less stereotypical symptoms, they might not be the only ones: boys with purely inattentive ADHD are probably being missed, too.
It’s a commonly held belief that girls are more likely to be inattentive than boys. But that’s a myth, says Elizabeth Owens, assistant clinical professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. She says the current best evidence shows that rates of inattention are the same for boys and girls.
For a long, long time, ADHD in girls was discounted, or overlooked – Elizabeth Owens
“The inattentive presentation is actually more common [among both boys and girls], but it tends to be under-recognised or under-diagnosed, because the kids aren't typically causing problems in the classroom,” she adds.
In fact, girls and boys with ADHD are much more similar than they are different, says Owens. “It underscores the fact that ADHD and girls is serious. For a long, long time, it was discounted, or overlooked.”
View image of Compared to boys with ADHD, girls with ADHD are more likely to develop depression later
One difference, though, is that girls with combined ADHD – who have both inattentive and hyperactive symptoms – are at higher risk of self-destructive actions as they enter adulthood. Girls with ADHD are also more likely to develop anxiety and depression later in life.
As part of a study that started in the 90s, Owens and her colleagues followed 228 girls, 140 of whom had ADHD, over two decades. At the second and third follow ups, when participants were on average aged 19 and 25 respectively, they found that girls who’d been diagnosed with combined ADHD in childhood were at higher risk of self-harm and attempting suicide .
In theory, recognising and treating ADHD early should help to mitigate this risk – although Owens says that, as yet, there’s no evidence to show this works. “ADHD is a chronic condition,” she says. “It's not something you can treat and it'll go away.”

Treatment for ADHD can, however, make a huge difference day-to-day.
Shortly after Johnson-Ferguson was finally diagnosed, she started taking medication, a stimulant commonly used to treat ADHD called lisdexamfetamine. “The next day I just sat down and watched a whole EastEnders,” she says. “It was like walking in slow motion for three days.”
She has to work hard to ensure she reaps the benefits of the drugs – exercising, eating healthily, drinking less, and forgoing caffeine – but the changes have been worth it. “The planning that I can do at work now is incredible, it’s like I’m a different person,” she says.

Beyond medication, knowing that the problems you’ve been facing throughout your life are not your fault can also be a huge weight lifted. Johnson-Ferguson describes her life pre-diagnosis as “42 years of feeling completely different to everybody on the planet”.
Now, she’s able to channel the positive aspects of her ADHD – hyper-focusing on short term projects – into a successful career in theatre marketing, while better understanding her shortfalls.
But many are not so lucky. Until we let go of the stereotypical image of what ADHD looks like and get to the bottom of why girls with the condition are being missed, plenty of women will end up living with symptoms that have drastic effects on their lives, without knowing they could get help.

The site at Crewe Toll, which is home to advanced engineering company Leonardo, was sold by owners Brockton Capital in an off-market transaction.
It was bought on behalf of an unnamed investor by Knight Frank Investment Management.
The site includes the Leonardo innovation hub, which covers 439,000 sq ft of office, lab and industrial space.
The aerospace, defence and security company, which employs about 1,800 staff in Edinburgh, recently signed a new 15-year lease at the hub.

The acquisition is the second major commercial property deal Edinburgh has seen in recent weeks.
Last month a German pension fund bought a major office and leisure development in the city centre for £120m.
The buildings at 4-8 St Andrew Square include offices for pensions giant Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA), a number of restaurants and a large TK Maxx store.
The site had been developed by Aberdeen Standard Investments (ASI) in conjunction with Peveril Securities.
The sale was thought to be the biggest mixed-use investment deal in Scotland since the St James Centre in 2016. Related Topics"

The protestors interrupted a service held at Gosford Anglican Church on the Central Coast of New South Wales state.
A group of about 10 people entered the church and pretended to pray while playing Muslim prayers over a loudspeaker.
Local police are investigating what the church described as a ""racist stunt"".
The Party for Freedom posted photos and video of the incident on social media, claiming it was a demonstration against the church's support for Islamic leaders and multiculturalism.

Father Rod Bower said the incident at his church terrorised the congregation.
""They were shocked,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
""I worked out who it was fairly quickly. Some of the congregation was quite traumatised.""

Last known survivor of Sobibor death camp uprising dies aged 96 - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48509422,"Last known survivor of Sobibor death camp uprising dies aged 96 4 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Semion Rosenfeld moved to Israel from Ukraine in 1990 Semion Rosenfeld - the last known survivor of the uprising at the Nazi extermination camp at Sobibor - has died in Israel aged 96.
Rosenfeld, who was born in Ukraine, passed away at a retirement home near Tel Aviv.
Rosenfeld was captured by the Germans while serving in the Soviet Army in 1941 and sent to the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland because he was Jewish.
In October 1943, he managed to escape together with some 300 prisoners.
A third of the escapees were caught almost immediately. Of the 200 who got out, only 47 survived World War Two.
More than 250,000 Jews are believed to have been killed at Sobibor in 1942-43. 'Anne Frank link' unearthed at Sobibor camp
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid tribute to Rosenfeld.
""He joined the Red Army, was captured by the Nazis but managed to escape from the death camp and continued to fight the Nazis,"" Mr Netanyahu wrote in a statement posted on Facebook.
""May his memory be a blessing,"" he wrote. Image copyright US Holocaust Memorial Museum Image caption Sobibor was built by the Nazis solely to exterminate Jews
Isaac Herzog, the head of Israel's Jewish Agency who had been providing support to Rosenfeld, said he was ""very sad"". He described Rosenfeld as a ""true hero"".
Unlike some facilities which also functioned as labour camps, Sobibor was among the Nazi camps built solely to exterminate Jews.
After the 1943 uprising, the Nazi guards shot dead all the remaining prisoners and destroyed the camp, before planting it over in an attempt to cover up their crimes.
Archaeologists later discovered the foundations of gas chambers and a train platform. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Survivor warns Holocaust ""began with whispers"" Related Topics"

Kim Jong-un criticises 'wrong spirit' of mass games - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48508512,"What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse?
The games are designed to celebrate the country and boost morale, but Mr Kim's criticism is not unusual, analyst Minyoung Lee of NK Pro told the BBC.
""Kim Jong-un publicly criticises departments and poor work performance,"" she said, adding that his criticisms can range from public spectacles like the mass games to even mundane things like poor tree-planting. Image copyright KCNA Image caption Kim Jong-un wants the country's propaganda to step up its game
Key to interpreting his criticism is the context of the past months. In March, Mr Kim said the country needed to do its propaganda in a ""novel"" way.
Since then, state media has increased its coverage of propaganda work and warned against ""bourgeoisie ways of life"" and ""non-socialist phenomena,"" Ms Lee said. Pyongyang under pressure?
The sudden pressure on propaganda may seem like a surprise, but Pyongyang's efforts make sense when seen against the recent failure of US-North Korea talks.
When negotiations with the South and Washington began, the propaganda machinery scaled down its criticism of those two traditional enemies.
""Pyongyang may feel insecure about the ramifications of the diplomatic detente and softer anti-South Korea and anti-US rhetoric on the people's mindset,"" explains Ms Lee. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'I marched in a North Korea parade'
Yet the current diplomatic stalemate means it's unclear if talks with the US will continue.
Sanctions relief seems out of reach for now and the North will have to prepare its population for what could be prolonged economic difficulties.
This means ""hardening the people's minds against outside influences and promoting domestic unity,"" said Ms Lee. Kim's sister returns
Also in attendance at the opening of the games was Mr Kim's sister, who had not been seen publicly in nearly two months.

She has been absent from the public eye before, but her recent absence was by some observers linked to the failure of the negotiations with the US.
There were reports last week that several of North Korea's top officials had been purged or possibly even executed after the Hanoi summit.
With none of the reports verifiable , analysts have to read official photos and seating patterns for clues as to who might have fallen out of favour.
Kim Yo-jong appears to no longer be member of the Politburo, as some official photos show her too far from Kim Jong-un to still be part of that powerful body, Ms Lee said.
The fact that she sat only two chairs from her brother during the mass games is hard to interpret, as there is more flexibility in seating arrangements during performances like this one, Ms Lee added.
South Korean media last week speculated about two other diplomats having been purged. One of the them has since reappeared in photos alongside Mr Kim while the other's fate remains unclear. Related Topics"
Sex diseases on the rise in England - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48509969,"Image copyright Getty Images Cases of sexually transmitted infections are increasing in England.
In 2018, there were 447,694 new diagnoses of STIs , a 5% increase on the 422,147 in 2017.
Gonorrhoea increased the most - by 26% to 56,259 cases, the largest number since 1978.
There were 7,541 cases of syphilis - a 5% increase on 2017.
High-risk groups include young people and men who have sex with men.
The most commonly diagnosed STIs were:
chlamydia (218,095 cases, 49% of all new STI diagnoses) genital warts (57,318 cases, 13%) gonorrhoea (56,259 cases, 13%) genital herpes (33,867 cases, 8%) The number of gonorrhoea cases has been increasing for years among both men and women, despite repeated warnings from public health doctors about the risks of unprotected sex.
Sometimes referred to as ""the clap"", it is a bacterial infection passed between people through unprotected sex.

Some people have no symptoms but can pass it on to their sexual partner.
It can be treated with antibiotics, although there have been recent reports of some cases of hard-to-treat "" super-gonorrhoea "" that are resistant to the usual choice of drugs.
Super gonorrhoea: Why your STI could become untreatable Have we fallen out of love with safe sex? STIs: What to do if you get one People with any of the symptoms of gonorrhoea - a yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis, or pain urinating - should visit their GP or a sexual health clinic for a test.
Gonorrhoea can cause serious long-term health problems, including infertility in women.
Experts are worried that many people are not getting tested for STIs when they should be.
Some may be too embarrassed to seek help - but cuts to services are also a concern.
Dr Olwen Williams, president of British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said sexual health services were at breaking point.
""Recent years have unfortunately seen severe and damaging cuts to sexual health service funding, jeopardising our ability to meet these challenges at a critical time,"" he said.
""The continuing escalation in gonorrhoea and syphilis diagnoses must be addressed as an urgent health priority, otherwise there is the potential for devastating consequences to the wellbeing of the wider population and the health system as a whole.""
Screening for chlamydia continued to decline in 2018, with just over 1.3 million young people tested.
Meanwhile, new cases of genital warts continued to decline.
Experts say this is due to the HPV vaccine - a jab offered to teenage girls (and soon boys too) and some adults in high-risk groups to protect against some strains of human papilomavirus, which are also linked to cervical cancer."

Trump's UK state visit: US media's verdict on first day - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48509752,"What did Trump bring with him to UK? 'Hint of tension' at the palace

But the toasts at Monday evening's state dinner at the palace ""carried an unmistakable hint of tension in the gilded Banquet Hall"", the Los Angeles Times reported.

The law requires any website or app on the register to provide local users' data on demand to intelligence servers such as the FSB internal security service.

A week after the fire, Paris police said the threat from lead exposure was ""very localised"", but warned people living near the landmark to use ""wet wipes to eliminate any dust"".
Now the Regional Health Agency in Paris has launched an ""environmental investigation"" after the child tested positive for lead in a blood test.
The test contained more than 50 micrograms per litre of lead, the agency said.
As a result, children under seven and pregnant women who live on the Île de la Cité - the island area where Notre-Dame was built - have been urged to consult their doctor ""as a precaution"".
Investigators are seeking to establish the cause of the child's exposure, adding that ""other factors"" aside from lead released by the fire are not being ruled out.
Lead, a metal which is toxic to humans, affects multiple body systems and is particularly harmful to young children, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
It can cause neurological defects, as well as nervous system and kidney problems, and there is no known level of exposure that is considered safe, the WHO says.

Hong Kong's Victoria Park is once again a sea of candlelight as far as the eye can see.
The crowd, many dressed in black, is mostly silent whilst holding up their candles in mourning. Some are crying. In between protest songs, they chant ""the people will not forget"".
The crowd claps and cheers when Liane Lee - who took part in the 1989 protests - shouts: ""We refuse to forget. We refuse to believe the lies"".
Standing watching is Teresa Chan. She has attended the commemoration every year since 1990, except once when she was ill.
""I wanted to go Beijing to be with the movement but I couldn't,"" she says. ""I never imagined it would end the way it did, it's very hard to forget.""
But there are also new faces in the crowd this year. Image caption Protestor Teresa Chan has come to the protest in Hong Kong nearly every year
Ms Leung, who is in her 30s, says she decided to come for the first time because she is worried about Hong Kong's future.
""I am very angry with what the Chinese government is doing here,"" she says.
Amongst the remembrance flowers and candles, there are posters protesting against proposed amendments to laws concerning extraditions to mainland China. Many fear the changes will lead to the further erosion of civil liberties here in Hong Kong.
Here in Victoria Park are also some mainland Chinese residents like Mr Zeng who travelled to Hong Kong with his wife and 11-year-old daughter just to attend tonight's event.

In response, a Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington DC said his comments were ""an affront to the Chinese people"".
On Tuesday, China issued separate travel warnings to its citizens travelling to the US, citing police harassment and crime.
Its foreign ministry accused American law enforcement agencies of ""harassing"" Chinese citizens in the US through immigration checks and other methods. What happened in 1989?
Pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square in April 1989 and began the largest political demonstrations in communist China's history. It lasted six weeks.
On the night of 3 June tanks moved in and troops opened fire, killing and injuring many unarmed people in and around Tiananmen Square.
Afterwards the authorities claimed no-one had been shot dead in the square itself. Estimates of those killed in the crackdown range from a few hundred to several thousand. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Wang Dan one of the leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests

Sudan crisis: What you need to know - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48511226,"'Why Sudan is shooting medics' The military has also faced international condemnation for launching a violent attack on protesters in Khartoum on 3 June which reportedly left at least 30 dead. The US condemned what it called a ""brutal attack"" and the UK said the military council bore ""full responsibility"". In response, the TMC expressed ""sorrow for the way events escalated"", saying that the operation had targeted ""trouble makers and petty criminals"" . Advertisement Who are the opposition? The economic problems brought Sudanese from all walks of life to the streets, but the organisation of demonstrations was taken on by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) - a collaboration of doctors, health workers and lawyers. The protesters are mostly young, reflecting the country's demographics, but people of all ages have been seen in the crowds. Women are at the forefront of the demonstrations and a video of a woman who has been named Kandaka, meaning Nubian queen, leading the chants has gone viral. Video caption A woman dubbed 'Kandaka', which means Nubian queen, has become a symbol for protesters When the military took power in April, demonstrators stayed put outside its headquarters and insisted that it transfer authority to a civilian administration. Talks between the ruling generals and the protest organisers, who have come together under the umbrella group Alliance for Freedom and Change, initially showed little sign of progress, but they eventually came to an agreement. Video caption Sudan military attacks protesters What did the two sides agree? The military and protesters agreed on 15 May to a three-year transition period to civilian rule. Demonstrators argue that Mr Bashir's regime is so deeply entrenched that a long transition is needed to dismantle his political network and allow fair elections. The two sides also agreed on the structure of a new government - including a sovereign council, a cabinet and a legislative body. But the military leaders scrapped all of these agreements on 3 June and said fresh elections would be held within nine months. The TMC's head said they had decided to ""stop negotiating with the Alliance for Freedom and Change and cancel what had been agreed on"". Former British ambassador to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, told the BBC that the snap election would ""simply pave the way for much of the old regime to come back into power"". The announcement came shortly after the violent crackdown on protesters in Khartoum. In the wake of killings, the leaders of the pro-democracy movement said they were cutting all contact with the TMC and called for ""total civil disobedience"" and a general strike. What about mediation? When talks broke down, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed flew to Sudan to try to broker a new agreement between the two sides. After days of talks, his special envoy, Mahmoud Dirir, announced on 11 June that protest leaders had agreed to suspend widespread strikes and return to the negotiating table. Mr Dirir said that, in return, the military had agreed to release political prisoners. No firm date for the resumption of talks was given. The privately-owned Baj News website reported that the opposition was insisting on an independent investigation into the violent crackdown before direct talks restart. What has the international response been? Most African and western countries have backed the protesters. Saudi Arabia has urged discussions between the two sides, but not directly condemned military violence. Along with UAE and Egypt, it perhaps fears the protests could inspire similar events to take place on home turf. The TMC's vice president, Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, also known as Hemeti, flew to Saudi Arabia last month to meet the crown prince Mohamed Bin Salman, promising to stand with the kingdom against threats and continue sending Sudanese troops to help the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. The African Union (AU) has suspended Sudan from its membership until a civilian led transitional authority is established. The UN is removing all non-essential staff from Sudan but China and Russia have blocked moves to impose sanctions. The US National Security Advisor, John Bolton, condemned the Khartoum violence, calling it ""abhorrent"". But the BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane said this will only mean something if the US demands that its regional allies - Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - exert pressure on the Sudanese military.

The move, which was announced by Trump administration officials, intends to roll back a US-Cuba thaw that began under President Barack Obama.
It is unclear exactly how the rules, which takes effect on Wednesday, will impact travel to the island nation.
US officials say the new rules seek to punish the country's communist regime.
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement on Tuesday the measures come in response to Cuban efforts ""to play a destabilising role in the Western Hemisphere, providing a communist foothold in the region and propping up US adversaries in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua by fomenting instability, undermining the rule of law, and suppressing democratic processes"".
""This administration has made a strategic decision to reverse the loosening of sanctions and other restrictions on the Cuban regime,"" Mr Mnuchin said.
""These actions will help to keep US dollars out of the hands of Cuban military, intelligence, and security services."" Venezuela crisis in 300 words
US tourism to Cuba is not permitted, but certain forms of organised group travel, known as ""people-to-people"" travel, had been allowed until Tuesday's announcement.
Commercial travel can continue, as long as the trips ""broadly support family travel and other lawful forms of travel"", a US State Department spokesperson added, but other vessels such as private yachts or planes are banned.
Cruise ship companies have not yet reacted to the news, but Norwegian Cruise Lines tweeted to one concerned customer: ""We are closely monitoring these recent developments and any resulting impact to cruise travel to Cuba.
""We will communicate to our guests and travel partners as additional information becomes available.""
Cuban government statistics show that Americans have become the second largest group of visitors to the island, after Canadians - with more arriving by ship than plane.
Americans who have already booked ""at least one travel related transaction"" - such as purchasing a flight - will still be allowed to continue their travel, US officials say.
White House national security adviser John Bolton outlined plans for sanctions earlier this year, referring to Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua as a ""troika of tyranny"".
In a tweet on Tuesday, he said the new rule means ""ending 'veiled tourism' to Cuba"". "

Scot Peterson, a security guard at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, did not enter as shots rang out last year and later resigned.
US President Donald Trump called him a ""coward"" for not acting.
Mr Peterson said he did not know where the gunfire was coming from.

Soon afterwards, authorities released footage showing Mr Peterson waiting outside the school as the shooting was taking place.
Following an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), Mr Peterson was arrested on Tuesday on seven counts of neglect of a child, three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury.
The investigation showed Mr Peterson ""did absolutely nothing"" to prevent the shooting, FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen said in a statement.

Mark Chambers lumped ""homosexuals"" and ""transvestites"" together with ""baby killers"" and ""socialists"" in the post, according to TV station WBRC.
The Carbon Hill mayor reportedly maintained his words had been taken out of context, before apologising.
A gay rights group has demanded his resignation. The mayor could not immediately be reached for comment.
According to WBRC , Mr Chambers posted on Facebook a graphic that read all in capital letters: ""We live in a society where homosexuals lecture us on morals, transvestites lecture us on human biology, baby killers lecture us on human rights and socialists lecture us on economics!"" 'Why our fight for gay rights in Kenya isn't over'
The mayor reportedly commented on the post: ""The only way to change it would be to kill the problem out. I know it's bad to say but with out [sic] killing them out there's no way to fix it.""
The comment prompted calls for the mayor to step down, including from the Alabama branch of the Human Rights Campaign.
The group called Mr Chambers' comments ""horrifying, unconscionable and unacceptable"".
""LGBTQ people face disproportionate levels of violence and harassment in their daily lives - a fact that is especially true in Alabama. Mayor Chambers must be held to account.""
Mr Chambers has given no signal that he will step down as mayor of Carbon Hill, a town of less than 2,000 people, 150 miles (240km) north of the state capital, Montgomery.
When WBRC contacted Mr Chambers, he initially denied being writing the comment, according to the Birmingham, Alabama-based news station.
But in a subsequent call, he reportedly told WBRC he had made the comment public by mistake and intended to send it privately to a friend.
During his phone call with the TV station, Mr Chambers also reportedly mentioned immigrants in the US, calling them ""ungrateful"" and arguing they were taking over the country.
US media report that Mr Chambers posted an apology to his Facebook page, writing: ""Although I believe my comment was taken out of context and was not targeting the LGBTQ community, I know that it was wrong to say anyone should be kill [sic].""
Mr Chambers has been mayor of Carbon Hill since 2014.
According to the town website, he ran for office because Carbon Hill ""was not going in a positive direction"". "

Most women serving in the Lebanese armed forces work in administrative or logistical roles, but its top commander is trying to change this, the BBC's Eloise Alanna reports.
Gen Joseph Aoun says bolstering women's roles is among his top priorities, with the ultimate aim of getting them into combat roles.
Women are not allowed to work on the front line in the army, but there is no such rule in the air force.
Six women have so far applied to be pilots in the air force - they went through testing and only two qualified.
They are 1st Lieutenant Chantal Kallas, 27, and 1st Lieutenant Rita Zaher, 26.
Rita says she met resistance when she first decided to join the armed forces, with many seeing her as ""taking a man's job"".
Chantal wanted to become a pilot from a young age but her parents were worried she would not be able to juggle work and family life. Despite the social pressures, she followed through with her plan.
""In my opinion, a woman has to overcome all of the challenges with their family or society to realise her ambition,"" she says.
Twenty-four year old Manar Eskandar is a sergeant and the first female mechanic in the air force.
When she started out, Manar was given mainly administrative tasks. But she later asked to be given a real mechanic's work - and her superiors agreed.
""When I first came here my male colleagues looked at me with sympathy, like I needed help. But little by little I have become stronger in my job and started doing work that they can't do themselves,"" Manar says.
""I have small hands so sometimes I can do things they can't, like reaching into areas of the engine they can't.""
Chantal says times are changing for women in the Lebanese armed forces.
""Everyone in the air force is helping us and encouraging us to fulfil our ambition, and this is why perceptions are changing and men have become more accepting of women in combat positions and emancipating women in society."" All photographs copyright Eloise Alanna Related Topics"
Does porn still drive the internet? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Tim Harford Presenter,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48283409,"Does pornography still drive the internet? By Tim Harford Presenter, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy 5 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Is Avenue Q's Trekkie Monster puppet right about porn and the internet? Consider the opening lines of The Internet is for Porn, a song from the Broadway musical Avenue Q.
Kate Monster: ""The internet is really, really great.""
Trekkie Monster: ""For porn!""
Kate Monster: ""I got a fast connection so I didn't have to wait.""
Trekkie Monster: ""For porn!""
Innocent kindergarten teacher Kate Monster is trying to celebrate the usefulness of the internet for shopping and sending birthday greetings.
Meanwhile, her surly neighbour Trekkie Monster insists that people really value it more for more intimate activities.
Is he right? Sort of... but not really.
Credible-seeming statistics suggest that about one in seven web searches is for pornography . This is not trivial - but of course it means that six in seven web searches are not.
The most-visited pornography website - Pornhub - is roughly as popular as the likes of Netflix and LinkedIn. That's pretty popular but still only enough to rank 28th in the world when I checked.
But Avenue Q was first performed in 2003, an age ago in internet terms, and Trekkie Monster might have been more correct back then.
New technologies often tend to be expensive and unreliable. They need to find a niche market of early adopters, whose custom helps the technology to develop.
Once it is cheaper and more reliable, it finds a bigger market, and a much broader range of uses.
There is a theory that pornography played this role in the development of the internet, and a whole range of other technologies. Does it stack up? More things that made the modern economy
Since the very dawn of art, sex has always been a subject. Prehistoric cave-painters record buttocks, breasts, vulvas and comically large penises.
Carvings of copulating couples date back at least 11,000 years, to goat herders in Judea.
About 4,000 years ago, a Mesopotamian artist lovingly crafted a terracotta plaque of a man and woman having sex as she sips beer through a straw.
A couple of millennia later, the Moche in northern Peru depicted intercourse through the medium of ceramics. India's Kama Sutra dates from about the same time . Image copyright other Image caption The Kama Sutra is perhaps the most celebrated work on love and sex
But just because people used the arts and crafts to depict erotica does not mean it was the driving force behind these techniques. There's no reason to think it was.
Consider Gutenberg's printing press. Although titillating books were certainly printed, the main market for reading material was religious.
A more plausible candidate, leaping ahead to the 19th Century, is photography.
Pioneering studios in Paris did a roaring trade in so-called ""art studies"", a euphemism the authorities didn't always accept.
Customers were willing to pay enough to fund the technology: for a time, it cost more to buy an erotic photograph than to hire a prostitute.
The word ""pornography"" derives from the Greek for ""writing"" and ""prostitutes"".
By the time of the next big technological breakthrough in artistic expression - the moving picture - the word had taken on its modern meaning.
But pornography didn't really drive the film industry, for obvious reasons.
Films were expensive. You needed a big audience to recoup your costs. That meant public viewings.
And while many people paid to look at pornographic pictures in the privacy of their home, far fewer people were comfortable watching an adult film in a public cinema. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Actor Debbie Rae poses in front of a series of ""penny peepshow"" machines showing short pornographic films
One solution came in the 1960s with the peepshow booth - an enclosed space where you'd put coins in a slot to keep a film playing.
One booth could bring in several thousand dollars a week.
But the real privacy breakthrough came thanks to the video cassette recorder (VCR).
In his book The Erotic Engine, writer Patchen Barss argues the VCR meant pornography ""came into its own as an economic and technological powerhouse"".
At first, VCRs were a hard sell: they were pricey, and they came in two incompatible formats - VHS and Betamax.
Who would risk plunging a significant chunk of cash into a device that might soon be obsolete? People who really wanted to watch adult films at home, that's who. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Linda Lovelace starred in the very successful X-rated video release Deep Throat, although later complained she had been forced to take part, and became an anti-porn campaigner
In the late 1970s, most videotape sales were pornographic.
Within a few years, the technology was more affordable for people who wanted to watch family films - and as the market expanded, pornography's share of it shrank .
A similar story can be told about cable television - and, yes, the internet.
Older readers might remember when getting online meant coaxing a dial-up modem into establishing a connection, then fretting about phone charges as it slowly chugged through a file that would nowadays download in the snap of a finger.
What would motivate an ordinary person to persevere? You've guessed it.
A few years later, research into internet chat rooms indicated a similar proportion of activity devoted to sex. Image copyright Getty Images
So in those days, Trekkie Monster's analysis wouldn't have been far wrong.
And, as he suggests to Kate, appetite for pornography helped to drive demand for faster connections: better modems and higher bandwidth.
It spurred innovation in other areas, too. Online pornography providers were pioneers in web technologies, such as video file compression and user-friendly payment systems, and in business models, such as affiliate marketing programmes.
All these ideas went on to find much wider uses. And as the internet expanded, it gradually became less for pornography and more for all that other stuff.
Nowadays, the internet is making life hard for professional pornographers.
Just as it's hard to sell a newspaper subscription or a music video when so much is available free online, it's hard to sell pornography when sites such as Pornhub are giving it away.
Much of this free pornography is pirated and it's an uphill struggle to get the illegally uploaded content removed , as Jon Ronson chronicles in his podcast series The Butterfly Effect . Image copyright Gabe Ginsberg Image caption Casey Calvert has shot hundreds of ""custom"" pornography films in recent years
One emerging niche is to produce ""custom"" pornography, for clients such as the man who paid adult star Casey Calvert - and others - to contemptuously destroy his stamp collection on film .
But, of course, what's bad for the content creators is good for the aggregator platforms, which make their money through advertising and premium subscriptions.
The big player in pornography at the moment is a company called Mindgeek, which owns Pornhub and several other top adult websites .
Its absolute dominance of the market is a problem, according to Prof Marina Adshade, of the Vancouver School of Economics, author of Dollars and Sex: How economics influences sex and love.
""Having a single buyer has put pressure on producers to lower the price of their films,"" she says.
""This hasn't just cut into pornographers' profits, it has radically changed the work of porn actors, who are now under greater pressure to perform acts that they would have been able to refuse in the past - and at a lower price.""
In Avenue Q, Trekkie Monster appears to do nothing all day but surf for pornography, so the other characters are surprised when he reveals he's a multi-millionaire.
His explanation? ""In volatile market, only stable investment is… porn!""
And, once again, Trekkie Monster is nearly right, but not quite.
For sure, there's money in pornography. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Will sex robots become an increasing presence in pornography?
But the best way to make it may be to invest in the technologies that enable it and which it enables.
In the past, that meant Parisian photo studios or companies making VCRs or high-speed modems; today, Mindgeek's algorithms that suggest content and keep eyeballs on screens.
And what will Trekkie Monster be singing in the future? ""Robots are for porn"", perhaps?
The role of sex in accelerating technology is unlikely to be finished yet.

Trump visit highlights crucial US-Irish economic ties - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Colm Kelpie Bbc News Ni,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48514478,"Image copyright PA Image caption Leo Varadkar and Donald Trump met at the White House earlier this year The improbable election of Donald Trump in 2016, coming just months after the Brexit referendum, added another element of uncertainty into the Irish economy.
Since taking office, he has radically overhauled US tax rules , shaken the foundations of global trade by slapping steep tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China , and repeatedly expressed support for Brexit.
Just this week, he advocated the UK leave the EU without a deal - and said Nigel Farage should be involved in the negotiations .
The president lands in the Republic of Ireland later on Wednesday for a two day visit that will include a stop-over at his golf resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, and a meeting with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar.
Given the hugely important economic ties between Ireland and the US, trade, jobs and Brexit are likely to dominate the agenda.
How extensive is the US-Irish economic relationship? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US accounts for nearly three quarters of the foreign investment into Ireland, experts say Big, big, big.
The US is the single largest source of foreign direct investment in Ireland, with more than 700 American companies employing an estimated 160,000 people.
""The United States accounts for about 70% of the foreign investment into Ireland and it continues to be a very strong source market across a number of sectors,"" says Kevin Sammon, director of global communications at IDA Ireland, Ireland's state agency responsible for attracting inward investment.
""US businesses have been locating in Ireland for over 100 years and, judging by recent investment numbers, they continue to see Ireland as a reliable partner for them in Europe.""
Some of those companies are among the world's largest, including technology giants like Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft, as well as a slew of drug companies such as Pfizer and healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson.
Experts say they've been lured to Ireland by a combination of factors, including its well-educated, multi-cultural workforce, easy access to the EU market and, of course, the relatively low 12.5% corporate tax offering.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why has every US president since JFK visited Shannon Airport? That's attracted the ire of President Trump.
He has, on a number of occasions, name-checked Ireland as a destination of choice for US companies seeking a low-tax base. Ireland has also made headlines internationally for the aggressive tax planning of some of the companies that have made the country their home, and their use of tax loopholes.
President Trump unveiled a sweeping tax reform plan in 2017 to encourage US companies to bring earnings back to the US.
Last St Patrick's Day, he quipped that the Irish were ""sharp, they're smart, they're great"" .
""And they're brutal enemies.""
It's not all one-way, though.
There are about 800 Irish companies active in the US market, employing 100,000 US citizens across the country, according to the American Chamber of Commerce.

They’re sharp, they’re smart, they’re great. And they are brutal enemies. You have to keep them as your friend. Always keep them as your friend.""
US President Donald Trump, on Irish people
""Ireland is now the ninth largest investor in the United States,"" says Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland.
""It's very much a two-way street. The US administration would have a strong focus in encouraging Irish companies to create more jobs in the States.""
Is the relationship all about jobs? Yes and no.
The US is also a significant location for Irish goods exports, pipped only by the EU as a whole .
""You cannot overstate the importance of the US-Irish relationship for the Irish economy,"" says Prof Ron Davies, head of economics at University College Dublin.
""The multinationals are a big part of it, and maybe they don't pay as much tax as some people think they should, but they still pay a significant amount in terms of tax.""

700 Number of US multinational companies in Republic of Ireland
160,000 Number of people employed in those companies
70% US share of total foreign investment into RoI
Source: American Chamber of Commerce Ireland/ IDA Ireland Since Ireland's recovery began following its crippling recession, its corporation tax take has dramatically surged.
It increased by 26% last year to €10.4bn (£9.2bn), driven by higher and increased payments from manufacturing companies and big multinational firms.
The share of corporation tax paid by the top 10 corporate taxpayers now accounts for 45% of all the tax paid.
""There is a special relationship there that has massive economic benefits,"" adds Prof Davies.
But it also, arguably, leaves Ireland vulnerable to outside economic shocks.
How so? Changes in the global trade order for one - something which President Trump has set his eyes on.
In March 2018, he said trade wars were good , tweeting that the US was ""losing billions of dollars on trade"" and would find a trade war ""easy to win"".
During his election campaign, he spoke aggressively about trade, US agreements and even some of the country's trading partners.
Since the late 1940s, the global trend has been towards reducing or eliminating barriers to trade and global commerce.
Image copyright PA Image caption Facebook is one of the US companies which has European headquarters in Ireland But Mr Trump is sceptical about that policy.
Economists have warned that, given the open nature of Ireland's economy, that could spell trouble.
""What he's talking about doing to international trade norms, that is going to have a very swift, very direct impact on Ireland,"" says Prof Davies.
""He can't pick a trade war with Ireland because we're part of the EU, but do I think he can pick a trade war with the European Union? Sure, it seems to be his thing.""
Has President Trump's rhetoric affected the Irish economy? The Irish economy performed strongly once again in 2018, and the IDA says there has yet to be an impact on US investment flows into Ireland.
But its chief executive, Martin Shanahan, has urged caution and says Ireland cannot be complacent.
He said there had been a slowdown in decision-making from potential US investors.
""Ireland is a small open trading economy, and increased nationalism and protectionism is likely to have an impact on future FDI figures,"" he said last year .
Image copyright Conor McCabe Photography Ltd Image caption Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, says there is huge expansion taking place in Ireland Prof Davies says the president's support for Brexit is a negative for Ireland.
""For me the biggest worrying aspect is his sticking his fingers in Brexit, encouraging Boris Johnson, saying Nigel Farage should have a place at the [negotiating] table, because as the UK goes, so does Ireland,"" he says.
That could mean a greater risk of a hard Brexit, he says, arguing that would be ""extraordinarily bad news for Ireland"".
But Mr Redmond says there are still ""very significant"" job announcements from US firms right across Ireland.

Can Virat Kohli take India to its third World Cup win? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Suresh Menon Sports Writer,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48458142,"Can Virat Kohli take India to its third World Cup win? By Suresh Menon Sports writer 5 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Reuters Image caption Virat Kohli is the finest all-round batsman in the world Ever since the 1987 World Cup, India have consistently been one of the favourites to win the title; they made it in 2011.
There are usually four teams equally capable of winning, and this year in England is no different. Besides the hosts, who are the bookmakers' and pundits' favourites, Australia and India should make the semi-finals. They have the best balanced teams.
The fourth place should be a tussle between South Africa and New Zealand, although this would be a good opportunity for the West Indies, once the kings of the game, to find their place in the high table. Cricket World Cup 2019 fixtures
The West Indies had to qualify for this one, but they have a team that is as talented as it is unpredictable. New Zealand have been in more semi-finals than anybody else.
So the short answer to the question, can India win the World Cup, is ""yes"", but then so can any of the other semi-finalists. Image copyright AFP Image caption Jasprit Bumrah goes into the tournament as the world's best bowler
While the likes of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are capable of the odd upset (Sri Lanka, who have been in three finals, won in 1996), a World Cup calls for consistency, the ability to recover from a setback, and a series of wins rather than the occasional one.
Teams that begin with a bang and threaten to overrun the competition do not always make it.
World Cups have been won by teams that begin slowly, gathering confidence as they go along, perhaps taking in a defeat or two which point to the weaknesses which are then corrected in the later stages. Sometimes one match in the middle can make the difference; in 2011, India were a different team after they beat Australia, and even their fielding standards shot up.
To make it to the semi-finals, a team will need to win perhaps five matches in the round robin (the top four teams go through). India's supporters assume they will beat the bottom three and possibly the West Indies, leaving them to beat only one other. But then the same logic applies to the others too. Cricket World Cup quiz:
And then there is the match on 16 June - India versus Pakistan.
The teams no longer play in bilateral series, meeting only in a multi-nation tournaments. Of the two sub-plots in the World Cup, one is the anomaly of South Africa consistently ""choking""; the other is India's unbeaten record against Pakistan. It stands at 6-0, adding an extra layer of interest to a match that is full of layers already.
Both captains have already intoned the standard message on these occasions, saying it is, after all, only a game. This is as much a way of keeping their own players on this side of panic as of telling their fans back home that burning their effigies and stoning their houses if they lose is not really cricket. Image copyright AFP Image caption MS Dhoni's presence in the team is crucial
So how good is this Indian team?
The top three and the bottom three are world class. Openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are probably the best in the business, and with the finest batsman in the world Virat Kohli to follow, there is both style and substance at the top. KL Rahul will probably come in at four, unless India decides to experiment with Kohli at that slot and send Rahul in at three.
At the other end, Jasprit Bumrah goes into the tournament as the best bowler in the world, the master of the death overs and the main threat in the early ones. Mohammad Shami and Bhuvaneswar Kumar have continued their good form, while the two wrist spinners, Yuzuvendra Chahal and left-armer Kuldeep Yadav have already shown their effectiveness in England.
It is the middle order that is worrying. Image copyright AFP Image caption Hardik Pandya is an all-rounder who holds a key
Dhoni at number seven in the line-up is a reassuring sight, especially after his century in a warm-up match. But India will have to decide whether to play a pure batsman at five or one of the all-rounders.
Hardik Pandya is the fifth bowler and lower-order batsman who holds a key. There is also the left arm spin and aggressive batting of Ravindra Jadeja. Kedar Jadhav is a bits-and-pieces man with a strike rate above hundred while batting and around 40 with his off spin. Vijay Shankar, a candidate for the number four position, bowls medium pace and completes the list of players with more than one skill to offer.
Dhoni's presence behind the stumps is crucial. In recent matches, it appeared as if India had two captains - Kohli while India batted and Dhoni when they fielded. The spinners in particular rely on the wicketkeeper's inputs. Image copyright AFP Image caption The Indian team is aggressive, fit and focused on winning
World Cups have been won by captains. There was Clive Lloyd in the 1970s, Kapil Dev and Allan Border in the 80s, Imran Khan, Arjuna Ranatunga and Steve Waugh in the 90s, Ricky Ponting, Dhoni, and Michael Clarke in this century. Each stamped the tournament with authority and leadership. Each shaped his team in his own image.
The Kohlification of the Indian team has already been accomplished, with the captain forging a team that is aggressive, fit and focused on winning rather than looking pretty.
This could be India's greatest advantage going into a tournament they first won in 1983 as 66-1 outsiders. This time, however, the expectations are far greater.

'Alarming rise in self-harm - but only half get care' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48514349,"Image copyright Getty Images There has been an ""alarming"" rise in the rates of self-harm in England, research suggests.
A Lancet Psychiatry study found that in 2014, 6% of people had self-harmed, up from 2% in 2000 - with the highest rate in those aged 16-24.
But the number getting no help remained at about 50% - and experts said more support was needed.
And there are concerns self-harm could become more serious as people age, leading to suicidal behaviour.
The term self-harm describes when people hurt themselves, perhaps by punching, hitting or burning, as a way of dealing with difficult feelings or overwhelming situations and experiences.
The triggers can be complex, but experts suggest academic pressures, and problems such as bullying or body image, are increasingly significant factors.
Emma Thomas, chief executive of the charity YoungMinds, called the Lancet Psychiatry figures ""alarming"", adding: ""It's far too difficult for children and young people to get mental health support before they reach crisis point.""
'You're never alone' Dr Sally McManus, of the National Centre for Social Research who led the study, said she was struck by the numbers who did not have contact with medical or psychological services.
""At least half of people who self-harm don't get that sort of support. It's important we offer alternative, safer ways of coping.""
She said that could include giving people problem-solving skills, and promoting the benefits of exercise or cognitive behavioural therapy techniques.
""We need to place the emphasis on prevention, and prevent self-harm becoming embedded as a way of coping with emotional stress.""
The study looked at data from a series of mental health surveys of people across England, with 7,243 responses in 2000, 6,444 in 2007 and 6,477 in 2014.
Among 16 to 24-year-old women in 2014, 19.7% reported having self-harmed at some point in their life, compared with 11.7% in 2007 and 6.5% in 2000.
This increase was mainly because of rises in self-cutting and use of self-harm as a way of coping with unpleasant feelings.
Experts say that intervention, as well as helping people with their situation at the time, may prevent future suicidal behaviour.
Prof Louis Appleby, who co-authored the paper and leads the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England, said there was a risk that self-harm could become a normal way of people coping with difficulties in their lives as they got older.
""The self-harm they have learned may become more serious and more likely to have a fatal outcome.
""Young people need health and educational services to be available, and health professionals need to discuss self-harm with young people and encourage them to find safer ways of coping.""
Sophie Beer, manager of Addaction's Mind and Body self-harm service, said: ""Our message to young people is, 'You're never alone. Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you are struggling.'""
A Department of Health spokesperson said mental health was a key priority for the government.
It said its long-term plan for the NHS would give 380,000 more adults access to psychological therapies by 2023/4, and 345,000 more children and young people greater support in the next five years.
It also said it was piloting a four-week waiting time standard for treatment, training a new dedicated mental health workforce for schools, and ""teaching pupils what good mental and physical health looks like"".
What adults can do to help a child who is self-harming: Show you understand Talk it over Discover the triggers Build their confidence Show you trust them Choose who you tell carefully Help them find new ways to cope How to spot warning signs: Look for physical signs such as cuts, bruises, burns and bald patches from pulling out hair.
The emotional signs are harder to spot:
depression tearfulness and low motivation becoming withdrawn and isolated, for example wanting to be alone in their bedroom for long periods sudden weight loss or gain low self-esteem and self-blame drinking or taking drugs Source: NSPCC

"DR Congo Ebola outbreak: More than 2,000 cases reported - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48522299,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright EPA Image caption The DRC's Ebola outbreak is the second worst in history More than 2,000 cases of Ebola have been recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the last 10 months, officials have said.
Two thirds of the cases have been fatal, the health ministry added.
The outbreak in the east of DR Congo is the second biggest in history, with a significant spike in new cases noted in recent weeks.
But health workers' attempts to contain the outbreak has been hindered by mistrust and violence.
Despite the fact that more than 1,300 people have died of the disease since August, the charity Oxfam says its teams are meeting people every single day who still don't believe the virus exists, the BBC's Africa editor Will Ross reports. Why Ebola keeps coming back
Others don't trust the health workers, which leads people with symptoms to avoid treatment, thus making it harder to stop the virus spreading.
Currently it is contained within two provinces, but it is becoming harder to monitor the spread of the virus because of violence in the country's eastern region. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Treating Ebola in the DR Congo warzone
Between January and May there were more than 40 attacks on health facilities. However, outbreaks of violence have reduced in recent weeks.
The World Health Organisation said the risk of a global spread is low , but it was very likely cases would spread into neighbouring countries.
Most Ebola outbreaks are over quickly and affect small numbers of people. Only once before has an outbreak been still growing more than eight months after it began - that was the epidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 , which killed 11,310 people. What is Ebola? Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat. It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea and both internal and external bleeding. People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola. Patients tend to die from dehydration and multiple organ failure. Related Topics"

MSPs say climate change plans 'must be clearer',www.bbc.com,,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-48521785,"MSPs say climate change plans 'must be clearer' By Kevin Keane BBC Scotland's environment correspondent 5 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Clearer plans are needed on how climate change will be tackled, according to Holyrood's environment committee.
It says the Scottish government needs ""well-defined plans"" on achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions as part of its Climate Change Bill.
The Scottish government has committed to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, five years ahead of the UK as a whole.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has also declared a ""climate emergency"".
The environment committee carried out a review as the Climate Change Bill is about to enter its second stage at Holyrood.
It followed net-zero recommendations from the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - which, so far, only Scotland has acted on. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Scottish government's plans for net-zero emissions are five years ahead of the UK as a whole
The committee backed the Scottish government's commitment but said there still needed to be a raised level of ambition across all sectors. Scotland 'could be net-zero for greenhouse gas emissions'
Committee convener Gillian Martin said: ""The climate emergency is real and the stark fact is that we have to take urgent action in the short term in order to address global warming.
""Our committee welcomes the Scottish government's swift response to the CCC's report and the commitment that Scotland will play its part in tackling it.
""While the targets are challenging we need to focus on the opportunities and benefits of early action and we need to support those most impacted in making the transition.
""This is why we have called for a higher level of ambition across all sectors and for clearer plans to be put in place for every sector so we ensure that our generation can address the catastrophic harm being done to our natural environment."" 'Difficult decisions'
The Scottish government welcomed the committee's report and said it hopes to build on its support for the difficult decisions needed to meet the targets.
A spokesman said: ""There is a global climate emergency and the Scottish Government is acting accordingly.
""We acted immediately on the recent advice of our independent scientific advisors, the UK Committee on Climate Change, by lodging amendments to our Climate Change Bill that set a net-zero target for 2045.
""Our proposals are the most ambitious statutory targets anywhere in the world and would mean that Scotland's contribution to climate change will end, definitively, within a generation."""
China issues US travel warning over 'shootings' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48522488,"China issues US travel warning over 'shootings' 5 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images China has warned its citizens to ""fully assess the risks"" of travelling to the US given recent ""shootings"", as tensions between the superpowers rise.
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism warned of threats such as robbery and gun violence, state media said.
China's foreign ministry also said US law enforcement agencies have been ""harassing"" its citizens with interrogation.
It comes amid a power struggle between China and the US over trade.
The US reignited the trade war with tariff hikes in May, and broadened the conflict by blacklisting Chinese tech giant Huawei.
Both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods over the past year, disrupting trade and hurting the global economy. What exactly did China say?
""Recently there have been shootings, robberies and thefts happening frequently in the US. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism reminds Chinese tourists to fully assess the risks of going to the US for travel,"" said an anchor on Chinese broadcaster CCTV, according to a Reuters translation.
Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang told a press conference the warning was ""necessary in light of current circumstances"".
""For some time, US law enforcement agencies have been harassing Chinese citizens with interrogation upon entry or exit, and on-site interviews, among other forms,"" he said, according to China's foreign ministry website.
""Therefore the Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued the tourism reminder, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Embassy and consulates in the US decided to issue the safety reminder to raise safety awareness. That, I believe, is what a responsible government should do."" What's behind the US-China tensions?
The US accuses China of playing unfairly in trade for years and says tech company Huawei poses a risk to its national security.
The Chinese refute this and increasingly see US moves as an attempt to curb China's growing global influence.
Only recently, the world's two largest economies seemed to be nearing a deal. But while negotiations were still ongoing, the Trump administration accused China of reneging on its promises and more than doubled tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods ."
"Darwin shooting: Banned shotgun used in four killings, police say - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48522342,"Those reforms included restrictions on gun ownership and the banning of semi-automatic and automatic firearms. Image copyright EPA Image caption The city centre was on lockdown before police arrested the gunman
The weapon used on Tuesday was a prohibited 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. Northern Territory Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said it ""may have been stolen as far back as 1997"".
Such a weapon should have been surrendered or destroyed under the government crackdown on firearms at the time, experts have said.
How did the shootings unfold?
The alleged gunman, who had been on parole since January, was wearing an electronic tag at the time. Police said he had served four years of a six-year sentence.
Police said he travelled to several places across the city, including the Palms Hotel in the suburb of Woolner. There he allegedly opened fire in a number of rooms before fleeing.
One man was killed at the hotel, and another person was wounded, police said.
Another person was killed at Buff Club, another at Gardens Hill Crescent and another at Jolly Street. Police said the suspect also went to the Peter McAulay Centre - a police operations base. Image copyright EPA Image caption Police outside the Palms Hotel, one of the shooting locations
Witnesses said the suspect appeared to have been searching for a specific person called ""Alex"".
""We know he was looking for one individual,"" Commissioner Kershaw told reporters on Wednesday.
The suspect remains in police custody at the Royal Darwin Hospital and is expected to be charged with murder, he added. What has been the response?
Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said officials would conduct an urgent review of all prisoners on parole in the wake of the shootings. Image copyright EPA Image caption Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner (left) and Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw
""The Northern Territory Government will do everything in its power to determine what led to these tragic events and how this violence occurred,"" Mr Gunner said.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday the shootings were a ""terrible act of violence"".
Gun crime is rare in Australia, but it saw its worst mass shooting incident in more than 20 years last year when seven members of the same family died in a murder-suicide.
More recently, a man was killed and three others wounded in a shooting outside a popular nightclub in Melbourne in April. Related Topics"
