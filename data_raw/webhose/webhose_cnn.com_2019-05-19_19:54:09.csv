Paris police use tear gas against 'yellow vest' protesters,edition.cnn.com,Chandrika Narayan,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/world/paris-protests-tear-gas/index.html,"(CNN) Riot police unleashed tear gas at so-called yellow vest protesters in central Paris who marched Saturday for the 23rd consecutive weekend.
The French capital was the scene of chaos as police confronted protesters, who set off small fires. Video showed heavy black smoke in the air. Police also used water cannons to disperse the crowds. Officers counter protesters in Paris on April 20, 2019. The Paris prosecutor's office said 182 yellow vest protesters were placed in police custody. This is the first demonstration since the devastating fire this week at the Notre Dame cathedral. The Interior Ministry said some 27,900 people demonstrated across France, including 9,000 in Paris.

The protesters, who chanted, sang and played musical instruments as they marched, are rallying against economic injustice. Some say the hundreds of millions of dollars in donations to rebuild Notre Dame is a glaring sign of the inequalities in the country.

The government had warned protesters that police would use ""all means necessary"" to stop demonstrations from getting out of control. More than 60,000 police were deployed across France to deal with the protests, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. There were protests in other cities including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille and Lille, Agence France-Presse reported. Police also fired tear gas in Toulouse, where thousands were demonstrating, according to Reuters. So-called ""street medics"" carry an injured protester amid tear gas. The ""gilets jaunes,"" or yellow vest, protests began as a campaign against a gas tax hike, but have morphed into a broader rally against President Emmanuel Macron's government. Macron had been set to make a televised address to the nation Monday and announce measures to defuse the unrest. He spoke instead about the Notre Dame blaze. Yellow vest demonstrators light a fire as they gather in the Bercy neighborhood to protest for a 23rd week in Paris. Macron is now set to make his announcement Thursday, according to Reuters. In his New Year's address, Macron referred to the movement without naming it. He acknowledged anger against injustice but said hateful speech would not be tolerated, and called on people to respect each other. He also has pledged to increase the minimum wage and scrap new pension taxes to appease the protesters."
Mama K's Team 4: Netflix to launch all girl African superhero animation,edition.cnn.com,"Aisha Salaudeen, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/africa/netflix-first-african-animated-series-intl/index.html,"(CNN) As part of its growing acquisition of content from Africa, Netflix has announced its first original African animated series - Mama K's Team 4.
The series is produced by award-winning South Africa based studio, Triggerfish Animation, and London based kids and family entertainment specialist, CAKE. Mama K's Team 4 tells a story of four teenage girls living in a futuristic version of Lusaka, Zambia's capital city. The girls are recruited by an ex-secret agent to save the world. Designed by Cameroonian artist Malcolm Wope, the animation drew inspiration for the visuals from retro 90s hip hop girl groups, Netflix said in a statement announcing the deal. It was written by Zambian writer, Malenga Mulendema who was one of the eight winners of the 2015 Triggerfish Story Lab initiative, a talent hunt for African storytellers. Read More Mulendema says she grew up watching cartoons and wondered why none of the heroes looked like her. ""In creating a superhero show set in Lusaka, I hope to introduce the world to four strong African girls who save the day in their own fun and crazy way. Most importantly, I want to illustrate that anyone from anywhere can be a superhero,"" she said in the Netflix statement. Netflix in Africa The commission of Mama K's Team 4 is not an isolated move from the streaming platform. Since its 2016 debut in Africa, the company has been investing in original content from the continent. License to chill: Netflix launches in Africa, Twitter reacts Netflix also recently appointed Dorothy Ghettuba, an award-winning Kenyan film producer, as the Manager for International Originals, signaling an intention to commission more African content. Netflix first captured the attention of the African audience in 2015 when it paid $12 million for the worldwide distribution rights of 'Beast of no Nation,' starring award-winning actor, Idris Elba, as a war general leading a group of child soldiers in a West African country. Last September, Netflix purchased its first film, Lionheart, from Nollywood , the world's second-biggest movie industry in output terms. It also acquired the rights to add Nigerian film ""Chief Daddy"" to its platform last month. Netflix, which is available in all 54 African countries, recently announced it is nearing 150 million subscribers . It currently faces competition from South African cable TV provider, MultiChoice, which has a presence in 49 African countries through its Africa Magic channel. Africa to the world The platform's foray into commissioning films and animations on the continent has generated excitement and analysts believe it is good news for producers on the continent. Bankole Oluwafemi, who writes about tech in Africa, says Netflix acquiring content directly from African producers will give them the budget to market their films to the rest of the world. ""You have an industry that doesn't have a lot of money flushing in. But Netflix comes into the African market with a budget that is definitely needed,"" he told CNN."
Police Missing 5-year-old boy's home,edition.cnn.com,Deanna Hackney,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/missing-illinois-boy/index.html,"(CNN) Police looking for a 5-year-old Illinois boy reported missing from his home say they're putting special focus on the residence after determining it's likely he neither was abducted nor walked away.
The boy's parents reported Andrew ""AJ"" Freund missing Thursday morning, telling police they last saw him around 9 p.m. the evening before, at bedtime, according to a release by the Crystal Lake Police Department. The search has included 15 police agencies, drones, and rescue canine units. Sonar teams that searched Crystal Lake found nothing, and the canine teams ""only picked up Andrew's 'scent' within the residence indicating that Andrew had not walked away on foot,"" the police said. ""(T)here is no indication that would lead police to believe that an abduction had taken place,"" the department said in the release. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has ""been involved with the family"" since Andrew's birth, department spokesman Jassen Strokosch told CNN. Andrew ""was brought into care with us"" soon after he was born, when ""neglect was indicated on part of the mom,"" Strokosch said. From 2013 to 2015, the infant was ""in care with someone else,"" he said. Read More The department was called in twice in 2018 on allegations of neglect in March and of abuse and neglect in December, Strokosch said. The allegations were determined to be unfounded in both instances, he said. A younger sibling who had been in the home until this week is now living with another family, Strokosch said. JoAnn Cunningham, Andrew's mother, ""doesn't know what happened to AJ, and had nothing to do with the disappearance of AJ,"" her attorney, George Kililis, told CNN affiliate WLS . ""Ms. Cunningham is worried sick. She is devastated."" ""AJ, please come home,"" his father, Andrew Freund Sr., said to television cameras. ""We love you very much. You're not in any trouble. We're just worried to death. Please, please come home."" The parents ""are no longer cooperating with investigators,"" CNN affiliate ABC7 reported , citing unnamed sources. Crystal Lake police issued a press release with Andrew's description Thursday but didn't issue an AMBER alert ""due to law enforcement being unable to confirm an abduction occurred,"" the department said. Police said about 373 acres were searched on foot, and almost 500 acres were searched by drones. A sonar team searched under docks and piers along all of Crystal Lake and in the lake close to the main beach area, a release said. Crystal Lake is about 50 miles northwest of Chicago. Police ""are continuing to actively investigate,"" the department said Friday."
From 'total exoneration' to 'total bullsh**': Trump lingers on damning report - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,Kevin Liptak,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/donald-trump-mueller-report-anger/index.html,"Washington (CNN) By the time President Donald Trump had passed through the prime rib buffet at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to sit for dinner with family and a top aide, the damning picture Robert Mueller's report painted of his presidency had become clear.
Instead of the ""total exoneration"" Trump had proclaimed earlier, the report portrayed the President as deceitful and paranoid , encouraging his aides to withhold the truth and cross ethical lines in an attempt to thwart a probe into Russia's interference in US elections -- his ""Achilles heel,"" according to one forthcoming adviser. Perhaps more angering to a leader who detests weakness -- but doesn't necessarily mind an amoral reputation -- were the number of underlings shown ignoring his commands , privately scoffing at the ""crazy sh**"" he was requesting and working around him to avoid self-implication. Now, those close to him say Trump is newly furious at the people -- most of whom no longer work for him -- whose extensive interviews with the special counsel's office created the epic depiction of an unscrupulous and chaotic White House. And he's seeking assurances from those who remain that his orders are being treated like those of a president, and not like suggestions from an intemperate but misguided supervisor. Undermining, but protective: How Trump's staff's insolence may have saved him ""Because I never agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad),"" Trump tweeted on Friday morning as he waited out a rainstorm in Florida before proceeding to his golf course for a round with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. Read More Some current and former officials who accurately predicted that details in the Mueller report would be embarrassing for the White House are now questioning the legal strategy to fully cooperate with the Mueller investigation. One official who sat down with the special counsel noted that they did so at the behest of the former White House legal team, John Dowd and Ty Cobb, who provided a wealth of documents and encouraged senior officials to be interviewed. It was because of these interviews with people closest to the President that Mueller and his team were able to get a cinematic look at the deceit and trickery taking place in the West Wing. While these people are critical, the full cooperation was a strategy to make it hard for Mueller to push for an interview given all the information he was given. It was a strategy that worked, even if there is some political embarrassment. The President was aware ahead of its public release what was contained in the Mueller report. Attorney General Bill Barr told reporters Thursday that both the White House counsel and Trump's personal legal team were given an opportunity to read the redacted version in the previous days. Mounting anger Undermining, but protective: How Trump's staff's insolence may have saved him But Trump grew angry as he watched cable news coverage because, sources familiar with the matter said, a theme was emerging that vexed him: a portrait of a dishonest president who is regularly managed, restrained or ignored by his staff. It was a sharp turn away from his earlier statements, which welcomed the report's findings on collusion and falsely claimed total exoneration. Hours before his Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump insisted to a crowd on the tarmac in Florida the dark days of Mueller's special counsel investigation had ended. ""Game over, folks,"" he said over the sounds of a busy airport. ""Now, it's back to work."" It's hard to tell, however, what Trump intends to head back to. Mueller's probe and Trump's constant focus on it have been the backdrop for all but a few months of the presidency, often diminishing whatever policy efforts have been orchestrated by officials or Republican lawmakers. The report depicts a President who for two years has been largely consumed by the Russia investigation, intent on short-circuiting it but repeatedly stymied in his efforts by aides. A senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that dynamic was ""nothing surprising."" ""That the President makes absurd demands of his staff and administration officials -- who are alarmed by them and reluctant to follow them -- is not only unsurprising but has become the norm,"" the official said. Nevertheless, in the past Trump has resisted the idea that he is being controlled by those around him or that they are responsible for his successes. Sources familiar with how the West Wing operates said attempts to subvert the President's demands have not ceased now that the Mueller investigation is over. There have been instances in recent weeks where aides have slow walked or ignored Trump's directives, hoping he will forget he gave them. What is clear is many of those who avoided carrying out Trump's demands related to Mueller's probe -- often, it seemed, in a bid to protect themselves from criminal wrongdoing -- are no longer employed by the White House. Instead, the aides who now surround the President appear less willing to write him off and more likely to encourage him to follow his gut. Among those who have moved on: the White House counsel who refused Trump's demand to fire Mueller, the chief of staff and senior adviser who anxiously tried to retrieve a resignation letter from the attorney general, the staff secretary who declined Trump's order to gauge the loyalty of a Justice Department official, the attorney general who refused to un-recuse himself and the communications chief who seemed most expert in Trump's whims. Even Steve Bannon, once viewed as the ultimate advocate for following Trump's instincts, is depicted in the report as a constraining force. In one instance, when the President tried to claim Mueller had a conflict of interest because of a membership dispute at a Trump golf club, Bannon wrote it off as ""ridiculous and petty."" Trump and Bannon parted ways in the summer of 2017 and have not reconciled since. Instead, the most prominent aides who do remain are depicted in the report as the most dishonest. Press secretary Sarah Sanders, who was out the office when the report was released, is shown repeatedly misleading the press , a fact she attempted to downplay in morning television interviews on Friday. ""(Trump) has never asked me to break the law,"" she said on CBS. ""When the President wants to do something and make a decision, he does it. He's not somebody who sit around and ponders. I think you guys have seen that day in and day out. One minute you're running stories saying the staff can't control him and the next minute everyone's saying thank God the staff could control him. You don't get to have it both ways."" Increasingly untethered JUST WATCHED Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' 02:48 Among those who Trump dined with in Florida on Thursday was Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff who still fills the role in an acting capacity but who, according to officials, has done less than either of his two predecessors to restrain Trump in his hardline instincts. Indeed, since Mulvaney's tenure began at the start of the year, Trump has overseen the longest government shutdown in US history, a dramatic shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security, a sharp turn toward harsher policies on the border, a decision to ask a court to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act and a confusing dictate on North Korea sanctions that still has advisers scratching their heads. People familiar with Mulvaney's style say those outcomes aren't necessarily his doing, but rather the result of a President newly empowered to follow his impulses without the restrictions placed on him by previous aides. Sources say the President has also come to rely on his chief of staff less than he did during the reign of Reince Priebus or John Kelly, when he would often call his top aide nearly a dozen times a day. Mulvaney has told colleagues there are days he barely hears from the President. In his report, Mueller describes both of Mulvaney's predecessors -- Priebus and Kelly -- as working in at least some capacity to contain the damage of Trump's behavior. Priebus is shown making an urgent (and vaguely comic) effort to recover a resignation letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Trump had kept, believing it would amount to a ""shock collar"" on the Justice Department because it was not dated and aides feared Trump could employ it at his leisure. Kelly told Mueller that when Trump wanted to meet with friends who encouraged his impulses, such as former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski, he tried to push them to the private residence ""to create distance from the West Wing."" Trump soured on Priebus and Kelly long before he summarily terminated each of their tenures. So, too, had Trump grown wary of former White House counsel Don McGahn, who sat for more than 30 hours of testimony with Mueller's team. Trump grew irate again at his former aide late Thursday and into Friday. In the report, Trump is described as having several tense encounters with McGahn during his White House tenure, including episodes when McGahn was prepared to resign rather than carry out Trump's demands. McGahn described Trump asking him to do ""crazy sh**,"" according to Priebus. Trump, meanwhile, deemed McGahn a ""lying bastard"" whose habit of taking contemporaneous notes raised suspicion. In an anecdote relayed in the report, Trump and McGahn went back-and-forth over the note-taking, which Trump insisted good lawyers -- such as his onetime counsel Roy Cohn -- never did. Trump hadn't backed off that view by Friday morning, when he made clear on Twitter his frustrations at the report. ""Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed,"" the President wrote. "
Tesla to shakeup its board of directors - CNN,www.cnn.com,Jackie Wattles,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/investing/tesla-board-steve-jurvetson/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Tesla revealed Friday that four directors will leave the company ‚Äî shrinking the size of its board to seven eventually.
The electric-car maker said that it wants to ""streamline"" corporate oversight because its board has grown by four members over the past five years. That has led to ""the duplication of certain areas of experience or expertise"" among its directors, the company said in a filing. Now Tesla is shaking things up to allow the board to ""operate more nimbly and efficiently."" Two directors have agreed not to stand for reelection at Tesla's annual meeting this year, and two more will leave in 2020 or 2021. The rules on CEO tweets weren't made for Elon Musk ""Such agreements did not result from any disagreement between Tesla and any of such directors,"" the company said. Cautious Tesla investors have also been pleading for with the company to tighten oversight of CEO Elon Musk. The disclosure comes just four months after Tesla added two new board members as part of a settlement deal that Musk and Tesla reached with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency wanted Tesla to put stricter checks on Musk's power after accusing him of misleading investors with his tweets about taking Tesla private. But their dispute is far from over : The SEC has since accused Musk of flouting other settlement terms and is looking to hold him in contempt. Read More Tesla's Friday filings say the outgoing board members include Linda Johnson Rice, the chairman and CEO of Johnson Publishing, who joined the board in 2017. The others ‚Äî Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and Steve Jurvetson ‚Äî have been with the company over nine years. Jurvetson is considered a close ally to Musk. The venture capitalist was one of Tesla's earliest investors, and he's a director at Musk's rocket company, SpaceX. Jurvetson, who is scheduled to depart in 2020, returned to his role at Tesla this month after taking a year-long leave of absence that he began amid reports of inappropriate workplace behavior and harassment. Jurvetson has denied the allegations. A new filing states that the Tesla board is confident that with three remaining independent members, it is ""poised to lead Tesla with fresh perspectives balanced by deep historical knowledge of our company, while maintaining a wealth of diverse experience and expertise."" 'Put your reasonableness pants on': Judge gives Musk and SEC two weeks to settle dispute over tweets Critics have said that some of Tesla's ""independent board members"" aren't so independent. Oracle's Larry Ellison, for example, reportedly had close ties to Musk before joining the board. He was one of the members that Tesla brought on to comply with the SEC settlement. Other independent directors include 21st Century Fox's James Murdoch and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, head of global human resources at Walgreens. Wilson-Thompson was the other independent director elected after the SEC settlement. Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, also has a seat on the board. If shareholders approve a plan to restructure the remaining board seats, director terms will be reduced to two years instead of three. "

A drive down Lombard Street in San Francsico may come with a fee soon | CNN Travel,www.cnn.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/lombard-street-fee-san-francisco/index.html,"Visiting San Francisco's windy Lombard Street may come at a price Lilit Marcus, CNN ‚Ä¢ Updated 22nd April 2019 Facebook Twitter Email California officials say this famous quirky street is too crowded with tourists, and they may enact a toll to keep it under control. (CNN) ‚Äî Driving down famously twisty Lombard Street in San Francisco may come with a fee soon. On April 16, San Francisco's Board of Supervisors unanimously OK'd state legislation that requires people who want to drive down the street -- known for its 27-degree slant and sharp curves -- will have to make a reservation and pay a fee. The bill has language noting that the street's immense popularity has become an issue for local residents. Related content San Francisco: Insider Travel Guide ""Due to over two million annual visitors, and daily queuing for up to 10 hours, traffic congestion on and around the 1000 block of Lombard Street in the City and County of San Francisco (known as the ""Crooked Street"") has deteriorated the safety and quality of life for residents of the Crooked Street and surrounding community,"" reads Assembly Bill 1605 , which was originally authored in February. ""It is the intent of the Legislature to authorize the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco to locally approve a reservation and pricing pilot program for vehicles to use the Crooked Street, and to designate an entity to administer the Crooked Street reservation and pricing pilot program to manage traffic congestion."" The plan is to impose a $5 per car fee, with the rate going up to $10 on weekends and holidays. Visitors would need to register for a time and date in advance. There are eight hairpin turns along the single block of Lombard Street. Getty/Stacy Gold Lombard Street is in the Russian Hill neighborhood of San Francisco. Though the street itself is quite long, the famous portion is the block between Hyde and Leavenworth streets. Because of the difficulty of driving it, the speed limit is 5 miles per hour. A neighborhood study conducted in early 2019 presented some options for reducing congestion on the crooked street and included feedback from community members. One potential bit of good news is that the pricing system will not apply to pedestrians who want to walk down Lombard Street -- if they can manage it. Other options not on the table for managing the street are privatizing the street, straightening it out (heaven forbid!) and closing it off completely. When reached for comment, San Francisco Tourism, the city's official travel organization, told CNN Travel : ""We are always interested in things that improve the visitor experience and are looking forward to learning more."" Related content The Beat Generation lives on in San Francisco While some tourists may be put out at the idea of paying simply to drive a block, the Lombard Street proposal has plenty of similar examples around the world. In Venice, Italy, the latest fight against overtourism has resulted in an $11 fee for day trippers -- people who don't spend the night in hotels, thus reducing tourism revenue. The local government plans to use the money to offset some of the damage incurred by tourism, including trash pickup. Two of the world's most iconic sites, Machu Picchu in Peru and the Taj Mahal in India, have also upped ticket prices while simultaneously introducing ""flood control"" measures to space out visitors throughout the day."

Premier League: Manchester City return to top of Premier League after narrow win over Tottenham,rss.cnn.com,"Matias Grez, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/puuKA0wDq04/index.html,"Story highlights Man City 1-0 Spurs City return to top of Premier League (CNN) Pep Guardiola must have been sick of the sight of Mauricio Pochettino.
This was the third time in the last 11 days that Manchester City and Tottenham have gone toe to toe, with the north London side coming out on top on the previous two occasions. True, City may have won 4-3 in Wednesday's pulsating Champions League clash but it wasn't enough to stop Spurs advancing to the semifinals on away goals. In the finale of the City-Spurs trilogy, Guardiola's side went at least some way to exorcising the demons of Wednesday's nightmare, which saw Raheem Sterling have a last-minute goal -- a tie winning goal -- disallowed by VAR. READ: Tottenham end Man City's quadruple hopes after mesmerizing clash Read More READ: Where does Man City vs. Spurs rank among Champions League classics? Though that result is likely to haunt City for quite some time, they can at least take comfort in Saturday's crucial, hard-fought 1-0 victory over Tottenham which saw them return to the top of the Premier League. Much was made about City's mentality in the build up to this game and how the team would react to Wednesday's soul-crushing result which seemed to drain the life out of the Etihad. It's the first Premier League goal Phil Foden has scored for City. In his pre-match press conference, Guardiola pointed out that his superstars were still only human but implored them to use that disappointment to fire them to victory as they chase a consecutive Premier League crown in a nail-biting title race. But the players -- with the fans roaring them on from the first whistle -- showed no signs of a Champions League hangover and took the lead inside five minutes. Bernardo Silva's deft ball into the box found Sergio Aguero, who showed impressive awareness and poise to cushion his header for Phil Foden to nod into an empty net. It was the teenager's first league goal for the club, becoming the first player born in the 2000s to score for City in the Premier League and it would prove to be the crucial winner. On a sour note, Kevin De Bruyne -- so impressive in City's recent quadruple-chasing run of games -- was the first casualty of the grueling set of fixtures as he limped off after half an hour with yet another injury. Although Spurs mustered two good first-half chances -- the first saved by Ederson and the second blocked wonderfully by Aymeric Laporte -- they faded in the second, as both sides had appeals fr a penalty turned down. All in all, it was an impressive display of mental strength from City to navigate the first of two difficult Premier League clashes, the second coming in Wednesday's derby against local rivals Manchester United. With Liverpool leading by two points prior to kick off having played a game more, victory ensures City lead the title race again -- for now at least. Jurgen Klopp's side face relegation-threatened Cardiff City on Sunday and could once again return to the top of the Premier League with a win."

Andrew ""was brought into care with us"" soon after he was born, when ""neglect was indicated on part of the mom,"" Strokosch said. From 2013 to 2015, the infant was ""in care with someone else,"" he said. Read More The department was called in twice in 2018 on allegations of neglect in March and of abuse and neglect in December, Strokosch said. The allegations were determined to be unfounded in both instances, he said. A younger sibling who had been in the home until this week is now living with another family, Strokosch said. JoAnn Cunningham, Andrew's mother, ""doesn't know what happened to AJ, and had nothing to do with the disappearance of AJ,"" her attorney, George Kililis, told CNN affiliate WLS . ""Ms. Cunningham is worried sick. She is devastated."" ""AJ, please come home,"" his father, Andrew Freund Sr., said to television cameras. ""We love you very much. You're not in any trouble. We're just worried to death. Please, please come home."" The parents ""are no longer cooperating with investigators,"" CNN affiliate ABC7 reported , citing unnamed sources. Crystal Lake police issued a press release with Andrew's description Thursday but didn't issue an AMBER alert ""due to law enforcement being unable to confirm an abduction occurred,"" the department said. Police said about 373 acres were searched on foot, and almost 500 acres were searched by drones. A sonar team searched under docks and piers along all of Crystal Lake and in the lake close to the main beach area, a release said. Crystal Lake is about 50 miles northwest of Chicago. Police ""are continuing to actively investigate,"" the department said Friday."
Washington state senator slammed for saying nurses 'play cards' for 'considerable amount of the day' - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/washington-state-senator-nurse-remarks/index.html,"(CNN) A Washington state senator has drawn the ire of nurses after remarks she made suggesting that nurses in smaller hospitals ""probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day.""
The Washington State Senate considered a bill Tuesday, SHB 1155, that would provide nurses with uninterrupted meal and rest periods. ""By putting these types of mandates on a critical access hospital that literally serves a handful of individuals, I would submit to you those nurses probably do get breaks. They probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day,"" Washington state Senator Maureen Walsh said on Tuesday during a debate on the Washington state Senate floor. Walsh, a Republican, was arguing in support of an amendment that would exempt critical access hospitals, in rural areas, and hospitals with less than 25 beds from the bill. ""I understand helping with employees and making sure that we have rest breaks and things like that. But I also understand that we need to care for patients first and foremost,"" Walsh said. Read More The Washington State Nurses Association called Walsh's remarks ""demeaning"" and said there is ""zero logic"" in covering nurses in some hospitals, ""while leaving others without any protections."" ""No, Senator, nurses are not sitting around playing cards. They are taking care of your neighbors, your family, your community,"" Mathew Keller, WSNA's director of nursing practice and health policy, said in a post on the union's website. Keller also argued that such an amendment would make it harder to recruit nurses to rural facilities. Walsh had also introduced an amendment to the bill that would prohibit nurses from working more than eight hours. ""Well, if we have an issue with nurses getting tired, let's quit letting them do 12-hour shifts, let's let them do 8-hour shifts. Like most standard shifts are,"" Walsh said on Tuesday. ""Twelve hours, I know they want it, but then they come back and they start talking out of both sides of the mouth and telling us how tired they are."" The Democratic-controlled Senate passed SHB 1155 on Tuesday, 30-18, with the two amendments included. Walsh voted against the bill. WSNA is in support of the full measure, but against the two amendments, which the union has vowed to try and remove. Walsh responded to the backlash, asserting that she has the ""greatest respect for nurses"" and that her mother was a registered nurse for many years. ""The comment made about the ability to play cards was referring to the staff at the very rural and small critical access hospitals who may only serve a handful of patients and the staffing mandates are unnecessary,"" Walsh said in a lengthy statement provided to CNN affiliate KEPR TV . Walsh continued: ""The fact is 61% of our critical access hospitals are in the red and the mandated breaks and lunch hours are not an issue in these facilities across the state. These are smaller, rural hospitals with much fewer patients than our urban hospitals and the bill is not necessary for them in meeting the needs of their patients or the hospital's budget."" Walsh's claim about 61% of critical access hospitals being ""in the red"" was challenged Saturday by the Washington State Nurses Association, citing data by the Washington Department of Health that showed a majority of the 40 critical access hospitals in the state reported net incomes in the millions or more over a four-year period ending in 2017, and approximately 70% operating at a surplus in any given year. ""Most Washington critical access hospitals are operating with a surplus and can afford to bring on one extra nurse or technician,"" said Heather Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Nurses Association told CNN. The bill originally passed the House on March 6 before being approved by the Senate on Tuesday. It now heads back to the House to approve the bill's changes before going to the governor's desk for his signature. CNN reached out to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's office to see if the governor intends to sign the bill. ""We generally don't make determinations on bill action until after the final bill is delivered to our office,"" Jaime Smith, a spokeswoman for Inslee's office, told CNN in an email. Inslee told reporters on Friday that he's been briefed on the bill and that the issue of limiting nurses' shifts to eight hours per day ""gets resolved."" ""We hope that a good bill gets to my desk,"" Inslee said at a bill signing at the state capitol. ""I'm very empathetic with the nurses on unduly burdening them so they can't be proficient in their work and so I just hope this gets resolved in a way that we have serious legislation."""
Mama K's Team 4: Netflix to launch all girl African superhero animation - CNN,us.cnn.com,"Aisha Salaudeen, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/africa/netflix-first-african-animated-series-intl/index.html,"(CNN) As part of its growing acquisition of content from Africa, Netflix has announced its first original African animated series - Mama K's Team 4.
The series is produced by award-winning South Africa based studio, Triggerfish Animation, and London based kids and family entertainment specialist, CAKE. Mama K's Team 4 tells a story of four teenage girls living in a futuristic version of Lusaka, Zambia's capital city. The girls are recruited by an ex-secret agent to save the world. Designed by Cameroonian artist Malcolm Wope, the animation drew inspiration for the visuals from retro 90s hip hop girl groups, Netflix said in a statement announcing the deal. It was written by Zambian writer, Malenga Mulendema who was one of the eight winners of the 2015 Triggerfish Story Lab initiative, a talent hunt for African storytellers. Read More Mulendema says she grew up watching cartoons and wondered why none of the heroes looked like her. ""In creating a superhero show set in Lusaka, I hope to introduce the world to four strong African girls who save the day in their own fun and crazy way. Most importantly, I want to illustrate that anyone from anywhere can be a superhero,"" she said in the Netflix statement. Netflix in Africa The commission of Mama K's Team 4 is not an isolated move from the streaming platform. Since its 2016 debut in Africa, the company has been investing in original content from the continent. License to chill: Netflix launches in Africa, Twitter reacts Netflix also recently appointed Dorothy Ghettuba, an award-winning Kenyan film producer, as the Manager for International Originals, signaling an intention to commission more African content. Netflix first captured the attention of the African audience in 2015 when it paid $12 million for the worldwide distribution rights of 'Beast of no Nation,' starring award-winning actor, Idris Elba, as a war general leading a group of child soldiers in a West African country. Last September, Netflix purchased its first film, Lionheart, from Nollywood , the world's second-biggest movie industry in output terms. It also acquired the rights to add Nigerian film ""Chief Daddy"" to its platform last month. Netflix, which is available in all 54 African countries, recently announced it is nearing 150 million subscribers . It currently faces competition from South African cable TV provider, MultiChoice, which has a presence in 49 African countries through its Africa Magic channel. Africa to the world The platform's foray into commissioning films and animations on the continent has generated excitement and analysts believe it is good news for producers on the continent. Bankole Oluwafemi, who writes about tech in Africa, says Netflix acquiring content directly from African producers will give them the budget to market their films to the rest of the world. ""You have an industry that doesn't have a lot of money flushing in. But Netflix comes into the African market with a budget that is definitely needed,"" he told CNN."

But this one traveled a long, long way to do so -- from another solar system . Researchers were able to determine this because of its velocity. It was moving so fast that it was able to make it to our solar system after probably traveling tens of thousands of years. They don't know how old it is, but it's probably ancient and contains a combination of a time capsule and message in a bottle with regards to information about its origin. ""Most importantly, there is a possibility that life could be transferred between stars,"" researcher Abraham Loeb of Harvard University said.

Love and loss during the Crusades DNA from 13th-century remains buried in a pit in Lebanon is shedding light on the lives of Crusader soldiers and how they mixed with the local population. Crusader burials are rare, and these weren't in the best condition. The soldiers bore the marks of the blunt force that killed them. Then they were dumped in a pit and burned and lay in warm and humid conditions for hundreds of years. But thanks to some intrepid scientists, DNA was extracted from their temporal bones. And it contains a fascinating story that had been lost to the historical record. Skeleton DNA reveals surprising backgrounds of Crusader soldiers The researchers weren't expecting the diverse origins of the men. Some were from Spain and Sardinia, four were locals who were probably recruited to fight, and two carried mixed genetics indicating that they were the result of relations between Crusaders and locals. Some of the soldiers who traveled from western Europe to fight stayed in the newly established Christian states that popped up along the Eastern Mediterranean coast, according to a study. They settled down and had families with locals. As the wars raged on, they also died together in battle. And then, they were eventually cast out, leaving no genetic mark on the local population. The year of the woman (in space) NASA astronaut Christina Koch was scheduled to take part in the first all-female spacewalk alongside Anne McClain on March 29, but it was scrapped due to spacesuit availability. Instead, Koch conducted her spacewalk alongside Nick Hague. Christina Koch aims for record for longest spaceflight by a woman Now, she has her eye on a different record: the longest single spaceflight by a woman . Koch arrived on the International Space Station on March 14 for her first mission. She will remain on the station until February 2020, according to NASA's new schedule. Normally, astronauts stay on the station for six months. Koch's mission will surpass that of Peggy Whitson, who spent 288 consecutive days in space, and end up just shy of the longest single spaceflight by a NASA astronaut: 340 days, set by Scott Kelly. The next hot trend: moon water Meteorites don't just stir up dust when they crash into the moon. They also send plumes of water shooting into space . It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ""meteor shower."" Micro-meteorites collide with the moon at high velocity and send shock waves reverberating through the lunar surface. They need to penetrate only a few inches to stir up deposits of water, and the high energy of the collision converts the molecules into water vapor. The plumes spurt out into space. Most of the molecules dissipate into the very thin atmosphere around the moon, while some settle back into the ground. This is exciting news for missions that may rely on the natural resources of the moon, which is proving to be much more than a quiet satellite. Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state It all started with the Big Bang. When the universe formed during the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, the chemical reactions of the aftermath formed the first molecules. Those molecules were crucial in helping form everything we know, but they're also absent. And although HeH+, the helium hydride ion, has been proposed for years as that first molecule, scientists couldn't find any evidence of its existence in space -- until now. After the Big Bang, HeH+ formed in a molecular bond when helium atoms and protons combined. Later, these would break apart into hydrogen molecules and helium atoms. Both elements are the two most abundant throughout the universe, with hydrogen first and helium second. A high-resolution spectrometer called GREAT on board a telescope called SOFIA detected the molecule in the planetary nebula NGC 7027, finally bring an end to a decades-long search. The biggest bad after the dinosaurs Millions of years ago, animals were on a much bigger scale -- and some of them were downright terrifying. For example, Simbakubwa kutokaafrika, which is Swahili for ""big lion coming from Africa."" Simba brings to mind ""The Lion King,"" but the real creature was more like your worst nightmare. This giant carnivore ruled at the top of the food chain after the dinosaurs went extinct. Twenty-three million years ago, the giant carnivore larger than any modern-day lion or polar bear stalked sub-Saharan Africa, according to the fossils of a previously undiscovered species that spent decades in a museum drawer. The skull is comparable to that of a rhinoceros, and given its size and giant sharp teeth, the carnivore was at the head of its food chain. Researchers estimate that it weighed 1.6 tons and could prey on large herbivores akin to today's elephant and hippopotamus. Timon and Pumbaa would have been food, not friends, to this giant predator. Simbakubwa was part of the hyaenodonts, an extinct group of mammalian carnivores that lived in Africa. And Simbakubwa is the oldest of this group, making it one of the largest carnivorous mammals ever to live on land. After the extinction of dinosaurs, they enjoyed a 45 million-year reign as the key predators. But tectonic plates shifted, introducing animals from other landmasses like the relatives of dogs, cats and hyenas. And eventually, they went extinct. Hopefully, ""Hyaenodont Park"" never becomes a thing. TESS finds its first Earth-size planet TESS the planet-hunting satellite is living up to its name. It just spied an Earth-sized exoplanet , as well as a warm mini-Neptune, in a star system 53 light-years away from us. The Earth-size planet, dubbed HD 21749c, completes an orbit of its host star every eight days. Its planetary sibling, HD 21749b, is about 23 times Earth's mass and has a radius about 2.7 times that of Earth. This puts the exoplanet in the category of a sub-Neptune or mini-Neptune. TESS has been operating for only about a year and has already made some exciting discoveries. So this is just the beginning for Kepler's successor. Happy birthday, Hubble! Twenty-nine years ago, the Hubble Space Telescope launched, and it has been capturing stunning views of the Milky Way galaxy ever since. To celebrate, Hubble's team shared a beautiful new look at the Southern Crab Nebula in all of its tentacled glory. The Southern Crab Nebula is several thousand light-years away in the Centaurus constellation. The hourglass-shaped nebula is due to an aging red giant star and a white dwarf. Materials that they ejected are pulled around the aging star and the dead star by gravity, creating its unique shape. In addition to taking us through the wonders of space, Hubble has made discoveries that affect astronomy and astrophysics. ""Among Hubble's landmark accomplishments include making the deepest views ever taken of the evolving universe, finding planet-forming disks around nearby stars, chemically probing the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars, identifying the first supermassive black hole in the heart of a neighboring galaxy, and providing evidence of an accelerating universe, propelled perhaps by some unknown source of energy in the fabric of space,"" the Space Telescope Science Institute said in a news release."
Maureen Walsh: Washington state senator slammed for saying nurses 'play cards' for 'considerable amount of the day' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/washington-state-senator-nurse-remarks/index.html,"(CNN) A Washington state senator has drawn the ire of nurses after remarks she made suggesting that nurses in smaller hospitals ""probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day.""
The Washington State Senate considered a bill Tuesday, SHB 1155, that would provide nurses with uninterrupted meal and rest periods. ""By putting these types of mandates on a critical access hospital that literally serves a handful of individuals, I would submit to you those nurses probably do get breaks. They probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day,"" Washington state Senator Maureen Walsh said on Tuesday during a debate on the Washington state Senate floor. Walsh, a Republican, was arguing in support of an amendment that would exempt critical access hospitals, in rural areas, and hospitals with less than 25 beds from the bill. ""I understand helping with employees and making sure that we have rest breaks and things like that. But I also understand that we need to care for patients first and foremost,"" Walsh said. Read More The Washington State Nurses Association called Walsh's remarks ""demeaning"" and said there is ""zero logic"" in covering nurses in some hospitals, ""while leaving others without any protections."" ""No, Senator, nurses are not sitting around playing cards. They are taking care of your neighbors, your family, your community,"" Mathew Keller, WSNA's director of nursing practice and health policy, said in a post on the union's website. Keller also argued that such an amendment would make it harder to recruit nurses to rural facilities. Walsh had also introduced an amendment to the bill that would prohibit nurses from working more than eight hours. ""Well, if we have an issue with nurses getting tired, let's quit letting them do 12-hour shifts, let's let them do 8-hour shifts. Like most standard shifts are,"" Walsh said on Tuesday. ""Twelve hours, I know they want it, but then they come back and they start talking out of both sides of the mouth and telling us how tired they are."" The Democratic-controlled Senate passed SHB 1155 on Tuesday, 30-18, with the two amendments included. Walsh voted against the bill. WSNA is in support of the full measure, but against the two amendments, which the union has vowed to try and remove. Walsh responded to the backlash, asserting that she has the ""greatest respect for nurses"" and that her mother was a registered nurse for many years. ""The comment made about the ability to play cards was referring to the staff at the very rural and small critical access hospitals who may only serve a handful of patients and the staffing mandates are unnecessary,"" Walsh said in a lengthy statement provided to CNN affiliate KEPR TV . Walsh continued: ""The fact is 61% of our critical access hospitals are in the red and the mandated breaks and lunch hours are not an issue in these facilities across the state. These are smaller, rural hospitals with much fewer patients than our urban hospitals and the bill is not necessary for them in meeting the needs of their patients or the hospital's budget."" Walsh's claim about 61% of critical access hospitals being ""in the red"" was challenged Saturday by the Washington State Nurses Association, citing data by the Washington Department of Health that showed a majority of the 40 critical access hospitals in the state reported net incomes in the millions or more over a four-year period ending in 2017, and approximately 70% operating at a surplus in any given year. ""Most Washington critical access hospitals are operating with a surplus and can afford to bring on one extra nurse or technician,"" said Heather Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Nurses Association told CNN. The bill originally passed the House on March 6 before being approved by the Senate on Tuesday. It now heads back to the House to approve the bill's changes before going to the governor's desk for his signature. CNN reached out to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's office to see if the governor intends to sign the bill. ""We generally don't make determinations on bill action until after the final bill is delivered to our office,"" Jaime Smith, a spokeswoman for Inslee's office, told CNN in an email. Inslee told reporters on Friday that he's been briefed on the bill and that the issue of limiting nurses' shifts to eight hours per day ""gets resolved."" ""We hope that a good bill gets to my desk,"" Inslee said at a bill signing at the state capitol. ""I'm very empathetic with the nurses on unduly burdening them so they can't be proficient in their work and so I just hope this gets resolved in a way that we have serious legislation."""

The woman and a 7-year-old male Sumatran tiger named Sanjiv were both in the tiger habitat shortly after the zoo opened when the tiger ""essentially tackled our keeper,"" Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said at an afternoon press conference. The zookeeper suffered ""lacerations and punctures to the back of the head, neck, back and one arm,"" Wiley told reporters. The zookeeper was transported to a local hospital where she received treatment. A spokeswoman for the City of Topeka previously told CNN that woman was ""awake and alert"" at the time she was taken to the hospital. She's currently in stable condition, Wiley said. The zookeeper is the facility's primary tiger keeper, Wiley said, and has been working in that space for years. Read More ""There really isn't a circumstance where they should have been in the same space, so there was some sort of error that occurred here,"" he said. He later clarified that it's part of the daily process for the zookeeper to be in the tiger habitat to clean and maintain it, but the tiger should not have been in the space at that time. Wiley said the zoo is not considering euthanizing the tiger. Sumatran tigers are a ""critically rare"" and ""endangered"" species, Wiley said. Sanjiv recently fathered four cubs. ""While this incident is very unfortunate,"" Wiley said, ""he did what a wild animal, what a wild tiger does."" The director credited his staff with a speedy and effective response that got the incident under control within 10 minutes. A notification was put out to all zoo staff after the attack. Elephant staff members were a short distance away and were able to lure the tiger back into its enclosure, where he was secured. ""The tiger was never out of its space,"" Wiley said. Several guests did witness the attack, Wiley said. The zoo was briefly closed, but has subsequently reopened. Wiley added, ""We have absolutely no concerns about the safety of our guests here."""

J Balvin makes history as Lollapalooza's first Latino headliner - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Kendall Trammell,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/entertainment/j-balvin-lollapalooza-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) J Balvin headlining Lollapalooza is just another example that the world of music festivals is evolving.
The ""Mi Gente"" singer will be one of the eight artists headlining the music festival August 1-4 at Chicago's Grant Park. More importantly, he'll be the first Latino headliner in Lollapalooza's 28-year history. Latino artists have performed at the festival before but never as a headliner, which is what makes this year's lineup different from the rest. Like Beyonc√© was for Coachella , J Balvin's performance will show that Lolla finally recognizes there's a large audience in the United States not only for reggaeton but for Spanish-language music. Balvin is listed above other big stars -- Lil Wayne, Kacey Musgraves and Janelle Monae , to name a few. And some of his achievements over the past year support why the ""Ginza"" and ""Safari"" singer deserves his time to shine at Lollapalooza. Read More His music transcends languages Hailing from Colombia, Balvin received eight Billboard nominations this year, including top Latin artist, top Latin song, and top Latin album as well as several other categories for his work with Cardi B on ""I Like It."" The rapper, born Jose Alvaro Osorio Balvin, was one of the most-streamed artists on Spotify last year . He also has collaborated with other American music icons, including Justin Bieber and Beyonc√©. And even then, you'll rarely (if ever) see Balvin perform in English. ""Just because you are Latino does not mean you can't be global,"" Balvin told CNN last year. That's what makes him stand out from other artists like Luis Fonsi and Bad Bunny. And while some of his audience in the United States may not speak Spanish fluently, that's not stopping him from performing the way he wants to be known. Lollapalooza isn't his first big music gig Balvin has already played Coachella twice. He first performed at the California festival last year as a guest during Beyonc√©'s headlining set , where he embraced his Latin pop flair while Queen Bey introduced HBCU culture to the Coachella crowd. This year, the 37-year-old graced the stage on his own, celebrating the beauty and vibrancy of reggaeton music. Last fall, Balvin kicked off his 27-day US tour, which included energetic dancers, several celebrity cameos and even dinosaurs . ""I don't just make music for people who like reggaeton,"" Balvin told Rolling Stone . ""I make music for everybody. I'm down to change people's minds, I'm down to just refresh the world."" Music is just one factor for mainstream success Even with No. 1 music hits, an artist's success is also measured by their influence on consumers' commercial power. With an Instagram following of more than 28 million, 6.1 million Twitter followers and more than 20 million YouTube subscribers , Balvin has the eyes and ears of many. According to Nielsen , millennial Latinx consumers over-index in areas, such as listening to streaming music and following artists on social media when compared to non-Hispanics in the United States. Balvin reaches audiences that brands are vying to engage with. His recent partnership with Guess is an example of that. Balvin launched a seven-piece capsule of concert merchandise with Gues s last year, named after his top-charting album ""Vibras,"" putting his mark on the fashion world. Fans could shop Balvin's clothing line at select Guess stores near the concert locations days leading up to each performance. ""My partnership with Guess, a brand that has strong roots in the Latin community, not only aligns with my personal brand, but with my community and fan base as well,"" Balvin said in a statement . ""I am so excited to launch an exclusive collection of concert merch on tour and officially bring the vibe of our music to fashion."""

Why the Mueller report probably isn't a game changer for voters - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,Analysis by Harry Enten,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/poll-of-the-week-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is from the television show WKRP in Cincinnati .
Poll of the week: A new Fox News poll finds President Donald Trump with a 45% approval rating and a 51% disapproval rating among voters. Last month, the same pollster gave him a 46% approval rating and 51% disapproval rating among voters. Fox News' findings are in-line with the average poll , which showed the President's ratings stayed steady after Attorney General William Barr released his summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. What's the point: Mueller's nearly two-year long investigation has given the news industry more than a few headlines. People were arrested, charged with crimes and sentenced to jail. Through it all, Trump's approval rating has almost always stayed somewhere between 40% and 45% among voters. Does the release of the full redacted version of Mueller's report on Thursday change that? It's certainly plausible, but you'd be right to express skepticism. Read More Back in March, before Barr's memo was published, just 7% of voters said in a Fox News poll that something in the Mueller report could have a ""strong"" chance of changing their minds about Trump. The lack of a shift in public opinion about Trump after Barr's memo was released is very much in-line with that. Voters said the Mueller report wouldn't change their minds about Trump because the Russia investigation is simply put not a top issue for voters. In a CNN poll last month , zero respondents (0%) said it was their top issue for their 2020 vote when they were allowed to list any possible issue. This follows the 2018 midterm elections, in which fewer voters said the Russian investigation was an important issue to their vote than any of the issues listed in CNN's poll. The Mueller report also seems unlikely to upend the Democratic race for president. This month, Monmouth University asked likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa to state their top one or two issues in determining their vote for the Democratic nomination. Voters could list anything they wanted. Again, zero respondents (0%) said the Russia investigation was a top issue for them. Voters seem most likely to rely on their partisan priors when reading the Mueller report. Currently, Trump sports a -10 point net approval rating (approval-disapproval) among voters in the average poll . That is, voters are 10 points more likely to take the anti-Trump position when it comes to whether they approve of the job he is doing as president. Now look at how voters responded in a CNN poll when asked about the Barr memo of the Mueller report, in regards to Trump and his campaign. A majority, 55%, said that ""the President and his campaign have not been exonerated, but collusion could not be proven."" This was, of course, pretty close to what the Barr memo actually stated . Despite what was written in the memo, 45% agreed with the statement that ""the President and his campaign have been exonerated of any collusion with Russia."" This statement was far closer to Trump's own spin of the memo. In other words, Trump's base seems pretty locked in, but so too does his opposition. Just like when it comes to his overall approval rating, voters were 10 points more likely to take the anti-Trump position on the Mueller report. Obviously, this time could be different. Trump received a lot of bad press on Thursday because of the redacted Mueller report. Just keep in mind that the vast majority of voters have already stated on the record that they plan to vote a certain way (either for or against Trump), regardless of what the report's findings. "

How reviving cells in a pig's brain could change medicine (opinion),edition.cnn.com,Ford Vox,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/opinions/pig-brain-experiment-medicine-vox/index.html,"Ford Vox is a physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine.

(CNN) It's 2019, and scientists can now r evive brain cells in a decapitated pig hours after death. While the pig brains did not come close to regaining consciousness, scientists noted metabolic activity in some cells, raising a host of ethical, religious and philosophical questions about life and death.
Ford Vox It's easy to overlook our underlying ignorance about how the brain produces consciousness with the blockbuster research published this week in the journal Nature . Still, this study could lead us to that seminal moment of the human brain understanding itself. Most importantly, this work could supercharge research into better repairing our most complex organ. While the Yale researchers who authored the publication made a huge leap forward in medical neuroscience, the work doesn't move us much closer towards the first brain transplant. Suspending a conscious brain in a vat of solution also remains the stuff of science fiction for now. Regardless, the experiment marks an important scientific achievement. The researchers retrieved pig heads severed at the neck from a food processing facility, surgically removed the brains and connected some of the arteries to a device they dubbed BrainEx, a contraption cobbled together from commercially available parts made by 15 different companies. One researcher told me the lab, filled with the wily array of tubing, pumps, analyzers, reservoirs and dialysis membranes ""looks like the junk closet in an oft-repaired spaceship."" BrainEx then pumped the brain with the artificial blood product Hemopure , a processed hemoglobin manufactured from cow's blood, which is key to the project's success. Given that Hemopure is used during transplants to keep organs alive longer, it makes sense that it was used to revive the cells in brains that had been without blood and at room temperature for four hours. Read More Researchers restore some function to brains of dead pigs, raising potential for human applications The fact that some people managed to survive hypothermia so severe that their hearts stopped beating probably gave researchers hope that their feat with BrainEx could work. But BrainEx's big advance actually isn't in reviving dead tissue -- it's long been known that we can see cellular function in tissues well after the host organism has died, and scientists have even done this with human brain tissue. What BrainEx offers is the possibility of keeping much of the brain alive separate from the body. This represents a new research model for experimental work on a whole array of brain injuries, not just the kind where the heart stops. By isolating the brain and hooking it up to BrainEx, scientists could potentially add various medications to the artificial blood stream to see how they work, and experiment with different repairing procedures on a living brain without dealing with the rest of the body. While the BrainEx technique raises questions about the blurred line between life and death, we're still a long ways off from seeing the practical applications of the study play out in hospitals around the country. In conducting the BrainEx study, scientists inflicted serious damage to the brain it was keeping alive -- they tied off all of the major arteries feeding the brain and brainstem save two major ones. In practice, this would cause numerous strokes, especially to the brainstem, which is in charge of directing all of the brain's output and input. Body Smart: Paralyzed man building a fully automated life And while the scientists showed that they were able to pump the artificial blood through the brain's arteries, many tiny blood vessels called capillaries remained closed off. The study presented the data in a bar graph without specifying the exact numbers, but it appears about 10% of capillaries didn't open up. A brain with 10% of its capillaries suddenly closed would be terribly dysfunctional, with widely distributed brain cell death. Proving individual cells can perform basic metabolic functions, or send a neural impulse when stimulated, is quite far from activating the complex networks that somehow generate conscious awareness, a process we still do not fully understand. A considerably more advanced technique producing far less brain damage would likely be necessary to see the alpha and beta electroencephalography waves we associate with consciousness. Looking at the possibility of a brain transplant, we currently have no means of connecting a brain to the spinal cord, or the brainstem to the head and neck nerves. A stroke at the brainstem can leave a patient temporarily or permanently with no control of the body and only limited eye movement. Brain transplant results would be far worse: no feeling, hearing, or sight, and with no tenable means for communicating with the outside world. The results of such a procedure, which no scientific review board would approve, would be even more horrific than what the Italian ""head transplant"" surgeon claims he wants to do one day.

The body isn't a machine, and death isn't flipping a switch. Biomedical scientists know this intellectually, but law and society do not understand this medical fact very well. Despite our current scientific limitations, it's not too early to consider the ethics of reviving consciousness in a disembodied brain, and question whether brain transplants should ever be allowed. In an accompanying Nature article , two bioethicists worry about what a brain life support system might mean for people awaiting organ transplants. Could death become such a blurry issue that families aren't willing to part with their loved one's remaining organs while they wait to see whether the brain might be revived? I suspect that by the time we are dealing with this dilemma, we'll have lab grown artificial livers, hearts and kidneys to fill such a void. The future is coming, with technologies that can be used for good or ill, but this study deserves more celebration than consternation. Better treatments for strokes, anoxic or traumatic brain injuries, and more, are closer at hand with this new research tool."

Ax found at Brooklyn apartment where woman was partially decapitated,edition.cnn.com,"Ray Sanchez and Mark Morales, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/new-york-brooklyn-ax-killing-investigation/index.html,"New York (CNN) Detectives have detained a person as they investigate the death of a woman who was found dead and partially decapitated in a Brooklyn apartment, New York police said.
The body of Savannah Rivera, 20, was found early Saturday after another woman who was in the apartment flagged an Uber on the street and the driver called police, according to a law enforcement official. NYPD Brooklyn North Deputy Chief Michael Kemper described the incident as a ""brutal vicious attack"" and said the incident was not random. He said the detained person knew both women. A motive behind the incident is still unclear, Kemper said, but he said there's a ""good possibility"" that the case will be categorized as a domestic violence. An ax recovered from a trash compactor at the public housing complex in the Bushwick neighborhood is part of the investigation, the official said. It's unclear whether the ax was used in the crime. Read More Police technicians remove bags of presumed evidence from the Brooklyn crime scene. When officers arrived at the eighth-floor apartment, Rivera was unconscious and unresponsive in the living room, where she was pronounced dead. She had multiple stab wounds and lacerations to the head, arms and body. She also had severed fingers, police said. They also discovered a 4-year-old girl who was unharmed. The child's 21-year-old mother managed to run from the apartment, leaving her daughter in a bedroom, according to the law enforcement official. She flagged down an Uber on the street and the driver called police around 1:30 a.m. Saturday after noticing a large amount of blood on the woman. The woman, who also had lacerations on her head and body, was in critical but stable condition at Elmhurst Hospital later Saturday, police said. The two women were either friends or relatives, according to police. The 21-year-old mother and her daughter lived in the apartment and Rivera had been staying with them, a police spokesman said, but it's was not immediately clear why or for how long she had been there. The child was taken to a local hospital for evaluation and is with family members, Kemper said. Police crime scene technicians checked the building's lobby for fingerprints and other evidence Saturday morning, according to news footage. Residents came and went under a light rain as yellow police tape secured the building's entrance. Crime technicians carried bags of presumed evidence to police vehicles."
Tiger attack: Zookeeper suffered 'lacerations and punctures' at the Topeka Zoo - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/tiger-attacks-topeka-zookeeper/index.html,"(CNN) A zookeeper is recovering in the hospital after she was attacked Saturday morning by a tiger at the Topeka, Kansas, zoo.
The woman and a 7-year-old male Sumatran tiger named Sanjiv were both in the tiger habitat shortly after the zoo opened when the tiger ""essentially tackled our keeper,"" Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said at an afternoon press conference. The zookeeper suffered ""lacerations and punctures to the back of the head, neck, back and one arm,"" Wiley told reporters. The zookeeper was transported to a local hospital where she received treatment. A spokeswoman for the City of Topeka previously told CNN that woman was ""awake and alert"" at the time she was taken to the hospital. She's currently in stable condition, Wiley said. The zookeeper is the facility's primary tiger keeper, Wiley said, and has been working in that space for years. Read More ""There really isn't a circumstance where they should have been in the same space, so there was some sort of error that occurred here,"" he said. He later clarified that it's part of the daily process for the zookeeper to be in the tiger habitat to clean and maintain it, but the tiger should not have been in the space at that time. Wiley said the zoo is not considering euthanizing the tiger. Sumatran tigers are a ""critically rare"" and ""endangered"" species, Wiley said. Sanjiv recently fathered four cubs. ""While this incident is very unfortunate,"" Wiley said, ""he did what a wild animal, what a wild tiger does."" The director credited his staff with a speedy and effective response that got the incident under control within 10 minutes. A notification was put out to all zoo staff after the attack. Elephant staff members were a short distance away and were able to lure the tiger back into its enclosure, where he was secured. ""The tiger was never out of its space,"" Wiley said. Several guests did witness the attack, Wiley said. The zoo was briefly closed, but has subsequently reopened. Wiley added, ""We have absolutely no concerns about the safety of our guests here."" "
Congress should initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump (opinion),edition.cnn.com,Jeffrey Sachs,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/opinions/mueller-report-trump-congress-initiate-impeachment-sachs/index.html,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University .

(CNN) Congress should launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump for welcoming Russian interference in the 2016 election and trying to obstruct the Mueller investigation. Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors stare us in the face, and each day he remains in power is a day closer to the collapse of the rule of law.
Jeffrey Sachs Trump welcomed Russian interference in the 2016 election while signaling his readiness to shift US foreign policy in favor of Russia by ending sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed his security apparatus to hack DNC emails and launched a disinformation campaign to troll the elections through Facebook and other means, according to Mueller's report . While Mueller did not find conclusive evidence that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government on the hacking and disinformation campaign, they knew that Russia offered assistance and ""expected [the Trump campaign] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts."" The hacking and social media campaigns ""coincided with a series of contacts between Trump campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government,"" according to the Mueller report , which includes a lengthy list of these contacts. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for example, shared internal polling data with a Ukrainian business associate with links to Russian intelligence, and discussed his strategy to win votes in the Midwest. The Mueller report is shocking And when the US intelligence community assessed Russia meddled in the US elections, Trump took Putin's side and refused to fully acknowledge Russia's involvement . Read More What were Trump's overarching motives? The first, of course, was to win the election. According to Mueller, Russians offered to help the campaign . Ahead of the famous Trump Tower meeting in the summer of 2016, for example, an email to Donald Trump Jr. offering dirt on Hillary Clinton explicitly stated that the information was being presented as "" part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump ."" The second motivation was at least as pertinent. Trump's greed appears to match or exceed his lust for power. During the 2016 campaign, Trump was trying to secure a lucrative Moscow Trump Tower real estate deal. For that to succeed, Trump needed Putin's blessing. Trump's allies reportedly even floated the idea of giving Putin a $50 million luxury apartment in the Moscow Trump Tower, which may have violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . After the election, Trump repeatedly tried to shut down, curtail or limit Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's illegal actions. The second half of the Mueller Report spells out many instances in which the President tried to undermine the investigation, which only failed because Trump's staff failed to carry out his orders . Mueller's report looks bad for Obama The Mueller investigation ultimately uncovered three devastating facts. The first, of course, was the extent of Russia's election interference and the Trump campaign's welcoming of that interference -- a double whammy that delegitimizes Trump's election victory. The second was Trump's brazen Russian business proposal during the campaign. The third included various financial dealings, including the hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels. Trump poses a serious threat to this country. He tries to govern by one-man decree, declares phony emergencies to crack down on immigration, resists Congressional oversight and courts tyrants abroad. Cautious Democratic leaders are reluctant to launch impeachment proceedings knowing that a conviction in a Republican Senate is currently against the odds, but they should recognize three overarching issues. First, as a matter of duty, they cannot shrug off rampant lawlessness without empowering thuggery in the future. Second, they can launch impeachment investigations now without deciding yet on whether to move to a vote, during which they and the public will gain information. Third, Trump's conviction by the Senate, or his resignation, remain plausible outcomes. During Watergate, public opinion was divided, even on the issue of Nixon's resignation, but the truth prevailed. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Trump recklessly welcomed Russian interference in the 2016 election for political gain while he was pursuing personal business interests in Russia, and those actions, together with his brazen attempts to obstruct Mueller's investigation, surely constitute high crimes and misdemeanors justifying the launch of impeachment hearings. According to Mueller's findings, Trump has egregiously undermined the rule of law and bid US officials to do the same. Congress now must defend the Constitution and initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump."
New York Times: Production issues at Boeing's South Carolina plant 'have threatened to compromise safety' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/boeing-south-carolina-plant/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former and current employees at a Boeing plant in South Carolina that produces the company's 787 Dreamliner claim the factory is overrun by ""shoddy production and weak oversight that have threatened to compromise safety"" -- a revelation that surfaces as Boeing is under fire over a separate aircraft, the New York Times reported Saturday.
The paper said a review of ""hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records,"" as well as interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees of the North Charleston plant, revealed ""a culture that often valued production speed over quality."" According to the paper, plant employees described defective manufacturing, debris left on planes and pressure to not report violations across ""nearly a dozen whistle-blower claims and safety complaints"" filed with federal regulators. The report comes as the company is dealing with the aftermath of two deadly crashes of its 737 Max aircraft, which have drawn attention to the company's production and safety standards. The Times noted that ""there is no evidence"" that the issues raised in the plant -- which was celebrated as ""a state-of-the-art manufacturing hub"" when it opened in 2009 -- ""have led to any major safety incidents."" 9 countries and 3 US agencies to investigate initial 737 Max certification In a number of cases, the paper said a former quality manager at Boeing, John Barnett, ""discovered clusters of metal slivers hanging over the wiring that commands the flight controls."" Barnett told the Times that if those ""sharp"" slivers ""penetrated"" the wiring, the result could be ""catastrophic."" Barnett filed a whistle-blower complaint with regulators, according to the paper. ""As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,"" Barnett told the Times. ""And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy."" Read More In a statement sent to the plant's employees and provided to CNN Saturday, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times' report ""paints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant)."" Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said ""quality is the bedrock of who we are,"" adding that the plant delivers ""the highest quality airplanes."" Still, the Times reported other employees also claimed the plant faced serious quality issues, but said they faced performance penalties and harassment for raising concerns. Another former employee, Rich Mester, told the Times he also found problematic objects in planes produced at the plant. Mester, a former technician who reviewed planes before they left the plant and who the paper reports was fired, said he had found ""tubes of sealant, nuts, stuff from the build process"" during his time with the company. Debris found in planes ""has cost Boeing at other plants,"" including their Everett, Washington, plant, where the company built the KC-46 tanker for the Air Force, according to the Times. CNN reported earlier this month that the Air Force stopped accepting deliveries of the tanker and refueling aircraft after debris was found inside some of the planes. An Air Force official told CNN earlier this week that some already delivered planes will be sent back to the factory for another round of inspections, which will involve removing panels to conduct the inspections. In a statement to CNN, Lynn Lunsford, a spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, said ""Safety is the FAA's top priority. We thoroughly investigate whistleblower complaints and take action if the allegations are substantiated."""
J Balvin makes history as Lollapalooza's first Latino headliner - CNN,www.cnn.com,Kendall Trammell,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/entertainment/j-balvin-lollapalooza-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) J Balvin headlining Lollapalooza is just another example that the world of music festivals is evolving.
The ""Mi Gente"" singer will be one of the eight artists headlining the music festival August 1-4 at Chicago's Grant Park. More importantly, he'll be the first Latino headliner in Lollapalooza's 28-year history. Latino artists have performed at the festival before but never as a headliner, which is what makes this year's lineup different from the rest. Like Beyonc√© was for Coachella , J Balvin's performance will show that Lolla finally recognizes there's a large audience in the United States not only for reggaeton but for Spanish-language music. Balvin is listed above other big stars -- Lil Wayne, Kacey Musgraves and Janelle Monae , to name a few. And some of his achievements over the past year support why the ""Ginza"" and ""Safari"" singer deserves his time to shine at Lollapalooza. Read More His music transcends languages Hailing from Colombia, Balvin received eight Billboard nominations this year, including top Latin artist, top Latin song, and top Latin album as well as several other categories for his work with Cardi B on ""I Like It."" The rapper, born Jose Alvaro Osorio Balvin, was one of the most-streamed artists on Spotify last year . He also has collaborated with other American music icons, including Justin Bieber and Beyonc√©. And even then, you'll rarely (if ever) see Balvin perform in English. ""Just because you are Latino does not mean you can't be global,"" Balvin told CNN last year. That's what makes him stand out from other artists like Luis Fonsi and Bad Bunny. And while some of his audience in the United States may not speak Spanish fluently, that's not stopping him from performing the way he wants to be known. Lollapalooza isn't his first big music gig Balvin has already played Coachella twice. He first performed at the California festival last year as a guest during Beyonc√©'s headlining set , where he embraced his Latin pop flair while Queen Bey introduced HBCU culture to the Coachella crowd. This year, the 37-year-old graced the stage on his own, celebrating the beauty and vibrancy of reggaeton music. Last fall, Balvin kicked off his 27-day US tour, which included energetic dancers, several celebrity cameos and even dinosaurs . ""I don't just make music for people who like reggaeton,"" Balvin told Rolling Stone . ""I make music for everybody. I'm down to change people's minds, I'm down to just refresh the world."" Music is just one factor for mainstream success Even with No. 1 music hits, an artist's success is also measured by their influence on consumers' commercial power. With an Instagram following of more than 28 million, 6.1 million Twitter followers and more than 20 million YouTube subscribers , Balvin has the eyes and ears of many. According to Nielsen , millennial Latinx consumers over-index in areas, such as listening to streaming music and following artists on social media when compared to non-Hispanics in the United States. Balvin reaches audiences that brands are vying to engage with. His recent partnership with Guess is an example of that. Balvin launched a seven-piece capsule of concert merchandise with Gues s last year, named after his top-charting album ""Vibras,"" putting his mark on the fashion world. Fans could shop Balvin's clothing line at select Guess stores near the concert locations days leading up to each performance. ""My partnership with Guess, a brand that has strong roots in the Latin community, not only aligns with my personal brand, but with my community and fan base as well,"" Balvin said in a statement . ""I am so excited to launch an exclusive collection of concert merch on tour and officially bring the vibe of our music to fashion."" "

And there's an autographed photo of baseball great Derek Jeter, wishing Frank well in the run-up to his retirement in 2014 as the principal of Columbine High School. ""It's a little bit of history,"" Frank said. Even still, 20 years after two students stormed the Colorado campus, killing 12 students and one teacher, Frank DeAngelis is inextricably linked to Columbine -- and to the event that has come to mark a horrific and ongoing chapter in America's saga of school massacres. Read More At first, he was bound by a promise to stay at the helm until every student who'd been at the school that unimaginable morning had graduated. Then, he expanded that vow, remaining until every local child who'd been in class that day, down to preschoolers, had earned a diploma. Framed memorabilia are displayed on Frank DeAngelis' office walls at his home. Since stepping away from the principal's office, he has continued his commitment to collective recovery -- and expanded his flock far beyond Columbine High School. Five years after retiring, the 64-year-old is as busy as ever, traveling the country to shepherd principals and communities that have fallen victim to the scourge of school shootings. It's the latest iteration of an evolving role, however unwelcome, he has pioneered since April 20, 1999. ""Columbine offers hope,"" Frank told CNN. ""And that's what I hope, 20 years later, that we're doing, that we're reaching out to other people -- the Parklands, the Santa Fes, the Sandy Hooks, the Virginia Techs."" ""I feel I was chosen to do that."" But he's also given so much of himself to Columbine, several people close to him said. And with the 20th anniversary of the shooting and the publication of a new memoir, ""They Call Me 'Mr. De,'"" Frank's wife, Diane DeAngelis, hopes he soon considers slowing down. ""It always comes to a head right before the anniversary,"" she said. ""And I just hope that with the 20th, that maybe this is the last anniversary that is as big as it is and that we can move on a bit."" A devoted educator faces the unthinkable When Frank was 13, he got a job in a pizzeria. In high school, he delivered newspapers. Frank's parents taught hard work and dedication, and when he got sick, he hardly ever missed work. Diane, who dated Frank in high school, said he was nice but very serious. He didn't have a sense of humor. The couple spent all their time together, and while still in high school, Frank gave her a promise ring and said he wanted to get married. Diane didn't want that, she said, so they broke up. ""I had no spontaneity ... I was so serious,"" Frank admitted. ""I was 15 or 16 going on 30, and I had to plan my whole life out."" Even so, Frank was unsure what he wanted to study in college, his brother said. But they had both played sports growing up, so when Frank told his brother he'd become an educator, Anthony DeAngelis assumed it was for the sake of athletics. ""I thought, 'He's probably going to be pretty good at this,'"" Anthony said. As with all things, Frank dove in deep. Early in his career, Frank's principal once forced him to fork over his keys to the school for a weekend. ""He said, 'I do not want to see you around this school. Frank, you need to get away,'"" he remembered. Lights streak as a truck drives by Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in this long-exposure photograph. Frank displayed that same commitment to each of his students and the baseball players he coached, said Tom Tonelli, one of Frank's former pupils and a Columbine High School graduate who went on to teach at the school. ""It was always: Be a good student, be a good athlete, but above all else, be a good person,"" said Tonelli of Frank's expectations. 20 years after that day at Columbine High School, I'm still asking: 'Am I safe?' Still today, when Frank's brother hands over his credit card at restaurants, servers often ask if he's related to Frank, Anthony said. A waitress last year told him Frank had been her principal. ""And she goes, 'You could talk to any of my friends. What we appreciated was how he treated us,'"" Anthony recalled. That sentiment holds whether before or after the shooting, said Tonelli, who was on staff at Columbine the day gunfire erupted. ""Do I think the shooting transformed him? Absolutely,"" the teacher said. ""But to say somehow he became a totally different type of person, I don't think so. The character he exhibited in the wake of the tragedy is just a reflection of who he was before it happened."" When 'the world didn't believe in us,' he did Columbine High School serves a middle- and upper-middle-class community in Littleton, Colorado, where the mountains in the west rise into a wide open sky. Before the massacre, it was an ""ideal"" community, Frank said, with a lot of parental support and where he ""could count on my two hands the number of fistfights we had in 20 years."" After the shooting, Frank ""felt this enormous burden to go rebuild that community,"" he said. That's when he made the promise to stay at Columbine until the Class of 2002 had graduated. Other staff members made the same commitment, he said. But in 2001, Frank felt he hadn't accomplished what he'd set out to do. The Columbine Memorial in Littleton was dedicated and opened to the public on September 21, 2007. ""There were so many people deeply impacted, even the kids in elementary school,"" he said. ""So, I made a promise that I wanted to be there until that last class graduated, which would be 2012."" Two years after that, he finally left.

Principal: I want Columbine to mean hope (2014) 03:17 Frank's promise to stay gave him ""so much credibility in the community,"" Tonelli said. The faculty and staff, along with the students and the whole community, looked to him as a leader, as someone who was ""persevering for a cause greater than himself."" The perception stuck, even in the face of criticism that the school's administrators and faculty had fostered a student culture ""where something like this could happen,"" Tonelli said, referring to the shooting and calling the claim ""unjust."" The notion ""that there were certain segments of the population we didn't care about was so untrue,"" the teacher said. Through it all, Frank's ""leadership meant everything,"" he said. ""He was the biggest believer in our kids and in their teachers and in our community at a time when we felt like the rest of the world didn't believe in us anymore."" A leader battles darkness at home But as he worked to help Columbine recover, Frank was also an ordinary survivor. At home, his heroic veneer vanished, giving way to the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder. ""I tried to do everything to protect what I call the Columbine family,"" Frank recalled. ""But when I would come home, I just wanted to be left alone."" He didn't want to talk with his first wife and two stepchildren about what happened; they just didn't understand the aftermath, he said. ""It cost me my marriage,"" he said. ""My wife was saying, 'You're not the same person I married. You've changed.' And I did. I felt so much guilt."" Religious icons are displayed in Frank DeAngelis' home office. His trauma manifested in other ways, too. Months after the shooting, Frank and his brother went to a Colorado Rockies game. When fireworks lit up the sky, Anthony said, ""My brother nearly took cover."" Later, Frank told Anthony the celebratory display took him right back to the attack. More shell shock set in when Frank returned to Columbine the summer after the shooting to prepare for the new academic year. Bangs and rumbles echoed as construction crews repaired damage to the building. ""I would have to go back to my office,"" he said, ""and I would cry."" Hope thrives in 'tough love' Ahead of the massacre's third anniversary, as he was pushed by divorce proceedings to the edge of emotional and financial ""ruin,"" Frank began pecking away at the mountain of unopened letters he'd gotten in its wake. Among the first he picked up was from his high school sweetheart, Diane. They began talking regularly by phone, often late into the night, but agreed not to see each other until Frank's marriage was dissolved. ""There was still a spark,"" Diane said, and she could tell Frank had grown up. ""I could see that he had a sense of humor,"" she laughed, but also that his core traits hadn't changed. ""Some of the good things that brought us together were there from the beginning."" But as their relationship developed, Frank continued to wrestle with his trauma. As with many Columbine survivors, it always got harder in the advent of April, a month in which Frank has gotten into six car wrecks and when his attention always jerks back to the terror. Diane and Frank DeAngelis were high school sweethearts who lost touch, then married in 2013. He leaned on counseling and his Catholic faith, but he was living alone in a nearly vacant house, with only a few pictures and a single bed left after most everything else was sold off. ""Twenty years of my life was in shambles,"" he said. ""I was struggling,"" and he eventually started to drink. Diane, whose father was a recovered alcoholic, quickly caught on. Frank started hanging up the phone around 4 in the afternoon, she said, and telling her they would talk the next day. ""Immediately, I knew,"" she said. ""I thought, I don't know if I'm going to have to end this, because I can't go down that path again."" Diane's father died that April; Frank attended the visitation, and they began seeing each other. Soon, Diane caught him drinking. ""I can't do this,"" she told him. ""It was justifiable,"" Frank said, looking back. ""That was what I needed, that tough love ... I was so fortunate she came back into my life. And I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize that. It was a wake-up call."" Leading the 'Club Nobody Wanted to Join' When he talks to others who have lived through school shootings, Frank mentions the risk of using alcohol or drugs to cope, and he emphasizes the importance of finding positive sources of support. It's just one of many pieces of advice he gives to members of what he calls in his book, ""A Club Nobody Wanted to Join."" Columbine wasn't the first school shooting, and it obviously wasn't the last. But every time another mass murder happens at a school, Frank said, his phone begins to ring with calls from reporters seeking insight from one of the nation's most seasoned campus attack veterans. ""Not that I'm an expert,"" he said, ""but I lived through it."" He was called on as recently as this week to address the news media when a Florida teenager -- who authorities said was ""infatuated"" with the Columbine massacre -- traveled to Colorado and bought a shotgun, prompting the shutdown of Denver-area schools, including Columbine. Quote: : s are inscribed at the Columbine Memorial. Frank also reaches out to school leaders thrust into the role he knows so well. Last year, he said he connected after deadly shootings with administrators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, as well as Santa Fe High School in Texas and Marshall County High School in Kentucky . Getting that call carries a lot of weight, said Andy Fetchik, the former principal of Chardon High School in Ohio, where three students were killed in a shooting in February 2012. What school threats and lockdowns are doing to a generation of children The first thing Frank said was, ""We are now members of the same fraternity that neither one of us pledged,"" Fetchik told CNN. ""And the second thing he asked me to do was to write down his cell phone number."" Months later, as Fetchik prepared to start the next school year, he gave Frank a call, he said. ""There was a peace of mind in speaking with someone that went through it,"" Fetchik said, noting that Frank validated the steps he'd taken to help his Ohio school community heal. Several years later, Frank visited Chardon High School to talk with faculty members about the recovery process. ""One of the things I struggled with in the recovery was addressing the needs of staff. We didn't always know what they needed,"" Fetchik said. ""Frank was that voice of somebody who's been there, who said, 'Where you're at is OK. Mental health recovery is not something you could control. There's no calendar.'"" 'Columbine is not going to define me' Today, Frank and Fetchik are members of the Principal Recovery Network , a new group of 17 current and former school administrators who have lived through school shootings and their aftermath. Unlike activists who have sought to change gun laws following campus attacks, these officials simply aim to offer themselves and their combined experience as a resource. 20 years on, Columbine survivors tell Parkland students: 'We're sorry we couldn't stop it.' It falls in line with the work Frank has undertaken since he retired. Last year, he gave about 50 presentations in the United States and Canada about the recovery process. He also serves on the boards of school safety and other organizations, he said, knowing his name and connection to Columbine carry weight. But he's tired, Diane said, and she's made it clear she hopes he slows down after the 20th anniversary of the event that has served as the pivot point for his life's work. ""He's doing a lot of good out there, and he has a lot to bring to the table,"" she told CNN. ""But I worry about his health, because it hasn't been great. I see it in his face, how exhausted he is."" Frank DeAngelis stands outside his home. For a man who's been working since he was a kid, ""I can't imagine myself being completely retired,"" Frank said. And he knows he'll always want to help suffering communities. But he admits he needs to lighten his load. ""I'm looking at the 20-year remembrance as, I need to reevaluate,"" he said. ""I need to be able to give myself permission to relax. I need to give myself permission."" When he retired, Frank said, Diane told him she worried he would fall into a depression because he would no longer be associated with Columbine. Around that time, he began worrying about his own health and suffered with anxiety. But the doctor told him he was fine. Then, he visited another expert who pinpointed the problem. ""You have been a part of Columbine for 35 years,"" Frank's therapist told him, he recalled. ""And you feel that Columbine is Frank DeAngelis."" That perspective set the stage for a new outlook, Frank said. It's one he says he wants to embrace, though it may require as much determination as any hurdle he's conquered yet. ""He made me realize that Columbine is not going to define me. And that helped a lot,"" the former principal said. ""I've just got to get it in my mind that it's OK."" "

From 'total exoneration' to 'total bullsh**': Trump lingers on damning report - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kevin Liptak,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/donald-trump-mueller-report-anger/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29,"Washington (CNN) By the time President Donald Trump had passed through the prime rib buffet at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to sit for dinner with family and a top aide, the damning picture Robert Mueller's report painted of his presidency had become clear.
Instead of the ""total exoneration"" Trump had proclaimed earlier, the report portrayed the President as deceitful and paranoid , encouraging his aides to withhold the truth and cross ethical lines in an attempt to thwart a probe into Russia's interference in US elections -- his ""Achilles heel,"" according to one forthcoming adviser. Perhaps more angering to a leader who detests weakness -- but doesn't necessarily mind an amoral reputation -- were the number of underlings shown ignoring his commands , privately scoffing at the ""crazy sh**"" he was requesting and working around him to avoid self-implication. Now, those close to him say Trump is newly furious at the people -- most of whom no longer work for him -- whose extensive interviews with the special counsel's office created the epic depiction of an unscrupulous and chaotic White House. And he's seeking assurances from those who remain that his orders are being treated like those of a president, and not like suggestions from an intemperate but misguided supervisor. Undermining, but protective: How Trump's staff's insolence may have saved him ""Because I never agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad),"" Trump tweeted on Friday morning as he waited out a rainstorm in Florida before proceeding to his golf course for a round with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. Read More Some current and former officials who accurately predicted that details in the Mueller report would be embarrassing for the White House are now questioning the legal strategy to fully cooperate with the Mueller investigation. One official who sat down with the special counsel noted that they did so at the behest of the former White House legal team, John Dowd and Ty Cobb, who provided a wealth of documents and encouraged senior officials to be interviewed. It was because of these interviews with people closest to the President that Mueller and his team were able to get a cinematic look at the deceit and trickery taking place in the West Wing. While these people are critical, the full cooperation was a strategy to make it hard for Mueller to push for an interview given all the information he was given. It was a strategy that worked, even if there is some political embarrassment. The President was aware ahead of its public release what was contained in the Mueller report. Attorney General Bill Barr told reporters Thursday that both the White House counsel and Trump's personal legal team were given an opportunity to read the redacted version in the previous days. Mounting anger Undermining, but protective: How Trump's staff's insolence may have saved him But Trump grew angry as he watched cable news coverage because, sources familiar with the matter said, a theme was emerging that vexed him: a portrait of a dishonest president who is regularly managed, restrained or ignored by his staff. It was a sharp turn away from his earlier statements, which welcomed the report's findings on collusion and falsely claimed total exoneration. Hours before his Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump insisted to a crowd on the tarmac in Florida the dark days of Mueller's special counsel investigation had ended. ""Game over, folks,"" he said over the sounds of a busy airport. ""Now, it's back to work."" It's hard to tell, however, what Trump intends to head back to. Mueller's probe and Trump's constant focus on it have been the backdrop for all but a few months of the presidency, often diminishing whatever policy efforts have been orchestrated by officials or Republican lawmakers. The report depicts a President who for two years has been largely consumed by the Russia investigation, intent on short-circuiting it but repeatedly stymied in his efforts by aides. A senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that dynamic was ""nothing surprising."" ""That the President makes absurd demands of his staff and administration officials -- who are alarmed by them and reluctant to follow them -- is not only unsurprising but has become the norm,"" the official said. Nevertheless, in the past Trump has resisted the idea that he is being controlled by those around him or that they are responsible for his successes. Sources familiar with how the West Wing operates said attempts to subvert the President's demands have not ceased now that the Mueller investigation is over. There have been instances in recent weeks where aides have slow walked or ignored Trump's directives, hoping he will forget he gave them. What is clear is many of those who avoided carrying out Trump's demands related to Mueller's probe -- often, it seemed, in a bid to protect themselves from criminal wrongdoing -- are no longer employed by the White House. Instead, the aides who now surround the President appear less willing to write him off and more likely to encourage him to follow his gut. Among those who have moved on: the White House counsel who refused Trump's demand to fire Mueller, the chief of staff and senior adviser who anxiously tried to retrieve a resignation letter from the attorney general, the staff secretary who declined Trump's order to gauge the loyalty of a Justice Department official, the attorney general who refused to un-recuse himself and the communications chief who seemed most expert in Trump's whims. Even Steve Bannon, once viewed as the ultimate advocate for following Trump's instincts, is depicted in the report as a constraining force. In one instance, when the President tried to claim Mueller had a conflict of interest because of a membership dispute at a Trump golf club, Bannon wrote it off as ""ridiculous and petty."" Trump and Bannon parted ways in the summer of 2017 and have not reconciled since. Instead, the most prominent aides who do remain are depicted in the report as the most dishonest. Press secretary Sarah Sanders, who was out the office when the report was released, is shown repeatedly misleading the press , a fact she attempted to downplay in morning television interviews on Friday. ""(Trump) has never asked me to break the law,"" she said on CBS. ""When the President wants to do something and make a decision, he does it. He's not somebody who sit around and ponders. I think you guys have seen that day in and day out. One minute you're running stories saying the staff can't control him and the next minute everyone's saying thank God the staff could control him. You don't get to have it both ways."" Increasingly untethered JUST WATCHED Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' 02:48 Among those who Trump dined with in Florida on Thursday was Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff who still fills the role in an acting capacity but who, according to officials, has done less than either of his two predecessors to restrain Trump in his hardline instincts. Indeed, since Mulvaney's tenure began at the start of the year, Trump has overseen the longest government shutdown in US history, a dramatic shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security, a sharp turn toward harsher policies on the border, a decision to ask a court to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act and a confusing dictate on North Korea sanctions that still has advisers scratching their heads. People familiar with Mulvaney's style say those outcomes aren't necessarily his doing, but rather the result of a President newly empowered to follow his impulses without the restrictions placed on him by previous aides. Sources say the President has also come to rely on his chief of staff less than he did during the reign of Reince Priebus or John Kelly, when he would often call his top aide nearly a dozen times a day. Mulvaney has told colleagues there are days he barely hears from the President. In his report, Mueller describes both of Mulvaney's predecessors -- Priebus and Kelly -- as working in at least some capacity to contain the damage of Trump's behavior. Priebus is shown making an urgent (and vaguely comic) effort to recover a resignation letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Trump had kept, believing it would amount to a ""shock collar"" on the Justice Department because it was not dated and aides feared Trump could employ it at his leisure. Kelly told Mueller that when Trump wanted to meet with friends who encouraged his impulses, such as former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski, he tried to push them to the private residence ""to create distance from the West Wing."" Trump soured on Priebus and Kelly long before he summarily terminated each of their tenures. So, too, had Trump grown wary of former White House counsel Don McGahn, who sat for more than 30 hours of testimony with Mueller's team. Trump grew irate again at his former aide late Thursday and into Friday. In the report, Trump is described as having several tense encounters with McGahn during his White House tenure, including episodes when McGahn was prepared to resign rather than carry out Trump's demands. McGahn described Trump asking him to do ""crazy sh**,"" according to Priebus. Trump, meanwhile, deemed McGahn a ""lying bastard"" whose habit of taking contemporaneous notes raised suspicion. In an anecdote relayed in the report, Trump and McGahn went back-and-forth over the note-taking, which Trump insisted good lawyers -- such as his onetime counsel Roy Cohn -- never did. Trump hadn't backed off that view by Friday morning, when he made clear on Twitter his frustrations at the report. ""Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed,"" the President wrote. "
Paris police use tear gas against 'yellow vest' protesters - CNN,www.cnn.com,Chandrika Narayan,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/world/paris-protests-tear-gas/index.html,"(CNN) Riot police unleashed tear gas at so-called yellow vest protesters in central Paris who marched Saturday for the 23rd consecutive weekend.

The Paris prosecutor's office said 182 yellow vest protesters were placed in police custody. This is the first demonstration since the devastating fire this week at the Notre Dame cathedral. The Interior Ministry said some 27,900 people demonstrated across France, including 9,000 in Paris. The protesters, who chanted, sang and played musical instruments as they marched, are rallying against economic injustice.

The government had warned protesters that police would use ""all means necessary"" to stop demonstrations from getting out of control.

There were protests in other cities including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille and Lille, Agence France-Presse reported.

Macron is now set to make his announcement Thursday, according to Reuters. In his New Year's address, Macron referred to the movement without naming it. He acknowledged anger against injustice but said hateful speech would not be tolerated, and called on people to respect each other.

Maureen Walsh: Washington state senator slammed for saying nurses 'play cards' for 'considerable amount of the day' - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/washington-state-senator-nurse-remarks/index.html,"Washington state senator slammed for saying nurses 'play cards' for 'considerable amount of the day' By Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN Updated 6:36 PM EDT, Sat April 20, 2019
(CNN) A Washington state senator has drawn the ire of nurses after remarks she made suggesting that nurses in smaller hospitals ""probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day.""
The Washington State Senate considered a bill Tuesday, SHB 1155, that would provide nurses with uninterrupted meal and rest periods.
""By putting these types of mandates on a critical access hospital that literally serves a handful of individuals, I would submit to you those nurses probably do get breaks. They probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day,"" Washington state Senator Maureen Walsh said on Tuesday during a debate on the Washington state Senate floor.
Walsh, a Republican, was arguing in support of an amendment that would exempt critical access hospitals, in rural areas, and hospitals with less than 25 beds from the bill.
""I understand helping with employees and making sure that we have rest breaks and things like that. But I also understand that we need to care for patients first and foremost,"" Walsh said.
The Washington State Nurses Association called Walsh's remarks ""demeaning"" and said there is ""zero logic"" in covering nurses in some hospitals, ""while leaving others without any protections.""
""No, Senator, nurses are not sitting around playing cards. They are taking care of your neighbors, your family, your community,"" Mathew Keller, WSNA's director of nursing practice and health policy, said in a post on the union's website.
Keller also argued that such an amendment would make it harder to recruit nurses to rural facilities.
Walsh had also introduced an amendment to the bill that would prohibit nurses from working more than eight hours.
""Well, if we have an issue with nurses getting tired, let's quit letting them do 12-hour shifts, let's let them do 8-hour shifts. Like most standard shifts are,"" Walsh said on Tuesday. ""Twelve hours, I know they want it, but then they come back and they start talking out of both sides of the mouth and telling us how tired they are.""
The Democratic-controlled Senate passed SHB 1155 on Tuesday, 30-18, with the two amendments included. Walsh voted against the bill.
WSNA is in support of the full measure, but against the two amendments, which the union has vowed to try and remove.
Walsh responded to the backlash, asserting that she has the ""greatest respect for nurses"" and that her mother was a registered nurse for many years.
""The comment made about the ability to play cards was referring to the staff at the very rural and small critical access hospitals who may only serve a handful of patients and the staffing mandates are unnecessary,"" Walsh said in a lengthy statement provided to CNN affiliate KEPR TV .
Walsh continued: ""The fact is 61% of our critical access hospitals are in the red and the mandated breaks and lunch hours are not an issue in these facilities across the state. These are smaller, rural hospitals with much fewer patients than our urban hospitals and the bill is not necessary for them in meeting the needs of their patients or the hospital's budget.""
Walsh's claim about 61% of critical access hospitals being ""in the red"" was challenged Saturday by the Washington State Nurses Association, citing data by the Washington Department of Health that showed a majority of the 40 critical access hospitals in the state reported net incomes in the millions or more over a four-year period ending in 2017, and approximately 70% operating at a surplus in any given year.
""Most Washington critical access hospitals are operating with a surplus and can afford to bring on one extra nurse or technician,"" said Heather Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Nurses Association told CNN.
The bill originally passed the House on March 6 before being approved by the Senate on Tuesday. It now heads back to the House to approve the bill's changes before going to the governor's desk for his signature.
CNN reached out to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's office to see if the governor intends to sign the bill.
""We generally don't make determinations on bill action until after the final bill is delivered to our office,"" Jaime Smith, a spokeswoman for Inslee's office, told CNN in an email.

Congress should initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump (opinion) - CNN,www.cnn.com,Jeffrey Sachs,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/opinions/mueller-report-trump-congress-initiate-impeachment-sachs/index.html,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University .

(CNN) Congress should launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump for welcoming Russian interference in the 2016 election and trying to obstruct the Mueller investigation. Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors stare us in the face, and each day he remains in power is a day closer to the collapse of the rule of law.
Jeffrey Sachs Trump welcomed Russian interference in the 2016 election while signaling his readiness to shift US foreign policy in favor of Russia by ending sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed his security apparatus to hack DNC emails and launched a disinformation campaign to troll the elections through Facebook and other means, according to Mueller's report . While Mueller did not find conclusive evidence that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government on the hacking and disinformation campaign, they knew that Russia offered assistance and ""expected [the Trump campaign] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts."" The hacking and social media campaigns ""coincided with a series of contacts between Trump campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government,"" according to the Mueller report , which includes a lengthy list of these contacts. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for example, shared internal polling data with a Ukrainian business associate with links to Russian intelligence, and discussed his strategy to win votes in the Midwest. The Mueller report is shocking And when the US intelligence community assessed Russia meddled in the US elections, Trump took Putin's side and refused to fully acknowledge Russia's involvement . Read More What were Trump's overarching motives? The first, of course, was to win the election. According to Mueller, Russians offered to help the campaign . Ahead of the famous Trump Tower meeting in the summer of 2016, for example, an email to Donald Trump Jr. offering dirt on Hillary Clinton explicitly stated that the information was being presented as "" part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump ."" The second motivation was at least as pertinent. Trump's greed appears to match or exceed his lust for power. During the 2016 campaign, Trump was trying to secure a lucrative Moscow Trump Tower real estate deal. For that to succeed, Trump needed Putin's blessing. Trump's allies reportedly even floated the idea of giving Putin a $50 million luxury apartment in the Moscow Trump Tower, which may have violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . After the election, Trump repeatedly tried to shut down, curtail or limit Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's illegal actions. The second half of the Mueller Report spells out many instances in which the President tried to undermine the investigation, which only failed because Trump's staff failed to carry out his orders . Mueller's report looks bad for Obama The Mueller investigation ultimately uncovered three devastating facts. The first, of course, was the extent of Russia's election interference and the Trump campaign's welcoming of that interference -- a double whammy that delegitimizes Trump's election victory. The second was Trump's brazen Russian business proposal during the campaign. The third included various financial dealings, including the hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels. Trump poses a serious threat to this country. He tries to govern by one-man decree, declares phony emergencies to crack down on immigration, resists Congressional oversight and courts tyrants abroad. Cautious Democratic leaders are reluctant to launch impeachment proceedings knowing that a conviction in a Republican Senate is currently against the odds, but they should recognize three overarching issues. First, as a matter of duty, they cannot shrug off rampant lawlessness without empowering thuggery in the future. Second, they can launch impeachment investigations now without deciding yet on whether to move to a vote, during which they and the public will gain information. Third, Trump's conviction by the Senate, or his resignation, remain plausible outcomes. During Watergate, public opinion was divided, even on the issue of Nixon's resignation, but the truth prevailed. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Trump recklessly welcomed Russian interference in the 2016 election for political gain while he was pursuing personal business interests in Russia, and those actions, together with his brazen attempts to obstruct Mueller's investigation, surely constitute high crimes and misdemeanors justifying the launch of impeachment hearings. According to Mueller's findings, Trump has egregiously undermined the rule of law and bid US officials to do the same. Congress now must defend the Constitution and initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump. "
A white driver faces hate crime charges after he allegedly tried to hit an interracial couple with his truck - CNN,us.cnn.com,Rebekah Riess and Dakin Andone,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/louisiana-hate-crime-interracial-couple/index.html,"(CNN) A Louisiana man has been arrested and booked on charges including committing a hate crime after he allegedly accelerated his truck toward an interracial couple in a suburban New Orleans parking lot, according to the local sheriff's office.
James Descant, who is white, is accused of driving his vehicle toward a black man and a white woman in a convenience store's parking lot around 9 p.m. Tuesday in Metairie, said Capt. Jason Rivarde of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. The vehicle hit the woman, causing injuries to her hip, wrist and foot. Prosecutor adds hate crimes to charges against Louisiana church fire suspect Descant allegedly attacked the couple because he was upset about their interracial relationship, Rivarde told CNN. The couple -- a black man and a white woman -- told police they had interacted with Descant at a local motel within a week of the incident. Descant was arrested Wednesday and charged with aggravated second-degree battery, aggravated assault, damaging property and hate crimes , records show. He is being held at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. Read More CNN was unable to immediately determine whether Descant is represented by an attorney. Descant's arrest comes weeks after the burning of three historically black churches in Louisiana captured the nation's attention. The suspect in that case pleaded not guilty this week to hate crimes and arson charges."
New York Times: Production issues at Boeing's South Carolina plant 'have threatened to compromise safety' - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/boeing-south-carolina-plant/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former and current employees at a Boeing plant in South Carolina that produces the company's 787 Dreamliner claim the factory is overrun by ""shoddy production and weak oversight that have threatened to compromise safety"" -- a revelation that surfaces as Boeing is under fire over a separate aircraft, the New York Times reported Saturday.
The paper said a review of ""hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records,"" as well as interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees of the North Charleston plant, revealed ""a culture that often valued production speed over quality."" According to the paper, plant employees described defective manufacturing, debris left on planes and pressure to not report violations across ""nearly a dozen whistle-blower claims and safety complaints"" filed with federal regulators. The report comes as the company is dealing with the aftermath of two deadly crashes of its 737 Max aircraft, which have drawn attention to the company's production and safety standards. The Times noted that ""there is no evidence"" that the issues raised in the plant -- which was celebrated as ""a state-of-the-art manufacturing hub"" when it opened in 2009 -- ""have led to any major safety incidents."" 9 countries and 3 US agencies to investigate initial 737 Max certification In a number of cases, the paper said a former quality manager at Boeing, John Barnett, ""discovered clusters of metal slivers hanging over the wiring that commands the flight controls."" Barnett told the Times that if those ""sharp"" slivers ""penetrated"" the wiring, the result could be ""catastrophic."" Barnett filed a whistle-blower complaint with regulators, according to the paper. ""As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,"" Barnett told the Times. ""And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy."" Read More In a statement sent to the plant's employees and provided to CNN Saturday, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times' report ""paints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant)."" Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said ""quality is the bedrock of who we are,"" adding that the plant delivers ""the highest quality airplanes."" Still, the Times reported other employees also claimed the plant faced serious quality issues, but said they faced performance penalties and harassment for raising concerns. Another former employee, Rich Mester, told the Times he also found problematic objects in planes produced at the plant. Mester, a former technician who reviewed planes before they left the plant and who the paper reports was fired, said he had found ""tubes of sealant, nuts, stuff from the build process"" during his time with the company. Debris found in planes ""has cost Boeing at other plants,"" including their Everett, Washington, plant, where the company built the KC-46 tanker for the Air Force, according to the Times. CNN reported earlier this month that the Air Force stopped accepting deliveries of the tanker and refueling aircraft after debris was found inside some of the planes. An Air Force official told CNN earlier this week that some already delivered planes will be sent back to the factory for another round of inspections, which will involve removing panels to conduct the inspections. In a statement to CNN, Lynn Lunsford, a spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, said ""Safety is the FAA's top priority. We thoroughly investigate whistleblower complaints and take action if the allegations are substantiated."""
Tiger attack: Zookeeper suffered 'lacerations and punctures' at the Topeka Zoo - CNN,us.cnn.com,Deanna Hackney,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/tiger-attacks-topeka-zookeeper/index.html,"(CNN) A zookeeper is recovering in the hospital after she was attacked Saturday morning by a tiger at the Topeka, Kansas, zoo.
The woman and a 7-year-old male Sumatran tiger named Sanjiv were both in the tiger habitat shortly after the zoo opened when the tiger ""essentially tackled our keeper,"" Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said at an afternoon press conference. The zookeeper suffered ""lacerations and punctures to the back of the head, neck, back and one arm,"" Wiley told reporters. The zookeeper was transported to a local hospital where she received treatment. A spokeswoman for the City of Topeka previously told CNN that woman was ""awake and alert"" at the time she was taken to the hospital. She's currently in stable condition, Wiley said. The zookeeper is the facility's primary tiger keeper, Wiley said, and has been working in that space for years. Read More ""There really isn't a circumstance where they should have been in the same space, so there was some sort of error that occurred here,"" he said. He later clarified that it's part of the daily process for the zookeeper to be in the tiger habitat to clean and maintain it, but the tiger should not have been in the space at that time. Wiley said the zoo is not considering euthanizing the tiger. Sumatran tigers are a ""critically rare"" and ""endangered"" species, Wiley said. Sanjiv recently fathered four cubs. ""While this incident is very unfortunate,"" Wiley said, ""he did what a wild animal, what a wild tiger does."" The director credited his staff with a speedy and effective response that got the incident under control within 10 minutes. A notification was put out to all zoo staff after the attack. Elephant staff members were a short distance away and were able to lure the tiger back into its enclosure, where he was secured. ""The tiger was never out of its space,"" Wiley said. Several guests did witness the attack, Wiley said. The zoo was briefly closed, but has subsequently reopened. Wiley added, ""We have absolutely no concerns about the safety of our guests here."""

The body of Savannah Rivera, 20, was found early Saturday after another woman who was in the apartment flagged an Uber on the street and the driver called police, according to a law enforcement official. NYPD Brooklyn North Deputy Chief Michael Kemper described the incident as a ""brutal vicious attack"" and said the incident was not random. He said the detained person knew both women. A motive behind the incident is still unclear, Kemper said, but he said there's a ""good possibility"" that the case will be categorized as a domestic violence. An ax recovered from a trash compactor at the public housing complex in the Bushwick neighborhood is part of the investigation, the official said. It's unclear whether the ax was used in the crime.

When officers arrived at the eighth-floor apartment, Rivera was unconscious and unresponsive in the living room, where she was pronounced dead. She had multiple stab wounds and lacerations to the head, arms and body. She also had severed fingers, police said. They also discovered a 4-year-old girl who was unharmed. The child's 21-year-old mother managed to run from the apartment, leaving her daughter in a bedroom, according to the law enforcement official. She flagged down an Uber on the street and the driver called police around 1:30 a.m. Saturday after noticing a large amount of blood on the woman. The woman, who also had lacerations on her head and body, was in critical but stable condition at Elmhurst Hospital later Saturday, police said. The two women were either friends or relatives, according to police. The 21-year-old mother and her daughter lived in the apartment and Rivera had been staying with them, a police spokesman said, but it's was not immediately clear why or for how long she had been there. The child was taken to a local hospital for evaluation and is with family members, Kemper said.

Egypt votes on expanding President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's powers,us.cnn.com,Chandrika Narayan,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/middleeast/egypt-referendum-votes/index.html,"(CNN) Egypt begins voting Saturday on a series of sweeping changes to its constitution that would tighten President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's grip on power and could allow him to stay in office until 2030.
More than 61 million people are eligible to vote in the three-day referendum, according to state-run Ahram Online . State television showed President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi casting his ballot Saturday at a school in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis. More judges and administrative assistants were sent to several polling stations due to ""huge"" turnout, National Elections Authority spokesman Judge Mahmoud El-Sharif said, according to Ahram Online. Egypt's parliament votes to expand Sisi's powers Fourteen amendments to Egypt's 2014 constitution are up for a vote, as well as two new articles, state news reported. Egypt's parliament voted Tuesday in favor of the changes. Read More One amendment would extend a presidential term from four to six years. It would also add two more years to Sisi's current term and allow him to seek re-election for another six-year term in 2024. Another measure would expand Sisi's power over the legislative branch by creating an upper house known as a senate. The president would be able to handpick one-third of the members. The size of the lower house would be reduced, from 596 to 450, with at least 25% of seats reserved for women. The revised charter would also give the president new authority to appoint members of the judiciary. Opponents warn of an authoritarian push Supporters of the changes said they would bolster Egypt's economy, which is struggling to recover from the political turmoil of recent years, and strengthen security. Opponents see a further step toward authoritarianism.

Sisi, a former general, became president in 2014 after a coup the previous year. He was re-elected in 2018 with 97% of the vote . Since he came into power, Sisi has cracked down on dissent. Human rights groups have accused the regime of widespread and systematic torture of political prisoners, silencing dissidents and using death sentences to ""settle scores.""

The views expressed here are hers. View more opinion on CNN.
(CNN) I hadn't looked at the photograph in years. But then news came she faced the death penalty. When I looked at the photo again after so long, I could almost hear her characteristic laughter.
Urooba Jamal It was a photo of a group of us from the Pakistan Students' Association. Front and center in it was my friend, Loujain al-Hathloul. We were pictured together at an event in 2011 at our alma mater, the University of British Columbia (UBC), in Vancouver, Canada. I don't remember exactly, but Loujain probably had, as she often did, driven us to the Pakistani restaurant 40 minutes away from our school to pick up the catered food for the event. We had probably thanked her endlessly, as we often did, for taking us to the event from our dorms, our heels and outfits made of silk, chiffon and lace standing no chance in the Vancouver rain if we walked in them across our enormous campus. The same smiling young woman in the photo we unearthed now faced incarceration and worse for having dared to do the same in the country she grew up in: to drive. Loujain was arrested in May 2018 in the United Arab Emirates, where she had been living, and then removed to Saudi Arabia and detained. While the death penalty rumors thankfully turned out to be false, Loujain's ongoing ordeal is still grim: she faces a number of dubious charges and according to her family has been tortured and sexually harassed while imprisoned. What has been her supposed crime? Peacefully fighting for women's rights in Saudi Arabia. Read More Saudi Arabia cites UN job application as evidence against rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul Loujain is currently facing a closed-door trial, a trial in which a number of her fellow women rights activists have testified that they too were subjected to torture and sexual harassment while detained. The prosecutor overseeing the hearing, I learned from Loujain's brother, Walid al-Hathloul , is denying all allegations of torture. Her fourth hearing, which would have taken place April 17 -- the day she was named as TIME magazine's 100 most influential people of 2019 -- was abruptly adjourned. While Saudi media brand her as a traitor to the kingdom, and international media reduce her to a mere victim, her nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize for her groundbreaking work on human rights has been largely ignored. Concurrently, media continue to give far more airtime to the nomination of someone else who is far from deserving of the prize: US President Donald Trump. In an embarrassing gaffe that still pales in comparison to his multitude of indiscretions, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported Trump himself had asked Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to nominate him for the award, a claim Abe refused to deny . The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the Asahi report. Meanwhile the momentum for Loujain's nomination has come from multiple fronts: a recommendation in a New York Times op-ed by journalist Nicholas Kristof; from academics, such as the nomination by Bessma Momani in Canada; to written support from more than a dozen French scholars; to yet more nominations by politicians from Canadian MP H√©l√®ne Laverdi√®re to a group of MPs in Norway .

Saudi sisters who escaped oppression are now free 03:19 It is absurd that Trump's self-aggrandizing nomination is being given incessant attention, while someone whose peaceful and tireless work spanning many years for the advancement of all Saudi women remains locked behind bars. Loujain receiving the Nobel Peace Prize would send a strong message to the Crown Prince and his rogue gallery of miscreants: that despite their attempts to squander and squash the voice and spirit of a woman who dared to imagine a brighter future for Saudi women ‚Äî they will fail. Being named a TIME honoree has already shown that the international community has not only taken notice of her efforts, but are rightly lauding her accomplishments. Loujain would join the likes of previous winners such as Malala Yousafzai and Nadia Murad, women from imperialized nations who have overcome incredible adversity ‚Äî to only have their commitment to the liberation of women globally, strengthen. Loujain has suffered tremendously since her imprisonment almost a year ago, but she's deserving of the award for everything her efforts have accomplished: she's shown extraordinary resolve and bravery in ways that have galvanized women around the world. It wasn't too long after we had both graduated from UBC that Loujain returned to Saudi Arabia, and in her resolve to see women's rights advance there, she began to defy the driving ban and speak out against the male guardianship system. Shortly after her most recent arrest last year -- she had been arrested several times before that since 2014 ‚Äî the driving ban was overturned in June 2018. The Crown Prince reaped praise for the move, while our friend and other women actually responsible for the historic change were just beginning to undergo what has become their nightmare ordeal. While my sister is in a Saudi jail, Mariah Carey could use her voice to help her That's when Friends of Loujain sprang into action. We are a collective of Vancouver-based women who knew Loujain from our time together at UBC. In this last year, we've taken a number of actions to demand her release. We have been pleased to see growing international attention surrounding Loujain's case; without a doubt, her actions have inspired people globally. Meanwhile, even by Trump's own admission , there is hardly a popular movement behind his Nobel Peace nomination, while his approval rating as President remains low . Highlighting Loujain's conditions as a political prisoner is vital; however, the media ought to also showcase her peaceful activism over the years -- activism that ignited one of the biggest social reforms ever seen in the ultra-conservative absolute monarchy. As a Nobel Peace Prize nominee whose only delinquency has been to peacefully demand equal rights, only one outcome will deliver justice for Loujain: a full pardon that grants her immediate release.

"Multnomah County, Oregon, to pay $100K to employee who complained about 'Blue Lives Matter' flag",edition.cnn.com,Steve Almasy and Keith Allen,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/oregon-county-settles-blue-lives-matter-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) An African-American employee who claimed she was subject to stress and racial harassment after she complained about a coworker's ""Blue Lives Matter"" flag and after she put up an ""equity wall"" has settled her lawsuit with an Oregon county, her attorney said Friday.
As part of the $100,000 agreement, Karimah Guion-Pledgure resigned from her job with the Multnomah County Department of Community Justice, her attorney, Ashlee Albies, said in an email. Guion-Pledgure, who was a corrections technician until Friday, can reapply for other positions, Albies said. In a lawsuit filed in January 2019, Guion-Pledgure says she and other black coworkers initially complained when a probation officer hung a ""Blue Lives Matter"" flag in the workplace in 2017. Guion-Pledgure, who had been with the county since 2011, maintains that the Blue Lives Matter flag ""co-opts"" the Black Lives Matter movement's slogan, and ""repurposes it to shift focus to law enforcement ‚Äî a chosen profession, not a racial identity ‚Äî and thus denigrates, dilutes, and demeans the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement,"" according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. Read More Guion-Pledgure complained to supervisors in late 2017 and early 2018 and voiced her objections about the flag with the Multnomah County chief operating officer in April 2018, according to the complaint. In July 2018, Guion-Pledgure established an ""equity wall"" in the workplace, the lawsuit says. The equity wall also included photographs of people of color killed by police in the United States and photos of immigrant children separated from their parents at the border due to the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance policy,"" the suit said. A coworker complained the day after the wall was decorated, and management issued a directive that all personal photographs be no larger than 5-by-7 inches, according to the lawsuit. The same day management's directive was issued, Guion-Pledgure found sticky notes on her equity wall that said, ""Thanks a lot"" and ""Bitch,"" the suit said. Guion-Pledgure went on leave in July 2018 due to health issues she says were caused by those events, according to the complaint. She initially sought $20,000 in lost wages and $400,000 for emotional distress and suffering. The settlement will be filed with Multnomah County Circuit Court when Guion-Pledgure files a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which is also a term of the settlement, county spokeswoman Jessica Mokert-Shibley told CNN. Multnomah County officials are withholding further comment until those legal proceedings are complete, Mokert-Shibley said. ""This is expected to happen sometime next week."" Portland is the county seat of Multnomah County."

New York Times: Production issues at Boeing's South Carolina plant 'have threatened to compromise safety' - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/boeing-south-carolina-plant/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former and current employees at a Boeing plant in South Carolina that produces the company's 787 Dreamliner claim the factory is overrun by ""shoddy production and weak oversight that have threatened to compromise safety"" -- a revelation that surfaces as Boeing is under fire over a separate aircraft, the New York Times reported Saturday.
The paper said a review of ""hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records,"" as well as interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees of the North Charleston plant, revealed ""a culture that often valued production speed over quality."" According to the paper, plant employees described defective manufacturing, debris left on planes and pressure to not report violations across ""nearly a dozen whistle-blower claims and safety complaints"" filed with federal regulators. The report comes as the company is dealing with the aftermath of two deadly crashes of its 737 Max aircraft, which have drawn attention to the company's production and safety standards. The Times noted that ""there is no evidence"" that the issues raised in the plant -- which was celebrated as ""a state-of-the-art manufacturing hub"" when it opened in 2009 -- ""have led to any major safety incidents."" 9 countries and 3 US agencies to investigate initial 737 Max certification In a number of cases, the paper said a former quality manager at Boeing, John Barnett, ""discovered clusters of metal slivers hanging over the wiring that commands the flight controls."" Barnett told the Times that if those ""sharp"" slivers ""penetrated"" the wiring, the result could be ""catastrophic."" Barnett filed a whistle-blower complaint with regulators, according to the paper. ""As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,"" Barnett told the Times. ""And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy."" Read More In a statement sent to the plant's employees and provided to CNN Saturday, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times' report ""paints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant)."" Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said ""quality is the bedrock of who we are,"" adding that the plant delivers ""the highest quality airplanes."" Still, the Times reported other employees also claimed the plant faced serious quality issues, but said they faced performance penalties and harassment for raising concerns. Another former employee, Rich Mester, told the Times he also found problematic objects in planes produced at the plant. Mester, a former technician who reviewed planes before they left the plant and who the paper reports was fired, said he had found ""tubes of sealant, nuts, stuff from the build process"" during his time with the company. Debris found in planes ""has cost Boeing at other plants,"" including their Everett, Washington, plant, where the company built the KC-46 tanker for the Air Force, according to the Times. CNN reported earlier this month that the Air Force stopped accepting deliveries of the tanker and refueling aircraft after debris was found inside some of the planes. An Air Force official told CNN earlier this week that some already delivered planes will be sent back to the factory for another round of inspections, which will involve removing panels to conduct the inspections. In a statement to CNN, Lynn Lunsford, a spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, said ""Safety is the FAA's top priority. We thoroughly investigate whistleblower complaints and take action if the allegations are substantiated."" "

She explained to KIRO the complex process of turning a dead body into soil. ""(The) body is covered in natural materials, like straw or wood chips, and over the course of about three to seven weeks, thanks to microbial activity, it breaks down into soil,"" she said. While the dead body is being broken down, Spade said families of the deceased will be able to visit her facility and will ultimately receive the soil that remains of their loved. It is up to the family how they want to use that soil, Spade said. ""And if they don't want that soil, we'll partner with local conservation groups around the Puget Sound region so that that soil will be used to nourish the land here in the state,"" she said. The process was the focus of a new study at Washington State University, according to KIRO, in which six people donated their bodies for research. ""We proved recomposition was indeed safe and effective for humans as well,"" Spade said. The average burial, KIRO said, can cost between $8,000 and $25,000. Cremation can top $6,000. Spade said she hopes to charge about $5,500 for human composting. One supporter for human composting, Leslie Christian, told KIRO it's an attractive from an environmental perspective.

Rumored compromising tapes of Trump in Moscow investigated by Mueller - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,"Erica Orden, CNN",04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/mueller-report-donald-trump-controversial-tape-moscow/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller examined whether President Donald Trump learned during the 2016 presidential campaign of the rumored existence of compromising tapes made of him years earlier when he visited Moscow, according to a redacted version of Mueller's report .
According to a footnote in the special counsel's report, which was released Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, received a text from Russian businessman Giorgi Rtskhiladze in October 2016 that said: ""Stopped flow of tapes from Russia but not sure if there's anything else. Just so you know..."" Read and search the full Mueller report Rtskhiladze told Mueller that ""tapes"" referred to ""compromising tapes of Trump rumored to be held by persons associated with the Russian real estate conglomerate Crocus Group,"" which had helped host the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant, according to the report (the pageant was owned by Trump for years ). Cohen told the special counsel that he spoke to Trump about the issue after receiving Rtskhiladze's text. That episode occurred months before top intelligence officials, including former FBI Director James Comey, presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him that were contained in a dossier prepared by retired British spy Christopher Steele, which CNN has reported took place in January 2017. BuzzFeed News published the full, unverified dossier that included the infamous claim that Russian authorities had evidence of Trump watching prostitutes urinate in a hotel suite. Read More There is no indication that such a tape exists and Trump has vehemently denied it. Rtskhiladze also told prosecutors that he was told the tapes were fake, but that he didn't convey that to Cohen. Scott Balber, a lawyer for Crocus Group founder Aras Agalarov, said the allegation is ""total nonsense."" He added that Crocus Group does not have any compromising tapes. Cillizza: Takeaways on Mueller Report Day The footnote raises the matter in the context of explaining that Comey had briefed the President-elect in January 2017 on the dossier, including that ""the Russians had compromising tapes of the President involving conduct when he was a private citizen during a 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe Pageant."" Trump has criticized the 35-page dossier, calling it a political document paid for by Hillary Clinton. In October 2017, the law firm for Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee, Perkins Coie, acknowledged its clients' role in paying for opposition research on Trump that helped lead to the now-infamous dossier.

"Japan's Ainu bill finally recognizes its first inhabitants as ""indigenous"" - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Emiko Jozuka,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/asia/japan-ainu-indigenous-peoples-bill-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Growing up in Japan, musician Oki Kano never knew he was part of a ""vanishing people.""
His Japanese mother was divorced and never told Kano that his birth father was an indigenous Ainu man. Kano was 20 years old when he found out. For decades, researchers and conservative Japanese politicians described the Ainu as ""vanishing,"" says Jeffry Gayman, an Ainu peoples researcher at Hokkaido University. Gayman says there might actually be tens of thousands more people of Ainu descent who have gone uncounted -- due to discrimination, many Ainu chose to hide their background and assimilate years ago, leaving younger people in the dark about their heritage. A bill, which was passed on Friday, for the first time has officially recognized the Ainu of Hokkaido as an ""indigenous"" people of Japan. The bill also includes measures to make Japan a more inclusive society for the Ainu, strengthen their local economies and bring visibility to their culture. Read More Japanese land minister Keiichi Ishii told reporters Friday that it was important for the Ainu to maintain their ethnic dignity and pass on their culture to create a vibrant and diverse society. Yet some warn a new museum showcasing their culture risks turning the Ainu into a cultural exhibit and note the bill is missing one important thing -- an apology. 'Tree without roots' Kano grew up in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo, where he became fascinated with Jamaican reggae. Even without being aware of his ethnic identity, the political commentary underpinning the songs made an impression on him. ""Bob Marley sang that people who forget about their ancestors are the same as a tree without roots,"" says Kano, 62. ""I checked the lyrics as a teenager, though they became more meaningful to me as I matured."" After discovering his ethnic origins, Kano was determined to learn more. He traveled to northern Hokkaido to meet his father and immediately felt an affinity with the Ainu community there -- the ""Asahikawa,"" who are known for their anti-establishment stance. But his sense of belonging was short-lived -- some Ainu rejected Kano for having grown up outside of the community, saying he would never fully understand the suffering they had endured under Japanese rule. Ainu people occupying parts of the Japanese island of Hokkaido, Russian Kuril Islands and Sakhalin, in about 1950. Yuji Shimizu, an Ainu elder, says he faced open discrimination while growing up in Hokkaido. He says other children called him a dog and bullied him for looking different. Hoping to avoid prejudice, his parents never taught him traditional Ainu customs or even the language, says the 78-year-old former teacher. ""My mother told me to forget I was Ainu and become like the Japanese if I wanted to be successful,"" says Shimizu. Ainu Moshir (Land of the Ainu) The origins of the Ainu and their language remain unclear, though many theories exist . They were early residents of northern Japan, in what is now the Hokkaido prefecture, and the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin, off the east coast of Russia. They revered bears and wolves, and worshiped gods embodied in the natural elements like water, fire and wind. In the 15th century, the Japanese moved into territories held by various Ainu groups to trade. But conflicts soon erupted, with many battles fought between 1457 and 1789 . After the 1789 Battle of Kunasiri-Menasi, the Japanese conquered the Ainu. Japan's modernization in the mid-1800s was accompanied a growing sense of nationalism and, in 1899, the government sought to assimilate the Ainu by introducing the Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act . A family of Ainu gives a meal to a Western man in a sketch. The act implemented Japan's compulsory national education system in Hokkaido and eliminated traditional systems of Ainu land rights and claims. Over time, the Ainu were forced to give up their land and adopt Japanese customs through a series of government initiatives. Today, there are only two native Ainu speakers worldwide , according to the Endangered Languages Project, a organization of indigenous groups and researchers aimed at protecting endangered languages. High levels of poverty and unemployment currently hinder the Ainu's social progress. The percentage of Ainu who attend high school and university is far lower than the Hokkaido average. The Ainu population also appears to have shrunk. Official figures put the number of Ainu in Hokkaido at 17,000 in 2013, accounting for around 2% of the prefecture's population. In 2017, the latest year on record, there were only about 13,000. However, Gayman, the Ainu researcher, says that the number of Ainu could be up to ten times higher than official surveys suggest, because many have chosen not to identify as Ainu and others have forgotten -- or never known -- their origins. Finding music Feeling neither Ainu nor Japanese, Kano left Japan in the late 1980s for New York. While living there, he befriended several Native Americans at a time when indigenous peoples were putting pressure on governments globally to recognize their rights. He credits them with awakening his political conscience as a member of the Ainu. ""I knew I had to reconnect with my Ainu heritage,"" he says. Kano made his way back to Japan and, in 1993, discovered a five-stringed instrument called the ""tonkori,"" once considered a a symbol of Ainu culture. ""I made a few songs with the tonkori and thought I had talent,"" he says, despite never having formally studied music. But finding a tonkori master to teach him was hard after years of cultural erasure. So he used old cassette tapes of Ainu music as a reference. ""It was like when you copy Jimi Hendrix while learning how to play the guitar,"" he says. His persistence paid off. In 2005, Kano created the Oki Dub Ainu group, which fuses Ainu influence with reggae, electronica and folk undertones. He also created his own record label to introduce Ainu music to the world. Since then, Kano has performed in Australia and toured Europe. He has also taken part in the United Nation's Working Group on Indigenous Populations to voice Ainu concerns. New law, new future? Mark John Winchester, a Japan-based indigenous rights expert, calls the new bill a ""small step forward"" in terms of indigenous recognition and anti-discrimination, but says it falls short of truly empowering the Ainu people. ""Self-determination, which should be the central pillar of indigenous policy-making, is not reflected in the law,"" says Winchester. UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) The United Nations adopted UNDRIP on September 13, 2007, to enshrine the rights that ""constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world.""
The UNDRIP protects collective rights that may not feature in other human rights charters. It emphasizes individual rights, and also safeguards the individual rights of Indigenous people.
Winchester and Gayman also say the government failed to consult all Ainu groups when drafting the bill. For the Ainu elder Shimizu, the new bill is missing an important part: atonement. ""Why doesn't the government apologize? If the Japanese recognized what they did in the past, I think we could move forward,"" says Shimizu. ""The Japanese forcibly colonized us and annihilated our culture. Without even admitting to this, they want to turn us into a museum exhibit,"" Shimizu adds, referring to the 2019 bill's provision to open an Ainu culture museum in Hokkaido. Other Ainu say the museum will create jobs. Japanese Indigenous Ainu men participate in a traditional ritual called Kamuinomi, held as part of the 2008 Indigenous Peoples Summit. Both Shimizu and Kano say the new law grants too much power to Japan's central government, which requires Ainu groups to seek its approval for state-sponsored cultural projects. Furthermore, they say the bill should do more to promote education. Currently, Ainu youth are eligible for scholarships and grants to study their own language and culture at a few select private universities. But Kano says government funding should extend beyond supporting Ainu heritage, to support the Ainu people. ""We need more Ainu to enter higher education and become Ainu lawyers, film directors and professors,"" he says. ""If that doesn't happen, the Japanese will always control our culture."""

"Multnomah County, Oregon, to pay $100K to employee who complained about 'Blue Lives Matter' flag",us.cnn.com,Steve Almasy and Keith Allen,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/oregon-county-settles-blue-lives-matter-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) An African-American employee who claimed she was subject to stress and racial harassment after she complained about a coworker's ""Blue Lives Matter"" flag and after she put up an ""equity wall"" has settled her lawsuit with an Oregon county, her attorney said Friday.
As part of the $100,000 agreement, Karimah Guion-Pledgure resigned from her job with the Multnomah County Department of Community Justice, her attorney, Ashlee Albies, said in an email. Guion-Pledgure, who was a corrections technician until Friday, can reapply for other positions, Albies said. In a lawsuit filed in January 2019, Guion-Pledgure says she and other black coworkers initially complained when a probation officer hung a ""Blue Lives Matter"" flag in the workplace in 2017. Guion-Pledgure, who had been with the county since 2011, maintains that the Blue Lives Matter flag ""co-opts"" the Black Lives Matter movement's slogan, and ""repurposes it to shift focus to law enforcement ‚Äî a chosen profession, not a racial identity ‚Äî and thus denigrates, dilutes, and demeans the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement,"" according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. Read More Guion-Pledgure complained to supervisors in late 2017 and early 2018 and voiced her objections about the flag with the Multnomah County chief operating officer in April 2018, according to the complaint. In July 2018, Guion-Pledgure established an ""equity wall"" in the workplace, the lawsuit says. The equity wall also included photographs of people of color killed by police in the United States and photos of immigrant children separated from their parents at the border due to the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance policy,"" the suit said. A coworker complained the day after the wall was decorated, and management issued a directive that all personal photographs be no larger than 5-by-7 inches, according to the lawsuit. The same day management's directive was issued, Guion-Pledgure found sticky notes on her equity wall that said, ""Thanks a lot"" and ""Bitch,"" the suit said. Guion-Pledgure went on leave in July 2018 due to health issues she says were caused by those events, according to the complaint. She initially sought $20,000 in lost wages and $400,000 for emotional distress and suffering. The settlement will be filed with Multnomah County Circuit Court when Guion-Pledgure files a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which is also a term of the settlement, county spokeswoman Jessica Mokert-Shibley told CNN. Multnomah County officials are withholding further comment until those legal proceedings are complete, Mokert-Shibley said. ""This is expected to happen sometime next week."" Portland is the county seat of Multnomah County."

""And if they don't want that soil, we'll partner with local conservation groups around the Puget Sound region so that that soil will be used to nourish the land here in the state,"" she said. The process was the focus of a new study at Washington State University, according to KIRO, in which six people donated their bodies for research. ""We proved recomposition was indeed safe and effective for humans as well,"" Spade said. The average burial, KIRO said, can cost between $8,000 and $25,000. Cremation can top $6,000. Spade said she hopes to charge about $5,500 for human composting. One supporter for human composting, Leslie Christian, told KIRO it's an attractive from an environmental perspective. She said she told her brother, who reportedly said, ""Oh great, you can plant tomatoes in me."""
Kabul attack: 7 slain as all attackers are also killed at Afghan communications ministry - CNN,us.cnn.com,"Ehsan Popalzai, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/middleeast/kabul-attack-telecommunications-ministry/index.html,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) An hourslong siege on the Afghan communications ministry in Kabul ended Saturday after security forces killed all five attackers, authorities said.
Four civilians and three police officers were slain in the incident, Kabul police spokesman Basir Mojahid said. Eight others were wounded in the assault. The attack began when a suicide bomber detonated explosives just outside the communications ministry, Mojahid said. Four other assailants then entered the ministry, the police spokesman said.

"Japan's Ainu bill finally recognizes its first inhabitants as ""indigenous"" - CNN",us.cnn.com,Emiko Jozuka,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/asia/japan-ainu-indigenous-peoples-bill-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Growing up in Japan, musician Oki Kano never knew he was part of a ""vanishing people.""
His Japanese mother was divorced and never told Kano that his birth father was an indigenous Ainu man. Kano was 20 years old when he found out. For decades, researchers and conservative Japanese politicians described the Ainu as ""vanishing,"" says Jeffry Gayman, an Ainu peoples researcher at Hokkaido University. Gayman says there might actually be tens of thousands more people of Ainu descent who have gone uncounted -- due to discrimination, many Ainu chose to hide their background and assimilate years ago, leaving younger people in the dark about their heritage. A bill, which was passed on Friday, for the first time has officially recognized the Ainu of Hokkaido as an ""indigenous"" people of Japan. The bill also includes measures to make Japan a more inclusive society for the Ainu, strengthen their local economies and bring visibility to their culture. Read More Japanese land minister Keiichi Ishii told reporters Friday that it was important for the Ainu to maintain their ethnic dignity and pass on their culture to create a vibrant and diverse society. Yet some warn a new museum showcasing their culture risks turning the Ainu into a cultural exhibit and note the bill is missing one important thing -- an apology. 'Tree without roots' Kano grew up in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo, where he became fascinated with Jamaican reggae. Even without being aware of his ethnic identity, the political commentary underpinning the songs made an impression on him. ""Bob Marley sang that people who forget about their ancestors are the same as a tree without roots,"" says Kano, 62. ""I checked the lyrics as a teenager, though they became more meaningful to me as I matured."" After discovering his ethnic origins, Kano was determined to learn more. He traveled to northern Hokkaido to meet his father and immediately felt an affinity with the Ainu community there -- the ""Asahikawa,"" who are known for their anti-establishment stance. But his sense of belonging was short-lived -- some Ainu rejected Kano for having grown up outside of the community, saying he would never fully understand the suffering they had endured under Japanese rule. Ainu people occupying parts of the Japanese island of Hokkaido, Russian Kuril Islands and Sakhalin, in about 1950. Yuji Shimizu, an Ainu elder, says he faced open discrimination while growing up in Hokkaido. He says other children called him a dog and bullied him for looking different. Hoping to avoid prejudice, his parents never taught him traditional Ainu customs or even the language, says the 78-year-old former teacher. ""My mother told me to forget I was Ainu and become like the Japanese if I wanted to be successful,"" says Shimizu. Ainu Moshir (Land of the Ainu) The origins of the Ainu and their language remain unclear, though many theories exist . They were early residents of northern Japan, in what is now the Hokkaido prefecture, and the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin, off the east coast of Russia. They revered bears and wolves, and worshiped gods embodied in the natural elements like water, fire and wind. In the 15th century, the Japanese moved into territories held by various Ainu groups to trade. But conflicts soon erupted, with many battles fought between 1457 and 1789 . After the 1789 Battle of Kunasiri-Menasi, the Japanese conquered the Ainu. Japan's modernization in the mid-1800s was accompanied a growing sense of nationalism and, in 1899, the government sought to assimilate the Ainu by introducing the Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act . A family of Ainu gives a meal to a Western man in a sketch. The act implemented Japan's compulsory national education system in Hokkaido and eliminated traditional systems of Ainu land rights and claims. Over time, the Ainu were forced to give up their land and adopt Japanese customs through a series of government initiatives. Today, there are only two native Ainu speakers worldwide , according to the Endangered Languages Project, a organization of indigenous groups and researchers aimed at protecting endangered languages. High levels of poverty and unemployment currently hinder the Ainu's social progress. The percentage of Ainu who attend high school and university is far lower than the Hokkaido average. The Ainu population also appears to have shrunk. Official figures put the number of Ainu in Hokkaido at 17,000 in 2013, accounting for around 2% of the prefecture's population. In 2017, the latest year on record, there were only about 13,000. However, Gayman, the Ainu researcher, says that the number of Ainu could be up to ten times higher than official surveys suggest, because many have chosen not to identify as Ainu and others have forgotten -- or never known -- their origins. Finding music Feeling neither Ainu nor Japanese, Kano left Japan in the late 1980s for New York. While living there, he befriended several Native Americans at a time when indigenous peoples were putting pressure on governments globally to recognize their rights. He credits them with awakening his political conscience as a member of the Ainu. ""I knew I had to reconnect with my Ainu heritage,"" he says. Kano made his way back to Japan and, in 1993, discovered a five-stringed instrument called the ""tonkori,"" once considered a a symbol of Ainu culture. ""I made a few songs with the tonkori and thought I had talent,"" he says, despite never having formally studied music. But finding a tonkori master to teach him was hard after years of cultural erasure. So he used old cassette tapes of Ainu music as a reference. ""It was like when you copy Jimi Hendrix while learning how to play the guitar,"" he says. His persistence paid off. In 2005, Kano created the Oki Dub Ainu group, which fuses Ainu influence with reggae, electronica and folk undertones. He also created his own record label to introduce Ainu music to the world. Since then, Kano has performed in Australia and toured Europe. He has also taken part in the United Nation's Working Group on Indigenous Populations to voice Ainu concerns. New law, new future? Mark John Winchester, a Japan-based indigenous rights expert, calls the new bill a ""small step forward"" in terms of indigenous recognition and anti-discrimination, but says it falls short of truly empowering the Ainu people. ""Self-determination, which should be the central pillar of indigenous policy-making, is not reflected in the law,"" says Winchester. UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) The United Nations adopted UNDRIP on September 13, 2007, to enshrine the rights that ""constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world.""
The UNDRIP protects collective rights that may not feature in other human rights charters. It emphasizes individual rights, and also safeguards the individual rights of Indigenous people.
Winchester and Gayman also say the government failed to consult all Ainu groups when drafting the bill. For the Ainu elder Shimizu, the new bill is missing an important part: atonement. ""Why doesn't the government apologize? If the Japanese recognized what they did in the past, I think we could move forward,"" says Shimizu. ""The Japanese forcibly colonized us and annihilated our culture. Without even admitting to this, they want to turn us into a museum exhibit,"" Shimizu adds, referring to the 2019 bill's provision to open an Ainu culture museum in Hokkaido. Other Ainu say the museum will create jobs. Japanese Indigenous Ainu men participate in a traditional ritual called Kamuinomi, held as part of the 2008 Indigenous Peoples Summit. Both Shimizu and Kano say the new law grants too much power to Japan's central government, which requires Ainu groups to seek its approval for state-sponsored cultural projects. Furthermore, they say the bill should do more to promote education. Currently, Ainu youth are eligible for scholarships and grants to study their own language and culture at a few select private universities. But Kano says government funding should extend beyond supporting Ainu heritage, to support the Ainu people. ""We need more Ainu to enter higher education and become Ainu lawyers, film directors and professors,"" he says. ""If that doesn't happen, the Japanese will always control our culture."""

New York Times: Production issues at Boeing's South Carolina plant 'have threatened to compromise safety' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/boeing-south-carolina-plant/index.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter,"Washington (CNN) Former and current employees at a Boeing plant in South Carolina that produces the company's 787 Dreamliner claim the factory is overrun by ""shoddy production and weak oversight that have threatened to compromise safety"" -- a revelation that surfaces as Boeing is under fire over a separate aircraft, the New York Times reported Saturday.
The paper said a review of ""hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records,"" as well as interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees of the North Charleston plant, revealed ""a culture that often valued production speed over quality."" According to the paper, plant employees described defective manufacturing, debris left on planes and pressure to not report violations across ""nearly a dozen whistle-blower claims and safety complaints"" filed with federal regulators. The report comes as the company is dealing with the aftermath of two deadly crashes of its 737 Max aircraft, which have drawn attention to the company's production and safety standards. The Times noted that ""there is no evidence"" that the issues raised in the plant -- which was celebrated as ""a state-of-the-art manufacturing hub"" when it opened in 2009 -- ""have led to any major safety incidents."" 9 countries and 3 US agencies to investigate initial 737 Max certification In a number of cases, the paper said a former quality manager at Boeing, John Barnett, ""discovered clusters of metal slivers hanging over the wiring that commands the flight controls."" Barnett told the Times that if those ""sharp"" slivers ""penetrated"" the wiring, the result could be ""catastrophic."" Barnett filed a whistle-blower complaint with regulators, according to the paper. ""As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,"" Barnett told the Times. ""And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy."" Read More In a statement sent to the plant's employees and provided to CNN Saturday, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times' report ""paints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant)."" Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said ""quality is the bedrock of who we are,"" adding that the plant delivers ""the highest quality airplanes."" Still, the Times reported other employees also claimed the plant faced serious quality issues, but said they faced performance penalties and harassment for raising concerns. Another former employee, Rich Mester, told the Times he also found problematic objects in planes produced at the plant. Mester, a former technician who reviewed planes before they left the plant and who the paper reports was fired, said he had found ""tubes of sealant, nuts, stuff from the build process"" during his time with the company. Debris found in planes ""has cost Boeing at other plants,"" including their Everett, Washington, plant, where the company built the KC-46 tanker for the Air Force, according to the Times. CNN reported earlier this month that the Air Force stopped accepting deliveries of the tanker and refueling aircraft after debris was found inside some of the planes.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is planning to visit Kentucky soon despite being uninvited by one of the state's Republican members of Congress.
Corbin Trent, a spokeswoman for the New York congresswoman, told CNN on Friday that they've been invited by other Kentuckians and that plans are in the works for a visit to the Bluegrass State on their own, though the exact timing is unclear. ""Luckily, we still have open borders with Kentucky, we are free to travel there,"" Trent said. ""We hope to visit and have a town hall, listen to concerns of workers in Kentucky."" In a spirited House Financial Services Committee hearing last month, Rep. Andy Barr, R-Kentucky, invited Ocasio-Cortez to his home state to see the impact her Green New Deal proposal would have on coal miners.

""I invite her to go underground with me and meet the men and women who do heroic work to power the American economy."" Read More Ocasio-Cortez was quick to take him up on the offer.

How Republicans are using Ilhan Omar for political gain Last week, however, Barr appeared to rescind his invitation, calling on Ocasio-Cortez to apologize to fellow GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas before any potential Kentucky trip. Crenshaw was one of the first high-profile Republicans to draw attention to a comment by one of Ocasio-Cortez's closes allies in Congress -- Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar -- about the 9/11 attacks, which some found offensive . Crenshaw called Omar's comment ""unbelievable"" on Twitter and accused her of minimizing the tragedy, a tweet that further inflamed the conservative backlash against Omar that was already brewing. Defending Omar, Ocasio-Cortez blasted Crenshaw for refusing to co-sponsor the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund and called on him to ""do something"" about domestic terrorism. That, in turn, prompted outrage from critics who pointed out that Crenshaw is a former NAVY seal who served three tours in Afghanistan and lost his eye from an improvised explosive device while fighting terrorism. Barr, in a letter delivered to Ocasio-Cortez and posted on Twitter, called on the congresswoman to apologize first ""prior to coming to visit Kentucky,"" saying her comment demonstrated a ""lack of civility."" Ocasio-Cortez hasn't apologized and her office said she does not intend to do so. ""We definitely think there is an apology in order, but we think it is from Crenshaw to Congresswoman Omar,"" said Trent, Ocasio-Cortez's spokesman. The congresswoman says the move was a sign that Republicans were having second thoughts about Ocasio-Cortez coming to Kentucky. ""GOP's getting scared that up close, their constituents will realize I'm fighting harder for their health care than their own Reps,"" she tweeted. She also tweeted this week that she invited Barr to a town hall she did with MSNBC in New York at the end of March, but that he declined, saying the University of Kentucky had a game that night. A spokesperson for Barr did not respond to a request for comment. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who represents Kentucky, was asked about the sparring in a news conference on Thursday.

""Of course, it did not go well in the Champions League, but there is next year."" The victory puts Juventus an insurmountable 20 points ahead of nearest rivals Napoli, wrapping up the league title with five games to spare. Juve now boast 35 Scudettos, far ahead of closest challengers AC Milan who have 18. Cristiano Ronaldo is the first player to win Serie A, La Liga and the Premier League. The club's recent dominance of Serie A began in the 2011-12 season when they won their first title since being stripped of two between 2004-2006 for match fixing."
Powerful storms kill 4 as they barrel through the Deep South - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Christina Maxouris and Chandrika Narayan,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/severe-storms-tornado-threats-friday-wxc/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_us+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+U.S.%29,"(CNN) At least four people, including an 8-year-old girl, have died as severe thunderstorms continue to march across the South and then veer north, spawning tornadoes, knocking down power lines and causing roads to flood.
The 8-year-old was killed Friday when a tree fell through a home in Woodville, just south of Tallahassee, the Leon County Sheriff's office said in a release. A 12-year-old boy was injured. At least three other people have been killed in the massive thunderstorms that pounded parts of Mississippi and Alabama on Thursday. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch for parts of the mid-Atlantic, including Washington, until midnight. There were more than 250 wind reports and 11 tornado reports Friday from Florida to Virginia, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. That makes 38 tornado reports and nearly 500 wind reports from the Texas panhandle to the East Coast over a three-day period. Read More There were no active tornado warnings Friday night, Ward said. About 180,000 customers are without power in the Southeast, according to poweroutage.us , the bulk of those in Florida and South Carolina.

‚Äî National Weather Service (@NWS) April 19, 2019 The nasty weather is slated to linger over the weekend. Severe thunderstorms capable of widespread damaging winds and a few tornadoes will shift across the mid-Atlantic and Southeast states Friday, the weather service said. A tornado touched down in Franklin County, Virginia, injuring at least two people, destroying two homes and severely damaging other buildings, the Franklin County Sheriff's Office told CNN. Heavy rainfall and a risk of flash flooding is also present as tropic moisture streams north along the East Coast, according to the weather service. The highest threat exists from the Carolinas into New England, it said. More than 130 instances of severe weather were reported Thursday in the Southeast, including 10 tornado reports in Mississippi. Rains flooded neighborhoods in the state as strong winds uprooted trees and left branches scattered across major roads. Storms turn deadly in Mississippi and Alabama The storm left at least two people dead in Mississippi, a state still reeling from last weekend's tornadoes. Kenderick Magee, 24, was killed when his car crashed during severe weather in Amite County on Thursday, CNN affiliate WLBT reported. A second unidentified driver was killed the same day when his car hit a tree in in Neshoba County, according to the affiliate. The sheriff told local media that a tree fell on the car . The Jackson Zoo will be closed due to damage caused by the weather, WLBT reported . In neighboring Alabama, one person died after a tree fell on a home, emergency management director Patrice Kurzejeski told CNN. The Alabama Emergency Management Agency reported that more than 61,000 people were without power late Thursday night. Parts of southeast Alabama have been placed under flood warnings after heavy rains caused ""significant"" rises along the Tombigbee River. Near Demopolis Lock and Dam, the river reached 69.1 feet -- while the flood stage (after which flooding is possible) is at 68 feet. Storm damage in Aliceville...

The pig farmer who became an internet sensation in China - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Julie Zaugg, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/asia/live-streaming-china-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""I don't want to be in this relationship anymore!""
""Why? Give me another chance!"" ""I don't like your haircut."" This tense exchange is taking place on a country lane bordered by chili fields in rural Guangxi, a southern province in China. Wu Nengji, a broad shouldered young man sporting an abundant shock of black hair, is arguing with his ex-girlfriend, an attractive girl wearing tall black boots, and her new boyfriend, whose hair is styled in an improbable bouffant. Read More It is the opening scene for Wu's latest mini-movie, lasting less than one minute. The 24-year-old videographer publishes his films on the Chinese streaming platform Kuaishou under the nickname Xiao Jiji, which means ""Little Lucky"" in mandarin. Wu Nengji shoots a scene for his video. He uses one smartphone and never does more than two takes. ""I don't really have a message to convey,"" he says. ""I just want to make people smile after a long day at work."" Once a hobby, Wu makes a living from his videos, earning between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan ($1,475 to $2,950) per month, about three to six times as much as a Chinese factory worker. All his revenue comes from his fans. They send him virtual gifts -- a sticker of a rose or a beer worth 1 or 2 yuan, for example -- which he can convert into real money. His story is far from unique. ""Some streamers barely earn a living and others have become billionaires,"" details Jian Xu, a communication specialist from Deakin University, in Australia. ""In northeast China, which has been badly hit by industrial decline, whole regions have been revitalized thanks to this new source of revenue."" Liu Mama, a northern granny whose feisty raps and regional dishes have become cult, is said to earn 1 million yuan ( $147,000 ) per month. China's streaming sensation In China, the streaming of short videos has become a massive industry. The first platforms, YY and Six Rooms, appeared in around 2008. They were soon joined by a host of competitors, such as Meipai, Huajiao, Yizhibo and Douyin. By the end of 2018, 648 million Chinese netizens regularly watched short videos, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC). The market for these was worth 11.8 billion yuan ($17.4 million), up 106% from the previous year. Most of these videos have showcased pretty young girls with pale skin and long eyelashes lip-synching to popular songs in studios made up to look like bedrooms. Cameroon bride and Chinese husband find fame online in China But in recent years, a few streaming platforms have popped up showing a grittier side of China. They host videos by people living in rural areas or in third- and fourth-tier cities. Many are based in the rust belt areas of the northeast. Kuaishou, which was created in 2011 and has 266 million monthly active users, is one of these. ""Young people living in cities like the videos on Kuaishou because they seem exotic to them, whereas migrant workers watch them out of a sense of nostalgia for the rural life they have had to leave behind,"" explains Zhicong Lu, a researcher from Toronto University who has studied the company. Millions of followers Wu Nengji started publishing videos on Kuaishou three years ago. He had just returned from Beijing, where he had spent several years working in dead-end jobs. ""I tried everything: waiting on tables, delivering food, but I just couldn't make enough money to live,"" he explains. Back in Hepu, the village he grew up in, he didn't know what to do with himself. So he decided to broadcast his everyday life. Since then he has produced more than 2,000 videos and has amassed 5.6 million followers. ""I use a single smartphone to shoot all my videos,"" he says. ""I only do one or two takes for each scene."" He uses the small alleys and fields surrounding his father's pig farm as a setting, embellished with an eclectic mix of accessories: a pink motorcycle helmet, a silver-haired wig and a plastic tiara. Some of his creations are poetic, showcasing his life on the farm and his troubles finding a girlfriend. Others are absurdist vignettes of him and his friends executing random dance moves to trashy techno music. Kuaishou is full of peasants plucking rice, fishers trying to catch eels and grannies cooking traditional recipes. ""Some farmers use these videos to promote and sell their produce directly to customers,"" says Jun Wen Woo, a video streaming expert for IHS Markit, an intelligence firm with expertise on China. Wu Nengji poses on the rural pig farm from where he streams mini movies across China. But it also has its own colorful universe. Kuaishou is where social shake, a collective street dance, was born. It is also the home of mic-shouting, a strange art form somewhere between a rap and rant. And it is full of unconventional characters who appeal to viewers' more voyeuristic instincts, such as a trio of sisters with brittle bone disease, a couple with dwarfism or a young girl who swallows live goldfish. Some content also rubs up against state censorship. During the winter of 2017, when the Beijing authorities started clearing out migrant workers living in tenement style housing, Kuaishou was the only platform to document the evictions. This didn't last long. In 2018, the site was asked to remove any videos deemed ""immoral,"" including a popular series about teen moms. Gone were the tattoos, swear words and sexual innuendo. ""Kuaishou had to hire hundreds of in-house censors to monitor all of its content,"" adds Zhicong Lu. But while tattoos and curse words have disappeared from the platform, Chinese netizens are quite crafty at finding ways to avoid censorship. Shooting a video It's mid-afternoon and a small group of twenty-somethings has started to congregate in front of Wu's farm. Some have their own streaming channel and are hoping to film a few scenes, others have just come to help out as extras. ""Most of them are childhood friends,"" says the videographer. Wearing black sweatpants, a blue hoodie and plastic slippers, Wu doesn't look anything like an internet star -- but here he's clearly in charge. He gets everyone to shuffle into a dusty shed where they start debating ideas for the next scene of his video. Everyone pitches in with a comment, a joke or a criticism. The air is thick with cigarette smoke and laughter. ""We often find a concept for the first five seconds of the video and immediately shoot it,"" he explains. ""We only sit down to discuss the overall concept afterwards."" To edit his videos, Wu Nengji uses a old computer with a screen that has no stand and is propped up against a chair. They settle on an idea: since Wu's girlfriend doesn't like his haircut, he will change it. Two of his friends grab a can of hairspray and start creating an intricate bouffant on the top of his head. The rest of the video shows him rejecting his enamored ex-girlfriend's pleas and parading around the farm with two friends. In three months, the video was viewed 7.7 million times, had 291,000 likes and generated more than 15,000 comments. ""At first, my parents were very critical,"" says Wu. They wanted me to get a job in a factory and send money back home. But when they saw how much I enjoyed making videos and that I could make a living from this, they changed their minds."" The sun is about to set. It is time for Wu Nengji to feed the pigs. He picks up a can of feed, mixes it with water and starts pouring it with a ladle into the trough. A bit later, he will sit down in front of his aged computer, which is covered in dust with a keyboard missing several keys, and edit his video. It will be live by tonight."
"Crystal Lake missing boy: Police focus on home, believing he neither walked away nor was abducted - CNN",www.cnn.com,Deanna Hackney,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/missing-illinois-boy/index.html,"(CNN) Police looking for a 5-year-old Illinois boy reported missing from his home say they're putting special focus on the residence after determining it's likely he neither was abducted nor walked away.
The boy's parents reported Andrew ""AJ"" Freund missing Thursday morning, telling police they last saw him around 9 p.m. the evening before, at bedtime, according to a release by the Crystal Lake Police Department. The search has included 15 police agencies, drones, and rescue canine units. Sonar teams that searched Crystal Lake located nothing, and the canine teams ""only picked up Andrew's 'scent' within the residence indicating that Andrew had not walked away on foot,"" the police said. ""(T)here is no indication that would lead police to believe that an abduction had taken place,"" the department said in the release. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has ""been involved with the family"" since Andrew's birth, department spokesman Jassen Strokosch told CNN. Andrew ""was brought into care with us"" soon after he was born, when ""neglect was indicated on part of the mom,"" Strokosch said. From 2013 to 2015, the infant was ""in care with someone else,"" he said. Read More The department was called in twice in 2018 on allegations of neglect in March and of abuse and neglect in December, Strokosch said. The allegations were determined to be unfounded in both instances, he said. A younger sibling who had been in the home until this week is now living with another family, Strokosch said. JoAnn Cunningham, Andrew's mother, ""doesn't know what happened to AJ, and had nothing to do with the disappearance of AJ,"" her attorney, George Kililis, told reporters, CNN affiliate WLS reported . ""Ms. Cunningham is worried sick. She is devastated."" ""AJ, please come home,"" his father, Andrew Freund Sr., said to television cameras. ""We love you very much. You're not in any trouble. We're just worried to death. Please, please come home."" Crystal Lake police issued a press release with Andrew's description Thursday but didn't issue an AMBER alert ""due to law enforcement being unable to confirm an abduction occurred,"" the department said. Police said about 373 acres were searched on foot, and almost 500 acres were searched by drones. A sonar team searched under docks and piers along all of Crystal Lake and in the lake close to the main beach area, a release said. Police ""are continuing to actively investigate,"" the department said Friday. "
Social media influencer plotted to take internet domain at gunpoint. It didn't end well,edition.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/iowa-social-media-influencer-domain-name-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The plan was like a bad movie script -- complete with an attacker in a puzzling outfit and a backup weapon.
The intruder entered a victim's home in Iowa carrying a cell phone, a stolen gun and a Taser. On his head was pantyhose and a hat, along with dark sunglasses to mask his eyes, court documents show. But things did not go as planned. Now, Rossi Lorathio Adams II could face two decades in prison. A jury found him guilty Thursday of hiring the intruder to break into the house in Cedar Rapids in 2017 to force the transfer of an internet domain at gunpoint, according to the US Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Iowa. Threats and gun emojis Read More Adams, 26, founded a social media company called ""State Snaps"" four years ago. The company operates on various social media platforms, including Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter, court documents said. ""At one time, Adams had over a million followers on his social media sites, which mostly contained images and videos of young adults engaged in crude behavior, drunkenness and nudity,"" court documents said. His followers often used the slogan ""Do it for state"" when posting videos and images. So, Adams tried to purchase the internet domain ""doitforstate.com"" from a Cedar Rapids resident who owned it, court records said. But the owner did not want to part with it. ""Between 2015 and 2017, Adams repeatedly tried to obtain 'doitforstate.com,' but the owner of the domain would not sell it. Adams also threatened one of the domain owner's friends with gun emojis after the friend used the domain to promote concerts,"" court records show. Then he had an idea: Why not take it by force? Cousin sentenced to 20 years In June 2017, Adams enlisted his cousin to break into the domain owner's home and force him to transfer it. The cousin drove to the domain owner's house and provided a demand note, which contained instructions for transferring the domain to Adams, court records show. After entering the home, the intruder grabbed the victim's arm and ordered him to connect his computer to the internet. He put the firearm against the victim's head and ordered him to follow the instructions. ""Fearing for his life, the victim quickly turned to move the gun away from his head. The victim then managed to gain control of the gun,"" court records show. The victim shot the intruder multiple times and called the police. The intruder, Adams' cousin Sherman Hopkins Jr., was sentenced to 20 years in prison last year. Now it's Adams' turn. He will remain in custody pending sentencing. He faces a maximum 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. Follow @faithmkarimi"
Jussie Smollett's lawyers file a motion opposing special prosecutor review of dismissal of charges - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/jussie-smollett-investigation-petition/index.html,"(CNN) Lawyers for actor Jussie Smollett filed a motion Thursday opposing the appointment of a special prosecutor to review the dismissal of charges against him.
Retired Illinois Appellate Justice Sheila O'Brien filed a petition on April 5 requesting a special prosecutor be appointed to review Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx's decision to dismiss charges against Smollett, whom investigators said staged an attack against himself. Smollett's lawyers argue in the motion that a review by a special prosecutor is only allowed when there is a pending case. They also said a review by a special prosecutor would be redundant as the Cook County Inspector General has already announced an investigation into how the office handled the case. The Inspector General's investigation is being conducted at Foxx's invitation. Read More Top Chicago prosecutor asks for 'independent review' into handling of Jussie Smollett case ""Ensuring that I and my office have the community's trust and confidence is paramount to me, which is why I invited an independent review of this matter,"" Foxx said in a statement provided to CNN. ""I welcome this investigation and pledge my full cooperation and the cooperation of my office as IG Blanchard conducts his review."" Chicago's police union has called on Foxx to resign, arguing she failed to follow through on charges that used significant police resources. ""I think we have to ask ourselves what is this really about? I've been asking myself for the last two weeks, 'What is this really about?'"" Foxx said in response to the calls for her resignation. ""I will tell you this is personal, it's personal."""
Sri Lanka explosions rock three churches and two hotels - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Sugam Pokharel,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/asia/sri-lanka-explosions/index.html,"(CNN) The calm of Easter Sunday was shattered by gruesome bombings that killed at least 250 people in Sri Lankan churches and hotels.
Though it's not clear who's behind the eight explosions that forced the country of 21 million people to go on lockdown, they are ""certainly acts of terror,"" said Manisha Gunasekera, high commissioner of Sri Lanka to the UK. An intelligence memo warning of a possible attack had circulated 10 days earlier, raising questions about whether more preventative measures could have been taken. ""Serious action need to be taken as to why this warning was ignored,"" Sri Lanka's Minister of Telecommunications, Harin Fernando, tweeted along with a photo of the memo. The document, titled ""Information of an alleged plan attack,"" is dated April 11 and signed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Priyalal Dissanayake. The explosions blew out the tiled roofs of churches and hotel windows, killing worshippers and hotel guests in the process. Read More Images and footage showed bloodied pews, broken glass, and plumes of smoke. ""You can see pieces of flesh thrown all over the walls and on the sanctuary and even outside of the church,"" Father Edmond Tillekeratne, social communications director for the Archdiocese of Colombo, told CNN from St. Sebastian's Church, one of the explosion sites. He estimated that more than a thousand people had come to the church for Easter Sunday ""because it is a special day."" Many came from villages afar, he said.

The violence punctured a decade of relative peace in the country following the end of its civil war in 2009 -- where attacks were common during the 25-year struggle. Since then, Sri Lanka has turned itself into a popular tourist destination, winning the title of best place in the world to visit in 2019 from travel guide publisher Lonely Planet . How the attacks unfolded St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo was severely damaged in the attacks. The first wave of attacks struck during busy Easter services at churches in the heart of the country's minority Christian community -- in the cities of Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa. More blasts ripped through three luxury hotels in the capital city of Colombo: the Shangri La, Cinnamon Grand and Kingsbury. The Shangri-La in Colombo said the hotel's Table One cafe was attacked just after 9 a.m local time. The hotel is popular with foreign tourists and the country's business community. Another blast rocked a hotel in front of the Dehiwala Zoo in Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia. The final blast struck a private house in Mahawila Gardens, in Dematagoda, during a raid in connection with the attacks, officials said. Three police officers were killed.

""One sub inspector and two constables of police have been killed."" Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe ""expressed his gratitude"" to the officers in a statement, according to state news agency Derena TV. Wickremesinghe reiterated that ""stern action will be taken against those responsible,"" the news agency reported.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility by any terror group. But seven people were arrested following the attacks, said Harsha de Silva, Sri Lanka's minister of economic reforms and public distribution. The victims came from around the world A Sri Lankan officer inspects a blast site at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo. Of the hundreds of people killed, about 30 were foreigners, de Silva tweeted . At least 20 foreigners were among those killed in the capital city of Colombo, hospital director general Anil Jasinghe said. The foreigners killed include at least three Indians, two Turkish nationals and two Chinese citizens, Sri Lanka's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Five British citizens, including two dual US-UK nationals, were also killed in the bombings, the statement said. Social media is cut off The Sri Lankan government blocked social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram while the investigation got under way. Facebook issued a statement Sunday offering its condolences to the those ""affected by this horrendous act."" ""Teams from across Facebook have been working to support first responders and law enforcement as well as to identify and remove content which violates our standards,"" the company said. ""We are aware of the government's statement regarding the temporary blocking of social media platforms. People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time."" Authorities order a curfew Police in Sri Lanka imposed an island-wide curfew from Sunday evening until Monday morning. In Colombo, the streets were eerily quiet, with hardly any cars on the road and no signs of bustling city life. Four guards carrying AK-47 rifles stood by a locked gate of a hotel not far from the Shangri-La, and bomb-sniffing dogs checked bags. Earlier, the country's authorities convened an emergency meeting involving the heads of the army, air force and navy, according to de Silva, Sri Lanka's economic reforms minister.

""We took multiple casualties to hospital. Hopefully saved many lives."" De Silva said rescue operations were underway, adding that emergency crews were operating in ""full force."" Christians were the apparent targets A tragic Holy Week culminates in an Easter Sunday horror Sri Lanka's minority Christian community appeared to be the main target of Sunday's attack. Christianity is a minority religion in Sri Lanka, accounting for less than 10% of the total population of 21.4 million. According to census data, 70.2% of Sri Lankans identify as Buddhist, 12% Hindu, 9.7% Muslim, and 7.4% Christian. It is estimated that 82% of Sri Lankan Christians are Roman Catholic. Sunday's attacks risk upsetting the country's fragile post-war peace. Tensions between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority led to a 25-year civil war between the Tamil Tigers, classified by the United States and others as a terrorist organization, and government forces. More than 70,000 people died in the fighting , which ended when Sri Lankan forces defeated the Tamil Tigers in 2009. In recent years, the country has witnessed a surge in ultra-nationalist Buddhism led by the Bodu Bala Sena, the country's most powerful Buddhist organization, which has pledged to defend the religion.

"Coachella, California: Woman caught on surveillance dumping plastic bag full of puppies",edition.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/puppies-dumpster-coachella/index.html,"(CNN) The woman who authorities say was caught on video tossing a bag of newborn puppies near a dumpster in Coachella, California, last week was arrested on Monday. Authorities have also now discovered dozens of dogs living in her home.
Police arrested Deborah Sue Culwell, 54, outside her Coachella home, according to Riverside County Animal Services spokesperson John Welsh. Culwell could face up to seven counts of felony animal cruelty, Welsh said. Culwell was seen in the video leaving the seven newborn puppies in a plastic bag near a dumpster behind a NAPA Auto Parts store on Thursday afternoon, according to Riverside County Animal Services. Authorities are looking for the woman they say dumped a plastic bag full of puppies. Riverside County Animal Services officers discovered 38 dogs living in Culwell's home, which were ""not in great condition"" and not friendly, Welsh said. Read More Welsh said he didn't know what breeds of dogs were at the home. The dogs have since been taken to the Coachella Valley Animal Campus. Puppies may 'not have survived much longer' Commander Chris Mayer with animal services said he was building an animal cruelty case against the woman with the help of the Riverside County Sheriff's office and the District Attorney's office. A passerby discovered the bag, and a store employee then contacted animal services. The puppies were about three days old and believed to be terrier mixes, animal services said. ""If not for the Good Samaritan's actions, the puppies may not have survived much longer,"" said the county animal services in a release. ""The mid-day temperatures in Coachella on Thursday were in the mid-90s range."" Animal Service's veterinary team members cared for the puppies and found a rescue group to accept and bottle feed them, according to the release. ""There is no excuse for dumping puppies,"" Mayer said. ""Especially in today's age when we or other shelters would be willing to get these animals to foster parents or rescue partners. This was a shameful act."""

Ukrainians head to the polls for presidential elections with comedian on track for triumph,edition.cnn.com,Kara Fox,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/europe/ukraine-elections-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Ukrainians were voting Sunday in the second round of presidential elections .
Television comedian and political newbie Volodymyr Zelensky was on track to cause a political upset, with recent polls, ahead of Sunday, suggesting an overwhelming lead over incumbent Petro Poroshenko. Zelensky's entry in the presidential race came as a surprise, given that he is perhaps best known for his role in the Ukrainian comedy series ""Servant of the People"" as an out-of-luck schoolteacher who abruptly becomes president of Ukraine. Despite his bid being initially dismissed as a protest vote and a joke, art may become reality after the 41-year-old challenger found support from an electorate tired of corruption and oligarchy. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, left, holds a debate with his electoral opponent Volodymyr Zelenskiy, right, at Olympiskiy Stadium on Friday in Kiev, Ukraine. Zelensky triumphed in the first round of voting April 1, receiving more than 30% of votes cast while Poroshenko, 53, came in second with 16% of the vote. Read More Poroshenko -- a billionaire businessman known for his ownership of chocolate manufacturer Roshen -- came to power in the aftermath of the 2013 pro-Western Maidan protests. He has since pursued a pro-European agenda despite opposition from Russia, first outlining a program of social and economic reforms that he said were aimed at preparing his country to apply for European Union membership in 2020. Yet his term has been plagued by suggestions of mass corruption and a flagging economy. Ukraine is one of Europe's poorest countries, with a growing number of people emigrating for better economic opportunities. In a bid to win over voters, Poroshenko ran on a militant patriotic platform and portrayed himself as a tough guy who could stand up to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. ""He personally, and the country he leads, are the biggest threat to Ukraine and to its every citizen,"" Poroshenko said about Putin in a Facebook post ahead of the vote. But it may be too little, too late for Ukrainians exhausted from a five-year proxy war with Russia. Ukraine's President is running against -- Vladimir Putin Ukraine and Russia have been locked in a long-simmer conflict since the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea by Russia in 2014. The conflict has claimed almost 13,000 lives, with at least 3,321 civilian deaths, according to the United Nations . In November, tensions with Moscow flared once again after Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait, a strategic waterway. Poroshenko's government responded by imposing martial law and warning of impending Russian invasion. Zelensky has run an unconventional campaign light on policies, prompting questions over how the political newcomer will steer the country out of its current challenges. However, Zelensky has surrounded himself with reform-minded technocrats to make up his team of advisers. Chief among them are former finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk; former economic development and trade minister Aivaras Abromavicius; and lawmaker and anti-corruption campaigner Sergii Leshchenko. Ukraine President takes drug test before debating comedian in 70,000-seat stadium Friday, the presidential contenders were given a last opportunity to appeal to voters during a rowdy debate at a football stadium in Kiev. ""I'm not a politician,"" Zelensky told Poroshenko in front of a crowd of thousands, Reuters reported . ""I'm just an ordinary person who has come to break the system. I'm the result of your mistakes and promises."" Positioning himself in front of a Ukrainian flag, the incumbent hit back at Zelensky's lack of political experience. ""You'd be a weak head of state who would be unable to defend yourself from Putin's blows,"" Poroshenko said. ""I don't believe that Mr Volodymyr dreams of handing over Ukraine, of dragging Ukraine back into the Russian empire, but Putin has such a dream."""
A German auction house is helping return pieces of art looted by the Nazis to their rightful owners,edition.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/nazi-stolen-art-returned/index.html,"(CNN) Nina McGehee always knew that her family fled Europe before World War II broke out. But she only recently learned about what they left behind.
McGehee's great-grandfather, Siegfried Laemmle, was a German art and antiquities dealer with a successful business in Munich. He was also Jewish, and like all Jewish art dealers in the Third Reich, he was forced to liquidate his business as part of the ""Aryanization"" of businesses. Before they had to give up their businesses, Jewish merchants in the Nazi era had to mark their stores with a Star of David and word Juden, which means ""Jews."" Some Laemmle objects ended up in private collections, others in museums. Most were sold through a Munich auction house under the guise of legitimate sales. Now, the current head of the auction house is helping return those objects to their rightful owners, including McGehee's family. A common estimate for the number of works of art looted in the Nazi era is 600,000 with at least 100,000 still missing. Read More Often, in the process of restitution, the burden is on families to prove an object was sold because of Nazi persecution. That's starting to change as countries and institutions strengthen their commitments to researching the provenance of objects in their possession and making that information publicly available. A central database contains an estimated 25,000 missing, looted or identified objects -- paintings, drawings, antiquities -- from more than 15 countries. But Neumeister Auctions in Munich appears to be one of few private art dealers in the world taking the work upon themselves. ""I'm not responsible for what happened in National Socialism (Nazism), but I'm responsible for what I'm doing now -- or especially what I'm not doing,"" said managing director Katrin Stoll, who took over the business in 2008. ""As a German business, we have a social responsibility to do this."" Stoll and McGehee shared their story this week at the University of Denver's Center for Art Collection Ethics, where McGehee recently audited a class on provenance research. Toward the end of the semester, McGehee revealed to the professor her connection to the subject. Nazi law required Jewish merchants to post signs saying their businesses were Jewish-owned. ""It's a wonderful success story that shows the benefits of the kind of research that we're trying to promote,"" said associate professor Elizabeth Campbell. ""It's an excellent example of how provenance research can help families achieve belated justice as well as strengthen human connections within one family and across continents."" McGehee says the restitution process opened her eyes to a chapter in her family's history that her parents seldom spoke of, eager as they were to leave it in the past. ""I didn't know anything about the family business or that my great grandfather was considered one of the top-of-the-line dealers,"" McGehee said in a phone interview. ""It just wasn't something my parents ever discussed."" What happened to the Laemmle collection? McGehee's journey to the truth began with a German documentary that includes her family's story. ""Under the Hammer of the Nazis"" recounts Stoll's efforts to right the wrongs of a key figure in the trafficking of Nazi-plundered goods in Bavaria. The documentary was screened at the University of Denver event that included McGehee, Stoll and the researcher who reviewed Neumeister's files, Meike Hopp. University of Denver associate professor Elizabeth Campbell, left, leads a screening of ""Under the Hammer of the Nazis"" with Katrin Stoll, Nina McGehee and Meike Hopp. Art dealer Adolf Weinmueller was a Nazi party member who directed the pilfering and sale of the Laemmle collection, among others in Bavaria, for the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts, which oversaw the liquidation of the Jewish art trade. Adolf Hitler intended for the artifacts to end up in the F√ºhrermuseum, an unrealized art museum in a planned cultural complex for his hometown. Hitler had first pick of the looted objects, according to the film, but most of them went into private ownership through auction. Siegfried Laemmle was 73 when the order came to liquidate his collection. A respected dealer and collector, he had been running his business in Munich since 1894, specializing in late medieval and early Renaissance sculptures. Laemmle and his son Walter tried to convince authorities of their professional qualifications and commitment to German culture. But they quickly realized they had no choice but to dissolve the business. Siegfried Laemmle, bottom right, was a successful art and antiquties dealer before the Nazi regime forced him to liquidate his business. Laemmle sold off as much as he could before immigrating with his family to California, where his brother, Carl Laemmle, the founder of Universal Studios, lived. The rest eventually fell into Weinmueller's hands as the person overseeing the liquidation of the region's Jewish art trade. With the Laemmles and other Jewish competitors gone, Weinmueller's business flourished as he auctioned off their plundered objects. Just how many objects passed through his auction house, or where they went, was a mystery until the past decade, when a discovery in the auction house basement shed light on the inner workings of Weinmueller's business. How an auction house found them For years after the war's end in 1945, historians knew Weinmueller was an agent of the Nazi party. But without records, they had no way of enumerating the nature of his misdeeds, let alone prove them. He was allowed to keep his business until his death in 1958, when German businessman Rudolf Neumeister took over the business. In 2008, Neumeister's daughter, Stoll, took over. Knowing what she did about Weinmueller's reputation, Stoll decided to give the business a fresh start under her tenure. ""I couldn't explain what I was searching for, I just had a feeling there was a history with Weinmueller, but nobody could give me answers,"" she said. Ten years earlier, 44 countries committed to the Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art , a set of principles that charged participating nations with returning Nazi-confiscated art to their rightful owners. But the principles were nonbinding, and no formal framework was created to help governments or private entities take up the task. A guard stands outside Schiffmann's department store, a Jewish business, after it was taken over by the Nazis. Stoll hired provenance researcher Meike Hopp to create a system to investigate the sales. During her research, the pair made an unexpected discovery in the basement of the auction house: bundles of auction catalogs filled with notes in Weinmueller's handwriting. The level of detail in the catalogs was like nothing that had been discovered before, Hopp said. The catalogs included the names of Jewish art dealers or businesses, descriptions of their objects and the buyers. In one auction alone, according to Weinmueller's catalog, 159 hand drawings and graphics that once belonged to Laemmle were sold. The pair digitized the annotated catalogs and published them in 2014 on Lost Art , a database of Nazi-looted objects. Finally, the nature of Weinmueller's misdeeds was laid bare. ""He was one of the main figures to catalyze the process and support the Nazis in its activities against Jewish art dealers,"" Hopp said. And he was one of the main profiteers, she said, because he received the private collections and belongings Jews were forced to leave behind when they fled the country. An object returns to its owner McGehee says she knew that her family had artifacts in Europe. Her parents, who lived in Minneapolis, first got involved in restitution efforts in the early 2000s, while she was in Denver, tending to her own family and career. Her great-grandfather died before she was born, and her parents rarely spoke of him. Without knowing anything about Siegfried Laemmle's life or business, she says she assumed the disputed objects were personal effects. Never in her wildest dreams would she have believed they were part of a massive collection culled from medieval estates and Bavarian courts, among other locales distant in time and place. She also knew that her parents were interviewed for the documentary, which aired in 2013 on German television. But she was not there for the interviews and she did not watch the documentary until 2016, after it was translated into English. She was floored by what she learned. ""That was my introduction to my family history. I watched it four to five times just thinking, 'what?' This is my mother's grandfather and I had no idea,"" she said. ""I couldn't grasp it at first. It didn't register, which is why I watched it so many times."" By then, her family had already received restitution from a museum in Vienna, where Austrian law compelled them to reach out. The discovery of the Weinmueller catalogs at Neumeister revealed more objects in museums in Germany, and her family began efforts to claim them. Ultimately, the museums offered to buy most of the items or sell them at auction, she said. The remaining items, antiques and household items of little value, were up for grabs if McGehee wanted them. So she traveled to Germany in last year and came home with a marble plaque. She met Stoll and Hopp and struck up a friendship. It's nothing fancy, she says of the plaque that now sits in her home. ""Just a marble thing that says Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so live here,"" she says. ""Really heavy."" But to McGehee and the others involved, it shows that it's never too late for justice. Or the truth."

The video of the Thursday incident appears to show one Florida deputy spraying pepper spray in the face of a teen boy. As the teen appears to walk away with his hands on his face, the deputy follows him, grabs him and slams him to the ground. Another deputy then jumps onto the boy's back, slams his face into the pavement more than once and punches the teen in the head. In the background, bystanders can be heard yelling ""What are you doing?"" and ""He's bleeding."" The video, which has since gone viral on social media, has sparked outrage over the deputy's conduct.

""I was appointed to this position exclusively about accountability and that accountability will be held not just for sake of when we are right, but in the cases where we may be wrong."" The Broward County Sheriff's office said on its website that the Division of Internal Affairs is investigating the incident. The office of Broward County State Attorney Mike Satz is also investigating, he said in a statement Monday. ""Our prosecutors and investigators had already scheduled a meeting for Tuesday with the attorney for the 15-year-old student,"" Satz said in the statement. ""The student's family has hired a new attorney and we are arranging a meeting with the new lawyer as soon as they are available."" Deputy says he 'had to act quickly' An arrest report from the Sheriff's Office says detectives with the Tamarac Crime Suppression Team were on ""proactive patrol"" at the Tamarac Town Square Plaza because of recent student fights at the strip mall. The day before the deputies' encounter, the report says, there had been a large fight that resulted in damage to property and a bystander's vehicle. Video of Baltimore officer beating a man leads to cop's resignation The officer writing the report, Christopher Krickovich, said a fight Thursday stopped before he and other deputies walked up. As the crowd dispersed, the deputies saw a teen who had been involved in Wednesday's fight. Krickovich wrote he and another deputy -- identified as Sgt. LaCerra -- approached the teen and put him into custody because he was trespassing. Krickovich said as he was detaining the teen, he noticed another boy wearing a ""red tank top"" reach down and try to grab the phone of the teen being detained, the report says. LaCerra told the boy to stay back because Krickovich was on the ground with his back turned, Krickovich wrote in the report. ""At this point, the male with the red tank top, took an aggressive stance towards Sgt. LaCerra,"" Krickovich wrote. ""The male with the red tank top bladed his body and began clenching his fist."" That's when LaCerra sprayed the boy with pepper spray, the report says. Two former officers were indicted after an altercation with a middle school student in Louisiana Krickovich wrote in the report that he saw the big crowd of 200-plus students ""converging on the two of us,"" so he jumped on the boy with the red tank top. ""With the crowd closing in and the loud yelling and threats towards us, I pushed down the male to ensure my weight was full on his person so he could not attempt to take flight or fight against us,"" Krickovich wrote, adding that it felt as though the boy in the red tank was trying to push up while he was pushing down. ""I had to act quickly, fearing I would get struck or having a student potentially grab weapons off my belt or vest,"" Krickovich wrote. Krickovich said he punched the boy in the head ""as a distractionary technique to free his right hand"" from under his face. The 15-year-old boy, who has not been identified, was taken Coral Springs Medical Center, cleared and then taken to Juvenile Assessment Center. He was charged with assault, resisting arrest and trespassing, according to CNN affiliate WFOR-TV . He appeared in court Friday morning and was released to his parents. Mayor says deputy should be fired Broward Mayor Mark Bogen released a statement Friday condemning the actions seen in the video. ""The behavior of these Broward Sheriff's Office deputies was outrageous and unacceptable,"" Bogen said. ""The officer who jumped on the student, punched the student and banged his head to the ground should be fired immediately. There is no excuse for a law enforcement officer to harm a teenager who was on the ground and who gave no resistance."" Bogen said he also had a problem with the deputy who threw the boy on the ground after pepper spraying him. ""After being sprayed, the teen held his face and walked away,"" Bogen said. ""If the deputy wanted to arrest the student, he could have easily done so without throwing him to the ground. I hope the appropriate authorities investigate this conduct and take the appropriate action."" Celebrities also reacted to the video on social media Saturday.

A member of an armed group detaining migrants at the border has been arrested by the FBI - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/border-militia-arrests/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29,"(CNN) The FBI has arrested a member of an armed militia that had detained hundreds of migrants at the border this week, the New Mexico attorney general's office said Saturday.
Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, is a member of an armed group that had reportedly detained migrants near Sunland Park, New Mexico, state Attorney General Hector Balderas said in a statement. Hopkins -- also known as Johnny Horton Jr. -- was arrested on felony charges of being in possession of firearms and ammunition, according to a statement from the FBI's Albuquerque field office. Larry Mitchell Hopkins Earlier this week, videos posted online purported to show migrants being held by a militia known as the United Constitutional Patriots before being turned over to US Border Patrol. The footage prompted a condemnation from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, which in a letter likened the militia's actions to kidnapping. A militia group detained migrants at the border. The ACLU calls it kidnapping Read More ""This is a dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families,"" Balderas said. ""Today's arrest by the FBI indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes."" Hopkins is expected to make a first appearance in court on Monday, the FBI said. CNN was unable to determine Saturday whether he was represented by an attorney. CNN has reached out to the United Constitutional Patriots for comment, but has not heard back. A spokesman for the group previously said their actions were legal, ""comparing the detention of the migrants to 'a verbal citizen's arrest,'"" according to a report from The New York Times . Videos show armed men in masks, fatigues Various private militia groups -- often espousing anti-immigrant views -- have patrolled the border for years, but it's rare to see footage of an armed group detaining migrants on the US side of the border. Videos purported to show members of the group detaining migrants, including families with children, who have just crossed the border. CNN has reached out to the group and the individuals who posted the videos for comment but has not confirmed details about who shot the videos, or when and where they were recorded. In the footage, people wearing full military fatigues can be seen with handguns strapped to their sides, wearing gloves and black face masks. Armed men order the migrants to stop, force them to sit on the ground and then appear to call Border Patrol to pick the migrants up. In at least two videos posted on the group's Facebook page, a man in fatigues verbally identifies himself as ""Border Patrol"" when stopping a group of migrants. A US Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman declined to comment on the United Constitutional Patriots and the online videos, but said the agency ""does not endorse or condone private groups of organizations taking enforcement measures into their own hands.""

The Easter story helps an outcast preacher find her way back home,edition.cnn.com,John Blake,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/outcast-pastor-finds-way-home-easter/index.html,"(CNN) The Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor was attending a seminar one day when someone asked her a question that she hasn't been able to forget.
""What is the story you are working on that doesn't have an ending yet?"" Taylor gave one answer that day but today she has another: The story she can't quite figure out is her own. On the surface, Taylor led a life that most people would envy. She was a widely sought-after speaker whose sermons were compared to ""literary gems."" Her books made the New York Times' best-sellers list. One made the cover of Time magazine. She appeared on Oprah Winfrey's ""SuperSoul Sunday"" show . Strangers approached her in grocery stores with reverence and awe. But something happened to her as her reputation spread. She found herself drawn to ""someone else's rose."" She began to see beauty and truth in other people's religions. And she became so disillusioned with her own that she ""could not look it in the eyes."" Read More Taylor once called herself a ""detective of divinity"" for her ability to collect evidence of God's genius. But her spiritual wandering made her feel at times as if she was guilty of a crime. ""The fear rose up from a more primitive part of my brain that had been taught to fear a jealous God's wrath if I did not love him and him alone,"" Taylor says. This was the plot complication she faced in her story: What do you do when you're the superstar preacher, but you fall in love with other faiths more than your own? Easter morning would help give her an answer. A voice for anxious times A story about doubt may seem like an odd topic for an Easter weekend. The traditional Easter message is one of triumph: Jesus conquers death and sin through his resurrection. But this is a tough Easter for many Christians. Many don't feel so triumphant. Christianity is in crisis. Catholics are losing faith in church and clergy because of an ongoing sexual abuse scandal. Mainline Protestant churches are splitting apart over issues such as gay clergy. There are now more Americans who claim no religion than there are evangelicals and Catholics. Taylor holds eggs she collected from her chickens. She calls the animals on her farm members of her congregation. When the Notre Dame Cathedral recently erupted in flames, some saw it as a sneak preview of the church's future in the US. They warned that American churches are heading toward collapse . They envision a post-Christian future like Western Europe's: rapidly emptying churches and soaring cathedrals that no longer speak to people. Few, if any, contemporary Christian leaders speak to the spiritual restlessness of this time like Taylor. In her books ""Leaving Church"" and ""Learning to Walk in the Dark,"" she always seems to be in motion -- leaving one spiritual rest stop for another exit down the road. She has ""near perfect pitch"" for speaking to people's fears without leaving them hopeless, says the Rev. Thomas G. Long, another celebrated speaker. He was recently selected, along with Taylor, as one of the 12 most effective preachers in the English language in a prestigious preaching survey . ""She has such powerful gifts of language and narration that her readers and hearers find their own questions and concerns coming to expression in ways that prompt them to say, 'Yes, yes that's what I feel,''' Long says. Why Taylor is scared of true believers What Taylor is feeling on this recent afternoon is hungry. It's lunchtime when she receives a visitor at her secluded farm in the northeast Georgia mountains. Now 67 with a mass of dazzling white hair, Taylor motions to a spread in her kitchen that she's prepared for her guest. ""Deviled eggs, good turkey sandwiches,"" she says pointing to the food. ""You eat the rest because I'm not going to."" Taylor's farm looks as picturesque as a postcard: rolling meadows, mountains looming on the horizon, a sprawling porch decorated with swings and cushions. She even has a small writing cabin near her house where she goes to work without distractions. An introvert who craves solitude, Taylor often retires to a small cabin near her farm to write. One of her dogs greets the visitor at her farm's entrance with a few desultory barks. Then he trots away to frolic in a meadow. He has plenty of company. Taylor has two horses, two dogs, four cats, 11 guinea hens and more chickens than she can count. She shares the farm with her husband, Ed. They married in 1982, a year before she was ordained as an Episcopal priest. Fourteen years her elder, he was never intimidated, she says, by a woman in a clerical collar. ""We've both been stung when people shake my hand and completely ignore him,"" she says. ""He doesn't travel with me much for that reason, and it's a great relief to me that he doesn't because when I come home from a trip, he's there like the pool of fresh water at the end of a dusty road."" Taylor has been traveling a lot lately to promote her latest book, ""Holy Envy."" It describes what she calls the ""shock of meeting God in so many new hats"" when she taught a course on world religions at Piedmont College, a liberal arts school in north Georgia. The book carries on Taylor's tradition of what she calls, ""saying things you're not supposed to say."" She takes on questions that annoy some Sunday school teachers: Is Jesus the only way? Are all religions alike? If I love Buddhist meditation, can I still call myself a Christian? The book has attracted plenty of praise. Book critics and journalists tend to love Taylor's work. Time magazine once said that her writing ""rivals the poetic power of C.S. Lewis and Frederick Buechner."" Yet her critics often react just as strongly to her work. Some say she waters down Christianity's core beliefs with a self-indulgent theology of ""happy faces and pumpkins in the sky."" Others say she should add some social justice to her message -- try less poetry and be more prophetic. But others say her message is needed more now than ever. After Taylor spoke at Concordia College-Moorhead in Minnesota, Jacqueline Bussie, director of the Forum on Faith and Life at the school, said more Americans need to get a dose of holy envy. Taylor feeds her horse Billy. The horses, chickens and dogs on her farm are reoccurring characters in many of her stories. The US is the most religiously diverse nation in the world, but ""in this country you can graduate college and still have no clue about the religious practices, world views, and history of billions of people,"" says Bussie, author of ""Outlaw Christian."" ""This is negligence."" In person, Taylor is playful, expressive with her hands and self-deprecating. But her voice rises in exasperation when she recounts how some Christians depict her as an outcast pastor. She calls them the true believers. ""True believers are among the meanest people I've ever met,"" she says, stretching out her legs in a cozy living room filled with books on poetry, religious icons and a photo of her posing with Oprah. ""I cannot think of anybody of another faith who has wounded me like Christians,"" she says. ""Judged, condemned to hell, cast out of the body of the faithful -- look me up online."" Taylor, though, became one of her own harshest critics when she experienced a spiritual fear that she never saw coming. A pastor who does a little spiritual 'sleeping around' Her spiritual crisis had no dramatic backdrop -- no spiritual breakthrough on some vision quest alone in the woods. She says she lost her way in the church after she found a new home in the classroom. When she started to teach a college course in world religions, something odd happened. She was enthralled when teaching students about other faiths and taking them on field trips to mosques, temples and Buddhist centers. But when the class syllabus turned to Christianity, her fire sputtered. She started to feel as if she was spiritually ""sleeping around."" She started collecting Tibetan singing bowls, Hindu deities and Muslim prayer rugs. She felt as if she was a spiritual shoplifter. Taylor carefully shows the Tibetan prayer book she keeps in her library. But she was no mere theological tourist. She started to see beauty and truth in other religious traditions. She was impressed by Buddhists because they weren't interested in opposing any other religion or converting anyone. She was astonished by the graciousness of an imam who told her class after they visited a mosque: ""Our deepest desire is not that you become Muslim, but you become the best Christian, the best Jew, the best person you can be."" And she was ashamed to learn how much her own faith had ""scorched"" other religious traditions by the way the faithful treated non-Christians. ""I cannot think of anybody of another faith who has wounded me like Christians.""
Barbara Brown Taylor
""Belittled, patronized, infantilized -- treated as if they had never had a thought about the divine and sacred,"" she says. Taylor knew what she was taught: Jesus was the way, salvation is found in no other name, and at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow. But she also knew what she felt -- something sacred was speaking to her even when it didn't have the name Jesus attached to it. In one ""Holy Envy"" passage she writes: ""Through the years I have spent dozens of hours in the presence of Tibetan lamas who have spoken directly to my condition. Their talks have been as meaningful to me as anything I have heard from teachers in my own traditions... What can this mean?"" It couldn't mean anything good when she thought back to her days following a fear-based Christianity that she thought she had abandoned. Scriptures that declared that God was a ""jealous God,"" and passages where prophets described those who turned to other gods as whores flashed in her memory. Religious artifacts from around the world are displayed on the shelves of Taylor's library. ""The fear surprised me because it wasn't rational,"" she says. ""I had been a seeker long before I became a Christian so questioning everything was second nature to me."" Taylor says she felt like a little child, scared that she would lose her heavenly father's love forever. How could she find her way back? She opened her Bible and started reading about Jesus. Where Jesus found loveliness She was in for a surprise. Turns out the New Testament is full of Jesus' interfaith encounters. Some of the best-known stories about Jesus depict his admiration for those outside his religion, she says. She cites some of them in her book: Jesus being astonished by the faith of a Roman centurion who wanted his servant healed; the Samaritan leper who impressed Jesus with his gratitude; the Syrophoenician woman whose wit and love for her daughter caught Jesus by surprise. They were all people who worshiped other Gods or worshiped the same one Jesus did in an unorthodox way, she says. ""If anything, the strangers seem to change Jesus' ideas about where faith may be found, far outside the boundaries that he has been raised to respect,"" she writes in ""Holy Envy."" Taylor amplifies the point from her living room. Her voice rises in volume. She's no longer cracking jokes and laughing. She's going into preaching mode. ""It's all on the page,"" she says. ""It's on the page in the Bible about Jesus dealing with women, Syrophoenicians, Canaanites and Greeks, and he's not making distinctions. Nor is he trying to convert everybody. He's just dealing with people who are hungry."" Taylor collects greens growing on her farm for dinner. Taylor stopped seeing herself as the wayward child risking God's wrath because she was dazzled by the faith of others. ""Now I don't believe Jesus is mad at me for finding loveliness in the faith of my religious neighbors because he did the same thing,"" she says. Taylor's new Easter sermon There are still nagging questions, though, about where Taylor stands with her own faith. Have you stopped being a Christian? ""No, I haven't,"" she says. ""So that means I'm very aware Jesus never commanded me to love my religion. He said love God and your neighbor. That's about all I can handle day by day."" Do you still go to church? Taylor has gone to everything from a sprawling evangelical mega church to a tiny African-American Catholic parish and a storefront church in a strip mall in recent years. ""I worship every day,"" she says. ""Sometimes it's in churches, but other times it's around dinner tables, in airports, in city parks, and in the woods with wild turkeys."" Those answers, though, are the kind of poetic musings that still make some Christians suspicious. Is she more than ""happy faces and pumpkins in the sky?"" She doesn't sound like a person who is giving up on Christianity. In ""Holy Envy"" she writes: ""However many other religious languages I learn, I dream in Christian. However much I learn from other spiritual teachers, it is Jesus I come home to at night."" A painting called ""String Theory"" by artist Charles Barbier is seen in Brown's library. Easter morning also helps her find her way home. She still believes in the Easter story. She just doesn't believe that it represents the triumph of Christianity -- proof that Christians have a monopoly on religious truth. How can you believe in Easter without believing Christ is the only way? The way she now talks about God in the Easter story helps explain why. ""Jesus never commanded me to love my religion. He said love God and your neighbor. That's about all I can handle day by day.""
Barbara Brown Taylor
""These days I would say Easter is the eruption of life from a tomb as God's huge surprise, going in a different direction, and if anything, proof that you can never predict how God is going to act next,"" she says. Taylor's spiritual restlessness may continue to push her in different directions. But she no longer sounds afraid to look her faith in the eyes. ""Now I value Easter as the reminder that you never know where life is going to come from next, and there's no sense being attached to the day before yesterday because the day before yesterday is dead, and today something is alive,"" she says. She leans forward on her sofa and her expression turns solemn. She gets a faraway look in her eyes, and raises her hands as if in worship. ""So why not follow the life, and see where it leads, with some kind of trust in the spirit's ability to blow where nobody expected to blow, and in a direction nobody expected it to go into -- and be willing to be blown away."""

A Florida deputy is under investigation after viral video appears to show him slamming teen's head into the ground - CNN,us.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/broward-county-florida-use-of-force/index.html,"(CNN) A Broward County sheriff's deputy is on ""restricted administrative assignment"" after a video surfaced that appears to show him slamming a teenage boy's head into the ground and then punching the teen in the head.
The video of the Thursday incident appears to show one Florida deputy spraying pepper spray in the face of a teen boy. As the teen appears to walk away with his hands on his face, the deputy follows him, grabs him and slams him to the ground. Another deputy then jumps onto the boy's back, slams his face into the pavement more than once and punches the teen in the head. In the background, bystanders can be heard yelling ""What are you doing?"" and ""He's bleeding."" The video, which has since gone viral on social media, has sparked outrage over the deputy's conduct.

""I was appointed to this position exclusively about accountability and that accountability will be held not just for sake of when we are right, but in the cases where we may be wrong."" The Broward County Sheriff's office said on its website that the Division of Internal Affairs is investigating the incident. The office of Broward County State Attorney Mike Satz is also investigating, he said in a statement Monday. ""Our prosecutors and investigators had already scheduled a meeting for Tuesday with the attorney for the 15-year-old student,"" Satz said in the statement. ""The student's family has hired a new attorney and we are arranging a meeting with the new lawyer as soon as they are available."" Deputy says he 'had to act quickly' An arrest report from the Sheriff's Office says detectives with the Tamarac Crime Suppression Team were on ""proactive patrol"" at the Tamarac Town Square Plaza because of recent student fights at the strip mall. The day before the deputies' encounter, the report says, there had been a large fight that resulted in damage to property and a bystander's vehicle. Video of Baltimore officer beating a man leads to cop's resignation The officer writing the report, Christopher Krickovich, said a fight Thursday stopped before he and other deputies walked up. As the crowd dispersed, the deputies saw a teen who had been involved in Wednesday's fight. Krickovich wrote he and another deputy -- identified as Sgt. LaCerra -- approached the teen and put him into custody because he was trespassing. Krickovich said as he was detaining the teen, he noticed another boy wearing a ""red tank top"" reach down and try to grab the phone of the teen being detained, the report says. LaCerra told the boy to stay back because Krickovich was on the ground with his back turned, Krickovich wrote in the report. ""At this point, the male with the red tank top, took an aggressive stance towards Sgt. LaCerra,"" Krickovich wrote. ""The male with the red tank top bladed his body and began clenching his fist."" That's when LaCerra sprayed the boy with pepper spray, the report says. Two former officers were indicted after an altercation with a middle school student in Louisiana Krickovich wrote in the report that he saw the big crowd of 200-plus students ""converging on the two of us,"" so he jumped on the boy with the red tank top. ""With the crowd closing in and the loud yelling and threats towards us, I pushed down the male to ensure my weight was full on his person so he could not attempt to take flight or fight against us,"" Krickovich wrote, adding that it felt as though the boy in the red tank was trying to push up while he was pushing down. ""I had to act quickly, fearing I would get struck or having a student potentially grab weapons off my belt or vest,"" Krickovich wrote. Krickovich said he punched the boy in the head ""as a distractionary technique to free his right hand"" from under his face. The 15-year-old boy, who has not been identified, was taken Coral Springs Medical Center, cleared and then taken to Juvenile Assessment Center. He was charged with assault, resisting arrest and trespassing, according to CNN affiliate WFOR-TV . He appeared in court Friday morning and was released to his parents. Mayor says deputy should be fired Broward Mayor Mark Bogen released a statement Friday condemning the actions seen in the video. ""The behavior of these Broward Sheriff's Office deputies was outrageous and unacceptable,"" Bogen said. ""The officer who jumped on the student, punched the student and banged his head to the ground should be fired immediately. There is no excuse for a law enforcement officer to harm a teenager who was on the ground and who gave no resistance."" Bogen said he also had a problem with the deputy who threw the boy on the ground after pepper spraying him. ""After being sprayed, the teen held his face and walked away,"" Bogen said. ""If the deputy wanted to arrest the student, he could have easily done so without throwing him to the ground. I hope the appropriate authorities investigate this conduct and take the appropriate action."" Celebrities also reacted to the video on social media Saturday.

Retired Illinois Appellate Justice Sheila O'Brien filed a petition on April 5 requesting a special prosecutor be appointed to review Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx's decision to dismiss charges against Smollett, whom investigators said staged an attack against himself. Smollett's lawyers argue in the motion that a review by a special prosecutor is only allowed when there is a pending case.

A German auction house is helping return pieces of art looted by the Nazis to their rightful owners - CNN,us.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/nazi-stolen-art-returned/index.html,"(CNN) Nina McGehee always knew that her family fled Europe before World War II broke out. But she only recently learned about what they left behind.
McGehee's great-grandfather, Siegfried Laemmle, was a German art and antiquities dealer with a successful business in Munich. He was also Jewish, and like all Jewish art dealers in the Third Reich, he was forced to liquidate his business as part of the ""Aryanization"" of businesses. Before they had to give up their businesses, Jewish merchants in the Nazi era had to mark their stores with a Star of David and word Juden, which means ""Jews."" Some Laemmle objects ended up in private collections, others in museums. Most were sold through a Munich auction house under the guise of legitimate sales. Now, the current head of the auction house is helping return those objects to their rightful owners, including McGehee's family. A common estimate for the number of works of art looted in the Nazi era is 600,000 with at least 100,000 still missing. Read More Often, in the process of restitution, the burden is on families to prove an object was sold because of Nazi persecution. That's starting to change as countries and institutions strengthen their commitments to researching the provenance of objects in their possession and making that information publicly available. A central database contains an estimated 25,000 missing, looted or identified objects -- paintings, drawings, antiquities -- from more than 15 countries. But Neumeister Auctions in Munich appears to be one of few private art dealers in the world taking the work upon themselves. ""I'm not responsible for what happened in National Socialism (Nazism), but I'm responsible for what I'm doing now -- or especially what I'm not doing,"" said managing director Katrin Stoll, who took over the business in 2008. ""As a German business, we have a social responsibility to do this."" Stoll and McGehee shared their story this week at the University of Denver's Center for Art Collection Ethics, where McGehee recently audited a class on provenance research. Toward the end of the semester, McGehee revealed to the professor her connection to the subject. Nazi law required Jewish merchants to post signs saying their businesses were Jewish-owned. ""It's a wonderful success story that shows the benefits of the kind of research that we're trying to promote,"" said associate professor Elizabeth Campbell. ""It's an excellent example of how provenance research can help families achieve belated justice as well as strengthen human connections within one family and across continents."" McGehee says the restitution process opened her eyes to a chapter in her family's history that her parents seldom spoke of, eager as they were to leave it in the past. ""I didn't know anything about the family business or that my great grandfather was considered one of the top-of-the-line dealers,"" McGehee said in a phone interview. ""It just wasn't something my parents ever discussed."" What happened to the Laemmle collection? McGehee's journey to the truth began with a German documentary that includes her family's story. ""Under the Hammer of the Nazis"" recounts Stoll's efforts to right the wrongs of a key figure in the trafficking of Nazi-plundered goods in Bavaria. The documentary was screened at the University of Denver event that included McGehee, Stoll and the researcher who reviewed Neumeister's files, Meike Hopp. University of Denver associate professor Elizabeth Campbell, left, leads a screening of ""Under the Hammer of the Nazis"" with Katrin Stoll, Nina McGehee and Meike Hopp. Art dealer Adolf Weinmueller was a Nazi party member who directed the pilfering and sale of the Laemmle collection, among others in Bavaria, for the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts, which oversaw the liquidation of the Jewish art trade. Adolf Hitler intended for the artifacts to end up in the F√ºhrermuseum, an unrealized art museum in a planned cultural complex for his hometown. Hitler had first pick of the looted objects, according to the film, but most of them went into private ownership through auction. Siegfried Laemmle was 73 when the order came to liquidate his collection. A respected dealer and collector, he had been running his business in Munich since 1894, specializing in late medieval and early Renaissance sculptures. Laemmle and his son Walter tried to convince authorities of their professional qualifications and commitment to German culture. But they quickly realized they had no choice but to dissolve the business. Siegfried Laemmle, bottom right, was a successful art and antiquties dealer before the Nazi regime forced him to liquidate his business. Laemmle sold off as much as he could before immigrating with his family to California, where his brother, Carl Laemmle, the founder of Universal Studios, lived. The rest eventually fell into Weinmueller's hands as the person overseeing the liquidation of the region's Jewish art trade. With the Laemmles and other Jewish competitors gone, Weinmueller's business flourished as he auctioned off their plundered objects. Just how many objects passed through his auction house, or where they went, was a mystery until the past decade, when a discovery in the auction house basement shed light on the inner workings of Weinmueller's business. How an auction house found them For years after the war's end in 1945, historians knew Weinmueller was an agent of the Nazi party. But without records, they had no way of enumerating the nature of his misdeeds, let alone prove them. He was allowed to keep his business until his death in 1958, when German businessman Rudolf Neumeister took over the business. In 2008, Neumeister's daughter, Stoll, took over. Knowing what she did about Weinmueller's reputation, Stoll decided to give the business a fresh start under her tenure. ""I couldn't explain what I was searching for, I just had a feeling there was a history with Weinmueller, but nobody could give me answers,"" she said. Ten years earlier, 44 countries committed to the Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art , a set of principles that charged participating nations with returning Nazi-confiscated art to their rightful owners. But the principles were nonbinding, and no formal framework was created to help governments or private entities take up the task. A guard stands outside Schiffmann's department store, a Jewish business, after it was taken over by the Nazis. Stoll hired provenance researcher Meike Hopp to create a system to investigate the sales. During her research, the pair made an unexpected discovery in the basement of the auction house: bundles of auction catalogs filled with notes in Weinmueller's handwriting. The level of detail in the catalogs was like nothing that had been discovered before, Hopp said. The catalogs included the names of Jewish art dealers or businesses, descriptions of their objects and the buyers. In one auction alone, according to Weinmueller's catalog, 159 hand drawings and graphics that once belonged to Laemmle were sold. The pair digitized the annotated catalogs and published them in 2014 on Lost Art , a database of Nazi-looted objects. Finally, the nature of Weinmueller's misdeeds was laid bare. ""He was one of the main figures to catalyze the process and support the Nazis in its activities against Jewish art dealers,"" Hopp said. And he was one of the main profiteers, she said, because he received the private collections and belongings Jews were forced to leave behind when they fled the country. An object returns to its owner McGehee says she knew that her family had artifacts in Europe. Her parents, who lived in Minneapolis, first got involved in restitution efforts in the early 2000s, while she was in Denver, tending to her own family and career. Her great-grandfather died before she was born, and her parents rarely spoke of him. Without knowing anything about Siegfried Laemmle's life or business, she says she assumed the disputed objects were personal effects. Never in her wildest dreams would she have believed they were part of a massive collection culled from medieval estates and Bavarian courts, among other locales distant in time and place. She also knew that her parents were interviewed for the documentary, which aired in 2013 on German television. But she was not there for the interviews and she did not watch the documentary until 2016, after it was translated into English. She was floored by what she learned. ""That was my introduction to my family history. I watched it four to five times just thinking, 'what?' This is my mother's grandfather and I had no idea,"" she said. ""I couldn't grasp it at first. It didn't register, which is why I watched it so many times."" By then, her family had already received restitution from a museum in Vienna, where Austrian law compelled them to reach out. The discovery of the Weinmueller catalogs at Neumeister revealed more objects in museums in Germany, and her family began efforts to claim them. Ultimately, the museums offered to buy most of the items or sell them at auction, she said. The remaining items, antiques and household items of little value, were up for grabs if McGehee wanted them. So she traveled to Germany in last year and came home with a marble plaque. She met Stoll and Hopp and struck up a friendship. It's nothing fancy, she says of the plaque that now sits in her home. ""Just a marble thing that says Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so live here,"" she says. ""Really heavy."" But to McGehee and the others involved, it shows that it's never too late for justice. Or the truth."

On the surface, Taylor led a life that most people would envy. She was a widely sought-after speaker whose sermons were compared to ""literary gems."" Her books made the New York Times' best-sellers list. One made the cover of Time magazine. She appeared on Oprah Winfrey's ""SuperSoul Sunday"" show . Strangers approached her in grocery stores with reverence and awe. Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor is photographed inside the small writing cabin on on her farm in Clarkesville, Ga. on Thursday, April 18, 2019. Her new book is √íHoly Envy: Finding God in the Faith of Others.√ì But something happened to her as her reputation spread. She found herself drawn to ""someone else's rose."" She began to see beauty and truth in other people's religions. And she became so disillusioned with her own that she ""could not look it in the eyes."" Read More Taylor once called herself a ""detective of divinity"" for her ability to collect evidence of God's genius. But her spiritual wandering made her feel at times as if she was guilty of a crime. ""The fear rose up from a more primitive part of my brain that had been taught to fear a jealous God's wrath if I did not love him and him alone,"" Taylor says. This was the plot complication she faced in her story: What do you do when you're the superstar preacher, but you fall in love with other faiths more than your own? Easter morning would help give her an answer. A voice for anxious times A story about doubt may seem like an odd topic for an Easter weekend. The traditional Easter message is one of triumph: Jesus conquers death and sin through his resurrection. But this is a tough Easter for many Christians. Many don't feel so triumphant. Christianity is in crisis. Catholics are losing faith in church and clergy because of an ongoing sexual abuse scandal. Mainline Protestant churches are splitting apart over issues such as gay clergy. There are now more Americans who claim no religion than there are evangelicals and Catholics. Taylor holds eggs she collected from her chickens. She calls the animals on her farm members of her congregation. When the Notre Dame Cathedral recently erupted in flames, some saw it as a sneak preview of the church's future in the US. They warned that American churches are heading toward collapse . They envision a post-Christian future like Western Europe's: rapidly emptying churches and soaring cathedrals that no longer speak to people. Few, if any, contemporary Christian leaders speak to the spiritual restlessness of this time like Taylor. In her books ""Leaving Church"" and ""Learning to Walk in the Dark,"" she always seems to be in motion -- leaving one spiritual rest stop for another exit down the road. She has ""near perfect pitch"" for speaking to people's fears without leaving them hopeless, says the Rev. Thomas G. Long, another celebrated speaker. He was recently selected, along with Taylor, as one of the 12 most effective preachers in the English language in a prestigious preaching survey . ""She has such powerful gifts of language and narration that her readers and hearers find their own questions and concerns coming to expression in ways that prompt them to say, 'Yes, yes that's what I feel,''' Long says. Why Taylor is scared of true believers What Taylor is feeling on this recent afternoon is hungry. It's lunchtime when she receives a visitor at her secluded farm in the northeast Georgia mountains. Now 67 with a mass of dazzling white hair, Taylor motions to a spread in her kitchen that she's prepared for her guest. ""Deviled eggs, good turkey sandwiches,"" she says pointing to the food. ""You eat the rest because I'm not going to."" Taylor's farm looks as picturesque as a postcard: rolling meadows, mountains looming on the horizon, a sprawling porch decorated with swings and cushions. She even has a small writing cabin near her house where she goes to work without distractions. An introvert who craves solitude, Taylor often retires to a small cabin near her farm to write. One of her dogs greets the visitor at her farm's entrance with a few desultory barks. Then he trots away to frolic in a meadow. He has plenty of company. Taylor has two horses, two dogs, four cats, 11 guinea hens and more chickens than she can count. She shares the farm with her husband, Ed. They married in 1982, a year before she was ordained as an Episcopal priest. Fourteen years her elder, he was never intimidated, she says, by a woman in a clerical collar. ""We've both been stung when people shake my hand and completely ignore him,"" she says. ""He doesn't travel with me much for that reason, and it's a great relief to me that he doesn't because when I come home from a trip, he's there like the pool of fresh water at the end of a dusty road."" Taylor has been traveling a lot lately to promote her latest book, ""Holy Envy."" It describes what she calls the ""shock of meeting God in so many new hats"" when she taught a course on world religions at Piedmont College, a liberal arts school in north Georgia. The book carries on Taylor's tradition of what she calls, ""saying things you're not supposed to say."" She takes on questions that annoy some Sunday school teachers: Is Jesus the only way? Are all religions alike? If I love Buddhist meditation, can I still call myself a Christian? The book has attracted plenty of praise. Book critics and journalists tend to love Taylor's work. Time magazine once said that her writing ""rivals the poetic power of C.S. Lewis and Frederick Buechner."" Yet her critics often react just as strongly to her work. Some say she waters down Christianity's core beliefs with a self-indulgent theology of ""happy faces and pumpkins in the sky."" Others say she should add some social justice to her message -- try less poetry and be more prophetic. But others say her message is needed more now than ever. After Taylor spoke at Concordia College-Moorhead in Minnesota, Jacqueline Bussie, director of the Forum on Faith and Life at the school, said more Americans need to get a dose of holy envy. Taylor feeds her horse Billy. The horses, chickens and dogs on her farm are reoccurring characters in many of her stories. The US is the most religiously diverse nation in the world, but ""in this country you can graduate college and still have no clue about the religious practices, world views, and history of billions of people,"" says Bussie, author of ""Outlaw Christian."" ""This is negligence."" In person, Taylor is playful, expressive with her hands and self-deprecating. But her voice rises in exasperation when she recounts how some Christians depict her as an outcast pastor. She calls them the true believers. ""True believers are among the meanest people I've ever met,"" she says, stretching out her legs in a cozy living room filled with books on poetry, religious icons and a photo of her posing with Oprah. ""I cannot think of anybody of another faith who has wounded me like Christians,"" she says. ""Judged, condemned to hell, cast out of the body of the faithful -- look me up online."" Taylor, though, became one of her own harshest critics when she experienced a spiritual fear that she never saw coming. A pastor who does a little spiritual 'sleeping around' Her spiritual crisis had no dramatic backdrop -- no spiritual breakthrough on some vision quest alone in the woods. She says she lost her way in the church after she found a new home in the classroom. When she started to teach a college course in world religions, something odd happened. She was enthralled when teaching students about other faiths and taking them on field trips to mosques, temples and Buddhist centers. But when the class syllabus turned to Christianity, her fire sputtered. She started to feel as if she was spiritually ""sleeping around."" She started collecting Tibetan singing bowls, Hindu deities and Muslim prayer rugs. She felt as if she was a spiritual shoplifter. Taylor carefully shows the Tibetan prayer book she keeps in her library. But she was no mere theological tourist. She started to see beauty and truth in other religious traditions. She was impressed by Buddhists because they weren't interested in opposing any other religion or converting anyone. She was astonished by the graciousness of an imam who told her class after they visited a mosque: ""Our deepest desire is not that you become Muslim, but you become the best Christian, the best Jew, the best person you can be."" And she was ashamed to learn how much her own faith had ""scorched"" other religious traditions by the way the faithful treated non-Christians. ""I cannot think of anybody of another faith who has wounded me like Christians.""
Barbara Brown Taylor
""Belittled, patronized, infantilized -- treated as if they had never had a thought about the divine and sacred,"" she says. Taylor knew what she was taught: Jesus was the way, salvation is found in no other name, and at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow. But she also knew what she felt -- something sacred was speaking to her even when it didn't have the name Jesus attached to it. In one ""Holy Envy"" passage she writes: ""Through the years I have spent dozens of hours in the presence of Tibetan lamas who have spoken directly to my condition. Their talks have been as meaningful to me as anything I have heard from teachers in my own traditions... What can this mean?"" It couldn't mean anything good when she thought back to her days following a fear-based Christianity that she thought she had abandoned. Scriptures that declared that God was a ""jealous God,"" and passages where prophets described those who turned to other gods as whores flashed in her memory. Religious artifacts from around the world are displayed on the shelves of Taylor's library. ""The fear surprised me because it wasn't rational,"" she says. ""I had been a seeker long before I became a Christian so questioning everything was second nature to me."" Taylor says she felt like a little child, scared that she would lose her heavenly father's love forever. How could she find her way back? She opened her Bible and started reading about Jesus. Where Jesus found loveliness She was in for a surprise. Turns out the New Testament is full of Jesus' interfaith encounters. Some of the best-known stories about Jesus depict his admiration for those outside his religion, she says. She cites some of them in her book: Jesus being astonished by the faith of a Roman centurion who wanted his servant healed; the Samaritan leper who impressed Jesus with his gratitude; the Syrophoenician woman whose wit and love for her daughter caught Jesus by surprise. They were all people who worshiped other Gods or worshiped the same one Jesus did in an unorthodox way, she says. ""If anything, the strangers seem to change Jesus' ideas about where faith may be found, far outside the boundaries that he has been raised to respect,"" she writes in ""Holy Envy."" Taylor amplifies the point from her living room. Her voice rises in volume. She's no longer cracking jokes and laughing. She's going into preaching mode. ""It's all on the page,"" she says. ""It's on the page in the Bible about Jesus dealing with women, Syrophoenicians, Canaanites and Greeks, and he's not making distinctions. Nor is he trying to convert everybody. He's just dealing with people who are hungry."" Taylor collects greens growing on her farm for dinner. Taylor stopped seeing herself as the wayward child risking God's wrath because she was dazzled by the faith of others. ""Now I don't believe Jesus is mad at me for finding loveliness in the faith of my religious neighbors because he did the same thing,"" she says. Taylor's new Easter sermon There are still nagging questions, though, about where Taylor stands with her own faith. Have you stopped being a Christian? ""No, I haven't,"" she says. ""So that means I'm very aware Jesus never commanded me to love my religion. He said love God and your neighbor. That's about all I can handle day by day."" Do you still go to church? Taylor has gone to everything from a sprawling evangelical mega church to a tiny African-American Catholic parish and a storefront church in a strip mall in recent years. ""I worship every day,"" she says. ""Sometimes it's in churches, but other times it's around dinner tables, in airports, in city parks, and in the woods with wild turkeys."" Those answers, though, are the kind of poetic musings that still make some Christians suspicious. Is she more than ""happy faces and pumpkins in the sky?"" She doesn't sound like a person who is giving up on Christianity. In ""Holy Envy"" she writes: ""However many other religious languages I learn, I dream in Christian. However much I learn from other spiritual teachers, it is Jesus I come home to at night."" A painting called ""String Theory"" by artist Charles Barbier is seen in Brown's library. Easter morning also helps her find her way home. She still believes in the Easter story. She just doesn't believe that it represents the triumph of Christianity -- proof that Christians have a monopoly on religious truth. How can you believe in Easter without believing Christ is the only way? The way she now talks about God in the Easter story helps explain why. ""Jesus never commanded me to love my religion. He said love God and your neighbor. That's about all I can handle day by day.""
Barbara Brown Taylor
""These days I would say Easter is the eruption of life from a tomb as God's huge surprise, going in a different direction, and if anything, proof that you can never predict how God is going to act next,"" she says. Taylor's spiritual restlessness may continue to push her in different directions. But she no longer sounds afraid to look her faith in the eyes. ""Now I value Easter as the reminder that you never know where life is going to come from next, and there's no sense being attached to the day before yesterday because the day before yesterday is dead, and today something is alive,"" she says. She leans forward on her sofa and her expression turns solemn. She gets a faraway look in her eyes, and raises her hands as if in worship. ""So why not follow the life, and see where it leads, with some kind of trust in the spirits' ability to blow where nobody expected to blow, and in a direction nobody expected it to go into -- and be willing to be blown away."""

A member of an armed group detaining migrants at the border has been arrested by the FBI - CNN,us.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/border-militia-arrests/index.html,"(CNN) The FBI has arrested a member of an armed militia that had detained hundreds of migrants at the border this week, the New Mexico attorney general's office said Saturday.
Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, is a member of an armed group that had reportedly detained migrants near Sunland Park, New Mexico, state Attorney General Hector Balderas said in a statement. Hopkins -- also known as Johnny Horton Jr. -- was arrested on felony charges of being in possession of firearms and ammunition, according to a statement from the FBI's Albuquerque field office. Larry Mitchell Hopkins Earlier this week, videos posted online purported to show migrants being held by a militia known as the United Constitutional Patriots before being turned over to US Border Patrol. The footage prompted a condemnation from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, which in a letter likened the militia's actions to kidnapping. A militia group detained migrants at the border. The ACLU calls it kidnapping Read More ""This is a dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families,"" Balderas said. ""Today's arrest by the FBI indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes."" Hopkins is expected to make a first appearance in court on Monday, the FBI said. CNN was unable to determine Saturday whether he was represented by an attorney. CNN has reached out to the United Constitutional Patriots for comment, but has not heard back. A spokesman for the group previously said their actions were legal, ""comparing the detention of the migrants to 'a verbal citizen's arrest,'"" according to a report from The New York Times . Videos show armed men in masks, fatigues Various private militia groups -- often espousing anti-immigrant views -- have patrolled the border for years, but it's rare to see footage of an armed group detaining migrants on the US side of the border. Videos purported to show members of the group detaining migrants, including families with children, who have just crossed the border. CNN has reached out to the group and the individuals who posted the videos for comment but has not confirmed details about who shot the videos, or when and where they were recorded. In the footage, people wearing full military fatigues can be seen with handguns strapped to their sides, wearing gloves and black face masks. Armed men order the migrants to stop, force them to sit on the ground and then appear to call Border Patrol to pick the migrants up. In at least two videos posted on the group's Facebook page, a man in fatigues verbally identifies himself as ""Border Patrol"" when stopping a group of migrants. A US Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman declined to comment on the United Constitutional Patriots and the online videos, but said the agency ""does not endorse or condone private groups of organizations taking enforcement measures into their own hands."""
"Coachella, California: Woman caught on surveillance dumping plastic bag full of puppies - CNN",us.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/puppies-dumpster-coachella/index.html,"(CNN) The woman who authorities say was caught on video tossing a bag of newborn puppies near a dumpster in Coachella, California, last week was arrested on Monday. Authorities have also now discovered dozens of dogs living in her home.
Police arrested Deborah Sue Culwell, 54, outside her Coachella home, according to Riverside County Animal Services spokesperson John Welsh. Culwell could face up to seven counts of felony animal cruelty, Welsh said. Culwell was seen in the video leaving the seven newborn puppies in a plastic bag near a dumpster behind a NAPA Auto Parts store on Thursday afternoon, according to Riverside County Animal Services. Authorities are looking for the woman they say dumped a plastic bag full of puppies. Riverside County Animal Services officers discovered 38 dogs living in Culwell's home, which were ""not in great condition"" and not friendly, Welsh said. Read More Welsh said he didn't know what breeds of dogs were at the home. The dogs have since been taken to the Coachella Valley Animal Campus. Puppies may 'not have survived much longer' Commander Chris Mayer with animal services said he was building an animal cruelty case against the woman with the help of the Riverside County Sheriff's office and the District Attorney's office. A passerby discovered the bag, and a store employee then contacted animal services. The puppies were about three days old and believed to be terrier mixes, animal services said. ""If not for the Good Samaritan's actions, the puppies may not have survived much longer,"" said the county animal services in a release. ""The mid-day temperatures in Coachella on Thursday were in the mid-90s range."" Animal Service's veterinary team members cared for the puppies and found a rescue group to accept and bottle feed them, according to the release. ""There is no excuse for dumping puppies,"" Mayer said. ""Especially in today's age when we or other shelters would be willing to get these animals to foster parents or rescue partners. This was a shameful act."""
Social media influencer plotted to take internet domain at gunpoint. It didn't end well - CNN,us.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/us/iowa-social-media-influencer-domain-name-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The plan was like a bad movie script -- complete with an attacker in a puzzling outfit and a backup weapon.
The intruder entered a victim's home in Iowa carrying a cell phone, a stolen gun and a Taser. On his head was pantyhose and a hat, along with dark sunglasses to mask his eyes, court documents show. But things did not go as planned. Now, Rossi Lorathio Adams II could face two decades in prison. A jury found him guilty Thursday of hiring the intruder to break into the house in Cedar Rapids in 2017 to force the transfer of an internet domain at gunpoint, according to the US Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Iowa. Threats and gun emojis Read More Adams, 26, founded a social media company called ""State Snaps"" four years ago. The company operates on various social media platforms, including Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter, court documents said. ""At one time, Adams had over a million followers on his social media sites, which mostly contained images and videos of young adults engaged in crude behavior, drunkenness and nudity,"" court documents said. His followers often used the slogan ""Do it for state"" when posting videos and images. So, Adams tried to purchase the internet domain ""doitforstate.com"" from a Cedar Rapids resident who owned it, court records said. But the owner did not want to part with it. ""Between 2015 and 2017, Adams repeatedly tried to obtain 'doitforstate.com,' but the owner of the domain would not sell it. Adams also threatened one of the domain owner's friends with gun emojis after the friend used the domain to promote concerts,"" court records show. Then he had an idea: Why not take it by force? Cousin sentenced to 20 years In June 2017, Adams enlisted his cousin to break into the domain owner's home and force him to transfer it. The cousin drove to the domain owner's house and provided a demand note, which contained instructions for transferring the domain to Adams, court records show. After entering the home, the intruder grabbed the victim's arm and ordered him to connect his computer to the internet. He put the firearm against the victim's head and ordered him to follow the instructions. ""Fearing for his life, the victim quickly turned to move the gun away from his head. The victim then managed to gain control of the gun,"" court records show. The victim shot the intruder multiple times and called the police. The intruder, Adams' cousin Sherman Hopkins Jr., was sentenced to 20 years in prison last year. Now it's Adams' turn. He will remain in custody pending sentencing. He faces a maximum 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. Follow @faithmkarimi"
The pig farmer who became an internet sensation in China,us.cnn.com,"Julie Zaugg, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/asia/live-streaming-china-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""I don't want to be in this relationship anymore!""
""Why? Give me another chance!"" ""I don't like your haircut."" This tense exchange is taking place on a country lane bordered by chili fields in rural Guangxi, a southern province in China. Wu Nengji, a broad shouldered young man sporting an abundant shock of black hair, is arguing with his ex-girlfriend, an attractive girl wearing tall black boots, and her new boyfriend, whose hair is styled in an improbable bouffant. Read More It is the opening scene for Wu's latest mini-movie, lasting less than one minute. The 24-year-old videographer publishes his films on the Chinese streaming platform Kuaishou under the nickname Xiao Jiji, which means ""Little Lucky"" in mandarin. Wu Nengji shoots a scene for his video. He uses one smartphone and never does more than two takes. ""I don't really have a message to convey,"" he says. ""I just want to make people smile after a long day at work."" Once a hobby, Wu makes a living from his videos, earning between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan ($1,475 to $2,950) per month, about three to six times as much as a Chinese factory worker. All his revenue comes from his fans. They send him virtual gifts -- a sticker of a rose or a beer worth 1 or 2 yuan, for example -- which he can convert into real money. His story is far from unique. ""Some streamers barely earn a living and others have become billionaires,"" details Jian Xu, a communication specialist from Deakin University, in Australia. ""In northeast China, which has been badly hit by industrial decline, whole regions have been revitalized thanks to this new source of revenue."" Liu Mama, a northern granny whose feisty raps and regional dishes have become cult, is said to earn 1 million yuan ( $147,000 ) per month. China's streaming sensation In China, the streaming of short videos has become a massive industry. The first platforms, YY and Six Rooms, appeared in around 2008. They were soon joined by a host of competitors, such as Meipai, Huajiao, Yizhibo and Douyin. By the end of 2018, 648 million Chinese netizens regularly watched short videos, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC). The market for these was worth 11.8 billion yuan ($17.4 million), up 106% from the previous year. Most of these videos have showcased pretty young girls with pale skin and long eyelashes lip-synching to popular songs in studios made up to look like bedrooms. Cameroon bride and Chinese husband find fame online in China But in recent years, a few streaming platforms have popped up showing a grittier side of China. They host videos by people living in rural areas or in third- and fourth-tier cities. Many are based in the rust belt areas of the northeast. Kuaishou, which was created in 2011 and has 266 million monthly active users, is one of these. ""Young people living in cities like the videos on Kuaishou because they seem exotic to them, whereas migrant workers watch them out of a sense of nostalgia for the rural life they have had to leave behind,"" explains Zhicong Lu, a researcher from Toronto University who has studied the company. Millions of followers Wu Nengji started publishing videos on Kuaishou three years ago. He had just returned from Beijing, where he had spent several years working in dead-end jobs. ""I tried everything: waiting on tables, delivering food, but I just couldn't make enough money to live,"" he explains. Back in Hepu, the village he grew up in, he didn't know what to do with himself. So he decided to broadcast his everyday life. Since then he has produced more than 2,000 videos and has amassed 5.6 million followers. ""I use a single smartphone to shoot all my videos,"" he says. ""I only do one or two takes for each scene."" He uses the small alleys and fields surrounding his father's pig farm as a setting, embellished with an eclectic mix of accessories: a pink motorcycle helmet, a silver-haired wig and a plastic tiara. Some of his creations are poetic, showcasing his life on the farm and his troubles finding a girlfriend. Others are absurdist vignettes of him and his friends executing random dance moves to trashy techno music. Kuaishou is full of peasants plucking rice, fishers trying to catch eels and grannies cooking traditional recipes. ""Some farmers use these videos to promote and sell their produce directly to customers,"" says Jun Wen Woo, a video streaming expert for IHS Markit, an intelligence firm with expertise on China. Wu Nengji poses on the rural pig farm from where he streams mini movies across China. But it also has its own colorful universe. Kuaishou is where social shake, a collective street dance, was born. It is also the home of mic-shouting, a strange art form somewhere between a rap and rant. And it is full of unconventional characters who appeal to viewers' more voyeuristic instincts, such as a trio of sisters with brittle bone disease, a couple with dwarfism or a young girl who swallows live goldfish. Some content also rubs up against state censorship. During the winter of 2017, when the Beijing authorities started clearing out migrant workers living in tenement style housing, Kuaishou was the only platform to document the evictions. This didn't last long. In 2018, the site was asked to remove any videos deemed ""immoral,"" including a popular series about teen moms. Gone were the tattoos, swear words and sexual innuendo. ""Kuaishou had to hire hundreds of in-house censors to monitor all of its content,"" adds Zhicong Lu. But while tattoos and curse words have disappeared from the platform, Chinese netizens are quite crafty at finding ways to avoid censorship. Shooting a video It's mid-afternoon and a small group of twenty-somethings has started to congregate in front of Wu's farm. Some have their own streaming channel and are hoping to film a few scenes, others have just come to help out as extras. ""Most of them are childhood friends,"" says the videographer. Wearing black sweatpants, a blue hoodie and plastic slippers, Wu doesn't look anything like an internet star -- but here he's clearly in charge. He gets everyone to shuffle into a dusty shed where they start debating ideas for the next scene of his video. Everyone pitches in with a comment, a joke or a criticism. The air is thick with cigarette smoke and laughter. ""We often find a concept for the first five seconds of the video and immediately shoot it,"" he explains. ""We only sit down to discuss the overall concept afterwards."" To edit his videos, Wu Nengji uses a old computer with a screen that has no stand and is propped up against a chair. They settle on an idea: since Wu's girlfriend doesn't like his haircut, he will change it. Two of his friends grab a can of hairspray and start creating an intricate bouffant on the top of his head. The rest of the video shows him rejecting his enamored ex-girlfriend's pleas and parading around the farm with two friends. In three months, the video was viewed 7.7 million times, had 291,000 likes and generated more than 15,000 comments. ""At first, my parents were very critical,"" says Wu. They wanted me to get a job in a factory and send money back home. But when they saw how much I enjoyed making videos and that I could make a living from this, they changed their minds."" The sun is about to set. It is time for Wu Nengji to feed the pigs. He picks up a can of feed, mixes it with water and starts pouring it with a ladle into the trough. A bit later, he will sit down in front of his aged computer, which is covered in dust with a keyboard missing several keys, and edit his video. It will be live by tonight."
Ukrainians head to the polls for presidential elections with comedian on track for triumph,us.cnn.com,Kara Fox,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/europe/ukraine-elections-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Ukrainians were voting Sunday in the second round of presidential elections .
Television comedian and political newbie Volodymyr Zelensky was on track to cause a political upset, with recent polls, ahead of Sunday, suggesting an overwhelming lead over incumbent Petro Poroshenko. Zelensky's entry in the presidential race came as a surprise, given that he is perhaps best known for his role in the Ukrainian comedy series ""Servant of the People"" as an out-of-luck schoolteacher who abruptly becomes president of Ukraine. Despite his bid being initially dismissed as a protest vote and a joke, art may become reality after the 41-year-old challenger found support from an electorate tired of corruption and oligarchy. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, left, holds a debate with his electoral opponent Volodymyr Zelenskiy, right, at Olympiskiy Stadium on Friday in Kiev, Ukraine. Zelensky triumphed in the first round of voting April 1, receiving more than 30% of votes cast while Poroshenko, 53, came in second with 16% of the vote. Read More Poroshenko -- a billionaire businessman known for his ownership of chocolate manufacturer Roshen -- came to power in the aftermath of the 2013 pro-Western Maidan protests. He has since pursued a pro-European agenda despite opposition from Russia, first outlining a program of social and economic reforms that he said were aimed at preparing his country to apply for European Union membership in 2020. Yet his term has been plagued by suggestions of mass corruption and a flagging economy. Ukraine is one of Europe's poorest countries, with a growing number of people emigrating for better economic opportunities. In a bid to win over voters, Poroshenko ran on a militant patriotic platform and portrayed himself as a tough guy who could stand up to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. ""He personally, and the country he leads, are the biggest threat to Ukraine and to its every citizen,"" Poroshenko said about Putin in a Facebook post ahead of the vote. But it may be too little, too late for Ukrainians exhausted from a five-year proxy war with Russia. Ukraine's President is running against -- Vladimir Putin Ukraine and Russia have been locked in a long-simmer conflict since the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea by Russia in 2014.

In November, tensions with Moscow flared once again after Russia seized three Ukrainian navy ships and detained 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait, a strategic waterway.

Sri Lanka blasts: At least 138 dead and more than 400 injured in multiple church and hotel explosions,us.cnn.com,Sugam Pokharel,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/21/asia/sri-lanka-explosions/index.html,"(CNN) The calm of Easter Sunday was shattered by gruesome bombings that killed at least 250 people in Sri Lankan churches and hotels.
Though it's not clear who's behind the eight explosions that forced the country of 21 million people to go on lockdown, they are ""certainly acts of terror,"" said Manisha Gunasekera, high commissioner of Sri Lanka to the UK. An intelligence memo warning of a possible attack had circulated 10 days earlier, raising questions about whether more preventative measures could have been taken. ""Serious action need to be taken as to why this warning was ignored,"" Sri Lanka's Minister of Telecommunications, Harin Fernando, tweeted along with a photo of the memo. The document, titled ""Information of an alleged plan attack,"" is dated April 11 and signed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Priyalal Dissanayake. The explosions blew out the tiled roofs of churches and hotel windows, killing worshippers and hotel guests in the process.

""You can see pieces of flesh thrown all over the walls and on the sanctuary and even outside of the church,"" Father Edmond Tillekeratne, social communications director for the Archdiocese of Colombo, told CNN from St. Sebastian's Church, one of the explosion sites. He estimated that more than a thousand people had come to the church for Easter Sunday ""because it is a special day."" Many came from villages afar, he said.

Hide Caption 39 of 39 ""This is an attack against the whole of Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka is (a) multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural country, and the whole country comes together in celebration of Easter Sunday,"" Gunasekera said. The violence punctured a decade of relative peace in the country following the end of its civil war in 2009 -- where attacks were common during the 25-year struggle. Since then, Sri Lanka has turned itself into a popular tourist destination, winning the title of best place in the world to visit in 2019 from travel guide publisher Lonely Planet . Four days after the coordinated attacks, the Sri Lankan Health Ministry revised the death toll, saying 253 people had died. That toll is significantly lower than the 359 initially reported to CNN by a Colombo police spokesman this week. The health ministry cited the condition of remains and the difficulty in identifying them for the discrepancy. How the attacks unfolded St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo was severely damaged in the attacks. The first wave of attacks struck during busy Easter services at churches in the heart of the country's minority Christian community -- in the cities of Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa. More blasts ripped through three luxury hotels in the capital city of Colombo: the Shangri La, Cinnamon Grand and Kingsbury. The Shangri-La in Colombo said the hotel's Table One cafe was attacked just after 9 a.m local time. The hotel is popular with foreign tourists and the country's business community. Another blast rocked a hotel in front of the Dehiwala Zoo in Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia. The final blast struck a private house in Mahawila Gardens, in Dematagoda, during a raid in connection with the attacks, officials said. Three police officers were killed. ""When crime division officials started questioning the people in the house, two explosions occurred,"" police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said. ""One sub inspector and two constables of police have been killed."" Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe ""expressed his gratitude"" to the officers in a statement, according to state news agency Derena TV. Wickremesinghe reiterated that ""stern action will be taken against those responsible,"" the news agency reported. In all, the eight sites of explosions Sunday included: St. Anthony's Shrine, Colombo St. Sebastian's Church, Negombo Zion Church, Batticaloa Cinnamon Grand, Colombo Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo The Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo Near Dehiwala Zoo in Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia A house in Mahawila Gardens, Dematagoda ""There is also information that these have been suicide bombings carried out,"" Manisha Gunasekera said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility by any terror group. But seven people were arrested following the attacks, said Harsha de Silva, Sri Lanka's minister of economic reforms and public distribution. The victims came from around the world A Sri Lankan officer inspects a blast site at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo. Of the hundreds of people killed, about 30 were foreigners, de Silva tweeted . At least 20 foreigners were among those killed in the capital city of Colombo, hospital director general Anil Jasinghe said. The foreigners killed include at least three Indians, two Turkish nationals and two Chinese citizens, Sri Lanka's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Five British citizens, including two dual US-UK nationals, were also killed in the bombings, the statement said. Social media is cut off The Sri Lankan government blocked social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram while the investigation got under way. Facebook issued a statement Sunday offering its condolences to the those ""affected by this horrendous act."" ""Teams from across Facebook have been working to support first responders and law enforcement as well as to identify and remove content which violates our standards,"" the company said. ""We are aware of the government's statement regarding the temporary blocking of social media platforms. People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time."" Authorities order a curfew Police in Sri Lanka imposed an island-wide curfew from Sunday evening until Monday morning. In Colombo, the streets were eerily quiet, with hardly any cars on the road and no signs of bustling city life. Four guards carrying AK-47 rifles stood by a locked gate of a hotel not far from the Shangri-La, and bomb-sniffing dogs checked bags. Earlier, the country's authorities convened an emergency meeting involving the heads of the army, air force and navy, according to de Silva, Sri Lanka's economic reforms minister.

""We took multiple casualties to hospital. Hopefully saved many lives."" De Silva said rescue operations were underway, adding that emergency crews were operating in ""full force."" Christians were the apparent targets A tragic Holy Week culminates in an Easter Sunday horror Sri Lanka's minority Christian community appeared to be the main target of Sunday's attack. Christianity is a minority religion in Sri Lanka, accounting for less than 10% of the total population of 21.4 million. According to census data, 70.2% of Sri Lankans identify as Buddhist, 12% Hindu, 9.7% Muslim, and 7.4% Christian. It is estimated that 82% of Sri Lankan Christians are Roman Catholic. Sunday's attacks risk upsetting the country's fragile post-war peace. Tensions between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority led to a 25-year civil war between the Tamil Tigers, classified by the United States and others as a terrorist organization, and government forces. More than 70,000 people died in the fighting , which ended when Sri Lankan forces defeated the Tamil Tigers in 2009. In recent years, the country has witnessed a surge in ultra-nationalist Buddhism led by the Bodu Bala Sena, the country's most powerful Buddhist organization, which has pledged to defend the religion. Update: This story has been updated to reflect the death toll has been revised by the Sri Lankan Health Ministry."
Paris police use tear gas against 'yellow vest' protesters,us.cnn.com,Chandrika Narayan,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/world/paris-protests-tear-gas/index.html,"(CNN) Riot police unleashed tear gas at so-called yellow vest protesters in central Paris who marched Saturday for the 23rd consecutive weekend.

Officers counter protesters in Paris on April 20, 2019. The Paris prosecutor's office said 182 yellow vest protesters were placed in police custody.

There were protests in other cities including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille and Lille, Agence France-Presse reported. Police also fired tear gas in Toulouse, where thousands were demonstrating, according to Reuters. So-called ""street medics"" carry an injured protester amid tear gas. The ""gilets jaunes,"" or yellow vest, protests began as a campaign against a gas tax hike, but have morphed into a broader rally against President Emmanuel Macron's government.

Yellow vest demonstrators light a fire as they gather in the Bercy neighborhood to protest for a 23rd week in Paris. Macron is now set to make his announcement Thursday, according to Reuters. In his New Year's address, Macron referred to the movement without naming it. He acknowledged anger against injustice but said hateful speech would not be tolerated, and called on people to respect each other. He also has pledged to increase the minimum wage and scrap new pension taxes to appease the protesters."
Congress should initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump (opinion),us.cnn.com,Jeffrey Sachs,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/opinions/mueller-report-trump-congress-initiate-impeachment-sachs/index.html,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University . The opinions expressed those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) Congress should launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump for welcoming Russian interference in the 2016 election and trying to obstruct the Mueller investigation. Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors stare us in the face, and each day he remains in power is a day closer to the collapse of the rule of law.
Jeffrey Sachs Trump welcomed Russian interference in the 2016 election while signaling his readiness to shift US foreign policy in favor of Russia by ending sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed his security apparatus to hack DNC emails and launched a disinformation campaign to troll the elections through Facebook and other means, according to Mueller's report . While Mueller did not find conclusive evidence that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government on the hacking and disinformation campaign, they knew that Russia offered assistance and ""expected [the Trump campaign] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts."" The hacking and social media campaigns ""coincided with a series of contacts between Trump campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government,"" according to the Mueller report , which includes a lengthy list of these contacts. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for example, shared internal polling data with a Ukrainian business associate with links to Russian intelligence, and discussed his strategy to win votes in the Midwest. The Mueller report is shocking And when the US intelligence community assessed Russia meddled in the US elections, Trump took Putin's side and refused to fully acknowledge Russia's involvement . Read More What were Trump's overarching motives? The first, of course, was to win the election. According to Mueller, Russians offered to help the campaign . Ahead of the famous Trump Tower meeting in the summer of 2016, for example, an email to Donald Trump Jr. offering dirt on Hillary Clinton explicitly stated that the information was being presented as "" part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump ."" The second motivation was at least as pertinent. Trump's greed appears to match or exceed his lust for power. During the 2016 campaign, Trump was trying to secure a lucrative Moscow Trump Tower real estate deal. For that to succeed, Trump needed Putin's blessing. Trump's allies reportedly even floated the idea of giving Putin a $50 million luxury apartment in the Moscow Trump Tower, which may have violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . After the election, Trump repeatedly tried to shut down, curtail or limit Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's illegal actions. The second half of the Mueller Report spells out many instances in which the President tried to undermine the investigation, which only failed because Trump's staff failed to carry out his orders . Mueller's report looks bad for Obama The Mueller investigation ultimately uncovered three devastating facts. The first, of course, was the extent of Russia's election interference and the Trump campaign's welcoming of that interference -- a double whammy that delegitimizes Trump's election victory. The second was Trump's brazen Russian business proposal during the campaign. The third included various financial dealings, including the hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels. Trump poses a serious threat to this country. He tries to govern by one-man decree, declares phony emergencies to crack down on immigration, resists Congressional oversight and courts tyrants abroad. Cautious Democratic leaders are reluctant to launch impeachment proceedings knowing that a conviction in a Republican Senate is currently against the odds, but they should recognize three overarching issues. First, as a matter of duty, they cannot shrug off rampant lawlessness without empowering thuggery in the future. Second, they can launch impeachment investigations now without deciding yet on whether to move to a vote, during which they and the public will gain information. Third, Trump's conviction by the Senate, or his resignation, remain plausible outcomes. During Watergate, public opinion was divided, even on the issue of Nixon's resignation, but the truth prevailed. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Trump recklessly welcomed Russian interference in the 2016 election for political gain while he was pursuing personal business interests in Russia, and those actions, together with his brazen attempts to obstruct Mueller's investigation, surely constitute high crimes and misdemeanors justifying the launch of impeachment hearings. According to Mueller's findings, Trump has egregiously undermined the rule of law and bid US officials to do the same. Congress now must defend the Constitution and initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump."
How reviving cells in a pig's brain could change medicine (opinion),us.cnn.com,Ford Vox,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/opinions/pig-brain-experiment-medicine-vox/index.html,"Ford Vox is a physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine.

(CNN) It's 2019, and scientists can now r evive brain cells in a decapitated pig hours after death. While the pig brains did not come close to regaining consciousness, scientists noted metabolic activity in some cells, raising a host of ethical, religious and philosophical questions about life and death.
Ford Vox It's easy to overlook our underlying ignorance about how the brain produces consciousness with the blockbuster research published this week in the journal Nature . Still, this study could lead us to that seminal moment of the human brain understanding itself. Most importantly, this work could supercharge research into better repairing our most complex organ. While the Yale researchers who authored the publication made a huge leap forward in medical neuroscience, the work doesn't move us much closer towards the first brain transplant. Suspending a conscious brain in a vat of solution also remains the stuff of science fiction for now. Regardless, the experiment marks an important scientific achievement. The researchers retrieved pig heads severed at the neck from a food processing facility, surgically removed the brains and connected some of the arteries to a device they dubbed BrainEx, a contraption cobbled together from commercially available parts made by 15 different companies. One researcher told me the lab, filled with the wily array of tubing, pumps, analyzers, reservoirs and dialysis membranes ""looks like the junk closet in an oft-repaired spaceship."" BrainEx then pumped the brain with the artificial blood product Hemopure , a processed hemoglobin manufactured from cow's blood, which is key to the project's success. Given that Hemopure is used during transplants to keep organs alive longer, it makes sense that it was used to revive the cells in brains that had been without blood and at room temperature for four hours. Read More Researchers restore some function to brains of dead pigs, raising potential for human applications The fact that some people managed to survive hypothermia so severe that their hearts stopped beating probably gave researchers hope that their feat with BrainEx could work. But BrainEx's big advance actually isn't in reviving dead tissue -- it's long been known that we can see cellular function in tissues well after the host organism has died, and scientists have even done this with human brain tissue. What BrainEx offers is the possibility of keeping much of the brain alive separate from the body. This represents a new research model for experimental work on a whole array of brain injuries, not just the kind where the heart stops. By isolating the brain and hooking it up to BrainEx, scientists could potentially add various medications to the artificial blood stream to see how they work, and experiment with different repairing procedures on a living brain without dealing with the rest of the body. While the BrainEx technique raises questions about the blurred line between life and death, we're still a long ways off from seeing the practical applications of the study play out in hospitals around the country. In conducting the BrainEx study, scientists inflicted serious damage to the brain it was keeping alive -- they tied off all of the major arteries feeding the brain and brainstem save two major ones. In practice, this would cause numerous strokes, especially to the brainstem, which is in charge of directing all of the brain's output and input. Body Smart: Paralyzed man building a fully automated life And while the scientists showed that they were able to pump the artificial blood through the brain's arteries, many tiny blood vessels called capillaries remained closed off. The study presented the data in a bar graph without specifying the exact numbers, but it appears about 10% of capillaries didn't open up. A brain with 10% of its capillaries suddenly closed would be terribly dysfunctional, with widely distributed brain cell death. Proving individual cells can perform basic metabolic functions, or send a neural impulse when stimulated, is quite far from activating the complex networks that somehow generate conscious awareness, a process we still do not fully understand. A considerably more advanced technique producing far less brain damage would likely be necessary to see the alpha and beta electroencephalography waves we associate with consciousness. Looking at the possibility of a brain transplant, we currently have no means of connecting a brain to the spinal cord, or the brainstem to the head and neck nerves. A stroke at the brainstem can leave a patient temporarily or permanently with no control of the body and only limited eye movement. Brain transplant results would be far worse: no feeling, hearing, or sight, and with no tenable means for communicating with the outside world. The results of such a procedure, which no scientific review board would approve, would be even more horrific than what the Italian ""head transplant"" surgeon claims he wants to do one day.

The body isn't a machine, and death isn't flipping a switch. Biomedical scientists know this intellectually, but law and society do not understand this medical fact very well. Despite our current scientific limitations, it's not too early to consider the ethics of reviving consciousness in a disembodied brain, and question whether brain transplants should ever be allowed. In an accompanying Nature article , two bioethicists worry about what a brain life support system might mean for people awaiting organ transplants. Could death become such a blurry issue that families aren't willing to part with their loved one's remaining organs while they wait to see whether the brain might be revived? I suspect that by the time we are dealing with this dilemma, we'll have lab grown artificial livers, hearts and kidneys to fill such a void. The future is coming, with technologies that can be used for good or ill, but this study deserves more celebration than consternation. Better treatments for strokes, anoxic or traumatic brain injuries, and more, are closer at hand with this new research tool."
Why my friend Loujain al-Hathloul deserves to stand front and center -- and free (opinion),us.cnn.com,Urooba Jamal,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/opinions/loujain-al-hathloul-deserves-nobel-peace-prize-jamal/index.html,"Urooba Jamal ( @uroobajamal ) is a freelance journalist who writes about social movements and international affairs.

(CNN) I hadn't looked at the photograph in years. But then news came she faced the death penalty. When I looked at the photo again after so long, I could almost hear her characteristic laughter.
Urooba Jamal It was a photo of a group of us from the Pakistan Students' Association. Front and center in it was my friend, Loujain al-Hathloul. We were pictured together at an event in 2011 at our alma mater, the University of British Columbia (UBC), in Vancouver, Canada. I don't remember exactly, but Loujain probably had, as she often did, driven us to the Pakistani restaurant 40 minutes away from our school to pick up the catered food for the event. We had probably thanked her endlessly, as we often did, for taking us to the event from our dorms, our heels and outfits made of silk, chiffon and lace standing no chance in the Vancouver rain if we walked in them across our enormous campus. The same smiling young woman in the photo we unearthed now faced incarceration and worse for having dared to do the same in the country she grew up in: to drive. Loujain was arrested in May 2018 in the United Arab Emirates, where she had been living, and then removed to Saudi Arabia and detained. While the death penalty rumors thankfully turned out to be false, Loujain's ongoing ordeal is still grim: she faces a number of dubious charges and according to her family has been tortured and sexually harassed while imprisoned. What has been her supposed crime? Peacefully fighting for women's rights in Saudi Arabia. Read More Saudi Arabia cites UN job application as evidence against rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul Loujain is currently facing a closed-door trial, a trial in which a number of her fellow women rights activists have testified that they too were subjected to torture and sexual harassment while detained. The prosecutor overseeing the hearing, I learned from Loujain's brother, Walid al-Hathloul , is denying all allegations of torture. Her fourth hearing, which would have taken place April 17 -- the day she was named as TIME magazine's 100 most influential people of 2019 -- was abruptly adjourned. While Saudi media brand her as a traitor to the kingdom, and international media reduce her to a mere victim, her nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize for her groundbreaking work on human rights has been largely ignored. Concurrently, media continue to give far more airtime to the nomination of someone else who is far from deserving of the prize: US President Donald Trump. In an embarrassing gaffe that still pales in comparison to his multitude of indiscretions, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported Trump himself had asked Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to nominate him for the award, a claim Abe refused to deny . The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the Asahi report. Meanwhile the momentum for Loujain's nomination has come from multiple fronts: a recommendation in a New York Times op-ed by journalist Nicholas Kristof; from academics, such as the nomination by Bessma Momani in Canada; to written support from more than a dozen French scholars; to yet more nominations by politicians from Canadian MP H√©l√®ne Laverdi√®re to a group of MPs in Norway .

Saudi sisters who escaped oppression are now free 03:19 It is absurd that Trump's self-aggrandizing nomination is being given incessant attention, while someone whose peaceful and tireless work spanning many years for the advancement of all Saudi women remains locked behind bars. Loujain receiving the Nobel Peace Prize would send a strong message to the Crown Prince and his rogue gallery of miscreants: that despite their attempts to squander and squash the voice and spirit of a woman who dared to imagine a brighter future for Saudi women ‚Äî they will fail. Being named a TIME honoree has already shown that the international community has not only taken notice of her efforts, but are rightly lauding her accomplishments. Loujain would join the likes of previous winners such as Malala Yousafzai and Nadia Murad, women from imperialized nations who have overcome incredible adversity ‚Äî to only have their commitment to the liberation of women globally, strengthen. Loujain has suffered tremendously since her imprisonment almost a year ago, but she's deserving of the award for everything her efforts have accomplished: she's shown extraordinary resolve and bravery in ways that have galvanized women around the world. It wasn't too long after we had both graduated from UBC that Loujain returned to Saudi Arabia, and in her resolve to see women's rights advance there, she began to defy the driving ban and speak out against the male guardianship system. Shortly after her most recent arrest last year -- she had been arrested several times before that since 2014 ‚Äî the driving ban was overturned in June 2018. The Crown Prince reaped praise for the move, while our friend and other women actually responsible for the historic change were just beginning to undergo what has become their nightmare ordeal. While my sister is in a Saudi jail, Mariah Carey could use her voice to help her That's when Friends of Loujain sprang into action. We are a collective of Vancouver-based women who knew Loujain from our time together at UBC. In this last year, we've taken a number of actions to demand her release. We have been pleased to see growing international attention surrounding Loujain's case; without a doubt, her actions have inspired people globally. Meanwhile, even by Trump's own admission , there is hardly a popular movement behind his Nobel Peace nomination, while his approval rating as President remains low . Highlighting Loujain's conditions as a political prisoner is vital; however, the media ought to also showcase her peaceful activism over the years -- activism that ignited one of the biggest social reforms ever seen in the ultra-conservative absolute monarchy. As a Nobel Peace Prize nominee whose only delinquency has been to peacefully demand equal rights, only one outcome will deliver justice for Loujain: a full pardon that grants her immediate release.

Bengal tigers could vanish from one of their final strongholds - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Isabelle Gerretsen, CNN",04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/world/bengal-tigers-sundarbans-scn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Feared and revered, it's one of the world's most iconic creatures: the majestic Bengal tiger.
Already threatened by poaching and humans spreading into its shrinking habitats, researchers say that in just 50 years it could completely disappear from one of its last remaining strongholds -- a huge mangrove forest called the Sundarbans, which crosses India and Bangladesh. Over the past century, we've lost 95% of all the world's tigers, leaving less than 4,000 in the wild. Bengal tigers are found in a handful of Asian countries, but just a few hundred still roam free in the Sundarbans. Read More Covering more than 10,000 square kilometers, the low-lying area is shrinking rapidly, with some of its islands submerging as local sea levels rise much faster than the global average . Read: The most effective way to fight climate change? Between 2004 and 2015, the number of Bengal tigers fell from 440 to 106 in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. That number is ""dangerously low"" said Dipankar Ghose, director of the species and landscapes program at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), due to ""an escalating poaching crisis, habitat degradation and fragmentation."" Rising seas and less fresh water Earlier this year, a study modeled how much of the Sundarbans would remain a suitable habitat for tigers as global greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. It found that by 2070, the Bengal tiger could vanish from the Sundarbans as habitats are completely wiped out by rising sea levels, more extreme weather and increasing salt in the water and soil. 5 everyday foods that are making droughts worse Rising sea levels and a decline in rainfall have already increased the amount of salt in the water, causing Sundri trees -- from which the Sundarbans region gets its name -- to die, and shrinking the tiger's mangrove habitat, according to Sharif Mukul, the study's co-author and assistant professor at the Independent University of Bangladesh. It's also leaving tigers without access to fresh water, Mukul told CNN. ""Fresh water is crucial for Bengal tigers to survive,"" he said. ""If sea levels [continue] to rise, Bengal tigers might not have any way to [survive]."" Read: Climate change - do you know the basics? Illegal poaching has also greatly diminished Bengal tiger's main prey, the spotted deer, the study noted. The study does not take into account the impact of disease outbreak, poaching and prey reduction, Mukul said, meaning the actual scenario could be better or worse than projected. A tiger wearing a radio collar wades through a river after being released by wildlife workers in the Indian Sundarbans. Conflict with humans As their fresh water and food supply declines, Bengal tigers are venturing out of their habitat and closer to human settlements, sometimes resulting in fatalities. According to a 2013 study , at least three tigers are killed each year as a result of human-tiger conflict. An average of 20-30 people are reported to be killed by tigers every year in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans but the number is likely to be higher as many attacks are not reported because they involve people who have entered the tigers' habitat without a permit. But conservation efforts are reducing human-tiger conflicts, according to a group that works in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans. Anwarul Islam, chief executive of conservation organization WildTeam, told CNN that the number of tiger attacks and deaths have fallen in the past five years due to increased awareness of wildlife protection among local communities. WildTeam launched a tiger hotline in 2013 and a 24-hour patrol team who intervene if a tiger roams into a village. Best places to spot tigers in India A Bengal tiger in the Sundarbans. ""If a stray tiger comes out of the forest, people know that they will not be killed because of the tiger team. They feel safe,"" Islam said. But more needs to be done to preserve the tiger's habitat, he said, stressing that the tigers will have nowhere to go if the Sundarbans are submerged. Read: Stronger hurricanes could decimate forests, accelerate climate change Ratul Saha of the WWF Sundarbans Landscape program told CNN that to protect the Bengal tigers, India and Bangladesh should identify hotspots where mangrove plants and species are thriving, despite a lack of soil nutrients, and move these resilient mangroves to dying parts of the forest. ""It is crucial that the necessary steps be taken to increase climate resilience in the region,"" he said. ""For tigers, conservation efforts must remain focused on habitat restoration and protection."""

So, in addition to other newsgathering efforts, CNN had journalists who stood outside their offices. Journalists often call this a stakeout. Here, the CNN team lays out the backstory of their assignment and how this investment of time yielded big journalistic returns.
The first challenge for CNN's nearly 18-month stakeout of special counsel Robert Mueller was finding the man himself. It all started on a chilly autumn morning in 2017, watching the sun rise over southwest Washington. After a day of staking out what we suspected to be Mueller's base of operations, a man with a red backpack crossed the street. Peter Carr was known as Mueller's spokesman, and he unwittingly led us to paydirt: a set of glass doors leading to a plain office building -- a classic example of the form in a part of town that was once an industrial hub but is now full of concrete and glass office buildings. Over the next year, we glued ourselves to the various entrances to try to catch a glimpse of the comings and goings of the major and minor players involved in the investigation. Eventually, we discovered when Mueller zipped into work in his signature silver Subaru, and identified his team of prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff who also drove or walked into the special counsel's office. There were garages, loading docks, front doors -- all part of the office complex. But we couldn't be at the garage and the front door at the same time to catch everything. Often, it was a gamble about where to stand and watch and risk missing something important. Read More Spotting Mueller beyond his daily entrance and exit in his car was difficult. And then, about a year after CNN started staking out Mueller's office regularly, out of the corner of our eyes, through the lobby window, a tall, silver-haired man came out from one hallway. Two seconds later, he disappeared into another hallway. We ran to the side to the garage to see if we could catch the man leaving. Success. There he was -- the elusive Robert Mueller, spotted not just coming and leaving through the garage but in the lobby. So the coffee shop became ""our spot."" Not just to see Mueller. If we were perched at the right seat, we could partially see into the building's lobby and catch glimpses of people coming and going. Not to mention the special counsel team coming in and out of the cafe themselves given its proximity and convenience. It was a key moment for the four of us -- two different pairs of CNN reporters over the course of the 22-month investigation -- who took shifts in the daily routine of standing outside the garage and office building and sitting inside the coffee shop, observing the movements of various prosecutors and FBI personnel, marking the times and sending dispatches back to CNN's Washington bureau to help inform, and in some cases, advance the broader story. A passerby at one point jokingly dubbed the CNN team 'TMZ', after the site that makes ample use of paparazzi. But the point wasn't to ambush people by snapping pictures. The point was to help the public know what its government was doing. Time and time again, CNN was able to penetrate the wall of secrecy surrounding Mueller's team thanks to key observations and break news about what the special counsel was up to, from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's cooperation sessions to the secret indictment of Roger Stone . The work was sometimes thrilling, often monotonous and always continued no matter rain, sleet or snow. Countless hours were spent watching, and by extension, listening -- to music, podcasts, Russian talk radio for one journalist, or Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow's daily radio show in hopes of hearing something Mueller-related -- to pass the time. Even though the stakeouts could be exhausting, there were moments when the full weight of the responsibility would hit us. Often we were the only journalistic eyes and ears on the ground at Mueller's office -- not just for all of CNN, but all of the world. It was history. JUST WATCHED What's in the Mueller report? CNN breaks it down Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
What's in the Mueller report? CNN breaks it down 07:37 The daily plan Our mornings followed a pretty standard routine: one of us would arrive around 6:50 a.m., set up our camera by the garage, and look for Mueller and his team to arrive. Often at least one prosecutor or FBI agent beat Mueller into the office. Most came by car, but some walked in from a nearby Metro station. One frequently rode a motorized scooter. By mid-morning, we would move to the front entrance of the building, where a courtyard separated us from visitors, defense counsel and possible witnesses. We took hundreds of photographs of strangers we thought looked ""lawyerly"" entering and leaving the premises, and we were always on the lookout for clues. At lunch, we waited for prosecutors and FBI personnel to emerge for Korean BBQ or Mexican food at the nearby food trucks, and sandwiches at the coffee shop. The daily lunch hour was our opportunity to spot anyone we had missed that morning and conduct a final headcount of who did or didn't show up to work that day. Afternoons were generally slower -- though not always. Finally, by 5 p.m., we would sweep the area, check for any departures and then head out. Of course, we were not invisible -- that wasn't the aim. And while the special counsel team was famously tight-lipped, sometimes they had questions for us. On one federal holiday, prosecutor Aaron Zebley with the special counsel's office stopped to ask us if Mueller had yet to arrive, knowing we probably had the answer. (We did -- Mueller wasn't in yet.) But the team was guarded, respecting their boss' serious ""no leak"" policy. Questions about the investigation were off the table. Polite hellos and 'how are yous' were the only things exchanged. (The special counsel's office is aware of this story.) Sometimes journalists from other organizations were there, often not. And we were right in the middle of it, even if we were just standing on the sidewalk. Paul Manafort and the ice cream social There was a rhythm to Mueller's office -- so changes from the ordinary helped us decipher what was happening. Like on September 13, 2018, when there was free ice cream in the plaza. Mueller's team was approaching a deal with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, but you never would have known it from the tiki-themed ice cream event the building management threw in the courtyard. The courtyard outside of Mueller's office was full of people -- including members of the special counsel team like Carr, prosecutor Michael Dreeben, and several FBI agents -- who all came down for free scoops. Carr even returned for seconds. Then, a big clue. At 2:40 p.m., when a paralegal who we knew to be part of the Manafort defense team went into the nearby cafe, emerging with a pizza, four sandwiches and four sodas -- just enough, we surmised, for himself and Paul Manafort's three lawyers. At the end of the day, a black Dodge Durango left the Mueller's office loading dock -- half an hour after Mueller left. (The Durango was one of many ordinary, plain vehicles the special counsel's office used to transport witnesses and members of the team.) Mueller's report leaves open possibility of post-White House criminal exposure for Trump About a week later, the proffer sessions began in earnest. While the rest of the country was gearing up for the midterms, Manafort and his legal team were visiting the special counsel on a nearly weekly basis, adding up to a total of nine sessions. It was during many of these sessions when, we later learned, Manafort was later accused of lying to prosecutors. Every morning, we were on the lookout for what would come first: a black government car with tinted windows which we figured out was transporting Manafort from jail and into the loading dock, or Manafort's lawyers coming in on foot -- often led by lead defense attorney Kevin Downing ready with a joke. How are negotiations going with the Mueller team? ""Just having lunch, tacos around the corner,"" he said, holding the bag open to see, before moving on. Why they were there following Manafort's agreement to waive having an attorney present as part of his plea deal? He motioned across the plaza: ""There's great sandwiches over there."" The mystery case Over time, we trained our eyes to recognize not only Mueller from where we sat in the coffee shop but everyone else we knew who worked at the special counsel's office, whether they were walking toward us or away from us, or with a crowd of people. (The government shutdown, which drastically reduced foot traffic in the plaza, helped confirm this as well.) At the same time, any deviation caused consternation in the CNN office. One day in December 2018, Mueller wasn't seen coming in, and an email returned half-jokingly with:""SO MUELLER IS MISSING?!"" The unofficial FBI uniform of a bright white dress shirt -- Mueller does not like his team wearing shirts with patterns -- and a dark suit helped to spot people from far away, too. We realized that when a group of people -- prosecutors, FBI agents, DOJ paralegals or administrative personnel -- headed to the garage, we could catch them leaving and send a heads up to our colleagues at US District Court, roughly five minutes away. We could run to the side to the garage, too, to see which tinted car they left in and in which direction they were headed. JUST WATCHED Mystery grand jury in Mueller probe explained Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Mystery grand jury in Mueller probe explained 02:10 We reverse-engineered this method as well; if we saw a car drive into the special counsel's office, we could run to the front to see who was coming up from the garage and into the lobby elevators. On December 14, 2018, a hearing at the DC court of appeals about a mysterious grand jury subpoena was to occur. The case, long suspected to be related to Mueller's investigation, was sealed and secretive -- the court had taken great precautions to keep the identity of the defense lawyers and prosecutors anonymous by clearing the entire fifth floor of any journalists. RELATED: Mystery Mueller mayhem at a Washington court As the press corps teamed up to stake out the courthouse, we knew that members of the special counsel's office drove out in a black DOJ car that day, and they would presumably drive the car back. We waited at the side for the car to return and ran to the front where we observed prosecutors Zainab Ahmad, Dreeben, Andrew Weissmann, Elizabeth Prelogar and one other person emerged from the garage. Our stakeout again paid off helping us fill some gaps in the story we reported later that day . From spots to scoops Of course, Manafort wasn't the only high profile witness being ushered quietly into the special counsel's office earlier that year for hours of interviews. In January 2018, we spotted a man with a dark overcoat and brown suitcase exiting Mueller's office, flanked by two people who appeared to be legal assistants. The trio hurried out of the front entrance and got into a dark car, but we were able to snap a quick photo from our post on the sidewalk. We later identified that the older man was a prominent white-collar attorney, Tom Green. This led to CNN's scoop that former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates had quietly added Green to his defense team and that Gates was nearing a plea deal with the special counsel. Gates, not known for grabbing headlines like other witnesses in Mueller's probe, turned into one of Mueller's most significant witnesses, testifying against his former boss Manafort. One night in early February 2018, someone we hadn't seen before exited the building. We later identified the man as veteran pollster and political strategist Tony Fabrizio, which led to CNN's report that he had been interviewed by Mueller's team . Fabrizio had previously worked on Ukrainian elections with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and went on to serve as the Trump campaign's chief pollster. The hunch that helped CNN get Roger Stone's arrest on camera Slight deviations from anyone's routine signaled something important, we came to believe. Prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky, for example, frequently zipped into work on a motorized scooter before walking past us and looking down at his phone. But on one memorable Thursday in January, something was different. Zelinsky walked into work with a small suitcase, a plastic bag and his usual black messenger bag. His charcoal helmet, which he wears while usually scootering or biking into the office, was noticeably absent. We knew Zelinsky was one of the Mueller prosecutors working on matters relating to Roger Stone, Jerome Corsi and WikiLeaks. Corsi's stepson was scheduled to testify that day in front of the grand jury, and we knew there had been speculation for months that Stone could be indicted.

Video shows FBI at Roger Stone's house 01:16 Roughly half an hour later, we spotted Zelinsky and an FBI agent leaving the special counsel's office in a tinted car we had previously identified as a car used by Mueller's team. Zelinsky and Andrew Goldstein were later spotted at court for what our court reporter believed was a convening of Mueller's grand jury. Was an indictment coming? As it happened, both Sam and Em were at the stakeout that afternoon since one of us (we won't say who) locked the stakeout car key, along with their jacket and bag, in the car. It was a chilly day, so as we waited for help we decamped to the coffee shop to stay warm -- where we then spotted Zelinsky leaving the office in casual clothes with his suitcase and briefcase. He then walked down the street to a nearby hotel, where he hailed a cab. Earlier in the day, we thought that perhaps the suitcase contained materials or documents, but Zelinsky's early departure in casual clothing didn't make sense. Back at the CNN office, reporters covering the investigation put this clue, along with the grand jury session on a Thursday, rather than the usual Friday, together and guessed that Stone may have been indicted. CNN sent a producer and camera to his home in Florida that night, and sure enough, less than 12 hours later, captured the dramatic pre-dawn arrest on video. Zelinsky showed up in the Florida courthouse for the Stone appearance. RELATED: How CNN captured video of the Roger Stone raid The end of the investigation By the time Mueller's investigation wrapped up last month, we had plenty of company outside the building. Mueller's ranks of prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff deviated from routine to avoid the gaggle of cameras stationed at the front of the building and other press in general. ""Oh, here we go again,"" one passerby scoffed as she walked past the gaggle of cameras and into one of the neighboring buildings. Of course, the gathered reporters knew Mueller was not about to walk out with the report in hand and give a press conference. But the press corps was ready for something to happen. Things had already gotten a bit odd. On one memorable afternoon in February 2019, about a month before the report was submitted, we noticed a commotion in the lobby of Mueller's office building. A few minutes later someone in a bird costume ""flew"" towards the lobby entrance. Whoever it was then danced, flapped their wings, and ""mooned"" the press corps assembled outside. They then flapped their arms and ""flew"" back to the elevators of the steel and glass building. . @FossumSamuel 's best update from #CNNStakeout today:

‚Äî Katelyn Polantz (@kpolantz) February 22, 2019 The day the report was submitted, March 22, it was likely handed to the Justice Department between 11:45 a.m. and 1:10 p.m., during which we saw Mueller's head of security drive out of the building in SCO vehicles with tinted windows. By 4 p.m., every prosecutor we spotted entering the office that morning was gone for the day. Scott Meisler walked out with a backpack and suitcase, turning the tables and stopping briefly to take a photo of the flock of cameras outside. Rush Atkinson, Dreeben, James Quarles, Goldstein, Prelogar, Zebley and Adam Jed had all either driven or walked out of the building. Aaron Zelinsky, the last man standing, left at 3:38 p.m. Where was Mueller? One minute later, the head of the special counsel's security sped out of the garage and drove north in the silver Subaru with no one else inside. The press outside the garage buzzed for the first time all day. About 10 minutes later a woman in a compact car drove out of the special counsel's office building saying, ""He's coming, he's coming."" Then, the silver Ford expedition drove out of the building. Was Mueller inside? We can't say for sure. But all clues suggest he was, because this car -- a vehicle that CNN's stakeout team has previously seen used to transport witnesses and persons of interest -- was likely used to bring him to work early in the morning.

"Pentagon, DHS considering designating fentanyl a WMD, memo says - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,David Shortell,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/dhs-fentanyl-wmd/index.html,"(CNN) Top military and Homeland Security officials are considering classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, according to an internal DHS memo.
The synthetic opioid, blamed in health surveys for surging drug overdose deaths in the United States, has for decades concerned national security officials because of its potential widespread lethality in terror attacks, and in recent months, officials from DHS and the Pentagon have met to discuss an official WMD designation as a tool to disrupt the drug's widespread availability on the black market, the memo says. ""Fentanyl's high toxicity and increasing availability are attractive to threat actors seeking nonconventional materials for a chemical weapons attack,"" the DHS assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction, James F. McDonnell, wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the military news publication Task & Purpose . A DHS official confirmed the authenticity of the memo, which was sent to then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in February. The national security threat posed by fentanyl has remained largely out of the public eye, but the Trump administration has made thwarting its illegal distribution a centerpiece of the campaign against the opioid crisis. Read More China announces new crackdown on fentanyl in win for US President Trump Fentanyl and its derivatives were behind 30,000 of the 72,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2017, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Versions of the drug, which has legitimate medical use as a painkiller, are widely produced in China and can be purchased on the dark web in the US. Mexican cartels and elements of the heroin trade have been known to use fentanyl as an additive to increase the potency of other illegal drugs. Late last year, after pressure from the Trump administration, the Chinese government said it would add fentanyl to its list of controlled substances in a significant shift that aims to curb the drug's manufacturing in the country. Congress has also set new standards on the US Postal Service that will help customs inspectors screen and interdict packages with fentanyl and other opioids at ports of entry. ""Disturbingly easy"" to weaponize Despite these efforts, it would be ""disturbingly easy"" to use the drug in a chemical attack, said Andy Weber, the former assistant secretary of defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs. ""Now that there's actually a market where one can buy large quantities of fentanyl analogues, it eliminates the capability gap and it makes it accessible to terrorist groups,"" Weber said. ""It's a game changer. In my lifetime I've never seen a weapon of mass destruction that is part of an existing black market."" There are other officially-designated WMDs that are made from easily obtainable items, like ricin, which is extracted from the castor bean, though weapons experts said the threat posed by fentanyl and its derivatives are more significant. ""It's as bad as it seems,"" said a government consultant who requested anonymity to discuss countering-WMD projects he has worked on. ""Because of its strength, it's like nothing else that we've seen, beyond radiation, nuclear, chemical and high explosive. It's something that is potentially very, very dangerous."" Fentanyl could be weaponized to devastating effect through its distribution in air and water systems. US defense officials first noted the danger of a fentanyl attack when the Russian military in 2002 pumped it into the ventilation system of a theater in Moscow that had been taken over by Chechen rebels, according to Weber. Dozens of hostages were killed by the fentanyl gas, along with the insurgents. ""That's when we at the Pentagon started to realize that militaries were developing fentanyl analogues as a form of chemical weapon and that we needed to start working on countermeasures,"" Weber said. Formal designation proposed According to the memo, there has been ""reinvigorated interest"" in addressing fentanyl as a WMD ""due to the ongoing opioid crisis ,"" and in recent months, senior DOD leaders, including the commander of the US Southern Command, have proposed the formal designation. Another former Defense Department official, who requested anonymity to speak to CNN about sensitive topics, said the current consideration of fentanyl as a WMD is part of a broader discussion between national security officials around the classification of pharmaceutical-based agents. DHS also had ""informal discussions on the topic"" in the first two months of this year between its sub-agencies and a number of DOD divisions, McDonnell wrote in the memo. In statements, DHS and US Southern Command both said that they are ""constantly assessing"" a range of threats in partnership with other agencies, but declined to comment on the specifics of those conversations. Countering illegal shipments Designating fentanyl as a WMD would allow national security officials to more effectively divert resources to building technology that could detect shipments of fentanyl. The Defense Department has been developing capabilities against non-traditional chemical weapons, like fentanyl, according to the memo, but ""certain operational [countering weapons of mass destruction] entities at DOD and elsewhere have been slow to act due to concern of getting pulled into the counter-narcotics mission,"" the memo says. An official WMD designation would also open up new tools for prosecuting the illicit distribution of the drug. ""It's going to enable them to get moving on the ability to stop big shipments of it quicker and easier,"" the government consultant said."

Watched by rockstar Bruce Springsteen and Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, the tight course in the compact, sandy arena of Miami Beach saw seven riders retire in the first round while only three went clear in the jump-off on a hot and humid day. ""It was tough sport, it was of the highest level sport, but it's normal, it's Global Champions Tour, the best riders of the world,"" said Devos. ""It was difficult, it was very delicate jumping, faults everywhere. That's why I was so happy with my mare, Claire, she jumped amazing."" The Global Champions Tour, show jumping's richest circuit, consists of a record 20 stops in 2019, including new venues in New York, Montreal and Stockholm. The season will finish with the GC Prague Playoffs November 21-24.

Tops-Alexander, a two-time overall winner, watched from the warmup arena as the next four riders -- Olivier Philippaerts of Belgium, Daniel Deusser and Christian Ahlmann of Germany and Britain's Scott Brash -- all failed to jump clear. Devos entered the arena as the sixth rider knowing that a clear round would guarantee him a spot on the podium. He expertly guided his mare around the course, taking a tight turn into the last jump to finish in the same time as Tops-Alexander, but taking the lead as he made no mistakes.

The seventh rider, Sweden's Malin Baryard-Johnsson, also had a clear round with H&M Indiana, but finished 1.1 seconds slower than Devos, and ended third. Would the last rider, the experienced Smolders of the Netherlands, spoil the party for Devos? For most of his ride, Smolders was ahead of Devos, only for Don VHP Z to finish in second place in 37.42 seconds as he took a wider turn going into the final jump. ""Considering that the poles were falling quite a lot, I didn't take maybe all the risk but I knew Harrie was also a very fast candidate after me,"" Devos said. ""It was really until the end that I was a bit stressed to be second, but it worked out and I am super happy."" READ: Spectacular Miami Beach hosts Longines Global Champions Tour Jennifer Gates, daughter of Bill, was in action on the sand of Miami Beach. Azure blue waters The scenic surroundings of the Miami Beach course, built against a backdrop of the azure blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean, proved to be an inspiration for Devos, who had been on the podium twice before in the Florida beach resort. ""On the beach here, it always goes well with me, so I am very happy to come back every time,"" said Devos, who now leads the overall LGCT rankings with 88 points, five points clear of Deusser and 16 points ahead of Smolders. ""It gives me a super-feeling. When you enter the ring here, you see the sea, I don't know what it is, but it gives me a lot of luck here.""

Earlier in the day, the Global Champions League team event went down to the wire after no teams managed to produce a double clear during the first round on Thursday, which saw New York Empire being eliminated. After Shanghai Swans swept the first two legs of the GCL, Miami Celtics pulled off a sensational home win as the Irish duo of Shane Breen and Michael Duffy produced a double clear on Saturday to finish with a total of six penalties. ""We've had our ups and downs, and it's nice to come back here on home turf,"" Duffy told a news conference. When asked if he had felt any pressure after his team mate and friend had gone clear, Duffy said: ""Pressure is for tyres."" St Tropez Pirates, with Athina Onassis of Greece and Devos, were in second place with a total of seven penalties, while Emil Hallundbaek of Denmark and Baryard-Johnsson kicked off their new partnership for Berlin Eagles with a third-place finish, on eight penalties. The Celtics, who had been lying in fourth place after the first round, moved to third place in the overall classification with 59 points, just one behind St Tropez Pirates. The Swans, the winners in Doha and Mexico City, remain the overall leaders with 79 points. After Doha, Mexico City and Miami Beach, the Global Champions Tour now heads to Asia, with Shanghai hosting the fourth leg on May 3-5."
