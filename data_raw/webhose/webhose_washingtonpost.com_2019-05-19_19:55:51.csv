On Parenting- Meghan Leahy took your questions about parenting,live.washingtonpost.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://live.washingtonpost.com/onparenting0327.html,"On Parenting: Meghan Leahy took your questions about parenting Mar 27, 2019
Meghan Leahy, a parenting coach with Positively Parenting, joined On Parenting editor Amy Joyce to talk about parenting children of all ages. Amy Joyce
Good morning, folks. We're here and ready to take your questions about parenting. Did you see Meghan's column today about how to ensure your only child isn't isolated ? Lots of great info and guidance here, not just for people with singletons, actually.
Here are Meghan's columns . And On Parenting is right here. Please don't forget we have an On Parenting newsletter than lands right at your inbox... It sums everything up twice a week. How easy is that?
Okay, good questions are here waiting. Join us, pop in with your own questions and comments. Let's discuss parenting. Q: Parental anger and shielding kids
Dear Meghan, My husband is going through some real trials personally, and due to some logistical complications in our current location, is not able to get any help right now. I think he is probably dealing with some untreated anxiety and depression issues that are manifesting as anger. The simple result for our kids is a super short-tempered dad who hollers way more than he should. Our kids are 3 and 6, and our six-year-old is definitely pushing boundaries, which sets my husband off. He's also short-tempered with me, which I am clear is modeling terrible behavior for my kids. I know this situation is not ideal, but for a few more months we are going to have to muscle through. My current approach is to try to buffer where I can, redirecting kids and husband as possible, but I am so weary of essentially trying to solve squabbles between a grown man and a child. I also can't be present full time, as I am the primary breadwinner. I know I need to get help for my husband sooner rather than later--do you know of any good online resources or others to help improve parenting strategies? I'm open to other suggestions too, and I am working on the game plan to solve this for my kids. I'm starting to consider divorce, but my biggest fear is that in a modern custody situation, they are going to end up with more unbuffered time with their father, which strikes me as the worst possible outcome, even worse than the current situation. Please help me. A: Meghan Leahy
1. I have an awesome online class, but tons of great parenting experts do, too. I am obvs going to recommend mine, not bc I am the best (ahem), but because it specializes in your ages. Here is a good list of classes, too.
2. Talk to a lawyer, STAT. You are right to worry about custody. You want to talk to someone and document the heck out of EVERY SINGLE THING you are going through.
3. While you are at it, get a therapist for yourself (I know, it's a lot). But there is a chance you are experiencing verbal and emotional abuse, yourself.
Given where you need to put your resources (money and time), I would say 1) LAWYER and 2) THERAPIST for yourself.
You are right to act as a buffer and please help your 6 yo move as much of his aggression out as possible. When a main attachment (father) is aggressive and scary and mean, this level of insecurity in a children results in chronic frustration and aggression. It is odd to say, but it is healthier to see your child act out his aggression than be beat down by it and have it turn inward.
Give names to his emotions...and say ALOUD that how Daddy acts is NOT okay. We want to bring language to his anger and fear. As he tantrums, name the emotions and see if it lands on him....see if he feels FELT. He is too young to name all of his emotions and react to them with maturity (all of the time), and that's especially true if his main attachment is hurting him. It is confusing to love someone who hurts you. Just try to bring LANGUAGE to that...
Get your plan together, STAT.
I am thinking of you over here, and write in if you need more."
"Moving a garden cross-country, ﬁghting a pest issue and more - San Antonio Express-News",live.washingtonpost.com,The Washington Post,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://live.washingtonpost.com/gardening-0418.html,"Moving a garden cross-country, ﬁghting a pest issue and more The Washington Post Published 9:49 am CDT, Wednesday, April 24, 2019
Gardening columnist Adrian Higgins answered questions recently in an online chat. Here is an edited excerpt.
Q: My kid really wants to plant some strawberries, and I have no idea how to go about it. We have an enclosed bed of dirt in a sunny spot. Should I get seeds, or can I buy strawberry plants at a nursery. And is this the right time to plant?
A: It's sort of too late for seed starting, and seed starting is something you graduate to as a gardener. You can buy plants now. They should be set in a sunny, well-prepared and weed-free bed and given a mulch (of straw, hence their name) to keep moisture even. When the fruit develops, you will be in a race with the animals to harvest them. Netting might be in order, though that comes with its own challenges. Alpine strawberries are smaller, tastier (to my palate), function in partial shade and yield for much longer.
Q: I'm moving cross-country and am thinking of driving from the West Coast to the East Coast. I have a lot of plants I would be very sad to leave behind because I've put a lot of effort into nurturing them over the years. Do you have any suggestions for packing them up for the drive? I don't think shipping would be feasible.
A: I don't know what sort of vehicle you have, what plants you have or their size, so this is a general response: If they are in pots, you could place them in plastic crates to keep them from tipping and jostling. However, if you don't have the room for pots, I would take each plant out of its current environment, keep much of the soil around the roots, wrap wet paper towels around the roots, add plastic bags and lay them carefully in cardboard boxes. I would soak all the plants well a day before digging/unpotting. They should be OK for a few days like this. Do not leave them in a hot, parked vehicle for very long, however. When you arrive, you will have to quickly re-pot them and get them in their preferred light conditions. Do not transport plants unprotected in the open bed of a pickup truck.
Q: I've got the basics in my herb garden: rosemary, oregano, tarragon, sage, parsley, chives and basil. Are there others, either annual or perennial, that you think would make an especially interesting or useful addition to the garden?
A: Lavender has a limited culinary use but is such a pretty and evocative herb. I am a big fan of cilantro and chervil - best grown in spring and fall in the mid-Atlantic, and easy from seed.
Q: I live in an old apartment and have had a lot of really weird insects crawl out of my AC vent. I've found that a couple of different insects have made their home in my house plants, including centipedes and sow bugs. The bottom trays of some of my plants have tiny baby insects crawling all over (while mature bugs live throughout the soil) and I'm not sure what to do about them once I move out. I've used neem oil for pests such as aphids and red spider mites, but I'm not sure what the best practice is for this situation because the soil itself seems infected. Is it best to just re-pot the plants?
A: I used to think sow bugs were harmless until last year, when they multiplied like crazy (I think because of the rain) and started rasping away at my carrots. If you have tenacious pests in your houseplant soil, one way to deal with them is to fill up your bath and submerge the pots overnight. Don't forget to drain them the next day.
Q: The previous owner of our home planted many beautiful flowers in the garden but also planted morning glory. The morning glory grows very quickly and chokes the other plants without constant maintenance and pruning. What are your tips for getting rid of the plant entirely?
A: This is very deep-rooted and almost impossible to dig out, and I don't use herbicides, so I just pull the vines as they grow. Eventually. this will weaken them and they go away. Make sure that none of the seed pods from last year are still about.
Q: We want to clean out the brush in our yard and plant evergreen trees. Is there a best time of year to do this? Is it OK to clear and plant at the same time?
A: I think unwanted and uninvited plants can be grubbed out at any time. My favorite tool for this is a mattock. Beware of burgeoning poison ivy. You could plant now, though make sure the roots are correctly manipulated, set at the right level and given a light mulch. The best time to plant most woody plants is in late summer or early to mid-fall.
Q: We're trying to start some hot peppers from seed this year and haven't had much success. Almost all started out OK, then died. Out of about 80 seeds started, about 10 are still alive. I know we're too late to restart this year. Any tips on how we could be successful next year?
A: If they germinated and then suddenly collapsed, they died of a fungal disease called damping off, associated with cool soil and insufficient air circulation. My advice for peppers is to give them bottom heat by way of a heat mat; this speeds germination and minimizes fungal issues. At this point, I would buy pepper transplants for setting out in early May.
Q: Last fall, I noticed deer were eating my ivy leaves but leaving the leaf stalk. Now, in the spring, most of my ivy is dead. Vines are brittle and dead. The only places ivy leaves are seen is under bushes or places difficult to reach because of a rocky landscape. Is there a connection to the deer?
A: I think not. Ivy is prone to a bacterial leafspot disease, for which the remedy is to cut out all the dead branches. English ivy, by the way, is considered a passe plant because when it matures and seeds, it becomes a major invasive weed in natural areas.
Q: Is there anything I can do to save an old, declining dogwood tree? This spring it has more dead branches than in past seasons.
A: When any tree is declining, pruning out the dead branches becomes essential. Often they are diseased, and the pathogen makes its way down the vascular system. Once it reaches the trunk, it's game over.
Q: Crabgrass is the bane of my existence. It is quite persistent across our rather large yard. We try to dig it up, but it is very difficult to stay on top of all of it. Are there any safe, organic treatments to suppress crabgrass?
A: The one I know of is corn gluten, which has the added benefit of feeding the lawn. The downside is that it's more expensive than chemical treatments and may need repeated applications.
Q: I'm an amateur gardener who is filling in for my elderly mother this spring. Three or four weeks ago, I thought I had pruned back the Knock Out roses to the correct level (about 3 to 3 1/2 feet). Recently, she got a look at them and said I have to prune them back more (along with other roses that are smaller). How much more? And is that safe with our warmer temperatures? I'm particularly concerned about the more delicate roses (e.g. French Lace), which have never been robust in our clay/compost mixture of soil. Most of our roses are hybrid tea roses.
A: Rose bushes are best pruned in late winter, in dormancy. The general idea is to leave five or so main canes in a way that removes dead and crossing branches and opens up the center. They should be cut back to 24 inches or a bit less to just above an outgrowing bud (or now shoot). I suppose you could still prune now, even though we are a month from flowering. Put thumb tacks or wood glue on the exposed cuts to prevent borer damage.
Q: I have to move some daffodil bulbs because of construction. How and when should I do that?
A: Daffodils ideally need at least six weeks of leaf growth before they should be lifted. If you have to move them now, be very careful to not damage the roots or the foliage, and place them in a prepared bed at the same depth and in a sunny location. You can then move them to a permanent location (if needed) in June as the foliage fades.
Q: We have plum and apricot trees with very long top limbs that should probably be pruned back. However, the trees have already flowered and leafed out, so I'm assuming now would be a bad time to prune. When is the best time to prune fruit trees?
A: Most fruit trees are in the rose family and should be pruned in winter dormancy. You might thin some of the young fruit clusters for bigger fruits, but otherwise wait for branch pruning. These are relatively high-maintenance plants, and most growers will have a spraying regime against certain pests and diseases. Neglected plums and apricots will not be happy campers in the mid-Atlantic. Most Popular "

Best advice I during my divorce. Figure out the most important thing that needs doing that day (which may be dealing with the kids being sick). Do that well enough and count the day a success. Everything else is a bonus. Also, as time and emotions permit, think about what you want from the divorce. Too many people show up at mediation and have no clue or haven't thought things through. And talk with folks you trust about what you think you want. Because the last kid isn't born yet, you've got 18 or so years of custody and child support ahead. I remember my mother pointing out that I was putting the welfare of my kid so far ahead of my own welfare in my divorce planning that I'd be lucky to be sane after two years. It took me a few weeks to figure out she was right and create a custody plan that worked for my kid and me. Q: Uncomfortable with Dares
My little sister (18) is in a sort of weird relationship with her boyfriend (26). OK, this sounds stupid but hear me out - her boyfriend always dare/bets her to do something to prove she is cool and sometimes I feel uncomfortably like it is borderline abusive? I mean, he dared her that she’d not sniff his friend’s unwashed jockstrap or that she’d not flash a homeless man her boobs. It is always vaguely humiliating, usually involves other people, and seems like an exercise of power on his part. On the other hand she always takes the dares and seems proud of herself that she never backs down, even when she is being sick because he dared her to eat a rotten fish. I have tried to talk to my sister about this, but she says I’m just jealous because I liked him first but he picked her. Which is true, I worked with him - that is how he met my sister - and I was a bit jealous/grossed out when he picked my little sister instead. I don’t think that is why I think he is a jerk now though. On the other hand, they are just dares? She could say no if she really didn’t like them, I guess. A: Carolyn Hax
Does she dare him? Does he comply?
If no, then this isn't stupid, it's grooming for abuse. 1-800-799-SAFE. Describe the situation and ask the staff to help you help her. ""brat"" and focus on punishment
My brother was around the same age when he realized that these were the kind of actions that could get him attention from my parents after he realized he wasn't going to be the one with the good grades--he wore ""brat"" like a badge of honor and continued to up the ante of ""bad acts"" once he realized this got my parents to give him the attention he needed--please don't slander your child and take Carolyn's advice to understand why he's feeling the need to act out, and maybe reflect on why you think punishment, especially exclusion of something that could be a way to recenter and bond (a trip) is the best course of action. Gift for 5-year-old
I raised my children far from their relatives. My parents used to send them a book along with a recording of my parent reading the same book aloud, and saying ""Turn the page"" at the end of each recording. My children are grown but still remember when Grandpa used to read them ""The Grinch"". I would suggest finding a book that suits your nephew's interests or was special to you, so you can tell your nephew it is now special to the two of you... Q: Respect my things please
My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, and moved in together a year ago. I really do love him, but living with him has been driving me crazy and I don't know if I'm being reasonable, or I'm being a jerk. I grew up in a family where everyone had their own things. Mt sister and I shared a bathroom, but I had a different shampoo and she would never use mine and I would never use hers. There were always snacks in the cupboard that were specifically for kids' lunches - my parents would never eat them - and I would never eat anything I knew my parents had bought specifically for themselves. We only ever shared personal items with permission: you would always ask first. My boyfriend is an only child and everything they had was shared. He and his parents used the same shampoo, soap, toothpaste. If he needed to borrow a shirt he could just grab one from his dad's closet. And this has translated into us living together. If he runs out of soap? He uses mine. If he has no clean socks? He borrows mine (and stretches them out!) If he's hungry, he eats whatever he can find - even if it’s something that I purchased specifically to take to work. He needs change for the laundry but has none? He'll go into my wallet and take some. All without asking. We've talked about this, and his attitude is: ""what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine and everything in the house is shared."" This sounds unreasonable to me, and I don’t think it has to be this way just because you share space. Is he right? Am I being unreasonable? A: Carolyn Hax
""We've talked about this, and his attitude is: 'what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine and everything in the house is shared'""?
WTF[ox]? Why does his ethic take precedence over yours?
It doesn't matter whose household-of-origin culture is the ""reasonable"" one. What matters is that you have yours and he has his and they're not dovetailing comfortably into a culture that you can both embrace as ""ours.""
People who love each other and have hope for a * non-contentious * future together (I recommend it) will take these issues and try to reconcile them. For example: He can leave your food alone that you have purchased specifically to take to work, and you can lighten up about soap.
But that's only if you both stop thinking the rightness of your way over the other's is more right than the rightness of an effort to:
-work things out;
-see what's good about the other's culture;
-respect what the other's limits are;
-own where your limits are and you aren't willing to budge.
To your credit, at least you're open to the idea that you're handling this wrong. As described, at least, he sounds entitled. Not a trait that breeds excellent roommates. Q: How to Answer a Question I Don't Want to Answer?
My sister committed suicide last week. She was young (mid-30s), healthy, and to everyone else, appeared happy. My family and I are distraught as we are now making funeral arrangements. Inevitably, as we share the news with her friends and others, we are repeatedly asked how she died. I suppose it is a natural curiosity to wonder, but infuriates me to no end that people actually ask this after hearing that I've lost a sibling. This question is asked other ways as well. ""Was she sick?"" I suppose I can say yes, that she was sick, as mental illness would qualify. I fear that will lead to more questions. How can I end this line of questioning? A: Carolyn Hax
How devastating, I am so sorry.
There is always a way to end a line of questioning: ""I prefer not to discuss it/I'm not ready to talk about it."" Or, softer: ""Thank you for your concern, but I prefer not to discuss it/I'm not ready to talk about it.""
Since you can in fact say she was sick, and mental illness does in fact qualify, do consider, when you're ready, answering as you would if she had died of cancer:
""She had [name of mental illness], and died by suicide.""
That answer is both honest and de-stigmatizing. It is not your job to carry this responsibility for our culture, but if it's one you are willing to assume, then it would be a kindness.
Q: Sunday's Column
One of the things that you didn't mention, and I'm not sure whether it's relevant given the red flag parade you did mention, was that the letter-writer said that this was the first birthday that had occurred during the relationship. So that means these two are engaged in less than a year part of which (no indication how much) has been spent apart. While I certainly know of people who got engaged quickly, it makes me wonder how well these two knew each other before they were doing the long distance total commitment thing. I'll let the red flag parade continue now... A: Carolyn Hax
Yes, I wondered too, but it could have been that they met, say, 10 or 11 months ago--and so introducing the whole how-soon-is-too-soon question for engagements with all the required qualifiers just struck me as clutter on top of an already busy answer. Thanks for the chance to explain my reasoning. Q: Secretive Therapy
Hi Carolyn! I'm scared to tell my mother I want to start therapy. I worked with a therapist briefly when I was 15 (I'm 18 now and still living at home) because my depression spiraled to the point where I couldn't take care of myself and was suicidal. I stopped for a number of reasons, not the least of which was that my mother tended to use it as a weapon against me when I was struggling (eg. snappish remarks about how my therapist would want me to try harder to do housework when I couldn't even get out of bed). I quit therapy, slowly got worse, and genuinely did not think I would survive until I graduated high school. But I did! And I'm going to college in the fall! And I'm so excited! I'm in a much better place now than I was back then, but I want to thrive, not just get by, and I know I need help for that. The only issue is, I'm finding it incredibly difficult to do the work of starting therapy. In the past you've advised people to let their loved ones help them with calls/appointments/etc., but I'm terrified of repeating what happened when I was 15, even though my mother and I get along much better now that I'm healthy enough to do my share of work around the house. I really don't know what to do. Thoughts? A: Carolyn Hax
Good for you for getting out of the hole you were in, and for taking steps to maintain your good health. That's so important.
I suggest leaning on someone other than your mother. Friend? Favorite teacher? Aunt or uncle? Identifying and approaching sources of support that you trust (vs. just are related to) is a big part of that maintenance. You can also, presumably, just call your old therapist to ask him or her to talk you through this process. That puts the bar much lower for a first step.
I'm sorry for those things your mom said. It doesn't excuse her actions, not even close, but it sounds at least possible she was scared/stressed and doing the parental version of ""acting out."" It's way too common.
Take care, and write back next week, if you'd like, to share whether you've made any calls. — May 03, 2019 2:44 EDT Carolyn Hax
Wow it's late. Sorry Teddy! That's it for today. Thanks everybody for stopping by and for your helpful contributions. Have a great weekend, and I'll type to you here next week. RE: Suicide
First, I'm sorry. Second, know that we aren't asking to cause more hurt or pain. It's just the first natural reaction hearing something happened to someone for most of us is to ask what happened. But also know that most of us will take the hint if you say you're not ready/willing to talk about it. In response to ""how to answer a question I do not want to answer""
I hate to say it, but this doesn't get much better over time. My mother died by suicide when I was 12 (42 years ago) and even today people will ask ""how did your mom die?"" I've learned to pick my answers carefully. With a person I've only recently met the answer will be ""she died suddenly"" or ""unexpectedly from a long illness"" or some other vague answer. If you say 42 years later that you still can't talk about it, people will think you have some serious mental issues. Only people I know well get the more detailed answer. But be prepared for their awkwardness when they get the answer. I think they really want to hear ""cancer"" or ""heart attack"" but suicide and murder are never the expected answer.

This week, let's talk about misery. That should be fun!
The Nats are miserable because they have the worst injuries to one lineup that I have ever seen. Other teams may have had as many or more on the IL. But the Nats have lost their No. 2-3-4-5 hitters --the heart of their lineup-- including BOTH of their No. 5 hitters (Zimmerman and Adams). Any combination of players that the Nats can not put in one lineup had --combined-- negative offensive WAR last year. Does that mean that --soon-- they can have a game where they score Minus runs?
Latest on MASN: Nats are owed $100M, according to an MLB panel. Any guesses on the year that money will actually be paid by Angelos-O's-MASN?
Let me know what you think about the Kentucky Derby DQ! I enjoy horse racing but am not an expert --or anything close to one. Informed opinions welcomed! I thought the stewards showed guts AND set a precedent for the future that --even in the Derby-- if your horse, or your jockey, ends up swerving all over the track, endangering other horses and riders, then you are going to get taken down, just as you would in any other (obscure) thoroughbred race. It is a HIGH danger sport, for animals and humans, and Anything Goes --whether it's intentional or not-- has no place in ANY race.
Finally, has Bryce Harper turned into a strikeout machine in the last two years? In his first 6 years, Bryce had 785 hits and 665 strikeouts. In '18-'19, he has had 165 hits and 212 strikeouts. The last four years his K-% has increased each year from 18.7% to 20.1 to 24.3 to a scary 29.3 this year. He can't be as bad as he's been so far this year. But what is his norm now --and why? Your thoughts + mine.
Off we go!
Today, the Nats need to go 76-53 for the remainder of the season to reach 90 wins. (1) Can they? (2) Will 90 wins take the division? A: Thomas Boswell
As I've pointed out in two columns in the last month, the Nats season may be decided by Memorial Day.
If they are still within sight of the NL East leader, or leaders, by then, they should get healthy in a hurry and I'd expect them to be right in the battle in September. But they are 5 games behind the Phils now. Will they be 10-or-more games behind by June 1? Or ""just 5-6-7 games behind?
Statistically, those are all bad spots to sit in. But the N.L. East isn't as good as expected so far. I don't see a 90-win team in the division right now. Also, a LOT of things have gone right for the Nats but it's utterly obscured by their injuries. Patrick Corbin is ""as expected"" --and that is a LOT. The catching tandem of Gomes and Suzuki won't keep up its current pace for 30 homers, but they are a huge upgrade. Howie Kendrick, who'd be in the League Leaders if he had enough at-bats, is found money after coming back from what can be a career-threatening injury (Achilles).
If Zimmerman can't stay healthy, or hit enough, then Kendrick can play a lot of 1st base in a platoon with Adams (and Howie's defense will be better than either). Dozier has been a drag so far, but has 5 homers and has always been a hot-weather hitter. I still think he'll hit 25 homers and, by August, fans will be a little sorry to see him go (presumably) after '19. Also, team leadership has shown up well in a lot of the Nats late-inning long-shot comeback wins --like the 10-8 win on Saturday. If they ever get healthy and hot, you may see very good chemistry.
But that is a huge ""if."" Because this trip to Milwaukee and the Dodgers will be ultra-tough and the next homestand, too.
However, a team with three top starters, two decent ones, a fine closer and (maybe) a decent set-up man in Barraclough can claw its way through the next 3+ weeks. If Rendon comes back on May 9, that's a help. (Will he?) If Turner comes back two weeks after that, it's another jump up. Will he? If Soto's back spasms really are minor --not an oblique problem or anything else-- and he comes back in less than a week, that's a big help, too.
If you can tell me how badly these players are hurt --and even they may not know when they'll heal yet-- and when they'll be back, then I can make a guess at how long the Nats season will be out on the ledge.
But we don't know. That's what's scariest. Q: Davey's strenghts
Hi Tom- in Barry's column last week (after quoting Rizzo saying he does not have any examples of malpractice by Davey) he rhetorically asked, ""The counter, of course, is: How many examples of best practices can you find? Or, put another way: How many games, over the past season-and-a-month, has the manager won for his team?"" As someone who has been around baseball and the clubhouse as much as you have, what do you think are Davey's strengths? That can either be in-game or taken holistically when looking at all the managers/teams you've interacted with over time. Thanks. A: Thomas Boswell
Some teams will ""run through a wall"" for the manager.
Some like him OK and play hard, but are essentially self-motivated --as they should be.
And sometimes a manager ""loses the clubhouse."" This should not happen. They're pros being paid insane salaries. But it DOES happen. In the time the Nats have been back in D.C., we've seen examples of all three situations, as well as the gradations in between. Williams lost the clubhouse.
""Run Through a Wall"" applied to Frank Robinson's team in '05, to Davey Johnson's in '12 and to Dusty's teams in '16 and '17.
Dave Martinez gets a LOT of effort and good morale out of his everyday players and bench. There have been several comebacks this year that are generally considered signs of a close team or one with 'fight.' Yes, of course, they should all 'fight to the last out,' in every game and, yes, in many cases those big comebacks have nothing at all to do with the manager.
Martinez certainly made the perfect pinch-hitting move on Saturday, using Kurt Suzuki --his back-up catcher-- to pinch-hit at the ideal time when a 3-run homer could tie the game 8-8/ Of course, Suzuki gets a lot more credit for actually HITTING IT than the manager does for sending him up there. BTW, Martinez is, IMO, 'on the right side of history' as far as using his back-up (and last) catcher in crucial pinch-hitting situations and thus running the risk of needing to ask Wilmer Difo (or somebody else) to be an emergency catcher in case of an injury to the ""last"" catcher.
As you know, everybody now looks at the connection between run differential and W-L record over MULTI-YEAR time frames, and also at a team's record in one-run games as a measure of a manager. I've pushed for this for many years. I once figured out that Jim Riggleman had the worst record in MLB history of manager's with 1,000 games in one of these categories (I've forgotten which) and I mentioned it to Stan Kasten. ""So, what have you got to say to THAT?""
Stan didn't miss a beat. ""He's due,"" said Kasten.
Well, Martinez is ""due,"" too. In his two years, Baker's W-L% in one-run games was .583. So far, Martinez is .434.
If Martinez was .583 in one-run games, the Nats would have 8 more wins the last two years. BUT maybe the '18-'19 teams just were not as good as the '16-'17 teams. What if they are just a .500 bunch of mediocrities and neither the team nor fans/media want to accept it? Well, then they still ought to be 27-26 or 26-27 in one-run games.
Run differential predicts that the Nats should have won EIGHT more games than they did last year --90! which probably have made the playoffs-- and one game more this year. Part of this can be flukes in run distribution. But -9 wins over `200 games is no feather in anybody's cap.
I think Martinez is above average in dealing with players and in keeping team morale up --and individual morale, too, in some cases-- and I think that has value. He's very good at being a conduit for the info from the analytics people and advance scouts, but then he should be because that was one reason he was hired.
If he can develop or manage a bullpen at a major-league-average level, then I am not able to recognize it yet. That could be my fault. He's better than he was 365 days ago. And, in his defense, he's not the one who thought Trevor Rosenthal would be the Set-up Man Deluxe by this time. That's on Rizzo for going for a high risk, high reward signing at a spot where he had a complete VOID with Madson and Kintzler (and others) gone over the last couple of years.
The next few weeks may be a time when Martinez' skills --his ""positivity"" which gets so much teasing, including from me-- will be of MOST value.
As the Nats sat on the runway for SEVEN hours last night in their charter plane --that was injured and on the IL-- then had to get off and stay in a Philly hotel, I wonder if Dave had any good golf-shot contests or camel jokes or...
OK, not funny.
One note on ""malpractice."" A manager has to make a TON of bad decisions to add up to 10 runs of malfeasance in a season. And 10 runs is ""worth"" only about one additional win or loss.
Suppose a manager makes a decision which improves (or damages) the chances of the next hitter getting on base by 5% --in other words, by .050 on-base percentage points from .325 to .275 or visa-versa. COME ON, how big a difference is that anyway --not much! In only 1 time in 20 will the bad (or good) decisions change the outcome! About 95% of the time, the manager's decision means nothing!
That is a VERY broad brush. But even if you think the outcome will change 10% of the time, that still means the manager's decisions --over 100 decisions-- will be a ""wash"" 90% of the time. Also, in that 10 % of times when the manager screws up, lots of those examples are only a walk or single versus an out. Every ""mistake"" doesn't produce a home run.
So, say a manager makes TWO mistakes per game versus an average manager --that would be GROSS incompetence. That's >300 mistakes a season. BUT, in our example, only 15 to 30 of those theoretical mistakes --5%-to-10%-- actually produce bad results. How many RUNS would those 15-to-30 mistakes produce? Maybe 10 runs? Or 15?
Well, that's only 1 or 1.5 wins-a-season between an average manager and a very bad (or very good) one.
My point is not to pretend to measure a manager's value precisely, but to GENERALLY give you the sense that it takes a LOT of good (or bad) decisions to change a season very much. Just because one decision works out spectacularly well, or badly, don't forget all the times that the manager calls in the ""wrong"" pitcher and the bum gets the hitter out anyway because --well-- hitters USUALLY make outs against everybody.
If you gave me the choice of a team with Above Average Health but a Below Average Manager and a team with Below Average Health and a Brilliant Manager, I take GOOD HEALTH every time and not give a damn who the manager is.
In other words, the injuries to Trea Turner, Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto will probably have more impact on the '19 Nats by June 1 than all of Dave Martinez decisions in all 162 games rolled together. Q: Maybe the airplane breakdown is the turning point?
I remember a column you wrote long ago about an Orioles team that was on a ridiculous bad-luck streak that finally got so silly the players laughed about it--then went on a tear to haul themselves back into the race (the one that ended with them playing that final set against the Brewers where the Orioles had to sweep a four game set to tie for the division--and darned near did). Anyway, the Nats could really, really use something like that at this point. Bullpen meltdowns and a spate of injuries that only comes in second to the Yankees at this point (at least the Nats' rotation is still intact, though I hate jinxing them by saying that) just in time for the toughest road trip on the calendar. And--oh hey!--after playing a depressing game in constant rain, how about a seven hour wait on the tarmac followed by a canceled flight and a late night return to the hotel/early wakeup and maybe even going direct from the airport to the ballpark? At some point, one has to laugh. And maybe by laughing, turn this thing around. Now would be a good time for that! A: Thomas Boswell
Maybe.
Last year, the Nats started 11-16 and had many injuries. Remember, Soto was brought up in May. On the ""depth chart"" he was the SIXTH leftfielder. They brought up Mosies Sierra, and once batted him cleanup, I think, before they brought up Soto!
What happened next? The Nats went 14-2 and followed that with 8-4 for a total run of 22-6. Based on what? Pretty much based on nothing. That was LAST YEAR. Everybody forgets.
BUT last year at this time the injured Nats had a very easy schedule. This year, it's very hard. It's spring. The flowers are beautiful. And I'm not going to go full gloom-and-doom with 129 games to play. I've seen too many teams get healthy and get red hot. It's easier, sometimes, to be the ""chaser"" than the chased. BUT, the Nationals are in real trouble right now. They need their Big Three to earn their $525-million (hardly an unfair request, I'd think) and their (fairly healthy) bullpen to suck it up.
Fans think, ""How will they ever score another run?"" But they will. The WORST scoring team in MLB last year averaged 3.66 runs. ANY lineup, no matter how beat up, should think it can average 3.5-to-3.75 runs a game. Small ball, sure. But Eaton, Dozier, Kendrick, Gomes and Suzuki are solid MLB hitters. Robles is a fine rookie.
This ""joke"" lineup scored 10 runs on Saturday. Just show up, play your best, shake off the loses and come back the next day. In baseball, you'd be amazed how often that produces surprisingly decent results, no matter how bad the times seem. Q: Doolittle
How does Sean Doolittle get away with throwing 90% fastballs? There are plenty of guys who throw harder than his 94-95. What's so special about his fastball that makes it so effective? A: Thomas Boswell
His fastball has ""hop."" It appears to rise. This is because he throws directly overhand and has an extremely high spin rate.
We've all heard about ""the high hard one."" Well, Doolittle has it. Nobody could hit it in 1919 and they can't hit it in 2019 either.
They say Walter Johnson threw one pitch for the first 15+ years of his career. Then he added what he called his ""nickel curve."" Maybe a cutter or semi-slider. But using one pitch --at about the same 90%+ as Doolittle-- didn't prevent him from leading the league in K's a dozen times.
Also, ""launch angle"" hitting came into vogue for two reasons --it was simply a good idea which should have been ""discovered"" generations ago and it also counteracted many years of pitchers being taught to concentrate on making pitches at the knees or slightly below. The ""uppercut swing"" has a better chance of elevating low pitchers. But no approach is perfect against everything.
The pitch that has always beaten the uppercut swing has been the high fastball. Doolittle was always very good. But ""launch angle"" hitting coaches came along just in time to be his best friend.
Billy Wagner had a similar fastball which seemed to ""hop"" and have great ""finish"" --meaning it seems to ""explode"" as it gets to the plate. Presumably, if there is such a thing as ""finish"" it is similar to ""hop"" --it's an illusion. The ""hop"" just means that your spin helps the pitch drop less than the batter's eye tells his brain should be possible.
Perhaps finish means that the pitch does not decelerate as much after (say) 50 feet as the normal fastball, so it seems to ""explode"" relative to what the hitter expects. (Or maybe this is scientific nonsense and there is no such thing as ""finish."" Help me out here, all you brainiacs.)"
Eugene Robinson Live (May 14) - The Washington Post,live.washingtonpost.com,,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://live.washingtonpost.com/opinion-focus-with-eugene-robinson-20190514.html,"Eugene Robinson Live (May 14) May 14, 2019
Read Gene's latest: The war in Washington isn’t between Trump and Democrats. It’s between Trump and Congress. Eugene Robinson
Hello, everybody, and welcome to our chat. Just the usual chaos today: Markets are rebounding somewhat after taking a plunge yesterday due to President Trump's idiotic and self-defeating trade war with China. Published reports say that (NYT) the administration is thinking about sending 120,000 troops to the Mideast to menace Iran; and that (WaPo) the administration seriously considered a mass roundup, really a pogrom, of undocumented immigrant families. My column tries to get at one obvious truth about Trump, which is that he has no idea what he's doing or how to do it. He's like ""a weak swimmer in a strong current."" The self-proclaimed Artist of the Deal couldn't negotiate his way out of a paper bag. But you knew that. Let's get started. Q: So much for checks and balances
Gene, please tell me how the WH is able to ignore or flat out deny Congress when they make requests for documents or testimony. Isn't this unlawful? What happened to checks and balances? For the first time in my 56 years, I am fearful of what is possible under this administration. A: Eugene Robinson
I certainly believe it's unlawful, and I hope the courts agree. The administration has decided just to stonewall, and count on running out the clock. The Constitution and the federal code are unambiguous, in my reading, but it may take time for the courts to rule. Q: Due process and more time to collect evidence on the
subpoena of Trump's financial records. Assuming that a judge will recognize that the Legislature has a legitimate oversight function, then there are only two theories of the case that justify preventing them from handing over the requested records: 1) there is some ""balancing"" test involved where the benefit of Congress getting the records isn't outweighed by a right to keep your financial records private and 2) the legit oversight interest in getting the records is somehow cancelled if there is also a ""gotcha"" reason. Neither theory is even remotely plausible legally. Given that is what they have to be arguing, the judge would also be justified in refusing an initial injunction because they haven't even put forward a theory of the case that could ever succeed in court, even if they could find the records proving it. This idea that everything can be delayed so long that nothing will happen before the election is looking flimsy. P.S. I have always thought that the accountants records will be more damaging then just the stuff from the IRS. Accountants have memos explaining what they are doing and sometimes why in their papers. A: Eugene Robinson
Thanks for the analysis. I agree that the Trump Org.'s longtime accountant surely knows much, much more than President Trump was willing to tell the IRS. Q: 0%
So Pete B___ (sorry, but too lazy to look up how it's spelled) is polling at 0% among Black voters both in South Carolina as well as his home state of Indiana. Is it inevitable the Black community gets accused of homophobia? I saw it in a few tweets, but that's hardly a fair standard. A: Eugene Robinson
Buttigieg. No, it's not inevitable, because I know of no evidence to back up a charge of homophobia. He needs to introduce himself to African American voters. If he could only find a handful in my hometown of Orangeburg, S.C., he's not doing it right. Q: Iran warmongering
You write of the prospects that the Dotard will gin up a war in Iran as a distraction from his myriad other problems. The really scary thing is that with no Sec of Def, NSA Director, or Amb. to the UN, the point person in this area is John Bolton, who has been lusting after a war with Iran for literally decades. A: Eugene Robinson
That is indeed scary. John Bolton has long wanted to press (somehow) for regime change in Iran. I hope there's someone still in the administration who can get it through Trump's thick skull how insane an attack on Iran would be. Q: I am scared
Through all the idiotic gyrations we’ve gone through over the last two plus years while I was angry and frustrated, I was never scared for our democracy. Until now. Trump, and more importantly the Republican party, thumbing their collective noses at the rue of law by has shaken me to my core. I am afraid of where we are headed. I know you will say, vote. I will, but will it be too late? A: Eugene Robinson
I don't think it will be too late, though we may have repair work to do once Trump is sent packing. Q: Investigations
Ugh, I can't wait for 202 when hopefully we vote this guy out of office. My question relates to the administration looking to investigate their political opponents in the upcoming election. I imagine that it would be the FBI that they enlist for this task. Can't the Bureau refuse based on the fact that there's no creditable information? Also, doesn't this open Trump and his lackeys to being investigated once they're out of office? A: Eugene Robinson
This is the sad state of affairs we've come to: We have to anticipate that the president of the United States will possibly -- even probably -- politicize the Justice Department and use it as a weapon against his 2020 opponent, whoever it turns out to be. There are still career public servants in the FBI who will balk at being used this way. I'm less sure about Attorney General William Barr. Q: deep bench
I'm unsure if we were told that 2016 Republican field was the deepest bench we had ever seen. I think the national press had over applied a lesson of 2008. In 2008 (really 2007) everybody was dismissive of the notion of a first-term U.S. Senator running a successful campaign since that just isn't what happens. So in 2016 a lot of focus went to the first-term U.S. Senators (Rand Paul, Marco Rubio & Ted Cruz) as if it's obvious history was going to repeat itself yet we saw why the dismissing of Sen. Obama in 2007 wasn't totally without reason since they ran lackluster, amateurish and lazy campaigns. Probably the hardest working of them was Cruz so probably a reason he was the last one of them left standing. Cruz is a reminder that hard work of on-the-ground campaigning shouldn't be dismissed either. A: Eugene Robinson
You make a good point about how we always try to apply the lessons of the last election to the one we're approaching, and how that never works. That said, I do recall being told by Republicans in 2016 how deep and talented their field of candidates was. This time, let's see if anyone not named Biden or Bernie can climb up from the depths of the Democratic field and become a serious challenger for the nomination. Q: Senate
I know nobody will listen, but the talk about ""why won't Stacey Abrams or Beto O'Rourke just run for U.S. Senate"" stop. One is just moot and a waste of time. They aren't, deal with it. The Senate isn't a fantasy football league for people to just be placed around. I get it can fun for some, but it's silly too. People ought to run for the office they want. Also acts as Texas or Georgia are these easy lifts which is ridiculous. It's also unfair because of how Senate seats come up and some candidates get off the hook for it i.e. Indiana not having a seat up next year. Seems Beto gets it harsher than Julián Castro which is also unfair. If you TRULY want to help with the Senate, talk up James Mackler or Josh Mahony instead of this nonsense. A: Eugene Robinson
Sorry, but I think those are legitimate questions. Texas and Georgia are indeed heavy lifts, but John Hickenlooper could win a Senate seat in Colorado and Steve Bullock could win one in Montana. They've shown the ability to win statewide. It will be a real shame if the Democratic Party doesn't take its best shot at seizing control of the Senate. Q: It's the party, not just the man
I can still remember in autumn of 2015 (recall the photo of Alan Kurdi, a drowned 3-year-old Syrian when his corpse washed up on along a beach) and this was when Trump first called for a ban on Syrian refugees (later a total Muslim ban). That same day Jeb Bush, a reasonable white knight of moderate Republicans, called for the United States to only accept Christian Syrian refugees. http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/15/jeb-bush-u-s-assistance-for-refugees-should-focus-on-christians/ A: Eugene Robinson "
The Fix's Ask Aaron: The week in politics - The Washington Post,live.washingtonpost.com,,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://live.washingtonpost.com/fix-ask-aaron-20190517.html,"Q: Checks and Balances
Aaron, We are supposed to have a system of checks and balances among the three branches of government, but I am not seeing any checks against the judiciary. Whatever the Supreme Court says becomes enshrined in law. In rare instances congress can and does enact a law to overcome a Supreme Court decision, but this does not cover constitutional issues. Other than norms, what is to stop an ideologically fueled majority on the Supreme Court from imposing some really bad law on the country? A: Aaron Blake
You are too quick to dismiss Congress's role! They can pass a law, and if the Supreme Court strikes it down, they can pass a constitutional amendment. That might be really difficult, given the political makeup of our country right now, but the check is there. Q: Why do more Democrats keep entering the race?
They really don't want to hear what I want to tell them, which is that it's overload. I'm tuning 90% of it out, and I'm a political junkie. If anyone else is even thinking about it, don't. Or wait until January. A: Aaron Blake
I cover this stuff for a living, and I sympathize with this. It's just so unwieldy that even analysis is such a crapshoot at this point. Q: Nancy Pelosi
Nancy Pelosi has taken impeachment off the table, fearing an electoral backlash. At what point do our leaders actually make decisions based upon the merits, rather than their own political expediency. Mitch McConnell has been operating as a political hack for years, stonewalling everything Obama wanted to do, and only passing Trump initiatives he agrees with (like Judges). Now Pelosi seems to be trying to have it both ways, condemning Trump verbally, but not doing anything. She seems to be just another do nothing Democrat who talks a good game, but doesn't act. Are there no profiles in courage anymore? A: Aaron Blake
You bring up a good point that I keep coming back to: If this is a constitutional crisis and what's happening is so dangerous, isn't it incumbent upon you to do something NOW rather than waiting for 18 months for an election?
Her counter-argument to that would be: Well, it won't work, and it might just extend his presidency another 4 years. Q: Karl Rove sez...
...Motivate your base to win elections. And he's got some small amount of experience in these matters. So if Rove is right, then wouldn't the Dems be best off nominating a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren? Trump clearly embraces Rove's strategy. If the Dems do likewise, wouldn't it come down to who has the larger base, and in which states? A: Aaron Blake
Conventional wisdom has long held that nominating someone like Biden is the best for the general election, because they can appeal to the middle. But given there are so many fewer actual swing voters than their used to be, base-motivation is a much bigger and more important factor than it used to be. I think the two parties are evolving when it comes to their conventional wisdom on this. Plus, those middle-of-the-road candidates might have other liabilities. "
