"Google Marks Pro-Life Film 'Propaganda,' Labels Nazi Propaganda 'History'",thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/google-marks-pro-life-film-as-propaganda-but-labels-literal-nazi-propaganda-film-as-history/,"April 12, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
A Google search for the new movie, “Unplanned” returned results labeling the film “Drama/Propaganda,” while other films that are actual propaganda material do not receive the same designation. “Unplanned” is the story of a Planned Parenthood director who became pro-life after witnessing an abortion.
Kelsey Bolar, a Daily Signal writer and Federalist contributor, captured a screenshot of the search result below on Thursday. By Friday, the label had been removed.

A Google search for the 1935 Nazi propaganda film, “The Triumph of the Will,” returns results labeling it “History/War.” The director Leni Riefenstahl was called up by Adolf Hitler himself, commissioning her to make a film of the annual rally of the Nazi party.
A spokesperson for Google told Fox News that the search engine’s “Knowledge Graph” created the label based on web content describing “Unplanned” as propaganda.
“When we’re made aware of disputed facts in our Knowledge Graph, we work to fix the issues, as we’ve done in this case,” the spokesperson said.
Given this logic, Google’s “Knowledge Graph” was also apparently unable to find enough web content to be able to determine whether “Triumph of the Will” is a history movie, or Nazi propaganda film."
You Don’t Need A Cultural Appropriation Mob To Take Out Lucky Lee’s. The Market Will Do That On Its Own,thefederalist.com,Liz Wolfe,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/dont-need-cultural-appropriation-mob-take-lucky-lees-market-will/,"By Liz Wolfe April 12, 2019
This week, a new Chinese-American food restaurant opened in New York City. This would usually be an unremarkable occurrence in a city where new eateries open up regularly, but this one was different because the owner, Arielle Haspel, is a white woman who has been heavily scrutinized for her branding of her restaurant, Lucky Lee’s, calling typical Chinese food “too oily” and salty, claiming in a since-deleted Instagram post it makes people feel “bloated and icky.” Not a brilliant move.
A word about Haspel: she’s probably partially coming under fire due to her tone-deaf marketing strategies, but also due to the fact that she’s a fitstagram influencer wannabe type; a nutritionist focused on “clean eating.” The New York Times reports that Lucky Lee’s “entire menu is gluten-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, corn-free, peanut-, cashew- and pistachio-free … We use non-GMO oil, and never refined sugar, MSG or food coloring.” This leads me to wonder how the food gets its flavor, but I digress.
The basic complaints against Haspel have to do with her obnoxious comments about Chinese food, which understandably frustrate many Chinese restaurant owners and Chinese-Americans who have an appreciation for their unique food history. There’s also a credible racial insensitivity undertone, more so than with other cultural appropriation food scandals. A Time magazine piece from 2016 touched on the Americanization of Chinese food, and how Chinese-American food adapted to fit Americans’ palates:
Regardless of its dubious authenticity, such adaptation of Chinese cooking to American palates was a key element in the proliferation and popularization of Chinese cuisine in the United States. Throughout the early 20th century, ‘Chinese’ dishes became sweeter, boneless, and more heavily deep-fried. Broccoli, a vegetable unheard of in China, started appearing on menus and fortune cookies , a sweet originally thought to be from Japan, finished off a ‘typical’ Chinese meal.
(For more on this, David Chang’s “Ugly Delicious” explores how American palates still aren’t interested in the range of texture in traditional Chinese food.)
Haspel is effectively trying to capitalize on Americans’ love for not-very-authentic Chinese food, while attempting to make bank on the clean eating trend and posh, wealthy schtick of knowing where your food comes from (not exclusive to New York , of course). This is extra ironic given that Chinese food became less “clean” to adapt to American preferences, the irony of which seems to be a bit lost on Haspel. This isn’t a capital offense, but it’s still a frustrating one.
Still, God bless the free market for allowing her to see a gap in food options for people with allergies, celiac disease, and the like, and choosing to fill it. If this is, in fact, a desired type of food for that group, Haspel will probably do quite well, and perhaps some of the ostensibly sensitive and well-intentioned social justice devotees who are getting mad at her should also consider that she’s catering toward people who have major medical problems.
People’s anger might also have to do with the fact that Haspel seems like she’s trying to pull wool over people’s eyes. She named the restaurant “Lucky Lee’s,” after her husband, Lee. As one blogger noted , “ Oh boy. Someone on IG had already posted this, but if her husband’s name was ‘Chad,’ would she have named this restaurant Lucky Chad’s?” Sub in “Justin” or “Shane,” and the thought experiment just keeps working. It seems a bit like Haspel has an eye for branding, but didn’t expect people to do quite so much sleuthing. How naive in the internet-scold day and age!
As a matter of principle, I don’t think there should be a hard and fast moratorium on white people cooking the food of cultures that they cannot claim. This will limit the range of good food, and needlessly limit people’s creative freedom. All that aside, piling on a single woman—when you might, in fact, be frustrated by the more complex legacy of how Chinese food has been treating in America—feels like a bit much.
Still, nuance gets lost when we’re talking about cultural appropriation and food: the end product might simply be less good, and a crappy representation of the food genre, if the person creating it has no clue what she’s doing and hardly cares to learn. Plus, it’s frustrating for those who have worked to show American audiences the nuances of their food culture.
Of course, maybe Haspel isn’t aiming for a Chinese audience at all. Maybe she’s going for the people who don “Rosé all day” shirts and looking for some gluten-free noms after Soulcycle (the most cringeworthy possible type of person, but whatever. They still need to eat).
The takeaway, though, should be that Haspel deserves a bit of criticism for rudeness, but not a full-on a–hole social media mob (in fact, very few people deserve mobs! They are bad for our souls). The market will decide whether her restaurant stays afloat or not ( early reviews suggest that the food isn’t good). It’s yet another excellent function of the glorious free market that giveth and taketh away. Liz Wolfe is managing editor at The Federalist, based in Austin, Texas. Follow her on Twitter."
‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’ Trailer Debuts,thefederalist.com,Brad Jackson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/12/star-wars-rise-skywalker-trailer-debuts/,"By Brad Jackson April 12, 2019
Today, fans at Star Wars Celebration in Chicago (and all over the world) got their first sneak peak at the year’s most hotly anticipated movie: “Star Wars: Episode IX.” The final film in the original saga envisioned by George Lucas more than 40 years ago is titled “The Rise of Skywalker.”
Now honestly, as Star Wars movie titles go, “The Rise of Skywalker” is only slightly better than “Attack of the Clones” in my opinion, but it is fitting that the title features “Skywalker.” Episode IX’s title should also set theories abuzzing, because the obvious question is: which Skywalker is it referring to? If we’re talking about a rising Skywalker, it’s probably not referring to the now-deceased Luke, or the aged Leia. Is it a reference to Kylo Ren (technically a Skywalker) or perhaps a reference to the true parentage of Rey?
I’ve always thought that every Star Wars film is really a movie about Darth Vader, in one way or another. The prequel trilogy is all about how he became Darth Vader. See: Episode I poster.
The original trilogy was all about Luke’s struggle against Vader, his father.
And so far, the sequel trilogy has featured Kylo Ren trying to emulate Vader (his grandfather).
Even “Rogue One,” a non-Skywalker Saga film, included Vader in what was perhaps his best on screen moment.
So what else can we take away from “The Rise of Skywalker” teaser trailer? Here are a few key things that got me excited for J.J. Abrams take on the closing Skywalker film. That Rey Flip.
Rey flipping over what appears to be Kylo Ren’s TIE fighter in a battle in the desert is pretty awesome. During the panel at today’s Star Wars Celebration, host Stephen Colbert asked J.J. Abrams if Rey had any new force powers that would amaze us in this movie. He hesitated to answer, which likely means yes. Nothing will be as surprising as Luke’s projection to Crait in Episode VIII, but the Force is a big world of possibilities, and this cool flip over Kylo’s TIE fighter in the preview is a sign that this movie might feature some great stunts. Lando!
We’ve known for a while that Billy Dee Williams will be reprising his role as lovable scoundrel Lando Calrissian for this film, but actually seeing it on the big screen today was pretty exciting. When Lando, wearing a costume very reminiscent of Donald Glover’s take on the character, is shown sitting behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon beside Chewbacca, it brought a big smile to my face. Lando is back! The John Williams Score.
George Lucas once said that “the secret sauce” of Star Wars is John Williams’s brilliant music, and he’s absolutely right. This trailer’s soaring score immediately pulls you into the Star Wars universe, and is perfectly constructed to get you as excited as you were the very first time you first traveled to a galaxy far, far away. Luke the Force Ghost.
At the end of the much maligned “Last Jedi,” Luke Skywalker faded off into the Force, so there was a question about how much of him we would see in Episode IX. It seems from his narration, that we’ll get at least a little of Master Skywalker again, and perhaps more Yoda or even a little Obi Wan (notice he says “we’ve passed on all we know” not just “I’ve passed on all I know.”) The Death Star, Sort Of.
Toward the end of trailer, we see what appears to be the wreckage of the Death Star on the surface of a planet. Some of the original concept for “The Force Awakens” featured Rey and company visiting what remained of the Death Star on a planet in search of some clue. I think in order to use the leftover footage of Carrie Fisher here in Episode IX (since Lucasfilm and Abrams agreed they weren’t going to recreate the deceased Fisher digitally), we’re probably going to be embracing some discarded story elements from “The Force Awakens” including this trip to the Death Star remains. The real question it raises though, is which Death Star is this and on which planet are they? Start speculating now. Is it a post-apocalyptic Endor with all though cuddly Ewoks obliterated by space debris? Probably not. It’s more likely to be the surface of Yavin or one of its moons, from the original Star Wars film. Emperor Palpatine
Finally, the most interesting part of this entire trailer is what we here at the very end: Emperor Palpatine. That cracking laugh is unmistakeable, and just in case you were in doubt that it’s actually him, as soon as this trailer concluded its initial airing at Star Wars Celebration, Palpatine actor Ian McDermond himself appeared on stage and said (in his full Palpatine voice) “Roll it again!” The incorporation of Palpatine is most likely a response to J.J. having no big baddy to work with on this film since, ya know Rian Johnson killed off Snoke way too early in “Last Jedi.” The Emperor’s inclusion though is what could make this film very interesting and rewarding for long time Star Wars fans.
If you’re a serious Star Wars fan like me, you may have thought about one thing immediately after seeing this trailer: “Star Wars: Rebels.” Why would I think about a now concluded Star Wars cartoon series after seeing Disney’s latest blockbuster tease? Because of one critical episode of that show ( detailed here ).
In that pivotal episode near the end of the series, we saw that Star Wars has time travel (sort of) and it’s something the Emperor tried to harness to change the past, influence the future, and perhaps become immortal. His inclusion in the latest Star Wars movie may tell us that he in fact succeeded.
J.J. Abrams has a lot to live up to as he seeks to conclude one of the biggest movie franchises of all time. He’ll be only the second director to helm more than one Star Wars movie, the only other being George Lucas himself. There are some aspects of this movie we see in the trailer that seem pretty exciting, and there are some that don’t. One thing is certain though, now that the Wookiee is out of the bag, and the first details released: There will be no way to escape the Star Wars hype between now and its December debut.

More Evidence Twitter Skews The Media's Understanding Of Americans,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/13/evidence-twitter-skews-medias-understanding-americans-think/,"By Emily Jashinsky April 13, 2019
It’s a given that Twitter is a bubble . The size of that bubble is what’s worth reemphasizing, especially for the benefit of the media. According to a new Pew survey , only 22 percent of American adults say they ever use Twitter. That’s compared with 69 percent who say they use Facebook, and 37 percent who say they use Instagram.
It gets worse. Of that 22 percent, a full 58 percent say they use Twitter “less often” than once a day. Twenty-nine percent say “once a week,” 10 percent say “every few weeks,” and 18 percent say “less often.” Only 42 percent of the already small 22 percent are daily users. That number was 74 percent among Facebook users, 63 percent among Instagram users, and 61 percent among Snapchat users. (Similar to Twitter, only 24 percent of adults say they use Snapchat.) The Pew survey was conducted from Jan. 8-Feb. 7 among 1,502 adults.
Journalists love Twitter, and for some obvious reasons. But even if you’re conscious of the platform’s limited representative value, it’s difficult to avoid internalizing or perpetuating false narratives—both about actual news (see: Covington Catholic ) and the national mood (see: Joe Biden).
After the press spent days mulling the fate of Biden’s potential candidacy—on Twitter, airwaves, and in print—polling found Democratic voters were less concerned. According to a Politico-Morning Consult survey , “Half of Democrats polled said the allegations from women that Biden made them uncomfortable by invading their personal space will make no difference in their vote. Twenty-nine percent said the allegations would make them less likely to vote for Biden.”
“The responses from male and female Democrats were nearly identical,” Politico reported. “And very few voters see the allegations as truly disqualifying. Only 14 percent say the stories make them ‘much less likely’ to vote for Biden.”
The disconnect between Democrats on and off social media was probed by Nate Cohn and Kevin Quealy in the New York Times this week:
The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online, according to data from the Hidden Tribes Project. This latter group has the numbers to decide the Democratic presidential nomination in favor of a relatively moderate establishment favorite, as it has often done in the past… The relative moderation of Democrats who are not sharing their political thoughts on social media, and therefore of Democrats as a whole, makes it less surprising that Virginia Democrats tolerated Mr. Northam’s yearbook page. It makes it easier to imagine how Joe Biden might not merely survive questions about whether he touched women in ways that made them feel uncomfortable, but might even emerge essentially unscathed.
It also helps explain why recent polls show that a majority of Democrats would rather see the party become more moderate than move leftward, even as progressives clamor for a Green New Deal or Medicare for all.
Journalists who spend a good deal of time on Twitter hear disproportionately from partisans, and it naturally infects their outlook on the 78 percent of people who don’t use the platform. As I argued here , the result is an overrepresentation of divisive stories lacking in news value.
If Twitter is buzzing about a video of high school kids interacting with Native American activists on the National Mall, journalists breathlessly confer it with news value and mine it for clicks. It’s easy to see how a video like the first Covington Catholic clip, which functioned as partisan clickbait, would generate debate on Twitter. But that some portion of 42 percent of 22 percent of adults who use Twitter daily are interested in a video does not indicate it’s worthy of national news coverage. Pausing to consider that question is an important step.
Of course, Twitter has other disadvantages , (and some advantages too). But the more we’re all aware of the platform’s shortcomings, and the more we act accordingly, the healthier our coverage will be. It’s one thing for someone without a media megaphone to make the mistake of allowing Twitter to distort his perception of the country; it’s another thing when your perception of the country shapes the media’s depiction of it.

Play Along: Make Your 'Game Of Thrones' Season Eight Predictions,thefederalist.com,The Federalist Staff,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/13/play-along-make-your-game-of-thrones-season-eight-predictions/,"April 13, 2019 By The Federalist Staff
After seven emotional, thrilling, and globally captivating seasons, we’ve finally reached the final chapter of “Game of Thrones.” Who will die? Who will survive? Are Cersei or Daenerys pregnant? Who, if anyone, will sit on the Iron Throne? Before Season 8 premieres this Sunday, make your predictions and share them with us.
To play along, download the form below, fill it out, and share your predictions with us on social media. Use the hashtag #GOTxFDRLST
Thanks to Reddit user Shadyholic for sharing this prediction sheet.
For clarity, a few words on choosing between “Lives,”“Dies,” and “Becomes a Wight”:
In the “Game of Thrones” universe the term “Wight” is a catch-all for anyone (human or beast) who has died and come back to life or experiences some version of reanimation. While wights are technically already dead, they can still die a subsequent, permanent death by many means.
Of the list of characters in this sheet, three characters are confirmed to already be wights: Jon Snow, The Night King, and Beric Dondarrian. Selecting “Dies” for any of these characters is to imply that you think they will die for real and not come back. Selecting “Becomes a wight” for these three would not make sense, as they became wights prior to season 8.
Selecting “Lives” for these characters would imply you believe they will continue their wight life OR that they die and get brought back to life yet again. There is no need to select “Dies” and “Becomes a Wight” for any character, as the latter implies the former. Only one selection should be made for each character.
In the words of Cersei, “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.” Here we go!"
Nobody In The GOP Is Inciting Violence Against Ilhan Omar,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/14/nobody-in-the-gop-is-inciting-violence-against-ilhan-omar/,"April 14, 2019 By David Marcus
Words have actual, distinct meanings. Somehow accepting this wisdom that is thousands of years old is something of a struggle in this, the 21st century. I’m not talking about the current confusion over what the words man and woman mean, or if “Western Civilization” describes an actual human phenomenon. Rather, I’m talking about the word “incitement,” and a dishonest campaign by Democrats to argue Republicans are guilty of it.
One thing common to the dictionary definitions of the word “incite” is intent. To incite is to encourage, it is to actively advocate for; it is not a speech or action that inadvertently or negligently causes violence. When Democrats claim, as many have this week, that Republicans are inciting violence towards Rep. Ilhan Omar in their reaction to her statements about 9/11, they are making a specific charge. That charge is “The GOP wants to encourage violence against Omar.”
I’ll be honest: I’m a bit nonplussed by Omar saying “Some people did something” in regard to 9/11. It’s not how I would put it, but I suspect I view the root causes of the attack differently than Omar does. Obviously Omar abhors the attack, but she likely sees its roots as having to do with colonialism in the Middle East. This, along with recently revealed comments in which she suggested a moral relevancy between al-Qaeda and the U.S. Army, suggest a certain type of worldview. And it’s not all that rare.
On college campuses all across America, there are professors who think the United States has been a harmful force — Central America, Vietnam, climate change, using a nuclear bomb, etc. They have their case. I think it’s foolish, but it’s not strange that Omar and other young Democrats in Congress don’t. It’s fairly standard leftist fare. It is also absolutely fair game for political attack.
The real danger in regard to Democrats accusing Republicans like Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Donald Trump, and outlets like the New York Post, of incitement to violence is that the charge is one of very few that can be used to erase First Amendment free speech protections. It’s no accident that this is the word being used. But it is an absurd accusation.
No Democrat will actually say that Crenshaw, Trump, or the New York Post editors desire harm to come to Omar, because obviously they don’t. And that takes incitement off the table. What they are saying, in classic progressive tones, is that Omar is a member of a vulnerable, marginalized minority, so attacks on her carry an extra threat of violence.
It is hard to know if this is true, but it might be. Omar has been the subject of death threats, including the arrest of one man. Perhaps Omar’s critics should take extra care in framing their attacks. But Omar is a public figure, a politician thrust into vast prominence and influence. She has to be fair game for direct criticism. And her identity cannot be allowed to transform a plain political attack into an incitement to violence.
Last year, many in the liberal press applauded the public abuse of Trump officials in restaurants. This was the people having their voice! Even Democratic members of Congress urged this kind of direct action. Can they really claim that public confrontation with politicians is less likely to lead to violence than criticism of a Muslim politician’s speech? If telling people to get in GOP officials’ faces isn’t incitement to violence — and it isn’t — then how can criticism of a congresswoman euphemizing the attacks of 9/11 possibly be?
My father has a piece of advice that he is perhaps overly fond of giving me. “Speak with particularity,” he says. It’s good advice. Frankly, my fear about Democrats’ misuse of “incite” is not that they do not know their error, but that they know it very well. My fear is that they intend to change what the word means, because there are no rules, and take away fundamental speech rights in the coming decades.
If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks Republicans are inciting violence by attacking Omar, can we doubt she would pursue hate speech laws that would police Americans’ speech in ways unimaginable two decades ago? The presidential candidates on the Democratic side are once again echoing her. It seems like they have gotten hooked on a progressive smack that is hard to beat. Well, hard for them to beat — maybe not for Trump.
Obviously Republicans can’t and won’t be cowed by these crazy claims that they are inciting violence. Let’s hope the Democrats come to understand how absurd it is as well.

Tiger Comes From Behind To Win Fifth Masters Title,thefederalist.com,Brad Jackson,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/14/tiger-comes-behind-win-fifth-masters-title/,"April 14, 2019 By Brad Jackson
Tiger Woods is a human highlight reel, a once in a generation athlete who changed his sport forever. It’s been a long time, though, since we’ve been able to say that Tiger Woods was a major champion.
Not since before the world was first enamored of Barack Obama has Tiger won at Augusta National Golf Club. It was way back in 2005, just after the first iPhone debuted, that Tiger last donned the famous green jacket among the striking azaleas at golf’s most storied course.
Sunday saw Tiger starting in the final group, but early in the morning, as the tournament moved all the tee times up several hours to escape surefire afternoon storms. He wasn’t leading, but was instead in a tie for second behind Francesco Molinari, who had been a consistent leader throughout the weekend.
Yet Molinari had never faced the pressure of leading on Sunday at The Masters. For Tiger, it’s old hat. Still, this wasn’t the Tiger of old, fist-pumping his way around the greens. The 43-year-old master playing amongst his Padawans, many of whom became professional golfers because they grew up watching him in the prime of his career, was more stoic and reserved than young Tiger ever was.
He has also become more relaxed, embracing his fellow golfers in a way he never did when he was winning nearly every tournament he played in the late ’90s and early 2000s. And it was a wonderful sight to behold.
Tiger and the Italian Molinari traded the lead throughout most of Sunday, but as the round drew to a close, it was Tiger who was sitting at the top of the leaderboard. Tiger kept himself from making many mistakes in his two under 70 and held off late charges from Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, and Xander Schauffele to win by one. People magazine.
For a man who thought just a few years ago that he might never play the game of golf again because of intense back pain, this is truly a comeback for the ages. Over the last decade he’s endured painful surgeries, front-page scandals, and stresses that only the country’s most popular athlete can face.
Many people who are much closer watchers of golf than I am thought Tiger might never come back to challenge Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major wins and six Green Jackets, but with Sunday’s win at Augusta, Tiger is just three away from Jack’s major mark, and only one Green Jacket shy of his Masters record.
Tiger has provided golf some of its greatest moments. After his 1997 win, he ran off the 18th green to embrace his ailing father, who, as Tiger said, “shouldn’t have even been there,” because he was recovering from a recent heart attack. This time, 22 years later, Tiger ran off the 18th green to embrace his son, Charlie, who wasn’t even alive the last time his father won a major tournament. As a parent myself, it was impossible not to get a little emotional watching the two hug like only a father and son can. From hugging his dad in 1997 to hugging his son in 2019. Tiger Woods is Masters champion once more. pic.twitter.com/oKcWchIxsG

Now we’ll see if Tiger can continue the momentum he’s built with fine play at recent tournaments, and his victory this week at The Masters. No one will dare count out the greatest golfer anymore. No doubt he has his eyes set on Jack’s final records, something he’s been eyeing since he was just a three-year-old golf phenom.

9 Reasons Tax Day Should Be A National Day Of Mourning,thefederalist.com,Laura Baxter,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/9-reasons-tax-day-should-be-a-national-day-of-mourning/,"By Laura Baxter April 15, 2019
I think April 15 should be declared a national day of mourning. Sure, government performs essential functions that private citizens can’t do alone. And sure, Jesus said, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.”
We live in a great country with a great heritage, and I don’t grudge resources that make it great. But that’s not what Tax Day is all about. 1. Withholding Blinds Us to the Real Cost of Taxes
April 15 is the deadline for Americans to “file” their taxes. Year after year, we provide a signed form summarizing income and approved expenses in order to calculate our tax bill. Yet the focus on filing—burdensome as it is—belies the fact that we are paying all year long.
For Americans who work as employees (as opposed to being self-employed), estimated taxes are withheld every paycheck. Apparently the feds don’t trust us to save up for yearly or even quarterly tax payments—perhaps with good reason. But more insidiously, withholding hides the true cost of taxes.
The money never hits our bank account! And who really reads his pay stubs? We don’t think of the money as ours, even though we earned it. Funny how the prospect of a refund makes us happy, as if the government is giving us a gift. In reality, we have been loaning the money to the government, interest-free. 2. The Tax System Is Far Too Complex
I took the recommended tax class in law school and I was astonished by the intricate detail in the tax code, including a vast array of carve-outs and exceptions. After law school, gluttons for punishment can even earn a special, advanced degree in tax. In my law practice, I have consulted with such attorneys on behalf of my clients. Amazingly, even the uber-educated can rarely provide a black-and-white answer. The tax system is mired in pages and pages of fine-print gray.
Because of my religious upbringing, I lean toward scrupulosity. Even though I am an attorney, I have an experienced accountant prepare my taxes. Yet I tremble to think that I may have inadvertently violated some arcane tax provision or that my accountant’s interpretation of an ambiguous law may differ from the interpretation of an IRS agent or that my documentation may be deemed insufficient if I’m audited years later. Not only does the complexity of the tax code generate an enormous paperwork burden, it puts all of us at risk of breaking the law. 3. The Tax System Favors Special Interests
We can easily imagine an income tax using one or more straight percentage rates, without deductions. Sen. Ted Cruz once suggested a system so simple, Americans could file taxes on a postcard. Why hasn’t that happened yet? Where did these complex carve-outs and exceptions come from?
Since the creation of the income tax, corporations and special interests have lobbied Congress for loopholes. Their millions invested in lobbying become billions in tax breaks. Our tax code has winners and losers, and the winners fight tooth and nail to keep their subsidies.
We rightly criticize tax concessions for multinational corporations. At the same time, those of us who are homeowners love our mortgage interest deductions—as do mortgage lenders, home builders, real estate agents, and home improvement stores. But if we are being honest, why should home owners get a tax advantage over renters? The tax code should focus on fair collection of revenue, not social engineering or, worse, buying votes. 4. The Tax System Is Easily Weaponized
Because of the tax code’s ever-expanding complexity and paperwork requirements, the IRS can pick almost anyone and find an irregularity (see point 2). You can’t audit everyone, so how do you choose? The temptation for tax authorities to play favorites—and target enemies—must be extremely strong. In 2013, the IRS admitted targeting conservative groups for heightened scrutiny and delayed approval of tax-exempt status. We can only imagine what goes on under the radar.
When Special Counsel Robert Mueller decided to investigate Paul Manafort, President Trump’s campaign advisor, he was ostensibly looking for evidence of collusion with Russia. Yet Manafort was indicted, not for collusion, but for tax fraud. We many never know how many other wealthy political consultants are gaming the tax system. But it’s a good bet that, without his Trump association, Manafort’s tax irregularities would have gone unnoticed. 5. Too Many Americans Are Free Riders
We have all heard the Democrat rallying cry: “The rich must pay their fair share !” I agree. It is unconscionable that wealthy individuals and corporations can finagle lower tax rates than middle-class Americans.
But at the same time, approximately 44 percent of Americans pay zero federal income taxes. In fact, the bottom 20 percent have negative tax rates, meaning they actually make money from refundable tax credits. This means many Americans have no “skin” in the income-tax game. Why should poor Americans care how our taxes are used, as long as none of their benefits are cut?
Instead, all Americans should be expected to contribute some modest amount to the funding of our government. Let’s share the pain together. 6. 42 Cents of Every Tax Dollar Go to a Pyramid Scheme
The tax system is not only broken on the revenue side. Let’s talk about how taxes are actually spent. Almost 20 percent of taxes—more than $667 billion in 2018—are redistributed in the form of direct Social Security checks to seniors, including wealthy seniors. Medical care for seniors—again, regardless of income level—swallows a similar amount of the federal pie. This means younger, poorer Americans are supporting older, wealthier Americans.
Reforming Social Security or Medicare is politically untouchable. No one wants to be accused of taking money away from grandma. In addition, grandma believes she earned those benefits by paying into the system. Unfortunately, Uncle Sam has not managed the Social Security trust fund wisely, and grandma voted for those spendthrift politicians. Instead, the trust fund loans out money for general federal spending. Social Security and Medicare trustees expect the trust funds (consisting largely of IOUs) to be depleted by 2034 .
Social Security and Medicare are nothing more than a pyramid scheme, with a dwindling number of workers supporting a growing number of seniors. Yet together they account for approximately 42 cents of each tax dollar. What could be more depressing than that? 7. Taxes Support an Unaccountable Bureaucracy
Tax Day is a legacy of the Progressive Era. The original progressives (like progressives today) had a dim view of constitutional constraints on government. Centralized, consolidated government was considered the best way to get stuff done. To fund their proposed expansion of government, the 16th Amendment gave the feds new power to tax individual incomes.
Modern progressives have continued the growth of the administrative state. Congress delegates its lawmaking power to largely unaccountable bureaucratic agencies, which then use their power to issue tens of thousands of regulations (which they then enforce, obliterating separation of powers). All of these agencies are funded by income taxes.
Even if we strenuously disagree with the policies of an administrative agency, even if we ourselves have been embroiled in conflict with that agency, we are still forced to fund it through income taxes. That’s something worth mourning. 8. Taxes Undermine the Reserved Rights of the States
Federal power was originally limited to areas appropriate for national government: defense, international relations, trade between states, and similar responsibilities. The Founders believed Americans’ day-to-day concerns should remain at the state level. This is spelled out clearly in Article I(8) of the Constitution, as well as the 9th and 10th Amendments in the Bill of Rights. According to Federalist 46, if the national government ever tried to exceed constitutional limits, the states would undoubtedly sound a general alarm!
All that changed with the 16th Amendment. The Progressives gained a new source of revenue, directly from the people, without going through the states. This allowed the national government to bribe the states into compliance. On average, state governments receive about a third of their budgets from federal grants. Today, state and local governments hire lobbyists and approach the federal government, hat in hand. This is not a position of strength for keeping federal power within constitutional limits. 9. The Majority of Taxes Encourage Dependency
The lion’s share of the federal budget (over $2.5 trillion in FY 2018) is spent on “mandatory” payments. These flow from agreements with the American people (including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) to provide benefits at a certain level. Approximately 15 percent of the annual budget goes to defense spending. While reasonable minds can argue over the details, defense as a budget category is a non-negotiable federal responsibility. The remaining 16 percent or so is spent on the alphabet soup of government bureaucracy (see point seven).
James Madison considered it an insult to “the free and gallant citizens of America” to suppose that we would ever reduce ourselves to “a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious measures” leading to the loss of our freedoms. Yet that is exactly what has happened. We blindly and tamely allow the federal government to create programs for our every desire.
We like all the payments, programs, and subsidies. Oh, we may resent money spent on other groups, but we just can’t give up the crumbs that are designated for us. As long as this situation remains, Americans will not be self-governing, but dependents on their government, just like the citizens of every other welfare state.

Top 15 ‘Game Of Thrones’ Theories For The Final Season,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/top-15-game-thrones-theories-final-season/,"April 15, 2019
Some spoilers ahead from season eight, episode one.
After two exceedingly long years since the finale of season seven, the first episode of the six-part final season of “Game of Thrones” aired last night. Many of The Federalist’s writers, as well as millions of people around the globe, have had plenty of time to develop theories about what will happen as the beloved fantasy drama draws to a close.
Now that the last season is officially underway, here are some of the favorite theories floated by several Federalist writers. After just one episode with minimal foreshadowing, there are still many more questions than answers, but all of these theories, however unlikely, are still technically possible. Daenerys becomes pregnant with Jon Snow’s baby, but shortly after giving birth succumbs to the Targaryen crazy gene, and Jon Snow is forced to kill her. Jon is subsequently killed by one of the dragons. The baby will inherit the throne. After a decisive defeat of the Army of the Dead, the remaining allied armies of Daenerys and Winterfell go to King’s Landing to defeat Cersei Lannister. She will be nearly rescued but ultimately killed by her brother, Jaime, in one of the final scenes of the season after he finally accepts that she is truly evil. This will also satisfy Jamie’s nearly dead sense of honor. He will feel responsible for the sad state the kingdom is in and recognize his hand in allowing it to happen, as well as causing much of the decay when he threw Bran Stark out of a tower. Jon, Daenerys, Cersei, and Jamie are all killed. Sansa Stark, the current lady of Winterfell, is killed by some deus ex machina. Her sister Arya ends up as the temporary ruler of the Seven Kingdoms with Tyrion Lannister as her right hand, waiting for Daenerys and Jon’s baby to grow up and rightfully sit on the Iron Throne. Tyrion is a secret, illegitimate Targaryen who was fathered by the Mad King, Aerys Targaryen. This explains why he has almost nothing in common with his scheming family. Tyrion is also drawn to dragons and is never afraid to touch them. The dragons seem to like him too. The Iron Throne is torn down to make swords to kill the Army of the Dead. The series ends with no Iron Throne and all those who could claim it are dead. (Jamie has to kill Cersei because she refuses to relent). Jon Snow discovers his heritage but definitely doesn’t stop sleeping with Daenerys. Daenerys and Jon Snow will secure a complicated alliance that will see stability over the realm, but at least one of them will die. The most likely case is that neither will survive the season. Their relationship could produce a child, who would be seen as the last, legitimate claimant to the Iron Throne. Tyrion Lannister will serve as regent, and the show ends with all seven kingdoms well on their way to modern sociopolitical norms. The dragons will all die, because fantastical magical creatures will not have a place in the new world that will exist after the apocalypse that is about to occur. The Iron Bank will have to default on all its outstanding loans to various pretenders to the Iron Throne. This will cause a collapse in the Bravos economy that will see a new age of piracy and looting across Essos. Hopefully someone invents gunpowder soon—they’re going to need it. Bran is either going to die or sublimate into the world of the Three-Eyed Raven, unable to return to his human life. Before that happens, he’ll be instrumental in some way to defeating the Night King and by extension the White Walkers. Maybe he’ll transpose his dreamscape to when the Night King was made and inhabit him to sort of make him uniquely vulnerable while someone who’s close to Bran has to kill him after he has changed places with the Night King. This person could possibly be Jamie Lannister, who almost poetically redeems himself for injuring Bran in season one by killing him in the final season. Brienne of Tarth will get to lead the new King/Queen’s Guard. This would be most fitting if Sansa were to become regent, or even the rightful queen. Sansa would be a satisfying queen, as she has come on the longest journey from “dumb and useless” to “strong and competent.” Sansa finishing her growth quest by becoming the most competent and beloved ruler of Westeros in 300 years would be really neat. Now that Theon Greyjoy has rescued his sister, Yara, the immediate plan is to return her to the Iron Islands as the rightful ruler on the Salt Throne. Theon wants to fight with Daenerys and Jon Snow, but before either are able to achieve their goals they will be forced to defeat their awful uncle, Euron. This will likely be in some Viking-style pirate battle, where Theon likely sacrifices himself to save his sister, redeeming him for his previous cowardice. Syrio Forel, the “Dance Master” from the first season, is actually the same person as Jaqen H’Ghar, a leader of The Faceless Men and dedicated servant of the Many-Faced God. Syrio’s death was implied in season one but not shown. Meanwhile, despite his impact on Arya’s journey, Jaqen’s story was never officially tied up. Both men gave Arya very similar-sounding advice, seemingly supporting her in a form she needed most at the time she knew them. Davos either kills Melisandre or arrives with the intention of killing her as she is being killed by something else, like the manifestation of her hubris. Davos is a favored character, so his death would be disappointing, but would be an easy dramatic moment during the absolute chaos that will consume these final five episodes. Varys’s death is likely to come just before this as a final manifestation of Melisandre’s dark predictions in service of the supremely shady Lord of Light. Tyrion will live or die in the last few scenes. What would be worth betting on is whether he gets a big brain redemption. For supposedly being one of the most clever and strategic minds in the story, he got outplayed three separate times by his sister last season, more if you count his falling for her peace offering. Sansa confronts his stupidity right off the bat in the season eight premiere. He has to prove to everyone that his clever mind still works and cook up a good plan, but his challenge will be getting Daenerys to accept it after he has been so keen to forgive his siblings’ terror and blind to their true intentions. When all the bad people are finally dead, Arya and Gendry will go on a quest to the sea and explore worlds unknown. She’s done with Westeros and all its nonsense, and once her family is safe and their future is secured, it’s time for adventure. She and Gendry will fall in love. The Brotherhood Without Banners is completely wiped out with the exception of the Hound, who defeats his brother, The Mountain, shortly before Jamie kills Cersei. After everyone he knows is dead, The Hound considers suicide but is invited by Arya and Gendry to accompany them on their adventures, which he accepts. He feigns reluctance but is actually delighted to join his friends. Sam Tarly and Gilly live happily ever after with Little Sam. Sam comes to terms with his intelligence and ability to lead and discovers the way to permanently defeat the White Walkers. He’ll end up starting a college, not a maestery, a proper academic institution where people seek out new knowledge, not just read about forgotten lore. His contributions will help usher in a new era of science, medicine, and knowledge, possibly leading this world out of the Dark Ages.

9 Apocalyptic Lies Fed To Americans About The Republican Tax Bill,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/9-apocalyptic-lies-fed-to-americans-about-the-republican-tax-bill/,"9 Apocalyptic Lies Fed To Americans About The Republican Tax Bill admin 13 hours ago 3 minutes read
Monday is the first Tax Day under the new Republican tax bill passed in December 2017, and the results are not what Democrats and their media apparatus predicted. Many Americans are discovering that they are not only alive and well, but indeed paying less taxes.
As Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley pointed out in The New York Times , there is a disparity between what Americans thought they would be paying the IRS this year, and what they actually paid. This myth, “appears to flow from a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.”
What falsities did these liberal opponents tell the American people would happen pending the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? Here are a few of the most outrageous examples of fear-mongering. 1. 10,000 People Will Be Killed Every Year
Economist and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that “the conclusion would follow that the tax bill would result in 10,000 extra deaths per year.” On CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” he explained why he thought the bill was “very dangerous.”
“When people lose health insurance, they’re less likely to get preventive care, they’re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they’re more likely to die,” he said. 2. The Tax Bill Is ‘Akin To Rape’
Bruce Bartlett, a writer and former Treasury official, said the bill would not create a single job, that Republicans want the poor to pay more taxes to force them to work more, and that the bill is “really akin to rape.” 3. ‘Armageddon’ and the Worst Legislation Ever Considered By Congress
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who was minority leader at the time the bill was passed, said the tax reform bill was “the worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.”
When a reporter asked her later about her hyperbolic descriptions, she replied , “No, it is the end of the world. The debate over health care is life and death. This is Armageddon.” 4. Grad Students Will Have to Quit Doctorate Programs
When graduate students were told their tuition waivers for working as teaching assistants and researchers would become taxable, they calculated that their taxes would increase by 61 percent.
As she started to do the math, tears welled up.
‘I would have to drop out,’ she said. ‘If this tax bill passes, I can’t support anyone, I can’t even support myself.’ 5. America Is Dead
At least, according to Kurt Eichenwald. America died tonight. Economic suicide adopted to feed the insatiable greed of donors, who have been refusing to dole out $ to GOP until they got their tax cuts. Voters fooled by propaganda and tribal hatred.
Millenials: move away if you can. USA is over. We killed it.
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 2, 2017 6. Republicans Want to Kick the Poor, Middle Class In the Face
Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell described the ways Republicans are using higher taxes to “plan to punish the poor and middle class.”
I used to think the Republican Party’s obsession with top-heavy tax cuts was about pleasing wealthy donors and maybe also fulfilling some misguided Randian fantasy. If the poor and middle class happened to be collateral damage, so be it.
But it’s starting to look like shafting the little guy has become a feature, not a bug, of the GOP’s budget-busting tax plan.
The left-leaning Tax Policy Center reported that 91 percent of middle-class taxpayers are getting a tax cut this year. 7. Most People Are Getting Bigger Paychecks. Here’s Why That’s Bad
Rick Newman at Yahoo Finance wrote about a looming “tax surprise” in 2018, without ever explaining why giving the government a smaller interest-free loan with every paycheck might be better than a fat refund.
The TCJA lowered the overall tax burden for about two-thirds of workers, leaving a majority with slightly larger paychecks. But a quirk could leave some taxpayers with an unhappy surprise as they file their 2018 returns this year, and find that the refund they were expecting is smaller than before. Some people accustomed to a refund could even end up owing money, instead. 8. New Yorkers Allege All Americans Will Suffer
The day before the tax bill was signed in December 2017, protesters staged a “die-in” on Wall Street, near the New York Stock Exchange. One protester laying on the ground held a sign in the shape of a gravestone that read, “RIP/tax scam helped the rich/not me.”
“If we don’t stop this, we, the young people, are not going to have a future,” the protester, Nova Felder, told City and State New York.
A number of New York community leaders participated in the protests, too. “All of us will suffer as a result of those who care more about corporations than they do about the people,” said New York City Public Advocate Letitia James. 9. An Endless, Global Recession
“We are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,” wrote New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. “I suppose we could get lucky somehow. But on economics, as on everything else, a terrible thing has just happened.” "
Christian Adoption Agency Sues Michigan And HHS For Religious Discrimination,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/15/christian-adoption-agency-sues-michigan-and-hhs-for-religious-discrimination/,"April 15, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
Michigan foster families and St. Vincent Catholic Charities are suing the state of Michigan and Health and Human Services to allow the non-profit to continue its work placing the state’s foster children in forever homes. In March, the American Civil Liberties Union and Michigan attorney general signed a settlement for a 2017 lawsuit, barring Michigan from working with faith-based adoption agencies because of their religious beliefs about marriage.
Now, with the help of Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, St. Vincent is filing their own lawsuit in federal court. According to HHS, every year about 50,000 children in the United States are adopted through state child welfare systems, but about 20,000 additional children “age out” before being placed in a home.
Michigan, like many states, partners with private adoption and foster agencies to unite these children with loving families. In 2017, St. Vincent recruited more new adoptive families than nearly 90 percent of the other agencies in its area. State spokesperson Bob Wheaton told AP that, as of February, St. Vincent and Bethany Christian Services had completed 12 percent of the entire state’s foster care and adoption cases.
Michigan now holds that St. Vincent will be penalized if they decline to make written certifications about marriage that conflict with their religious beliefs, even though gay couples working with other agencies have been able to adopt children in St. Vincent’s care in the past. Halting the social work of St. Vincent will leave thousands of children in foster care limbo, and lead to a shortage of homes available for them.
“Faith-based agencies like St. Vincent consistently do the best work because of their faith, and we need more agencies like them helping children—not fewer,” said Becket President Mark Rienzi in a statement. “The actions by the Attorney General of Michigan do nothing but harm the thousands of at-risk children in desperate need of loving homes.”
The lawsuit suit is against both Michigan and HHS because the the Obama administration put a policy into place in its closing days, ruling that any groups publicly licensed and receiving money from HHS cannot discriminate on the basis of religion. This rule contradicts a Michigan law that protects taxpayer-funded, faith-based organizations from policies that discriminate against religious beliefs.
In January, the Trump administration’s HHS issued a waiver allowing faith-based foster care agencies in South Carolina to restrict placements to families that share their Christian beliefs. Melissa and Chad Buck, two of the foster parents suing alongside St. Vincent, adopted five children with special needs through St. Vincent Catholic Charities.
“My five children have a home and a future today thanks to St. Vincent, and my husband and I still rely on St. Vincent’s vital support in every step of our journey together as a family. We are hopeful that the courts will step in, do the right thing and allow faith-based agencies to continue to help vulnerable families like mine,” she said.
This is not the first time Michigan’s attorney general Dana Nessel has fought with Catholic adoption agencies. When this issue with state-funded, faith-based adoption agencies in Michigan was raised in 2015, Nessel was the attorney representing a lesbian couple with adopted children of their own. After Michigan lawmakers passed protections for religious adoption agencies, Nessel called the catholic charities “hate mongers” and declared their services “a disaster for the children and the state.” Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

The Silence Of The Bells: Notre Dame Cathedral In Ashes,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/silence-bells-notre-dame-ashes/,"By Ellie Bufkin April 16, 2019
Yesterday, the world watched in horror as raging fire consumed much of the 850-year-old Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral. In a stroke of mercy late on Monday evening in Paris, the fire officials declared that the main façade of the cathedral, containing the famed bell towers, would be spared.
Shortly thereafter it was revealed that even the central vault was largely still intact. The iconic spire, however, was completely destroyed, falling along with the majority of the roof into a pile of ashes.
Holy Week began yesterday, and many French and visiting Catholics watched as one of the most recognizable institutions of their faith was in danger of being annihilated after nearly 1,000 years on Earth. My colleague David Marcus wrote yesterday about Christ’s gift of mercy and grace, and the power of faith in God in the wake of this destruction.
In its 850 years, the cathedral has also become a symbol for much more. In its lifetime, it has seen the highest points and the darkest hours of France. It has become the visual symbol of the ability of Paris—and all of France—to survive revolution, cruel monarchs, wars, and country-wide occupation by Nazis. The 12 million annual visitors to Notre Dame serve as proof that it is much more than just a Medieval Gothic church. It is Paris.
It is perhaps the modern history of Notre-Dame that most clearly marks it as a symbol of Parisian strength and resolve. As it entered its 754th year in 1914, the Great War came to France and the famed bells of Notre Dame were silenced except for use as a citizen warning system.
The bells had been woven into the soundtrack of life in the City of Lights, and their silence did little to placate the anxiety during the war. On November 11, 1918, the bells rang out once more as the armistice was signed. People ran to the streets in jubilation. The cathedral had signaled the restoration of peace and prosperity in France.
Only a few decades later in 1940, as the dark cloud of Nazi Occupation settled in Paris, the bells of Notre Dame went silent once more. The symbol of life, of culture, of religious freedom, and of Paris itself was to be unheard for several years.
The French took early steps to protect the cathedral from Nazi looting, hiding large stained-glass pieces and many works of art. The occupation saw the life of French people deteriorate in an instant as families were torn apart, Jews were arrested and put on trains destined for concentration camps, and freedom was taken from every man, woman, and child.
The absence of the cathedral bells’ familiar chiming was coupled with more than four years of starvation, fear, and unrelenting Nazi rule. Following the 1944 arrival of the Allied army to France in the invasion of Normandy, Adolf Hitler placed Gen. Dietrich von Choltitz in charge of Paris with the order to destroy the city if the advancing Allies threatened to enter it.
Choltitz agreed to have the city wired for destruction by placing explosives in the most significant landmarks, including the Arc de Triumph, the Eiffel Tower, and the Notre Dame Cathedral. However, Choltitz knew the war was coming to an end and that he would not be on the winning side. He hoped the war would end somewhat peacefully, and he knew that the destruction of Paris, a city he loved, would mean his war would end in blood.
As the first of the Free French forces entered Paris under the command of Capt. Raymond Dronne, Parisians spread word quickly that liberation of their city was imminent. Messages were broadcast asking priests to once again ring the bells of their churches to signal to the Resistance and to the citizens that the Allies had arrived. Paris would be free. The bells of Notre Dame were the first to break the silence of persecution. They rang out in the sweetest song ever heard, joined by other bells from all over the city.
Choltitz called his superior, Gen. Speidel, and simply held the receiver of the phone to the window. The overwhelming sound of the bells did not require an explanation. Paris was no longer under Nazi control. Paris was free. Choltitz never gave the order to destroy the city.
The bells became an important symbol of the alliance between France and the United States once more, nearly 60 years later. On September 12, 2001, following the loss of almost 3,000 people in an unspeakable act of evil in the United States, the city of Paris closed the Metro so their citizens could pray. At Notre Dame, where many Parisians gathered, the bells began to toll in mourning.
The largest bell, Emmanuel, which had played the celebratory tones at the ends of both World Wars, was nearing 600 years of age and generally reserved for only a few annual holidays, state funerals, and visits from the pope. On September 12, however, for an entire hour Emmanuel and every other cathedral bell sang out in sorrow for the profound loss of life in America.
The cathedral of Notre Dame has been in Paris for most of a millennium. In just the last 105 years, it has become the symbol of life for the remarkable city. When times were grim, the cathedral’s survival served as a reminder that darkness is always followed by light. As the towers containing the iconic bells miraculously survived the fire, Parisians will soon hear them toll once more, and be reminded that the people of France have risen from the ashes many times, and now the cathedral will do the same.

Bernie Sanders Still Can't Explain How He's Paying For 'Medicare For All',thefederalist.com,Mark Hemingway,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/at-fox-town-hall-bernie-sanders-still-cant-explain-how-hes-paying-for-medicare-for-all/,"By Mark Hemingway April 16, 2019
Appearing at a Fox News town hall in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on Monday, Vermont senator and socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders turned in a fiery and combative performance. One moment particularly seems to be generating a lot of excitement.
After an audience member asked about his “Medicare for all” health plan, which would require eliminating private health insurance, Fox host Bret Baier decided to poll the audience to ask if they would prefer Bernie’s plan to their existing health insurance. Here’s what happened: Bret Baier just polled the Bernie Town Hall audience who would be willing to switch to #MedicareForAll . It backfired spectacularly. pic.twitter.com/dQJ9gfQ137
— jordan (@JordanUhl) April 15, 2019
This is a bit unfair to Baier, since it assumes he asked the question in bad faith, rather than knowingly asking the politically diverse crowd Fox assembled for the event their opinion on the matter. Further, it doesn’t really tell us much that a room half full of Democratic voters and Bernie supporters prefer some imaginary, aspirational future where the government pays for health care and there are minimal problems, as opposed to the warts-and-all reality of what we have now. (Certainly, it’s appealing enough that four other Democratic presidential candidates have chosen to co-sponsor his recently introduced “Medicare for all” legislation in the Senate .)
That’s especially true since Sanders hasn’t done a good job of explaining “Medicare for all,” to put it mildly. Asked about the specifics of his plan, Sanders employed the tried and true three-step explanation for how it works.
Step one, point out that the United States is the only “very highly developed” country without socialized health care and note that U.S. per capita health spending is much higher than that in these other countries. Make sure you do this without noting the problems inherent in the way these other countries ration lifesaving treatments (and even prevent you from leaving the country to seek potentially lifesaving treatment, presumably just to make some stupid nationalistic point about how great it is that everyone is trapped in the same system together). Also, under no circumstances note that these other countries often have vastly inferior medical technology and infrastructure– the average wait time for an MRI in Canada can be longer than five months , which is unthinkable here.
Step two, elide over all the details of how to implement a socialized system that addresses the size and diversity of American health care, which is radically different than the challenges faced by much smaller and more homogeneous European countries with supposedly superior care. Most importantly, also elide over the fact that the socialized health care system we have that’s supposedly so appealing, Medicare, is a money black hole with trillions in unfunded liabilities that is the single largest driver of our enormous debt that threatens to precipitate a republic-destroying financial crisis.
Step three, after having said nothing particularly illuminating or specific, bask in the glory of being a radical reformer that dares to imagine a future where greedy insurance companies are put out of business by a selfless and incorruptible federal government.
That was roughly the template Sanders followed during his Fox town hall, and from the video above you can see he scored debate points on health care. (Or at least, Vox , HuffPo and much of the left-of-center Twitterati seem to think so.)
But if you were listening, Sanders made some telling admissions. “You’re gonna pay more in taxes but your health care will be cheaper,” he said. For a long time now, Sanders has owed us an actually detailed explanation for how our health care is going to get cheaper under “Medicare for all,” and it hasn’t been forthcoming.
The Associated Press summed up a study done by the Mercatus Center last year this way, “Sen. Bernie Sanders’s ‘Medicare for all’ plan would boost government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, requiring historic tax hikes.” Of course, Bernie Bros would protest that the Mercatus Center is a libertarian think tank not predisposed to give Sanders’s plan a fair shake. But what about The New York Times?
When Sanders was running for president in 2016, New York Times domestic correspondent Margot Sanger-Katz kicked the tires on Sanders’s “Medicare for All” plan he proposed then and concluded, “ Bernie Sanders’s Health Plan Is More of a Tax Plan “:
[T]he plan … was full of details about the taxes that would be collected to finance it. The plan would charge a special income tax, called a premium, increase payroll taxes and raise a variety of taxes on high-income Americans, including income and capital gains taxes. Those are big, specific changes, worthy of detailed coverage. Missing, however, were more than a few sentences about how the proposal would change the health care system in the United States.
Further, “Medicare for all” doesn’t have much to do with Medicare as we know it:
But the program he describes isn’t an extension of the existing Medicare program, which provides health insurance for older people and the disabled. Medicare includes premiums, co-payments and deductibles, and excludes coverage for long-term care or dentistry. A lot of important details have been left out. Here are some things it doesn’t say: What would the new system pay doctors and hospitals for their services? How would it decide which medical treatments it should and shouldn’t cover? What strategies would it use to contain health care costs and keep the system affordable? Who would make the decisions, big and small, about how the program would work?
Finally, Sanders’s own campaign economist couldn’t explain to Sanger-Katz how his plan was supposed to work:
I spoke with Gerald Friedman, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who provided the campaign with estimates of the program’s cost. … Mr. Friedman calculates, for example, that the cost of physician services in a single-payer system could be lowered by 10.7 percent — his estimate of how much doctors currently spend on billing and administration staff that they would no longer need. I asked him how the payer would get to that number — would the government pay lower prices for treatments, or change which treatments it paid for, or switch doctors to a system in which they earn government salaries? He couldn’t say with certainty. ‘The pleasure of being an academic is I can just spell things out and leave the details to others,’ he said. ‘The details very quickly get very messy.’
Well, that’s quite an admission. But in the three years since Sanger-Katz tried to understand how Sanders’s plan worked, it seems everyone in Sanders’s orbit, himself included, has been leaving the details to others. After being embarrassed in the pages of The New York Times in 2016, apparently they learned nothing.
Astonishingly, when the AP reported on the Mercatus study last year, Sanders wasn’t even able to begin to refute the report’s conclusion that his plan was financially unsustainable. Why? “Sanders’ office has not done a cost analysis, a spokesman said.”
His recently proposed “Medicare for all” legislation doesn’t much improve on prior attempts to flesh out how health care will be administered in a cost-effective manner, even as it’s full of tax hike proposals such as 70 percent marginal tax rates on income over $10 million, 77 percent estate taxes on the rich, and taxes on big banks. Even the liberal outlet Vox once again admits the “plan has lots of details about what single-payer would cover. It has less information on how to pay for it.” Sanders can try to soak the rich all he wants, but it doesn’t mean much when credible estimates suggest “doubling all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan.”
In the end, Sanders doesn’t have a health care plan, so much as a branding strategy for one. Medicare, despite its fiscal unsustainability, is very popular. So calling government-run health care “Medicare for all” is a stroke of genius, insofar as it makes the American public more receptive to socialist ideas. That’s why other Democratic candidates are happy to associate themselves with “Medicare for all” as a slogan, but appear to be distancing themselves from the actual policy.
Kamala Harris may be co-sponsoring Sanders’s legislation, but ultimately she “backs many incremental, go-slow plans that aren’t as radical and add up to something more like ‘Medicare for more’ or a strengthened version of Obamacare,” notes Politico . Similarly, another candidate and Senate co-sponsor, Elizabeth Warren, has taken a similarly less radical approach, saying she’s “ open to different paths ” to getting “Medicare for all.” In reality, her plan is more like the “ACA 2.0.”
In a lot of polls, Sanders is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. He cannot be allowed to offer a radical plan he freely admits will cause 180 million Americans to lose their existing health care coverage and not bother explaining how it works.
Yet he’s gotten away with it for three years. The press, as well as his competitors in the Democratic primary, need to grow a spine and demand some real answers here.

Mother Of Trans Child Critiques Bans On 'Conversion Therapy',thefederalist.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/feminist-pro-gay-mother-trans-child-critiques-bans-conversion-therapy/,"By Anonymous April 16, 2019
Something odd is happening in gender clinics. In 2017, the number of males receiving transgender surgery in the United States increased by 41 percent over the year before, while the number of females seeking such surgery increased by 289 percent.
At the Tavistock Clinic, Britain’s sole pediatric gender clinic, the number of boys referred over the past decade has increased by 1,150 percent , the number of girls by 4,400 percent. Why is the number of females seeking transgender treatments rising much more quickly than the number of males?
You can get some clues by looking at blogs and videos posted by detransitioned and desisted women. Detransitioners and desisters are people who thought they were transgender for a time and changed their minds. In their posts, some common themes regarding these women’s reasons for transitioning emerge, reasons that have nothing to do with being transgender. Some young women say they transitioned because of same-sex attraction. They had internalized so much homophobia, they became boys rather than accept themselves as lesbians. In Britain, five clinicians have resigned from the Tavistock clinic on principle in the last three years. One of their major concerns is the large numbers of gay children being transitioned because of homophobia. The children were facing either bullying at school or parents who did not accept them. One clinician said , “A lot of the girls would come in and say, ‘I’m not a lesbian. I fell in love with my best girl friend but then I went online and realized I’m not a lesbian, I’m a boy. Phew.’” Staff at the clinic joked ruefully that due to transition “there would be no gay people left.” Other women say they transitioned as a reaction to trauma, often the trauma of a sexual assault. One detransitioned woman said (minute 1:55) a sexual assault “absolutely contributed to just this feeling that I wanted to take my body off.” Women using transition as camouflage is not progressive. Progress occurs when women no longer feel a need to hide. One of the reasons my daughter gave for wanting to transition was because people listen to boys, and she wanted to be heard. Notice she did not say she had a deep internal sense that she was a boy. She wanted the kind of respect she believes only boys attain. Girls shouldn’t have to medically transition to get respect. The culture needs to change, not the girls. Some women felt they didn’t fit in with other girls and had no examples of gender-nonconforming women. One young woman said (3:47-4:38) “I was never … raised to believe that there was more than one way to be a girl…. I thought femininity and womanhood was like, being thin, being white, wearing skirts and wearing dresses and you know, playing dress up, playing with dolls … and liking boys…. And that was never my experience.… I thought, well then I must be a boy.” Due to internalized misogyny, women have often been convinced they need to modify their bodies. “Teen girls are taught to hate everything about themselves. None of us can win. Even the thinnest, most clear-skinned, prettiest of girls find an enemy in the mirror,” a desisted woman said . In response to culture telling them their bodies are not good enough, women from many generations and places have bound their feet; mutilated their genitals; wore corsets, girdles, and high heels; endured cosmetic surgeries; and starved themselves. What feminists see in gender-dysphoric girls binding their breasts, taking testosterone, and seeking mastectomies, hysterectomies, metoidioplasties, and phalloplasties is a new and more virulent form of internalized misogyny.
When my daughter came out as transgender, I wanted to find a therapist who could help her sort out what her gender dysphoria meant. Was she transgender, or was she ashamed of same-sex attraction, reacting to trauma, wanting respect, uncomfortable with feminine stereotypes, or had she internalized hate for women’s bodies?
I quickly discovered that it is nearly impossible to find therapists who do this kind of work. If a girl presents as transgender today, the vast majority of therapists will immediately affirm the girl’s declared gender identity and ask her what steps she would like to take toward transition.
I interviewed at least a dozen therapists in search of one who could help my daughter examine her feelings and motivations. I finally resorted to paying out-of-pocket for my daughter to talk online to a therapist who lives in another state. I know I am not alone. I belong to an online support group of nearly 1,500 parents of gender dysphoric youth. Finding therapists who provide standard mental health therapy rather than automatic affirmation is a frustration for most of us.
Twenty states are considering well-intentioned anti-conversion therapy bills in 2019, including my own state of Minnesota. The term conversion therapy used to apply only to attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation. Now the term is applied to attempts to change either a person’s sexual orientation or a person’s gender identity.
The goal of anti-conversion therapy bills is to ban mental health therapists from using conversion therapy with minors. I am afraid these bills will have a chilling effect on therapists’ ability to help girls who say they are transgender. Let me be very clear: I am discussing only the impact of anti-conversion therapy bills on youth who are identifying as transgender only. My arguments don’t apply to sexual orientation.
What the general public does not understand is that standard mental health therapy is now considered conversion therapy when practiced with gender-dysphoric youth.
This is how my daughter’s therapist describes her work : “The type of therapy I’m doing is … pretty standard….You’re doing a thorough assessment of a client long-term…You’re looking at their history back many years. You’re thinking about comorbidities, other types of psychological or mental health issues that might be … contributing to their discomfort, and you’re looking at the symptomology and trying to really thoroughly assess where this is coming from….For example, people who have a body image disorder or an eating disorder, the symptomology is going to look very, very similar.to what we describe as gender dysphoria. So the work I’m doing is really just a careful analysis of a person’s … presenting concerns” (7:45-8:45). Does this sound harmful? Does it sound like an attempt to change someone’s gender identity?
My daughter has appreciated the opportunity to think deeply about what her feelings mean and whether transition would be a helpful thing for her. Yet activists who believe in an affirmation-only approach are filing complaints to her therapist’s licensing board, claiming the therapist is practicing conversion therapy.
Why are transactivists so determined to prevent youth from receiving therapy that in any other context would be considered good and ethical practice? I think it is because transactivists believe they should be exempt from the rules the rest of us follow when we seek medical care.
I accept that I must get a diagnosis from a doctor before the doctor will give me a prescription or a referral. There are some elective treatments a doctor will give me without a diagnosis, such as cosmetic surgery. I accept that I must pay for elective procedures; my insurer will not.
By contrast, transwoman Andrea Long Chu wrote in a New York Times opinion article that a trans person should be able to get surgery based on “a simple demonstration of want” even if it will make the person feel worse. Long Chu asserts that when doctors use the alleviation of pain as the criteria for treatment, they are acting like “dictators” and “kings.”
In an essay for Jezebel.com, transactivist Harron Walker was enraged because a journalist dared to feature several detransitioners in a story about adolescent transition for The Atlantic . Walker fears that stories focusing on people who feel their transitions were a mistake might lead medical providers to reinstitute gatekeeping for hormone therapy, the same kind of gatekeeping the rest of us take for granted when we seek medical treatment.
I suspect Walker’s outrage is fueled by the fact that The Atlantic is a mainstream media outlet with a large circulation, a national readership, and a left-center bias . Coverage of detransitioners in mainstream media poses a threat to transactivists who want their treatments available on demand and covered by insurance.
To transactivists, girls who transition by mistake are expendable collateral damage whose existence must not be allowed to hinder trans people’s access to hormone therapy and surgeries. Thus, standard mental health therapy must be called conversion therapy, and it must be banned through legislation.
If standard mental health therapy is allowed, someone might notice that gatekeeping serves an important purpose. Someone might figure out that trans people are no better than the rest of us at diagnosing and treating their own illnesses. Many transgender people will say they are not ill and should not be treated as such. If they are not ill, then they are seeking elective treatments, and they should pay the full cost just like the rest of us.
In his Jezebel rant, Walker says a journalist writing about children who transitioned by mistake is using the kids “as a smokescreen” to hide anti-trans sentiment. My daughter is not a smokescreen. Neither are the thousands of young women like her struggling in a culture that does not value them. They are harmed, not helped, by immediate affirmation of gender identities that may have been adopted as a way to cope with other issues.
If you want to help girls, talk to your legislators. Tell them to require therapists to provide thorough assessments for gender-dysphoric minors and to identify and treat any comorbidities.
Ironically, one of the clinicians who resigned from the Tavistock clinic said of the clinic’s practices, “It feels like conversion therapy for gay children.” If you really want to ban efforts to convert young lesbians into straight people — that is, into straight transmen — tell legislators to remove gender identity from anti-conversion therapy bills. Girls need all of us to take a stand.
States currently considering conversion therapy bans include : Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.
States that have already banned conversion therapy include: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

The Moral Case For Israel Annexing The West Bank—And Beyond,thefederalist.com,Jason Hill,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/moral-case-israel-annexing-west-bank-beyond/,"By Jason Hill April 16, 2019
The April 2019 election victory for Benjamin Netanyahu will see him serve a record fifth term as Israeli prime minister and form a new right-wing coalition government. It also brings the promise of a commitment Netanyahu made to the nation during his campaign: That he would annex Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territories.
Vowing to extend sovereignty without distinguishing between settlement blocks and the isolated settlements, Netanyahu promised not to transfer any sovereignty to the Palestinians. His victory in the elections will, hopefully, see the enactment of Netanyahu’s promise.
Israel has the moral right to annex all of the West Bank (even Area C) for a plethora of reasons. Israel’s Mistake Was Allowing the Palestinian Pretense
Israel made an altruistic mistake toward the Palestinian people after the 1967 defensive war with Jordan. Rather than regard them as “war settlers” or refugees or, after legally occupying conquered territory, as “illegal occupants,” they made the Palestinian people their political and moral problem.
After victory, the “war settlers” could have been seen as enemies of the state: supporters of the Fatah (Palestine Liberation Organization) Charter, which basically calls for the end of Jewry in the region. Under a malevolent and illiberal regime, they would have been regarded and treated as such, not as Israel did treat them: as human beings with specific, inalienable rights.
Under a different set of political sensibilities, the Palestinian people would have been militarily removed from the area because, morally speaking, after the 1967 war, they never belonged there. The proper response from Israel should have been to immediately annex the land and make the people there the responsibility of their original political homeland: Jordan.
There can be no such thing as legitimate “Palestinian Territory” in a geographic region legally seized in a defensive war instigated by a foreign aggressor. The purpose of war is always to vanquish the enemy. The losers of the war cannot make demands on the victors that the victors themselves would not have been put in the position of meeting had the adversary or enemy not forced the victors into making it in the first place.
Israel was forced into a war, which it won. It was then expected to renounce and repudiate the consequences of its fairly won war by capitulating to the conditions of its vanquished enemy, which included, among other self-sacrificially undertaken goals, granting statehood, autonomy, right of return, and the ultimate elimination of Jewry from the region. The Palestinian Authority Is a Terrible Government
Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) have enjoyed joint rule by Israeli military government and the Palestinian Authority with around 98 percent of the Palestinians living in areas under jurisdiction of the PA. In such areas, the PA has destroyed the freedom Palestinians enjoyed under Israeli rule and their economy through kleptocracy, corruption, nepotism, and authoritarian forms of governance subject to none of the checks and balances that characterize Israel’s Knesset.
Jewish exceptionalism and the exceptionalist nature of Jewish civilization require an unconditional space for the continued evolution of their civilization. What’s good for Jewish civilization is good for humanity at large. Jewish civilization is an international treasure trove that must be protected.
Not all cultures are indeed equal. Some are abysmally inferior and regressive based on their comprehensive philosophy and fundamental principles—or lack thereof—that guide or fail to protect the inalienable rights of their citizens.
Given the voting patterns of Palestinians—towards Islamicism and terrorist organizations for the most part—that openly advocate and work for Israeli and Jewish destruction and annihilation, a strong argument can and ought to be made to strip Palestinians of their right to vote—period. The regional hostilities towards Israel in the Middle East are such that Israel must take those threats seriously. It must work for a coalition of forces to neutralize them. Israel Has Every Right to Defeat Terrorists
The Israeli left should abandon its agonistic handwringing over so-called Palestinian occupation and realize that applying Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, meaning the wholesale destruction of Hamas in Gaza—Hamas being a terrorist organization that can claim no rights as a group and no right to any square inch of land in the region—is an application of democratic law protecting the rights of the individuals who rightfully belong there.
Speaking of Gaza, although the strip was unilaterally relinquished, when one considers the reign of terror executed by the Hamas terrorists and the unadulterated illiberality of the movement itself, Israel has every moral right to wage a ruthless and unrelenting war against Hamas and to re-settle the land if it ever so desires.
America must also admit that it owes Israel political and financial reparations for America’s many decades of support of the PLO and the PA, which have pledged destruction to Israel, and have rejected all plausible peace offerings from Israel, preferring instead war and destruction.
This political and economic reparation would see the United States supplying Israel even more advanced military capabilities, and funding Israel’s military defense in any manner Israel deems necessary for its survival and unrivaled military status in the Middle East. Some may ask why this is necessary. The answer is two-fold.
Should a regional conflict between Israel and her Arab neighbors emerge, Israel will need to demonstrate extraordinary, excessive, and unprecedented military might in a manner that can act as a deterrent and, if necessary, to irrevocably destroy her offensive enemies.
Additional U.S. militarization of Israel is also moral in its execution. It sends a univocally clear message to the world that in any conflict between Israel and her adversaries, the United States stands willing and ready—along with her ally—to destroy any political agent that attacks the sovereignty of Israel. This is because Israel’s right to exist is non-negotiable and it has a right to unilaterally apply Israeli law over its nation-state. Why Palestinians Have No Moral Authority
Continued militarization of Israel comprises protracted support of our political and moral alter-ego in the Middle East. The decline of the Palestinian people is narrated by their willful ideological malfeasance. They have never come into their own as a people largely because they have never explicitly held a philosophy that can support freedom, the basic liberal principles of individual rights, and a free market economy.
Given Fatah and Hamas’s genocidal aspirations toward Israel and universal Jewry and, in the case of Hamas, of a global caliphate, a moral goal would be to reverse the potential sovereignty of every Palestinian movement in the region. It ought to force Jordan to re-revoke its citizenship status of the Palestinian majority in Jordan. A people that overwhelmingly approves of their terrorist leaders cannot be made to become citizens of any civilized country such as Israel.
The Palestinian terror war Fatah launched after the 2000 Camp David Peace Summit and unilaterally accepted by the Palestinian people places them in a precarious position. Whatever actions Israel or any of her allies take against them in a war against terror are their responsibility, and are moral. A people that overwhelmingly approves of their terrorist leaders cannot be made to become citizens of any civilized country such as Israel. No moral or political distinctions must be made between Fatah, Hamas, and the people who elect and or support them. No constituted people responsible for the election and appointment of terrorist actors can or should be entrusted with the responsibility of voting.
They constitute a national security threat to Israel because a core feature of their identity is a commitment to destroying Israel as a Jewish state. Therefore, only a policy of radical containment or expulsion remains a viable option. No state can obstruct the case for the achievement of its own justice and territorial safety by aiding and abetting its own destroyers. By making strategic alliances with ISIS, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations—should political expediency dictate such a move—we will witness the destruction of Jewish secularism in the region and religious militarization of the entire region.
One cannot admit anti-Semitics devoted to the destruction of Israel into the domain of Jewish civilization. There has to be some semblance of re-shaping the political sensibilities of those outside the historic process. If this is not possible, then we have to admit to their intrinsic humanity, but also, nevertheless, confess to their tragic status as political ballasts. Jason D.

"No, Joe Scarborough, Spying On Trump Wasn't Done 'By The Book'",thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/no-joe-scarborough-spying-on-trump-wasnt-done-by-the-book/,"By Mollie Hemingway April 16, 2019
When Attorney General William Barr acknowledged the Donald Trump campaign was spied on in 2016 by agencies investigating a dramatic conspiracy theory about alleged collusion with Russia, and said he’d like to review the matter, those who pushed the theory began to panic.
Some media figures attempted to deny that spying had occurred, even though it had been revealed in various and sundry ways. They conceded that overseas intelligence assets had been placed against the campaign, that wiretaps had been secured, and that national security letters had been drafted, but they claimed these examples of spying were not spying. That they’d regularly and repeatedly referred to them as spying in non-Trump contexts slowed them down not at all.
Some tried to pretend that the only example of spying was the surveillance of Carter Page, but that it didn’t count because he’d left the campaign before the surveillance began. There were a few problems, including that wiretaps can be used to secure information from months and years prior to the date it is obtained. Besides, Page had encounters with an overseas U.S. intelligence asset while he was still on the campaign. So had other campaign affiliates.
The media had previously reported that four Trump affiliates had been spied on secretly surveilled: Page, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Mike Flynn. It is unclear what other American citizens on the Trump campaign, if anyone, were spied on by their government.
Last Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” a quintet of pundits sputtered about Barr’s description . Barr specifically said he was not saying anything improper had definitively happened, just that it needed to be reviewed since spying on American citizens was such a serious thing.
“Spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated,” he said.
Barr referenced controversial spying on American citizens during the Vietnam War, which led to reforms in the laws governing such spying.
“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr said. “It’s big deal. The generation I grew up in, which was the Vietnam War period, you know, people were all concerned about spying on the antiwar people and so forth by the government. And there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there’s an adequate basis before our law-enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance. I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated. But I think it’s important to look at that,” he said, adding that he felt an “obligation to make sure that government power was not abused.”
National affairs analyst John Heilemann said, inexplicably, there was “no evidence” for Barr’s claim. Host Joe Scarborough then pivoted to a completely different line of argument. He said that while there was no evidence of spying, such spying on political opponents is a totally normal and accepted practice.
“Everything was done by the book and there were procedural safeguards,” Scarborough said, before sputtering that Barr was “stupid” and “reckless and irresponsible.” He also said the well regarded attorney who soberly stated indisputable facts was “destroying his legacy here.”
While a thorough investigation will need to be performed to figure out how the FBI and other agencies got wrapped up in a conspiracy theory that they felt justified breaking norms and spying on political foes, it is not true that everything was “by the book.”
For example, FBI Director James Comey failed to notify Congress for nine months that an investigation into the Trump campaign had been opened, even though he was supposed to provide quarterly updates about particularly sensitive investigations. In fact, Rep. Elise Stefanik just introduced legislation to make it more difficult for FBI directors to thwart “the book” on these matters.
While at least four spy secret surveillance warrants were approved, a congressional investigation by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence described the verification effort before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) not as “by the book” but so inadequate it resembled a concerted effort to conceal information from the court : A salacious and unverified dossier formed an essential part of the application to secure a warrant against a Trump campaign affiliate named Carter Page. This application failed to reveal that the dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The application presented a Yahoo News article as corroboration for the dossier, when in fact it was sourced to the dossier’s author Christopher Steele. The wife of a high-ranking Justice Department official also worked on behalf of the Clinton campaign effort, and her husband Bruce Ohr funneled her research into the Department of Justice. Although he admitted that Steele “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president,” this and the Ohrs’ relationship with the Clinton campaign was concealed from the secret court that grants surveillance warrants. The dossier was “only minimally corroborated” and unverified, according to FBI officials.
A criminal referral from the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmed that the dossier was unverified when it was used to secure the wiretaps.
A third example of the anti-Trump campaign not going “by the book” was the widespread use of leaks to further the investigation and the false narrative of treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the election. U.S. officials selectively leaked information to frequently give the impression that Trump was a threat to national security because of his illegal actions with Vladimir Putin.
Leaking classified information is illegal, although no one has been held responsible yet for the criminal leak against Flynn, which falsely suggested he was an agent of Putin. But even leaks of non-classified information can be extremely harmful to national security. High-level intelligence officials arranged a meeting with president-elect Trump to brief him on the now-discredited dossier in order to leak it to friendly reporters at CNN. This leak turbocharged the Trump-Russia conspiracy that devoured CNN and other media outlets. It was not done “by the book.”
Presumably some of the spying on the Trump campaign was done “by the book,” but that doesn’t include using false information as pretext to spy on Americans, attempting to extort elected officials through bogus investigations, refusing to charge ideological allies who committed crimes, lying to Congress, refusing to respond to congressional document requests, using intelligence and law enforcement as “insurance policies” against political enemies, widespread unmasking of political opponents and dissemination of their information, using foreign spies to produce evidence not permissible in court, circular introduction of “evidence” to government agents that is reintroduced through media leaks, and various other actions taken by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
Scarborough would have you believe that these actions are completely typical and normal, that informants are placed against campaigns all the time. If that’s true, who else are they doing it against? Can Donald Trump’s officials open investigations against the many Democratic candidates without notifying Congress, using bogus opposition research to secure wiretaps? To quote an MSNBC morning host, “Is he that stupid?”
One more thing about the phrase “by the book.” I can’t be the only person to notice that the phrase is the same one used by Susan Rice in a curious email she sent to herself on the date Trump was inaugurated. The email was about a January 5 meeting between President Obama, former FBI director Comey, and former deputy attorney general Sally Yates regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
“President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities ‘by the book’. The President stressed that he is not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book.”
As senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina wrote more than a year ago , “It strikes us as odd that, among your activities in the final moments on the final day of the Obama administration, you would feel the need to send yourself such an unusual email purporting to document a conversation involving President Obama and his interactions with the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia investigation. In addition, despite your claim that President Obama repeatedly told Mr. Comey to proceed ‘by the book,’ substantial questions have arisen about whether officials at the FBI, as well as at the Justice Department and the State Department, actually did proceed ‘by the book.’”

"Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke Give Almost Nothing To Charity",thefederalist.com,Liz Wolfe,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/bernie-sanders-beto-orourke-give-almost-nothing-charity/,"By Liz Wolfe April 16, 2019
Last night, The Washington Post reported that Beto O’Rourke released his tax returns for the past ten years. Of course, the feel-good, inevitably government-expanding presidential contender should probably have been more hesitant to release his returns because it doesn’t take much sleuthing to figure out from them that the O’Rourkes made $370,412 in 2017 while giving a measly $1,166 of that income to charity. As The Post noted, this makes Beto’s charitable giving less than one-third of 1 percent of his household income.
Other candidates who claim conservatives are the true greedy ones and deserve to be smited for their fiscal sins don’t stack up much better. Bernie Sanders and his wife gave roughly 3 percent of their astonishingly large $566,000 income to charity in 2017. Interestingly, Sanders recently talked about his impressive sum of book earnings, and Reason’s Peter Suderman pointed out that the socialist is indeed a millionaire :
I think it’s genuinely great that Bernie Sanders is a millionaire, and that in becoming a millionaire, our nation’s most well-known democratic socialist politician has, however inadvertently, started defending one of the core tenets of capitalism—that if you come up with an idea for a product, make that product a reality in the world, and sell it to lots of willing buyers, it’s perfectly just and reasonable for you to earn a lot of money as a result.
He’s exactly right. None of these impressively wealthy Democratic presidential contenders should be scorned for making heaps, providing it’s from creating value that people want to benefit from.
Kamala Harris (and her husband) made nearly $2 million in 2018, giving 1.4 percent to charity (which totals out to about $27,000); Elizabeth Warren (and her husband) made just shy of $1 million (donating an improved 5.5 percent to charity in 2018). They should, however, be thoroughly criticized for demonizing millionaires and billionaires, branding them the no good, very bad, super icky ultra-wealthy, when they are some of the wealthiest people in America.
Of course, many super-wealthy people don’t think of themselves that way. A YouGov poll from earlier this year found that almost 90 percent of respondents who make $90,000 or more annually consider themselves neither rich nor poor. There’s nothing wrong with abundance, but it is odd that people would be not more self-aware about where they stand compared to the groups many routinely demonize.
Charitable giving should transcend political affiliation. It would be bad for our broader societal health if generosity were grossly weaponized to score political points, because then giving becomes more of a manipulative political ploy than it already is (to recipients, the intention behind giving probably doesn’t make a difference).
There’s something to be said for giving credit where due and recognizing when our political opponents do genuine good. Still, Arthur Brooks wrote on broader charitable giving habits in his 2015 book “The Conservative Heart,” noting:
Households headed by a ‘conservative’ give, on average, 30 percent more dollars to charity than households headed by a ‘liberal.’ This discrepancy is not an artifact of income differences. On the contrary, the average liberal family earns an average of 6 percent more per year than the average conservative family, yet still gives less away.
Later on, he notes that there’s a collective action problem as well:
Consider that the total that Americans give annually to human service organizations to assist the vulnerable comes to about $40 billion. Now suppose that we could spread that sum across the 46.5 million Americans receiving food assistance, with zero overhead and complete effectiveness. It would come to just $860 per person per year.
As much as it fits a convenient narrative, it’s awfully weaselly for liberals with political aspirations to claim conservatives are the stingy ones when those same liberals give miserly amounts of money to the people they purportedly care about.
The Betos and Bernies of the world would probably counter that by saying: 1) poverty is a collective action problem that can only be solved by taxing everybody (one person can only make a tiny dent, so why bother?), 2) the ultra- ultra -rich deserve to be taxed (like, the Koch brothers. Not normal millionaires! Extra big millionaires! Billionaires! Those ones! Trump!), or 3) really this wealth should be harnessed via taxes that way nobody can be exempt. The fact that some can accumulate so much means our system must be fixed (by them—supposedly disinterested third parties).
These points are varying degrees of wrong. 1) Lack of adequate provisions for the poor is absolutely a collective action problem. But it is also one that would probably be helped, on some level, with an extra $300,000 from the Sanders family if they would spare it.
2) If the ultra-rich were the only ones taxed, even if taxed at an insanely high rate, the additional revenue generated would not be enough to cover the hefty price tag of the various social programs that progressives want to institute. There simply aren’t anywhere close to enough Koch-level people in this country. We would also probably have a hard time safeguarding against capital flight, as any sane wealthy person would be wise to get his or her money out of the country as quick as possible.
3) The idea that progressive politicians, people who are emblematic of this very problem, would be God’s gift to man, able to fix poverty and wealth inequality despite being wealth-hoarders themselves is completely goofy. People like Sanders and O’Rourke would have more credibility if they didn’t engage in such hypocritical practices, condemning the big, bad rich people whose greed they want to harness for their own allegedly benevolent bidding.

"If You’re Getting a Huge Tax Refund, You’re Doing It Wrong",thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/youre-getting-huge-tax-refund-youre-wrong/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 16, 2019
Unless you’re a procrastinator, tax filing season officially ended Monday. That milestone means a likely reprise of the political battles from earlier this year about tax refunds and the effects of the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Early in the filing season, Democrats argued that smaller refunds for filers demonstrated the legislation’s ineffectiveness. (As of March 29, the Internal Revenue Service has processed $6 billion less in refunds than during last year’s filing season.) Republicans counter that, under the new law, most individuals will have smaller tax liabilities overall, meaning that individuals receiving smaller refunds this spring benefited from fatter paychecks throughout 2018.
By and large, Republicans have the better argument. Even the liberal Tax Policy Center concedes that most households will benefit from the tax legislation. Under their estimates , more than four in five tax filing units (80.4 percent) received a net tax cut, with fewer than one in twenty (4.8 percent) paying a net tax increase. (About 15 percent of households won’t see a major change, one way or the other.) As a result, most families with smaller refunds received larger net pay during the year, due to smaller tax withholding in their paychecks every month.
But the political back-and-forth misses the bigger point: Individuals who get a large refund at year-end from the Internal Revenue Service are in most cases not managing their money well. Why Give the Government an Interest-Free Loan?
Granted, the major changes to the tax law represent an anomaly. Some individuals could end up with a big refund this year out of an abundance of caution—they did not fully understand how the changes to the tax code would affect their financial situation, so did not want to reduce their monthly tax withholding.
But in most years and most cases, Americans’ use of their tax refunds, which averaged $2,727 last year , as a planned “bonus” check appears irrational. For instance, one survey released last month found that the largest percentage of Americans (27 percent) plan to use their refund to pay down debt.
Consider that for a moment: Individuals are using money they gave the federal government interest-free for several months, or even a year, to pay off debt for which they have been paying interest . For individuals with credit card debt charging 10 percent (or more) in interest, taking a refund in spring 2019 and not paying down their debt during 2018 through larger monthly paychecks cost them several hundred dollars in interest.
Other individuals who use their refunds for major purchases (9 percent), vacations (7 percent), or splurges (3 percent) may think that a low interest rate environment means they’re not losing that much money by taking a big refund each spring. While that belief held true for much of the past decade, it has less validity now.
Interest rates have risen ( albeit slowly ), such that savings accounts are now paying 2-2.5 percent interest. Compared to someone who uses his refund to pay for a tropical vacation, an individual who adjusts his withholding and saves the difference every month will earn enough money in interest to pay for an extra “free” dinner on his trip.
Likewise, individuals looking to place their refunds in an investment (9 percent) or retirement (7 percent) account lose the benefits of months’ worth of potential gains by doing so in a lump sum. Had they invested monthly by reducing their tax withholdings, they would have received dividends on the shares they purchased throughout 2018. Moreover, by investing every month, instead of in a lump sum when they get their tax refunds, individuals would receive the added benefit of dollar-cost averaging —buying small sums over time, rather than making one big bet, in ways that reduce an individual’s exposure to market volatility. Why Pay Fees to Get Your Own Money Back Faster?
Anticipation loans represent a particularly bad form of refund planning. Having given the federal government an interest-free loan for the entire year, individuals choosing the anticipation loan route will end up paying interest and fees to get back the money they lent the federal government for free .
To mitigate this bad planning (only slightly), H&R Block now offers refund anticipation loans without interest and fees. However, the loans come via electronic debit cards, which come with—surprise, surprise!— their own fees .
In a slightly different context, I noted previously the need for Americans to increase their personal savings. Using tax refunds as a form of forced savings reinforces my earlier point. Americans should work to save money throughout the year, not use tax refunds as their sole option to fund their retirement, or pay down debt.
On the one hand, taxpayers giving the federal government interest-free loans benefits me indirectly, by reduces the Treasury’s interest payments. But on the other, the refund phenomenon demonstrates our cultural profligacy—increasing my concern about the debts our nation continues to incur, with little plan to repay.

This Hate Crime Helps Show How To Know Real Ones From Hoaxes,thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/hate-crime-helps-show-know-real-ones-hoaxes/,"By Chad Felix Greene April 16, 2019
In national conversations about hate crimes, members of the media tend to rely on emotional rhetoric rather than rational evaluation of the facts. Despite aggravated assault making up 19.5 percent of hate crimes in 2017, the idea of random acts of hate-motivated violence inspires most of the fear and activism against hate crimes nationwide. Of the total number of hate crimes affecting persons in 2017 in all categories, 79 percent were nonviolent.
To the public imagination, though, the concept of hate crimes conjures images of innocent people being targeted and brutally attacked merely for who they are. Despite many highly publicized incidents turning out to be hoaxes, hate crimes still drive a great deal of media attention. We have become accustomed to making arguments decrying the potential for true victims to be further victimized by lack of public trust in media and that real hate crimes do still happen. Here is an example of one of those true cases.
In July 2018, around 3:30 a.m., 24-year-old Brandon M. Wiley told the police that a 39-year-old gay man propositioned him and grabbed him in a sexual manner. In response, he beat the man, then later posted bloody pictures of himself on social media bragging about the assault.
The victim of the assault was found by police after a security guard witnessed the assault and suffered “multiple serious facial injuries, including a broken nose and fractured orbital sockets.” In April 2019, Wiley pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and police confirmed with video and witnesses that the victim had not molested him. Hate crime charges have been added, and Wiley is scheduled for sentencing in June . What Makes This Hate Crime Plausible?
Multiple factors of this story illustrate the anatomy of a true hate crime. The first, and most important factor, was a neutral third party. A security guard just happened to pass by when the assault happened and was able to see specific details. Witnesses are one of the most important pieces of evidence as they allow more than one perspective to the crime. Hoax hate crimes often lack eyewitnesses or, if one is present, such witnesses have a bias towards the victim and may not be an objective source of truth.
In addition to eyewitnesses, the most affecting source of evidence comes from video or audio recordings of the event. In this case, security cameras caught the entire interaction between the two individuals. This allowed the police a straightforward view into the factual events. Security footage may not reveal verbal evidence, but in this case the attacker claimed the victim first assaulted him by grabbing his crotch. This was quickly disproven by the video evidence.
Police found the victim lying on the ground where the assault occurred, and he was taken to the hospital. Immediately going to the hospital is a powerful indicator of legitimate injury also, as it does not allow for staging or exaggeration of events.
Again, the victim had multiple witnesses to his injuries and was evaluated by medical professionals rather than taking a bloody selfie and posting it on social media or waiting until later to go to the hospital. The police were informed by a third party, in this case the security guard, and allowed the facts to be objectively recorded without outside influence. The first person to interact with the victim post-attack was the police officer, which significantly strengthens the case.
One of the most revealing aspects of this case is the pride the attacker took in his actions. He posted pictures of himself immediately afterwards, positioning himself as the victim and bragging about severely beating the man. He clearly intended for the public to know his motivations and felt justified in his actions.
A widely overlooked aspect in the narrative about a hateful population intentionally targeting minorities for violence is that we rarely see attackers bragging about their actions. It would seem reasonable that if people truly despise LGBT people to such an extent that they feel compelled to physically attack them in public, there would be more public celebration of such attacks. Perpetrator Motives and Victim Reaction
A Texas study of hate crimes found that most reported hate crimes never identify a suspect and many are dismissed due to little or no evidence. It seems that the media assumes perpetrators of hate crimes simply wish to attack individuals of hated groups for the satisfaction alone rather than as a (perceived) political or social message.
In this case, the victim did admit to the police to propositioning the attacker . While a wildly inappropriate response, it is at least a reason that explains the attack. Too often we are simply asked to believe random citizens roam the streets looking for members of marginalized groups to assault for the sheer joy of the act.
Another unique property of this crime is that it took several months to collect sufficient evidence to properly prosecute the attacker with local reports updating the case. Too often, hate crimes receive a large, public announcement and rarely involve resolution or follow-up. This case was reported locally and in several LGBT news sources, but never achieved nationwide attention or outrage. This allowed the police and prosecution to gather evidence and build a case.
One overlooked quality of this case that significantly distinguishes it from most reported hate crimes is that the victim is not publicly named. Typically, an alleged victim immediately turns to social media or the press and tells his or her story before any investigation can be conducted.
In this case, even though he was viciously beaten over a minor infraction, he chose not to take this route. He was attacked, went to the hospital, gave an honest police report, and allowed justice to be properly served as he healed and rebuilt his life. While he deserves public sympathy for the attack, he did not seek fame or money. This says a great deal about the legitimacy of the incident. Would Extra Laws Really Deter Hate Crimes? Not Likely
This was a hate crime because the attacker reacted to the proposition with extreme violence and bragged about attacking the victim, a gay man. The gay man took a chance in a moment of weakness late at night in a bar, and did not deserve to be viciously beaten. But an important question is: what law would have prevented this attack?
Although a terrible situation and unfortunate experience of engaging with the wrong person in the wrong scenario, the assault on its own was already illegal. Although a hate crime charge increases sentencing, is this going to influence Wiley’s future choices or his views on gay men or his own sexuality, which inspired the assault to begin with? Will the hate crime charges prevent a similar irrational young man from doing the same?
One of the unfortunate rhetorical media reactions, especially in LGBT advocacy, is the outrage that the violent incident occurred in the first place. They insist the same could happen to all LGBT people nationwide, and that the incident is evidence of a larger pattern. But this situation is far more of an outlier than a pattern. In fact, it’s the bold honesty of the attacker about his motivations that makes this story stand out as shocking and disturbing. Our collective agreement that this is morally wrong should be evidence enough that no one supports violence against LGBT people.
It is equally as important to recognize legitimate hate crimes as it is to report on the abuse of public sympathy and compassion with high-profile hoaxes. We should recognize that, despite the unfair imbalance of hoaxes to legitimate crimes, the police take reports seriously and do everything in their power to get justice for victims.
Unfortunately, it takes a real hate crime with a satisfying resolution for us to appreciate just how safe and protected LGBT individuals are in our society. The police and our justice system should be thanked for this. Chad Felix Greene is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Tiger Woods Showed Us The Power Of Grit And Redemption,thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/tiger-woods-showed-us-power-grit-redemption/,"By Helen Raleigh April 17, 2019
Early Sunday afternoon, my husband was chatting with his 75-year-old father over the phone. Both are usually quiet men who believe it’s unmanly to wear one’s emotions on one’s sleeves. So their phone calls normally last less than five minutes. Yet last Sunday afternoon, they spent more than 30 minutes talking about Tiger Woods and recounting his play at the Masters golf tournament, hole by hole. The excitement in their voices was infectious.
I asked my husband later why he cheered for Woods all these years even though Woods hadn’t won any major for 11 years and hadn’t won the Masters for 14 years. My husband replied, “I don’t cheer for him but appreciate him. I watch sports for those few transcendent moments. Tiger is one of a handful of athletes to consistently provide those moments.”
In the mid ’90s when I immigrated to the United States, before I had a chance to pick up a golf club and hit my first shot, I’d already heard of Tiger Woods. The world of golf was divided into pre-Woods and post-Woods.
Pre-Woods, golf seemed to be a slow and boring game played mostly by slightly out of shape mid-aged or older men. Then when Woods came along, golf suddenly became a cool, fun, and athletic, challenging game. He was young and fit. He played golf with machine-like precision and collected one trophy after another, as if he simply checked off boxes on his way to Jack Nicklaus’ record of winning 18 majors.
Some called Woods a superhuman, a superhero, or even a robot. His youth and biracial background were relatable to average Joes, yet he had this air of aloofness that put a great emotional distance between him and all other mere mortals. Still, we liked him, admired him from afar, and were all certain that he was destined to greatness because he was unstoppable and invincible.
The ’90s was a hopeful time for many, including myself, a new immigrant with new experiences and, soon after, a new career and a new boyfriend. My life, while not as spectacular as Tiger’s, was moving in the right direction, too. The Late-2000s Turning Point
2008 was a terrible year and a turning point for a lot of us, including Woods. Our nation fell into a deep economic recession and many Americans lost jobs, houses, hopes, and their American dreams. It was also the last year Woods won a major and a beginning of a long, winless drought. Later some say it was the beginning of an end — an end of the era of greatness defined by Woods.
In 2009, our Thanksgiving break was interrupted by the revelation of Woods’ sex scandal . When the scandal broke, his daughter Sam was two and his son Charlie was a newborn. Sponsors like Accenture began to drop him, and his wife divorced him a year later.
A few years later, the world saw his terrible mug shot after the DUI charge. He didn’t seem cool and invincible any more. The bags under his eyes and his hallowed look showed us a deeply flawed mortal possessed by his own demons. He lost his touch and his game suffered.
Then his body kept failing him. There were repeated back surgeries. He could barely walk, and merely limped along. It was reported that, in 2017 at Augusta, he had to take a nerve blocker to make it upstairs to the Champions Dinner. His world ranking fell from 1 to 1,199. It seemed that his dream of beating Nicklaus’ record was only a dream. The whisper of a Tiger comeback or a Tiger redemption faded away in a few years after one humiliating loss after another.
His personal failings reminded us that we are all fallible. His physical failings reminded us how fragile our own bodies are and how little control we have. Like a funhouse mirror, his outsized fall forced us to stare back at a reality we didn’t want to face.
The world of golf hasn’t been the same without an invincible Tiger. Yes, there have been many good, young players like Jason Day and Jordan Spieth. But none of them could bring back the kind of mojo that Woods had. It’s hard to appreciate golf without Tiger. just like it’s hard to appreciate a Greek mythology without Hercules. Tiger’s Resurgence
Then everything changed last Sunday. After a 15-year gap, Woods won the Masters again, when everyone least expected it. Just like the video Nike put out, he “experienced every high and every low,” but never gave up chasing his crazy dream. After all the scandals, injuries, and failures, he came back in the most spectacular way on Palm Sunday. With this win, his ranking in the world climbed 1,193 spots to number six.
The beauty of Augusta is that it’s the only major golf tournament that takes place at the same golf course at the same time, year after year. But Tiger is a different player this time. He no longer walks around with an air of aloofness or invincibility. As sports reporter Jason Gay observed , Tiger is more “human” now, and there was a sense of humility. He put on a great performance, but it was the way he scooped up his son after the 18th hole that made our eyes moist and hearts melt. The display of raw emotion stirred something deep in our hearts too.
Frank Pallotta, a sports reporter for CNN, tweeted two photos: on the left, Tiger hugged his dad in 1997 when he won the Masters for the first time. As a young man he sought his famously demanding father’s approval. On the right, Tiger hugged his son, Charlie. As a father, it seems his biggest joy was to share this incredible moment with his children. Life comes full circle.
Last week was a good week in some ways. Two things that we previously considered impossible happened: first, scientists presented us with the first-ever photo of a black hole. Then, Woods won the Masters again after 15 years. The lesson from both? Don’t let naysayers define your life. Don’t settle for less. No matter how far behind you are, never give up. With persistence and focus, crazy dreams do come true.
We should also remember that this week is the holiest week for Christians. Wood’s redemption on Palm Sunday serves as a good reminder for all of us that no matter how far we fall—or how flawed we are—we can all be redeemed.

What To Expect From Democrats When Mueller’s Report Drops Thursday,thefederalist.com,Jason Beale,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/expect-democrats-muellers-report-drops-thursday/,"By Jason Beale April 17, 2019
You know the moment in a really suspenseful movie when That Thing happens and everyone in the theater simultaneously realizes that nothing will ever be the same?
Everything slows down. The camera focuses on a face, or an object. Birds suddenly take flight. Characters turn to each other, their expressions changing in slow motion from light-hearted to tense, sensing danger. Eyes widen. A single, high-pitched note pierces the scene.
Think Arya Stark watching from the crowd when her father Eddard is beheaded. The glass of water on the table in Jurassic Park, rippling to the beat of a dinosaur’s footsteps. Private Ryan’s mother doing the dishes, not noticing as we all watch that government vehicle coming up her driveway.
That Thing happened on March 24 when Attorney General William Barr released his summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election and any links or coordination with members of the Trump campaign. The summary reported the bottom-line findings of the Mueller team: no conspiracy or coordination, and no decision on obstruction of justice, although there was no finding of a crime.
As attorney general, it fell to Barr to make that decision, and he did. In consultation with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and DOJ prosecutors, Barr found that the evidence provided in the report was insufficient to warrant an obstruction charge.
In doing so, Barr brought the sword down on Eddard Stark’s neck, uncaged the Tyrannosaurus Rex, and drove that black sedan up to Mrs. Ryan’s front door. Everything stopped. In Washington and New York, thousands of Democratic politicians and media luminaries froze, as their worldview and credibility instantly shattered under the weight of Barr’s words. A single, piercing, foreboding note echoed across the country, from Washington to Los Angeles. Everything had changed, and nothing would ever be the same. Here’s Where It Diverges from a Movie Plot
In the movies, there has to be a denouement of some sort—an untying of the plot that brought us to this moment—to give meaning and substance to the story. It can’t end with a plot twist. The plot twist is just the beginning of an ending that could include anything from redemption to revenge to triumph.
Unfortunately, for all us this isn’t a movie, and there will be no proper denouement—at least not in the near term. After two years of shamelessly and enthusiastically hyping the notion that the president of the United States is a compromised agent of the Russian Federation—a process that involved dozens upon dozens of anonymously sourced falsehoods, falsely interpreted statements, demonstrably false characterizations of classified evidence, and false predication for official sanction to spy on fellow citizens—those who perpetrated those acts will do everything in their power to avoid this unexpected and unwelcome introduction of truth into their narrative.
Under any circumstances other than those that include a collusive media, the Democratic politicians and former intelligence officials who perpetrated this hoax would be the laughingstock of the world.
There’s a reason beer companies pay millions for 30-second ads, and millions more to advertising companies to draw from a variety of well-studied human influence techniques to craft their commercials: it’s worth the money. It sells. The strategy is simple—just make sure the message and the logo are out there as often and consistently as possible, and the return will validate the investment.
The same applies to cable news networks and national newspapers staffed and managed by left-leaning Democrats. The constant barrage of reflexive leftist messaging and 24/7 cover, support, and venue for Democratic talking points is literally priceless, from an advertising perspective.
There is no possible way to quantify the influence of legacy media in aiding and abetting the notion that President Trump was a compromised agent of Russia, but think about how much Budweiser pays for 30 seconds, then think about the cumulative messaging influence of Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon, Jim Sciutto, Jim Acosta, Joy Reid, Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O’Donnell, Malcolm Nance, Chris Hayes, Chris Matthews, Gloria Borger, April Ryan, Andrea Mitchell, Simone Sanders, Asha Rangappa, John Berman, Paul Begala, Max Boot, and Anderson Cooper.
Each of these people is as influential during his nightly five-minute to one-hour pro-collusion, anti-Trump advertisement as is the Trivago guy in convincing us to visit his site in his 30-second ad. It sells. The only difference is that you can probably trust the Trivago guy to accurately represent the capabilities of his travel site, because we have laws that guard against false advertising on a commercial level. Those laws don’t apply to cable news hosts and political punditry. The Next Ad Is About What’s Not In the Report
At some point on Thursday, Barr is going to release the redacted Mueller report to the public, and every Democrat in Congress is going to run to the nearest camera to declare the redacted information crucial to understanding Trump’s complicity in collusion and obstruction. There will be no acknowledgement of the direct quotes from the Mueller report reflecting what Barr put out in his summary, declaring no conspiracy or coordination.
There will be no acknowledgement, once the evidence of obstruction against Trump turns out to be 90 percent tweets and public statements, that there’s no “there” there. And there will be no acknowledgement that the Steele dossier and every subsequent anonymously sourced bombshell alleging collusion between Trump and Russia is thoroughly debunked in the Mueller report.
From Thursday onward, we’re going to be talking about redactions. If the report reads: “After dedicating two years to examining every allegation, interviewing every witness, reviewing every communication of everyone involved, and summoning the collective might of the entire U.S. intelligence apparatus to support our investigation, we found no evidence to support conspiracy or cooperation between Trump or his campaign and the Russians,” we would undoubtedly hear from Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell, and all of cable news that the redaction invalidated the conclusion of no conspiracy or cooperation.
Take it as a matter of faith that Democrats and left-leaning media will completely reject the Mueller report, despite being able to read for themselves the same exculpatory sentences Barr included in his summary, and claim that the redactions either hid horrific and collusive behavior by Trump and his campaign associates, or left open the possibility that Barr improperly redacted impeachable behavior that didn’t reach the threshold of “beyond a reasonable doubt” but may well meet congressional standards for impeachment. Sowing Dissention Is All They Have Left
Left unstated will be the unimpeachable fact that Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic-controlled Congress have no intention of attempting to impeach the president. They simply want to keep the idea alive, keep people talking, keep people doubting, and sow discord and confusion into the body politic.
That is, quite literally, all they have left. And if you think they’ll consider for one moment the obvious desperation inherent in their predictable and dishonorable response to a report of investigative findings by a man they swore they’d fight to the death to protect, you’d be wrong. They simply want to keep the idea alive, keep people doubting, and sow discord and confusion into the body politic.
Consider the course of events since March 24, when Barr, a highly respected former attorney general, issued his summary. Pandemonium. After a brief period of recovery from the solar plexus punch that stole their air for a moment, the media and their Democratic congressional associates set about the task of delegitimizing the attorney general’s authority to decline prosecution on borderline cases.
They didn’t argue the facts of the case, as they had nothing other than the public allegations we’ve all heard on which to base their argument. Instead, they attacked Barr. They said he was “speaking to an audience of one”—an oldy but a goody—and “he was covering for his boss, Donald Trump.” The idea was to begin to plant into our psyche the notion that this has all been a big Trump/Barr conspiracy, that the legendary Mueller was too weak, or perhaps too patriotically subservient to the AG, to object to Barr’s abject mischaracterization of his conclusions.
I realize this is crystal clear to the vast majority who read this, but that’s simply a load of baloney. Mueller is not afraid of anybody, nor is he the kind of guy to sit idly by while a senior government official engages in conduct Mueller believes to be unethical or untoward. He’s no Jim Comey, and there will be no hastily scribbled “Barr made me feel all cold inside” notes turned into a book at the end of this saga.
If Mueller had a problem with what Barr wrote in his summary, he’d have made it clear to Barr first, then Congress, then the media. None of them heard a peep out of Mueller.
Democrats and the media have simply invested so much of their personal and professional credibility into Trump and his campaign conspiring with the Russians to win the election that there is a less-than-zero possibility they will acknowledge that they got it wrong. To the contrary, they will draw strength from each other to weather the storm. Democratic politicians will invent specious fantasies of what lies beneath the redactions, and the media will host them, encourage them, parrot them, and thank them for keeping hope alive. Don’t Call It Spying, Call It Surveillance
The problem with this strategy is that Barr doesn’t care what they think. He made that clear in his hearing in front of the Senate Appropriations Committee when he said that he believed the Obama administration “spied” on the Trump campaign, and that he planned to get to the bottom of whether that spying was lawfully predicated. Remember that Barr hasn’t said a word, thus far, that isn’t demonstrably true.
He will get to the bottom of it, and those most vocally opposed to his interest in determining the legality of the origins of the investigation—those salad days of foreign intelligence agency reporting, John Brennan meetings with Harry Reid about the Steele dossier, unlimited unmasking of NSA intercepts, et al.—those are the people and activities Barr will be most interested in reviewing.
Predictably, “progressives” who used to call themselves “liberals” lost their minds about his use of the word “spying.” It was as if Barr had expressed skepticism for “global warming,” unaware that the issue was actually “climate change.” They were incensed that Barr’s use of the word “spying” may give Americans the impression that government agencies under the Obama administration were actually “spying” on American citizens—a horrible, detestable notion—as opposed to what was actually happening.
What was happening was the complete surveillance coverage of every word they wrote, received, uttered, forwarded, or saved, including months prior to the order and everyone up to two hops away from their communication circle. “That’s not spying, Barr,” said Democrats. “The connotations of that word are troubling. That’s called surveillance, and we’re cool with that.” Taking Refuge in Complete Denial of the Truth
There will be no proper denouement of this particular movie because a proper denouement would require the media to acknowledge their almost universal failure, and the effect their political bias had on their erroneous reporting. It would require Democratic politicians like Schiff, Jerry Nadler, and Swalwell to admit that they were wrong and (in the movie) to dedicate themselves to working to regain the respect and trust of the man they wrongfully accused of treason to his country. That would be the movie ending. That’s not going to happen.
What’s going to happen is that the Mueller report will have enough information in it to convince a fair-minded observer of Trump’s innocence about collusion, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice, but the only conversation that will resonate on cable news media and in national newspapers Thursday will be the assumption-fueled speculation of what lies under the redactions. The unredacted, exculpatory facts will be downplayed or ignored, in favor of the sweet, sweet comfort of the unprovable, and thus easily manipulated, redactions. Remember that Mueller himself (and his team) is participating in the redaction process.
Remember this Thursday night, when all of the primetime cable news anchors are convincing you of their clever and discerning stance that there’s no way anyone can trust Barr to do anything but illegally cover for the president by indiscriminately redacting large portions of the Mueller report. Remember that Mueller himself (and his team) is participating in the redaction process. Remember that Barr hasn’t said a word, thus far, that isn’t demonstrably true. Remember that the report could include 399 pages of evidence proving Trump innocent of all charges and one redacted page, and the media and Democrats would team up to highlight the impeachment possibilities hiding underneath that one redacted page.
It’s a shame we have to do it like this. It’s a shame it’s so predictably callous and unserious. But it’s even more of a shame that people who marketed themselves as patriots are engaged in a game of hiding the truth and mischaracterizing evidence in service of their personal and political agendas.
We will see all of this in its full glory Thursday and beyond. Watch closely, because the only honest response to the Mueller report by both Democrats and media is, “We got it wrong.” It’s not often one can be so certain, in advance, of disappointment in one’s fellow man. Unfortunately, in this case, you can bank on it.

Democrats Are Using Ilhan Omar As An Excuse To Chill Speech,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/democrats-using-ilhan-omar-excuse-chill-speech/,"By David Harsanyi April 16, 2019
Democrats have spent the past two-plus years accusing the president of the United States and his allies of seditiously conspiring with our enemies to destroy “democracy.” For the most part this fairytale has been cynically deployed by politicians to undermine the legitimacy of a Republican presidency, yet millions of Americans now believe their votes were upended by a foreign power. There is no more serious charge against an elected official than treason.
Then again, for decades before the 2016 election, Democrats argued that Republicans were literally killing their fellow Americans when cutting taxes , murdering the sick when rejecting nationalized health care, and sentencing the poor to death when rejecting socialist schemes. Not to mention suppressing the minority vote when asking for ID, engaging in Nazi-like actions when enforcing existing border laws , and destroying the world when failing to embrace a takeover of the economy. And so on.
This overwrought rhetoric is embedded in the everyday arguments of the mainstream left, and its intensity is only growing.
The same liberals are now demanding that conservatives stop quoting and posting video of progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar belittling the 9/11 attacks because doing so puts her life in danger. That’s quite the deal they’ve cooked up for themselves. Nearly every presidential candidate and major Democratic leader has argued that Donald Trump’s criticism of Omar is out of line because of increased death threats against her. I do wonder how many death threats Trump or Mitch McConnell or Steve Scalise receives every week. I imagine it’s considerable.
But, as usual, most of the media took up the Democrats’ cause, trying to infantilize a 38-year-old woman. “Trump clearly unmoved over increased concerns raised by Dems over Omar’s safety,” noted The Washington Post’s CNN’s Manu Raju after Trump attacked Nancy Pelosi’s handling of the Minnesota representative. One wonders if Raju had similar apprehensions when he published a story with two alleged sources giving him the same exact incorrect information falsely accusing Donald Trump Jr. of conspiring with Russia?
Do reporters and columnists consider the safety of the Trump administration before writing critically about them? I hope not. Because free speech—political discourse and good faith political reporting included—shouldn’t be inhibited by prospective actions of third-party nuts. It is imperative, in fact, that we don’t let those nuts undercut our ability to freely express our political disagreements. If Americans pondered the actions of political terrorists every time they took a position, they would only be empowering criminals.
Not one of Trump’s critical comments about Omar called for violence in any way. He didn’t rationalize chasing Omar out of a restaurants or standing in front of her home with a bullhorn. The idea that politicians should have immunity from criticism is not something journalists, or anyone who values free expression, should give any credence. Yet, here we are.
Let’s remember one of the times we actually saw overt political violence was when progressive activist and Bernie Sanders campaign volunteer attempted to assassinate the entire Republican congressional delegation. As far as I can tell, no one in the media asked Sanders or any other Democrats to temper their political rhetoric about Republicans. If the reverse had occurred we would have been plunged into a national discussion about right-wing rhetoric. (Wait, what am I saying, Republicans are already asked to take responsibility for violent actions of people who have nothing to do with them!)
Attempting to chill speech isn’t a new tactic for Democrats, and certainly not when it comes to Omar. As an African-American Muslim woman, the congresswoman has reached the pinnacle of special status, and thus any criticism, even quoting her verbatim or playing a video of her yucking it up about terrorism, is categorized as racist. There are no specific guidelines for when it’s acceptable to be critical of the things an African-American Muslim woman politician says, though, for most people the answer is “never.”
Of course, the notion that someone’s color or ethnicity or religion offers them dispensation from political debate is one of the most destructive aspect of this debate.
Democrats chose to rally around Omar, celebrating her immigrant story and appearing with her on magazine covers. Now those Democrats are compelled to cover up and rationalize her comments (though we shouldn’t underestimate how popular some of her anti-Jewish tirades and ugly views of America are among progressives). There is no freshman-level Marxist gobbledygook or conspiracy theory that Omar won’t regurgitate, from claiming that the US was “founded by genocide” to claiming that American power is built through “neocolonialism” to embracing morally decrepit ideas about the Middle East and Jews.
Democrats first covered for her actions by watering down an already-useless resolution condemning her anti-Semitic comments with a bunch of vacuous censures of all bigotry. Even today, Democrats and their media allies continue to mislead about what Omar actually said. This week, Maggie Haberman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg of the New York Times, for example, described Omar as being in trouble over “comments on Israel.” Bernie Sanders offered the same falsehood in his Fox News town hall when he claimed “It is not anti-Semitic to be critical of a right wing government in Israel.” The comments Omar was in trouble for weren’t about Israel. Of course, her continuous attacks on our liberal allies and her defense of proto-terrorist states is one thing. But Omar was in trouble for smearing American Jews, not merely Israel .
Now, they’ve moved onto covering for her with “ fact checks ” and feigned indignation. It is clear to me that Omar was minimizing 9/11, as she does Islamic terrorism in general. It’s clear to me she is a defender of theocrats and an apologist for terror organizations like Hamas. You might disagree. You can view her comments and decide for yourself. Whatever the case, threats of violence against politicians are illegal and should be condemned by any decent person. In the end, though, whether Omar has increased threats against her or not, she is a public figure and deserves no special dispensation from debate. "
‘Stop Sanders’ Haven’t Noticed One Of Bernie’s Biggest Weaknesses,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/stop-sanders-democrats-havent-noticed-one-bernies-biggest-weaknesses-yet/,"By Warren Henry April 17, 2019
According to The New York Times , “mainstream Democrats are increasingly worried that their effort to defeat President Trump in 2020 could be complicated by [Bernie] Sanders, in a political scenario all too reminiscent of how Mr. Trump himself seized the Republican nomination in 2016.” Sanders pays lip service to the idea of unity, but has warned supporters he is also fighting establishment Democrats .
Bernie is embroiled in a bitter feud with Clinton loyalists at the Center for American Progress (CAP), which has been criticizing the socialist’s Medicare-for-All proposal behind the scenes. (There is little question where the Times stands in this battle; its hit piece uses CAP President Neera Tanden’s 78-year-old mother to attack her.)
The “Stop Sanders” Democrats will turn out to be as ineffectual as NeverTrump Republicans were in 2016 unless they find a line of attack that is not simply a grievance of the party’s establishment. Sanders supporters are about as likely to ditch Bernie over his millionaire status as Trump supporters were affected by the bankruptcies in his business past. Nor are they likely to care about the details of his single-payer health-care bill. But once Bernie’s opponents understand the roots of his success, they may find a potent issue staring them in the face.
There are two major reasons Sanders is near the Democrats’ center of gravity. First, his socialism (or “ social-ism “) largely expresses a vision Democrats have held for at least 50 years and often longer. Second, because his vision is old, it remains rooted in class , rather than the identity politics of the New New Left. For some, this second reason is a feature; for others, it is a bug.
The potential fault line for Sanders among Democrats may be his position on immigration: Sen. Bernie Sanders campaigns in Oskaloosa, IA: ""If you open the borders, there's a lot of poverty in this world, and you're going to have people from all over the world. And I don't think that's something that we can do at this point. Can't do it."" pic.twitter.com/INF9GopzIe
— The Hill (@thehill) April 7, 2019
Bernie’s stance against open borders is not where many Democrats are now, especially young progressives and democratic socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Rep. @AOC : ""I think 'Abolish ICE' is a call to action on several levels. One is the literal interpretation of all abolishing ICE, which I support…I don't believe that an agency that systematically & repeatedly violates human rights — I don't think that agency can be reformed."" pic.twitter.com/YyOQCSA3lA

Granted, the woke are as over-hyped as the “Stop Sanders” types are likely to be. But the younger, woker set is likely to be a key component of Bernie’s coalition. Per HarrisX, Generation (aka age) is THE divide in the Dem primary right now. This is an average of the last few days… Bernie Sanders has got the young and Joe Biden has got the old.

Moreover, the open borders position is held more broadly among Democratic leadership. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly called a border wall “immoral.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called the wall “ medieval .”
It is obvious to anyone paying attention that Democrats’ newfound extremism against border security is a reaction to President Trump, who made it his signature issue in 2016. More than any other subject (excepting possibly “Russiagate”), Trump’s immigration policies embody the personal qualities Democrats loathe about Trump.
For Democrats, Trump’s determination to secure our border and crack down on illegal immigration represent his racism, nativism, Islamophobia, and general cruelty. His immigration policies outrage the party faithful, and none more than those marinating in left-wing identity politics.
Viewing the 2020 campaign from this perspective, the Democrats nominating Sanders would be not unlike Republicans nominating Mitt Romney in 2012. The GOP suffered steep losses in 2008, but roared back to reclaim Congress in 2010 based on widespread opposition to Obamacare. Having championed a mandate-based health system as governor of Massachusetts, Romney was effectively neutered on this key issue, dampening partisan enthusiasm for his candidacy. Nominating Sanders would require either a Romney-esque flip on immigration, or dispiriting the Democratic base on the issue that largely defines and fuels their opposition to Trump.
Sanders can try to spin his immigration position as a feature rather than a bug. Republicans tend to win on immigration when the question is whether America should have borders and enforce them. Democrats tend to gain when the issue becomes what to do about those who have already crossed into our country illegally ( e.g. , family separation, a path to citizenship, etc.)
By rejecting open borders, a Sanders-Trump debate would play out on more Democratic turf. Sanders might also argue that his position is a better fit to attract Obama-Trump voters in the Rust Belt and Midwestern states Hillary Clinton lost.
This will be a difficult sell, however, to Democrats who have elevated the notion of open borders to a moral principle. Again, the parallel to the right’s attitudes regarding Obamacare is instructive.
When each party base has lacked the power to enact legislation, it has been easy to embrace maximalist positions. Tea Party Republicans generally sought to repeal Obamacare without consensus about a replacement. Progressives and socialists want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement and tear down the wall we already have.
Only after a party gains effective control of the government do political realities intrude. It is a psychology that does not aid Sanders in winning the Democratic nomination, let alone a general election.
There is no guarantee the neoliberals and woke identitarians can deny Sanders the Democratic nomination by putting him in a vise on immigration. After all, Romney did win the GOP nod in 2012, despite his weakness on Obamacare. But Bernie’s opponents have failed to come up with a better idea so far.

"Notre Dame Isn’t Just A Symbol Of Civilization, It’s A Symbol Of Heaven",thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/notre-dame-isnt-just-symbol-western-civilization-symbol-heaven/,"By John Daniel Davidson April 17, 2019
I am fortunate to have visited Notre Dame de Paris before the fire. I went twice, seven years ago when my wife and I were living in the south of France. I was not yet a Catholic back then, and went to Notre Dame as a tourist. Even then, the immensity, grandeur, and transcendent beauty of the place made a deep impression on me. If man can imagine and build such a thing for God, I thought, what must God have in store for man?
I see now that Notre Dame was, for me, a small step—a push—toward the Catholic Church. It was a sign, a physical manifestation of an eternal truth that I had not yet been able to recognize in full, but that, standing amid the soaring Gothic columns of the cathedral, I intuited. On some level I knew that Notre Dame, the place itself, proclaimed the truth—about its patron the Blessed Virgin Mary, about heaven and hell and all creation, about man and God and His church.
The burning of Notre Dame has now brought us a new sign. Rod Dreher writes that it “symbolizes what we in the West have allowed to happen to our religious and cultural patrimony. What happened in Paris today has been happening across our civilization.”
Many others echoed this sentiment over the last 48 hours, and while fairly obvious, it is not wrong. What more powerful symbol of the decline of faith and religion could there be than Notre Dame engulfed in flames? For believers, the flames are clearly a call to repentance and conversion. As C.C. Pecknold rightly notes , “To truly rebuild Notre Dame will require becoming the kind of people who built her in the first place.” That we are not now that kind of people, there is no doubt. What Macron and Others Get Wrong About Rebuilding
Consider French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Tuesday that Notre Dame will be rebuilt within the next five years. Imagine the hubris it takes to look at a burned out Notre Dame, a cathedral that took centuries to build, and proclaim the day afterward that it will be rebuilt, even greater than before, in five years.
In this, Macron embodies the very worldview that makes the resurrection of Notre Dame, at least by secular westerners, impossible. The urge to proclaim that it will be rebuilt—even more splendorous than before!—in just five years is what you would expect from those who mistake the cathedral building, in all its splendor, for the truth that the cathedral points to.
It’s also partly what’s behind the reaction of pundits like Ben Shapiro, who described Notre Dame as a “monument to Western civilization,” later tweeting , “If we wish to uphold the beauty and profundity of the Notre Dame cathedral, that means re-familiarizing ourselves with the philosophy and religious principles that built it.”
But Notre Dame is not primarily a monument to Western civilization, it is a monument to the Holy Mother of God and the salvation of Jesus Christ, and it will take more than “re-familiarizing ourselves” with western philosophical and religious principles to revive the faith that erected it 800 years ago.
That is, it will take real faith in the resurrection of Jesus Christ—and real repentance for our rejection of that faith. Listening to the likes of Macron, one despairs. Whether he realized it or not, Macron was echoing the Jews in the second chapter of St. John’s gospel, when Jesus drove out the moneychangers from the temple:
So the Jews answered and said to Him, ‘What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?’ Jesus answered and said to them, ‘Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.’ Then the Jews said, ‘It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?’ But He was speaking of the temple of His body. A Call to Repentance and Conversion
The burning of Notre Dame is not a challenge to restore a jewel of Western civilization, or a call to reflect on the philosophical principles of our Judeo-Christian heritage, or even—as it will surely be construed—an opportunity to unite around our “shared heritage” or some such. Such platitudes will not do. At this late hour, the burning of Notre Dame is nothing less than a call to repentance and conversion.
That is not because if we repent and convert we will be spared the future flames and disasters of history, but because repentance and conversion are the only means by which we overcome the ultimate disaster, which is death and separation from God.
The West lost sight of that truth some time ago, and it might never regain it. As for Catholics and all Christians, we will suffer much more than the fire of Notre Dame in the years and generations to come. As then-theology professor Fr. Joseph Ratzinger said in 1969 about the future of the church:
From the crisis of today the Church of tomorrow will emerge—a Church that has lost much. She will become small and will have to start afresh more or less from the beginning. She will no longer be able to inhabit many of the edifices she built in prosperity. As the number of her adherents diminishes, so it will lose many of her social privileges. In contrast to an earlier age, it will be seen much more as a voluntary society, entered only by free decision. As a small society, it will make much bigger demands on the initiative of her individual members.
Notre Dame was once a symbol of heaven on earth. Today, it is a symbol of how far we have drifted from the divine vision it has proclaimed down the centuries—and how far we will have to go to recover it. "
Why One-Third Of Biologists Now Question Darwinism,thefederalist.com,Benjamin R. Dierker,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/16/one-third-biologists-now-question-darwinism/,"By Benjamin R. Dierker April 16, 2019
While Christians have long challenged Charles Darwin’s theory of undirected evolution, few appreciate the true extent of the challenge beyond the church. Current estimates are that approximately one-third of professional academic biologists who do not believe in intelligent design find Darwin’s theory is inadequate to describe all of the complexity in biology.
Ben Stein documented a crackdown within the academy on criticism of Darwin in his 2008 documentary “ Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed .” While this might explain why the public rarely hears of challenges to Neo-Darwinism, the documentary centered on intelligent design. But the growing discontent in academia is from secular naturalists.
Defining evolution is key. At the basic level of change over time , even Young Earth biblical creationists agree. At its most specific level of the common descent of all life on earth from a single ancestor via undirected mutation and natural selection , many legitimately question evolutionary theory as it stands. The word is often used interchangeably without distinction, but even when used technically in academic biologist circles, real skepticism exists about the theory. Demanding a New Theory
A controversial letter to Nature in 2014 signaled the mounting concern, however slow and cautious, among thoughtful professional biologists. Other works by atheist authors like “ What Darwin Got Wrong ” and “ Mind and Cosmos ” find “fatal flaws” in the theory and assert it is “almost certainly false.”
Another project, The Third Way , seeks to avoid a false choice between divine intervention (which it outright rejects) and the Neo-Darwinian model (which it finds unsupported in the face of modern molecular theory) while presenting evidence to improve evolution theory beyond Neo-Darwinism. Some even believe billions of years have not been adequate for Darwinian theory to accomplish current complexity, as the theory currently exists.
This dissatisfaction is a matter of public record, even if it lacks public attention, and despite the narrative running contrary. Indeed dedicated Neo-Darwinists often say “no serious scientists disagree” or “only creationists have problems.” These contentions are increasingly disproven.
The important note is that these are not ideologues or religious zealots, nor do they propose a god or biblical solution. Rather, they find problems with the explanatory value of Darwin’s theory in light of modern understanding of mutation, variation, DNA sequencing, and more. These expressions of doubt do not reject naturalism or evolution per se, but the rigor of the Neo-Darwinian model for explaining the development of life.
In fact, they want to help Darwin, not tear him down. That he needs help is news to the academy. A Voice in the Wilderness
Professor Kevin Laland, author of the Nature letter insisting on “urgent” rethinking of evolutionary theory, has been described by critics as offering an unneeded paradigm shift . He recognizes the pushback from the scientific establishment, but he and his colleagues forge a path forward nonetheless with rigorous work on their model of Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES).
This is an update to the mid-20th-century Modern Synthesis , which patched up Neo-Darwinian theory with then-modern information. Since then, understanding of complexity has grown such that Laland and others believe EES or another supplement is necessary to keep up. It is not a replacement or rejection of Neo-Darwinism, but can be deployed alongside it as a way to understand key processes of nature the theory neglects.
Laland explained, “The EES is a minority position, but not as small a minority as it is often portrayed. It is also gaining ground.” EES is not the only naturalist supplement or revision of Neo-Darwinism, but joins several other embattled factions in the academy, including The Third Way.
“As you may surmise, there is a lot of politics in these debates. Traditionalists have a track record of characterising more progressive researchers as a small group of extremists,” Leland added. Explaining why it is difficult to gain traction, he continued, “support for our position comes from academic fields on the periphery of evolutionary biology, such as evolutionary developmental biology, ecological developmental biology, paleontology, botany, and the human sciences, while traditionalists dominate evolutionary genetics.” A Growing Minority
After publishing in Nature, Laland received more than 1,000 emails in support from the academic community. This number is huge for a critique of such a longstanding accepted theory. In the five years since the Nature letter, support has also only grown.
The leading critics have been intelligent design supporters, who are looked down on by naturalists. But as each group adds to the scientific literature, certain critiques and findings inevitably bolster or redirect the research of the other.
The effects go at least one way. Following work and theories of Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Denton helped shape a generation of skeptics with his 1985 book “Evolution: A Theory in Crisis.” An evolutionist and agnostic, Denton has continued his criticism .
In the past decade, the works of professor Michael Behe, Steven Meyer, and others have given more life to the debate on the national stage. In “Darwin Devolves,” Behe points to the process of mutations to describe the inadequacy of an unguided materialist process to add information. Meyer explores the Cambrian explosion and the complexity of the cell to show the biodiversity and complexity we observe, and notes that natural processes have never been observed to produce such results.
Importantly, these two men, and many others, believe in the standard multibillion-year timeline for the Earth and make their findings based on deduction of natural evidence rather than starting from authority in scripture or elsewhere. The growth of the intelligent design community is noteworthy, but not as interesting as those who are apart from it, secular, and nonetheless find Darwinian evolution to contain serious flaws.
Behe explained that, “Based on conversations with my own colleagues at Lehigh [University], dozens of other biologists, and news stories in journals I would guesstimate that a third or more of biologists are quite skeptical that Darwin’s theory explains all of biology.” The growing literature speaks for itself.
Paul Nelson told Stein that, “One-on-one at a scientific meeting after the third or fourth beer, my experience has been that many evolutionary biologists will say ‘Yeah, this theory’s got a lot of problems.’” While anecdotal, this is echoed by many in academia, both within intelligent design, and more importantly outside of it.
While maintaining his field is not in crisis, and insisting on nuance, Leland notes, “I think the numbers issue depends strongly on subtle details of how you frame the question. A good proportion would probably agree that the causal bases of evolution are more complex than commonly portrayed in the textbooks.” Difficulties in Forming Alliances
Nuance and framing are important, and along with traditional pressures, make estimates of the Neo-Darwin critics incredibly difficult to conclude. One approach is to simply seek signatures on a simple scientific statement of skepticism . Several hundred PhDs have signed. However, the association with intelligent design and possible academic consequences keeps many from signing. Current Neo-Darwinism is far from the untouchable theory it is lauded to be.
While intelligent design gets a bad rap, such titans as Francis Crick and Richard Dawkins have espoused the same tenets. Still, many immediately and falsely link intelligent design with Christian divinity and stay far away.
The Third Way is highly exclusive to maintain purity and preempt criticism. Not only are religious believers excluded, but the platform is invite-only. The isolated clusters of scientists averse to associating with one another, or too set on their preferred nuance, lend credence to the traditionalist Neo-Darwin assertion that only a tiny fringe minority, if that, exists.
The plain truth from the literature, conferences, expert perception, and a bit of anecdote for color, is that current Neo-Darwinism is far from the untouchable theory it is lauded to be. Not only this, but it has serious and increasing skeptics and challengers from within the secular scientific community.
When adding in supporters of intelligent design, which is religion-neutral, the numbers begin to expand rapidly. While there are serious, scientific, and peer-reviewed studies from this group, it does not rock the boat as much as the secular material naturalists. The goal is not to abandon Darwin, but to retire him to make way for more coherent comprehensive theories.
This article has been slightly changed to clarify the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis. The original draft described it as a paradigm shift, which Laland says is inaccurate. Benjamin Dierker is a law student at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University. He holds a master's degree in public administration and a bachelor's degree in economics, both from Texas A&M University. He is a Christian and a Texan and loves to talk about both. "
Notre Dame's Ruin Is A Metaphor For The Western Church - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/notre-dames-ruin-metaphor-western-church/,"By Charles C. Camosy April 17, 2019
If one were going to choose the most important church in the world, the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris (with the possible exception of the St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome) would top the list. Built over the better part of two centuries, an era spanning nearly the entire Gothic period, the cathedral’s construction was funded by Christian benefactors from all around late-medieval France.
The fruit of their donations, a building named for Our Lady—who carried the God-man in her very self—continued for eight centuries. Countless people who entered the cathedral’s doors were led to a profound experience of the divine. Known as “the poor people’s book,” the building told salvation history through images and paintings for those millions who either could not read or did not have access to texts.
But we should not shrink from the hard truth about what Notre Dame de Paris became. Many millions more now have visited the building annually as a historical monument than who entered to commune with the transcendent. Notre Dame is, in many ways, much closer in the West’s cultural imagination to a Temple of Apollo than a home of the living God. It’s become a historical and beautiful curiosity that signals a time, now past, in which the people who went before us believed some, well, nutty stuff.
Indeed, the smoldering ruin of the cathedral now stands as a tragic metaphor for the church, not just in France, but in much of the developed West more generally. The structure or shell is still largely intact, but the building itself has been gutted.
Yes, there are still priests. There are still churches. There are still schools and hospitals. But the heart of the church—worn away over time by riches and consumerism, moral relativism and hyper-secularism—is no longer there.
While the burnt-out church is a metaphor for the role of Christianity in the developed West, the major media coverage of its burning was a performance. Although ostensibly a church—with significance primarily as a house of worship—the main media stories rely on the historical, artistic, and social significance of the cathedral for their gravity.
At the time I write this, for instance, the New York Times headlines on the story had exactly zero religious references. They did mention, of course, the building as “an iconic symbol of the beauty and history of Paris” and “a jewel of Medieval Gothic architecture.”
Yet, despite all of this darkness, what will likely come to be known as simply “the fire” may in fact be a sign of hope, particularly during this Holy Week in advance of Easter. In churches all over the world that will celebrate the Easter vigil on late Saturday night into early Sunday morning this week, for instance, roaring fires will be lit as a sign of God’s grace and power in the midst of a powerful darkness.
It’s a darkness that cannot shut out the light. From those fires many candles will be lit, including the Paschal candle, lit in many churches during special occasions like baptisms and funerals.
The fact that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire took places at the beginning of Holy Week is no accident. Christians know better. An Anglican bishop put it this way yesterday: Christians understand what fire means. It either burns in judgement or purges in healing and preparation for restoration, healing and resurrection. The difference between them is repentance. pic.twitter.com/sAA7rK27Hz

French President Emmanuel Macron has said that Notre Dame de Paris will be rebuilt. But what is it, precisely, that will be rebuilt? Will it essentially be a museum, a mere symbol or repository of the history and beauty of Paris and France? Or will it be something more? Will what comes from the ruins be an actual house of prayer?
Much depends on the response of Christians. St. John the Baptist realized repentance was necessary for those seeking a genuine experience of God. Whether Monday’s fire is one of judgement or one of healing, hope, and restoration will indeed depend on capacity for repentance.
The call for this may need to come from outside the developed West, infected as we are with the kind of social arrogance that makes calls for such repentance something close to absurd. The church is thriving in places like Africa and Asia , and it may take their evangelical zeal to help us see our hubris and need for repentance. Indeed, much of the money collected worldwide for the rebuilding of Notre Dame de Paris will likely come from energetic, faith-filled, exponentially growing numbers of Christians on these two continents.
For what will they be paying? Much like the funders of the original cathedral, they will put their resources into a building they hope will bring people closer to Christ. This holy week, there is more than the usual hope that such goals could actually be realized. In just a few days, Christians will commemorate the fact Jesus’ lifeless body remained in the tomb three days.
On Easter Sunday we will celebrate and even experience the power of God in the raising that body from the dead. For 2,000 years, Jesus’ body has been a metaphor for the church. Christians pray in a special way each Easter that the Body of Christ, the church, may be renewed and vivified through the power of God’s grace. The roaring fire built in the darkness of the Easter vigil is a powerful symbol of that hope even when things appear to be at their worst.
Despite the horrific fire, the altar and pulpit of Notre Dame de Paris survive. Its walls are unmoved. A cross still hangs majestically over the smoking debris. Could Notre Dame de Paris once again be a living, vibrant home for Christ’s body, the church?
Here is an unmistakable invitation to conclude this Lent with a spirit of repentance that will transform what appears to be a terrible defeat and unspeakable tragedy into the means by which a new, living spirit is imbued into what was little more than a lifeless relic of the past. Christians must make the most of the opportunity God has given us to turn what looks like a horrific defeat into a glorious victory.

To achieve air supremacy in war means to be able to put your assets in the air with the ability to destroy your enemy’s cities, troops, and ability to fight back. In the online course, “The Second World Wars,” Professor Victor David Hanson discusses the technological advances in air power made by German, American, and Japanese forces throughout the course of World World II, and how one side slowly achieved air supremacy.
Before 1941, there was a clear pattern to the victories achieved by German forces. Germany invaded Poland, Denmark, Luxembourg, Holland, Norway, Belgium, France, and Yugoslavia. Each one of these victories was against an unprepared neighbor and a surprise attack. Germany shocked everyone with their sudden domination of European democracies, especially with their success with a new military tactic: blitzkrieg. The blitzkrieg method involved violently and quickly mobilizing forces in the air and on the ground, defeating opponents with series of short attacks.
What we know now is that Germany’s opponents, presumably stunned and alarmed by the attacks, never stopped to evaluate the limitations of Germany’s power, specifically in the air. Could they defeat an enemy in a battle that was not a surprise attack? Could their planes reach the United States? Britain? The answer was no.
The main difference between the Allied powers’ and the Axis powers’ approach to building out their fleet was that the Allies were focused on efficiency, cost, and durability, while the Germans and the Japanese focused on building the biggest and the best weapons. In the long run, the latter proved to create the more accurate and more maneuverable machine in battle, but lacked the support system, the trained pilots, and sheer number of planes in the sky.
Perhaps the biggest strategic mistake Germany made was that they never built a bomber with four engines. Their two-engine bombers — Junkers, Dorniers, and Heinkel models — were first-rate planes, but could not carry more than 5,000 pounds of explosives. A four-engine bomber could carry twice the amount of explosives and travel twice as far as a two-engine.
Meanwhile, the Allied powers were making quantum leaps in technology. Forty percent of the U.S. budget was invested in bombers, fighters, and transport planes. U.S. Army Air Forces developed the B-29 bomber, P-51 fighter, and the jet engine. Of course, their largest impact was participating in the Manhattan Project and the catastrophic atomic bombing on Japan.
As Hanson points out in his book , the Allied bombers took out a significant amount of Germany’s and Japanese’s resources:
German industry was bombed systematically by late 1942, and Japanese factories by late 1944 and 1945. For all the problems with the Allied bombing campaign, no one denied that, in its last months, heavy Allied bombers finally took a terrible toll on Axis aircraft production, transportation, and fuel supplies. The availability of fuel proved the greatest divide between Axis and Allied air power.
Eventually, the Allies bombed the Axis into submission, precluding a land invasion in Japan. Relying on sea power and air power allowed the United States and Britain to avoid the need to land in Europe, unlike the reliance on ground forces in World War I.
Air power did not eliminate fighting on the ground altogether, but it redefined the elements of speed, distance, and geography in military theater. Germany was a much more powerful enemy in WWII than in WWI, yet the Allied forces lost fewer men in the second war (only 2 to 3 percent of their entire military forces, to be exact). It took several years of fighting before Allied forces obtained complete air supremacy, but once they did, it was only a short time before Axis powers were in absolute ruin.

Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal Short Film Is Delusional,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-short-film-is-delusional/,"April 17, 2019 By David Marcus
In a new, seven minute animated video from The Intercept, narrated by and starring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) we are transported, via an NYC to DC bullet train, into the future. It is 2028, and what a world it is. On the downside, Hurricane Sheldon at some point left significant portions of Miami underwater, but on the bright side, former oil workers are planting mangroves under the direction of Native American elders. No, I’m not making this up. Climate change is here + we’ve got a deadline: 12 years left to cut emissions in half.
A #GreenNewDeal is our plan for a world and a future worth fighting for.
How did we get here?What is at stake?And where are we going?

The style of the video is a paintbrush quickly illustrating page after page of the glorious Green New Deal. In fact, we are told, after Democrats take back the Senate and White House in 2020, it will usher in the decade of the Green New Deal, transforming not only the climate, but also, in fact more importantly, the economy. In fact, we are told it will change everything. There will be guaranteed jobs, Medicare for All (promised to be the most popular program of all time), and all the gummy bears you can eat. Okay, I made the last part up.
At the top, we are given a survey course of climate change science over the last 40 years and introduced to the evil oil companies and corrupt politicians who worked to silence the brave scientists. This pretty much brings us to today. The Green New Deal has been proposed, but its too big, too fast, say the naysayers, clearly being chided. As mentioned above, the proponents of the Green New Deal succeed.
The biggest problem, we are told, after the government takes over half the economy is a labor shortage, which kind of makes the guaranteed jobs stuff not make a lot of sense, but whatever. Next we hear about the universal childcare initiative, presumably some situation where the government raises your kid. We find out that “caring for others is valuable, low carbon work.” Okay. Meanwhile every building in America is being retrofitted for renewable energy, a process that would likely expend more carbon than it reduces.
By the end, a young woman from Ocasio-Cortez’s district who apparently in the space of 10 years went from working for AmeriCorps, to becoming an engineer, and then a teacher, successfully runs for Congress in 2028. Guess whose seat she wins? Yep. So where does that leave Ocasio-Cortez? Senator maybe? Who are we kidding; this voiceover from the future is coming straight from the oval office.
I have to admit. This is a great piece of political propaganda. For Republicans. If I was advising a GOP candidate in a swing district, I’d tell them not to run any TV ads but just buy blocks of time to show this bizarre dystopian vision of a country that could not be less like our own. There is no individual ambition. There is no small business. There aren’t even any families. All is provided for by mother state. When you understand that this what the socialists in the Democratic Party really want, it’s actually quite chilling.
What is so great about this short film is how obviously clear it makes it that the Green New Deal is not about climate change. If it were, nuclear energy would play a prominent role. Why doesn’t it? Because nuclear energy doesn’t require the government to take over free markets willy nilly. And that is what the Green New Deal is really all about. This is a video that should be shown far and wide since it unwittingly exposes the folly that is the Green New Deal far better than any of its opponents could ever hope to.

Paul Hollander Explained Why Smart People Support Totalitarianism,thefederalist.com,Alexander Riley,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/paul-hollander-explained-smart-people-support-totalitarianism/,"By Alexander Riley April 18, 2019
One of the 20th century’s greatest scholarly critics of totalitarianism, Paul Hollander, passed away last week. Although the Soviet Union and the Eastern communist bloc fell apart more than a quarter-century ago, we still deeply need thinkers like Hollander, and his loss will be all the more felt because the totalitarians he spent a career analyzing have burrowed so successfully into the very fabric of American institutions and cultural life.
I first read what is arguably Hollander’s chef d’oeuvre , “Political Pilgrims,” as a graduate student in the ’90s. It struck me then (as it still does) as one of the handful of books written by an American sociologist that one can safely say will still be timely in a century. I read many of Hollander’s other books over the years, and he quickly became one of my intellectual heroes.
He was born in Hungary between the two world wars, during the rule of Admiral Horthy, and he witnessed the collapse of the country first into a brief and bloody fascist regime, then post-World War II, into the condition of a vassal state to the Soviet dictatorship. He escaped the country in the wake of the Soviet invasion to crush the 1956 uprising and came to the United States. In short order, he embarked upon the career path of intensively reflecting on the causes of the catastrophes he had seen up close in his country of birth.
I cannot hope to summarize the full breadth of Hollander’s work here, although I have made an effort to do that elsewhere . Perhaps the single most important question Hollander pondered was this: How is it that cultural elites—people whose livelihood depends on a high level of intellectual performance—can so easily and so frequently fall into a form of political identity that involves championing ideas and regimes that produce massive human suffering?
His conclusion was that it is typically the combination of utopian idealism, an unrealistic view of human nature, and a deep resentment at the relative deprivation these radical intellectuals tend to suffer vis-à-vis other elites with less educational (but more economic capital) that explains the phenomenon.
So great is their adherence to the wild-eyed political dreamworld that intoxicates them that such intellectuals will not be deterred by the failure of any particular utopian political project, or indeed by the collapse of the entire global narrative on communism as the human solution to suffering. Just as they moved from Stalin to Mao to Castro to Hugo Chavez, they will find other totalitarian models to venerate when all the communist options are gone, as they seemingly are today. Islamism, Post-Communism?
Paul predicted that after communism collapsed Islamism might well become the next big thing for such utopian intellectuals. Such individuals would find sympathetic the attack on modernity and Western civilization that Islamists mount.
The outrage of Western radical intellectuals at the Danish Mohammed cartoons or the suggestion of some that the staff of Charlie Hebdo got what they deserved demonstrate how right Paul was. His analysis also aids in comprehending the enthusiastic fawning among the intellectual class over far-leftist Muslim activists Linda Sarsour and Ilhan Omar, the sweet-faced Muslim congresswoman from Minnesota who recently referred to the 9/11 attacks in flippant language.
The novelist Michel Houellebecq provided a perfect literary example of the phenomenon Paul catalogued and theorized in his many books and articles. In his recent novel “Submission,” Houellebecq envisions the coming to power of an Islamist regime in France. A central thread in the narrative details how leftist French intellectuals such as the novel’s narrator are brought over to the new regime’s side.
The emergent Islamist leader, Ben Abbes, begins by endlessly flattering the intellectuals, telling them how admirable they are in their intellectual purity and abstraction, and how deserving they are of the material goods of which they are deprived, goods that are hoarded instead by the business class the resentment-filled left intellectuals despises with a visceral fury.
The Islamist regime gives them yet another seamless, simplistic, one-size-fits-all answer, abstract grand system that they can wield in their merciless way to resolve every moral, political, and scientific problem conceivable. Finally, Abbes provides them with a charismatic, strong leader, mouthing always the sweet discourses of “total justice,”“the welfare of the people,”and “the vanquishing of the oppressors,” however cynically.
This last is the most important, Houellebecq knows, and Hollander as well. The leftist utopian intellectuals, despite their flowery talk of egalitarianism and the anarchist need to challenge hierarchy, simply cannot leap quickly enough into line when a Lenin, or a Che Guevara, or a Ben Abbes alerts them that the time has come (at last!) to take up arms (however figuratively) in service of the Great Leader of the People.
It is almost as though intellectuals cannot help but fall under the spell of such men, not in spite of their commitments to abstract reason and independence of thought, but because those commitments are merely empty games they play only because they are denied other, more direct methods for self-assertion. In their deep heart of hearts, they want to be Ben Abbes. Since they cannot, the best they can do is to align themselves with him, and fawningly admire his power.
The list of such intellectuals who aligned themselves with the dictatorial, murderous thug regimes of the 20th century is long and distinguished. Hollander was one of the chief chroniclers and critics of this phenomenon. He is irreplaceable.

Netflix's 'Traitors' Is Hampered By An Ignorant Political Agenda,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/netflixs-traitors-hampered-ignorant-political-agenda/,"April 18, 2019
This review contains many spoilers for season one of “Traitors” on Netflix.
Netflix’s “Traitors” seems to have all the ingredients of a really great television show. It’s a period drama about spies with a dynamic cast and rich characters, the pacing is sharp, and talented writers are contributing to the effort. Unfortunately, “Traitors” made a catastrophic error in execution, taking an ill-researched political stance and building the entire story around it.
The first season unfolds over six episodes, all set to seemingly misfit folk music. It’s the end of World War II and the United Kingdom faces the daunting challenge of recovery in the aftermath of a war that left the victorious but shelled country in financial straits. Feef Symonds (Emma Appleton) is the bright, young, patriotic Brit who had dreamed of a life in the Special Operations Executive (SOE), and readily identifies as a conservative Tory.
Sadly, the end of the war squashed her dreams of danger and espionage in occupied France. Feef is also having an affair with an American soldier named Peter who is empathetic to her disappointment in not being able to serve her country. He introduces her to his mysterious boss, “Rowe” (Michael Stuhlbarg) who offers Feef an opportunity to fight the communists in the impending war with the Soviets by spying on the British government. She happily agrees.
Soon, however, Feef’s beloved Peter meets an untimely end and Feef is left to plod through her new life as a spy without guidance as Rowe is shown to be—wait for it—not quite what he seemed. His gusto for fighting commies seems to be fueled by a blinding obsession with capitalism, which has turned him into a psychopathic monster. Meanwhile, Feef has found love again in a star of the new Labour Party government, Hugh Fenton.
Hugh is initially disgusted by Feef’s conservative ideology and her lack of interest in the new, trendy socialist politics he adores, but softens towards her after they dance at a party. He continues to try to persuade her to join the ultra-liberal postwar generation, and it doesn’t take too much for her to start seeing cracks in her beloved capitalism.
As Rowe becomes more and more unhinged, willing to do anything and kill any person for his love of capitalism, clunky flashbacks show Fenton’s humble transition into socialism as he “saw the light.” By this point it becomes abundantly clear that the show is a disastrous effort to draw parallels between 1945 and 2019, with America cast as the villain in both.
Not only are the communists cast as something other than bad guys, they’re the misunderstood heroes. This is where the previously mysterious folk music begins to make sense. The style of music has long been tied to the socialist Industrial Workers of the World and was quite popular after World War II among communists in many nations.
The show goes completely off the rails near the end, with side characters developing stories about communism saving the world from racism and more evil Americans showing up to torture whomever they need to in the name of greed and power. The older, more conservative members of Parliament are even shown to laugh at the plight of 100,000 stranded Jewish refugees as they meet to discuss the future of Palestine. Only the young, idealistic socialists are shown to have passion for restoring the Jewish homeland.
The conclusion shows that darling Feef failed to learn her lesson, now recruited by her beloved home country to oversee acts of espionage in Israel in the name of protecting British oil interests. Her arc concludes as she clears the way for Operation Embarrassment, an actual declassified act of British spies meant to sabotage ships designated for the passage of Jewish refugees from Italy to Israel.
It certainly was not Britain’s finest hour, but it also not the act of genocide the show might have you believe. Of course, historical accuracy is not always necessary when creating fictional narratives, but suggesting, even vaguely, that the British killed Jewish refugees headed for Israel is fairly egregious.
“Traitors” was created and developed in the United Kingdom by Bathsheba Doran in her first series “created by” credit. Doran previously wrote for shows like “The Looming Tower,” “Masters of Sex,” and “Boardwalk Empire.”
In the show’s haste to make its point, the script faltered, producing a level of dialogue that didn’t rise to the level of high-end television for which Netflix originals have become known. While Feef was played aptly by the relatively unknown Appleton, other performances by older actors like Michael Stuhlbarg felt hallow and broad in their delivery.
Doran’s story in “Traitors” is totally mired by a compulsion to advance a political agenda rooted in ignorance and misunderstanding. What a terrible way to waste a period show about heroes and espionage. Ellie Bufkin is the co-host of the movie podcast ""Flix It"" and a senior contributor to The Federalist.

"Steny Hoyer Said Impeachment ‘Is Not Worthwhile,’ Left-Wingers Freaked",thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/steny-hoyer-said-impeachment-is-not-worthwhile-left-wingers-freaked/,"April 18, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) reacted to the release of the Robert Mueller report on Thursday by arguing impeachment of President Trump “is not worthwhile.” His two-sentence comment to CNN ignited a furor on the left, rankling those who predictably interpreted the report as further cause for impeachment efforts.
“Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,” Hoyer told Dana Bash. “Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgment.”
Hoyer’s apparent signal that Democratic leadership, like most of the rest of the country, is prepared to move on from the special counsel investigation didn’t sit well with a host of anti-Trump commentators. For a sampling of the backlash, see the tweets below. And expect the tension between Democratic leadership and the party’s progressive wing to escalate. This is unbelievably disappointing. Even if you don't ultimately pursue impeachment proceedings, why on Earth would you say this today?

"Mueller Passed The Prosecutorial Buck, Preferring To Slime Trump On Obstruction Rather Than Indict",thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/mueller-passed-prosecutorial-buck-preferring-slime-trump-obstruction-rather-indict/,"By Margot Cleveland April 18, 2019
After two years and spending an estimated $35 million , Robert Mueller issued a 448-page report that ignored the governing special counsel regulations. Those regulations required Mueller, at the conclusion of the special counsel’s work, to “provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.”
Yet, instead of issuing the mandated closing documentation, Mueller explained that his team “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment” of whether “to initiate or decline a prosecution.”
Attorney General William Barr spoke during today’s press conference of Mueller’s failure to perform this regulatorily required duty. When asked why he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein felt it necessary “to take it to the next step to conclude there was no crime,” Barr retorted:
The very prosecutorial function and all our powers as prosecutors, including the power to convene grand juries and compulsory process that’s involved there, is for one purpose and one purpose only. It’s to determine yes or no, was alleged conduct criminal or not criminal. That is our responsibility and that’s why we have the tools we have. And we don’t go through this process just to collect information and throw it out to the public. We collect this information. We use that compulsory process for the purpose of making that decision. And because the special counsel did not make that decision, we felt the department had to. That was a decision by me and the deputy attorney general. Yes.
Notwithstanding Mueller’s professed refusal to render judgment on whether to initiate or decline prosecution, Part 2 of the special counsel’s report served solely to indict President Trump in the court of public opinion by providing detailed factual conclusions that seemingly support obstruction of justice charges—at least based on the special counsel’s view of the law.
But Mueller’s view is decidedly wrong. Prior to his appointment, Barr decimated the obstruction of justice theory of criminal liability Mueller relies upon in the special counsel report.
Further, while Democrats and the media will put Barr’s view down to bias, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein agreed with those conclusions. Rosenstein, who supposedly floated the 25th Amendment as a basis to out the president, is anything but biased in favor of the president. Rosenstein appointed Mueller, and Rosenstein, who flanked Barr during the press conference, agreed with Barr’s conclusion that no crime had occurred.
Many believe lead special counsel prosecutor Andrew Weissmann instigated the non-indictment indictment of Trump in Mueller’s report. The modus operandi is just too perfect.
Recall that Weissmann led the Enron task force and served as the lead prosecutor in the Department of Justice’s case against Arthur Anderson. Weissmann secured a conviction against the former accounting giant, shuttered the firm, and left tens of thousands of innocent employees without jobs. Then , “three years later, the Supreme Court reversed the Andersen conviction in a unanimous decision, holding that Andersen’s conduct was not criminal, and it ‘was shocking how little criminal culpability the jury instructions required.’”
Weissmann’s attempts to convict Merrill Lynch executives of non-crimes were likewise swatted down in court. And then there was Weissmann’s questionable conduct during those trials, which emails indicate included threatening witnesses.
Even if Weissmann holds responsibility for pushing to include the obstruction of justice analysis, Mueller approved the final report that pontificated on Trump’s potential criminal conduct, while refusing to make a decision to initiate or decline charges. Ironically, in justifying his non-decision, Mueller claimed any other outcome would be unfair to the president. From the special counsel’s report:
We determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusations is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongfully accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator. The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor’s accusations of a crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequence that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice.
But Trump has no process now to clear his name from the taint of obstruction of justice created by Mueller’s report. So, after two years of battling unjust and untrue charges of collusion with Russia, Mueller has destined President Trump to spend the second half of his first term combating claims of obstruction of justice—claims which, even if they had a basis in fact, have no basis in law.

The Bombshell In The Mueller Report Is Russia’s Social Media Campaign,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/the-bombshell-in-the-mueller-report-is-russias-social-media-campaign/,"By David Marcus April 18, 2019
It’s over. The Mueller Report is upon us and it says what Attorney General William Barr said it would say. Nobody in the Trump campaign—in fact, no American citizen at all—colluded or conspired with the Russian government to impact the 2016 election. This is obviously good news for the country and a vindication for the president who has protested his innocence quite vociferously from the beginning.
But the findings of the report were not unalloyed good news. In one area, in particular, Mueller found deeply troubling activities from the Russians. The section on Russia’s informational campaign using social media to influence the election is damning and shocking. Much of the information it presents was already known, but seen summarized by Mueller, what they achieved was astounding.
Conducted by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian government-backed social media troll farm, the extent and reach of the operations is astounding. Collectively, the report says, “The IRA’s social media accounts reached 10s of millions of US persons.” It also controlled Facebook groups such as “United Muslims of America,” that had 300,000 followers when it was shut down in 2017.
In total the report says that at least 29 million and perhaps as many as 126 million people were reached by the propaganda campaigns. The danger of this is not merely that the propaganda might help determine the outcome of viewers’ voting decisions. What is far worse is that, on that scale, the Russians can make fringe, divisive positions and rhetoric appear to Americans to be, if not mainstream, at least vastly more prominent than they really are.
Even the news media was not immune to these efforts. The report outlines that on multiple occasions “U.S. media outlets also quoted tweets from IRA-controlled accounts and attributed them to the reactions of real U.S. persons.” It is very possible, if not likely that the real target of the IRA was not to sway an election, but rather to sow discord and distrust among Americans. And it looks like the news media was an unwitting accomplice.
Sometimes IRA social media operations even reached beyond the screen and into real life. Dozens of rallies, some of which had hundreds of attendees, were organized by the IRA. Their sinister scheme involved creating well-followed interest groups on Facebook (on either side of the political spectrum) and then announcing a live event. Group followers who showed interest were then contacted and made event coordinators. Unbeknownst to the coordinators, or the attendees, their rally was really a Russian propaganda put-up job.
All of this should shock Americans, especially since Russia is not the only country engaged in these kinds of social media informational attacks. I wrote in June of last year, after attending the National Security Seminar at the Army War College, that the military and defense department take these attacks incredibly seriously and that they are incredibly difficult to defend against. At the time I wrote:
“While an ultimate good, freedom of speech is also a dangerous hole in our ability to defend against the growing threat of propaganda operations. Our primary foreign adversaries—Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea—are all repressive regimes vastly more capable of defending against propaganda. If speech is being used to sow division and discord in those nations, they just squash it. They shut down websites, close newspapers, and even kill journalists. These are defensive options that thankfully our government cannot use.”
Since the government has little leverage, that leaves it to the social media companies themselves to police their content for foreign political interference, but as congressional testimony from the heads of Facebook and Twitter has shown, these companies have no earthly idea how to do it. When asked, they tend to mumble something about the potential of artificial intelligence to someday weed out bad actors.
The situation is not good and there do not seem to be any optimal solutions. In any sane political time we would see a bipartisan effort to create new approaches to defend against foreign social media informational attacks. But our current political divisions are making this impossible. Both sides share some blame for this.
Democrats, with their wild and irresponsible promises of collusion between Trump and Russia, set expectations so high that Trump being cleared of collusion makes the information campaign seem like small potatoes. Meanwhile, Trump and too many Republicans have downplayed the attacks as a mere excuse for why Hillary Clinton lost. Now that the Mueller report is out and Trump has been cleared, both sides should be able to move to the center and accept the true nature of Russian interference—but that won’t happen.
Instead, Democrats will continue to try to catch the great orange whale, this time with a harpoon of obstruction. Reasonable people may or may not be able to agree if obstruction took place but, even if it did, Trump has not been charged so the only recourse would be congressional investigation and potential impeachment. Meanwhile, the actual threat remains lost behind the sound and fury of allegations against the president.
Now is the time for good actors on both sides—Marco Rubio or Mitt Romney (who knows about the threat Russia poses, if you recall) on the right, and perhaps people like Joe Manchin or Chris Coons on the left—to bring attention to, and seek solutions to, the problem of Russian social media informational attacks.
But some of the responsibility also falls on us, the citizens of the United States. Know that the awful anonymous tweet you see might just be foreign propaganda. Don’t assume the worst about those with whom you disagree. Because that is exactly what Russia has been trying to make you do, and in far too many cases, they’ve been succeeding.

The much anticipated final report from special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed in 2017 to investigate whether Donald Trump treasonously colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, was finally released on Thursday morning. You can download Volume I and Volume II of Mueller’s report here and here , respectively.
At a Thursday press conference ahead of the full Mueller report’s release, Barr said that Mueller’s investigation and report “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”
“The Special Counsel found no collusion by any Americans” in the efforts of Russians to interfere in the 2016 election or hack the e-mail accounts of top Hillary Clinton aides or the Democratic National Committee, he added.
“[T]here was no evidence of Trump campaign ‘collusion’ with the Russian government’s hacking,” Barr said.
The attorney general also said Mueller’s investigation failed to establish that Trump obstructed justice.
“After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,” Barr said.
“[T]he White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims,” he said. “And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation.”
The release of Mueller’s report brings to a close a sprawling, multi-year and multi-million dollar investigation that in the end concluded the president did not illegally conspire with Russia or act as a secret agent of Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign. The release of the report followed years of frenzied speculation and conspiracy theory-mongering about Trump’s alleged Kremlin connections.
Much of the hysteria was fueled by a so-called dossier from retired foreign spy Christopher Steele, who was jointly funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The salacious and unverified allegations in Steele’s collection of dossiers against Trump were then used as a primary basis by the Obama administration to spy on Trump campaign affiliate Carter Page. Despite the fact that the dossier was used in 2016 to justify spying on private American citizens, none of its major allegations have been verified, while many of its central claims have been thoroughly debunked .
Barr testified before the Senate last week that he planned to investigate whether the 2016 spying operation against Trump and his presidential campaign was proper and lawful. He also said an ongoing investigation of the matter by the Department of Justice’s inspector general would likely be concluded in May or June of this year.
“I believe that the publicly released report will allow every American to understand the results of the Special Counsel’s investigation,” Barr concluded at his press conference on the full Mueller report.

"Austin, Texas ‘School Climate Survey’ Tells Students ‘Gender Is How A Person Feels’",thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/austin-texas-school-climate-survey-tells-students-gender-person-feels/,"By Joy Pullmann April 18, 2019
A survey given to all Austin Independent School District students in grades 3-11 this spring told children “Sex is what a person is born. Gender is how a person feels.” It then asked students to select whether they feel they are a “girl/woman,”“boy/man,” or “identify in some other way.” That was followed by a blank box for students to “describe how you identify.”
The Federalist obtained a copy of the survey through an open records request. The full survey is here , and a screenshot of the gender identity question below.
An AISD Student Climate Survey, which included the question this year, has been administered every year to students in grades 3-11 since the 2003-04 school year, district spokeswoman Samantha Alexander told me by email. Texas’s fifth-largest district supervises more than 83,000 children, according to federal data . Assuming an even distribution across grade levels, that means some 57,000 children took this survey this year.
The survey includes other response statements and questions such as “At my school, some students are treated unfairly because of who they are,”“At my school, there is respect for different cultures,” and “Do you ever feel unwelcome at school?” It is used “to examine factors contributing to student success beyond test scores,” Alexander wrote. Its primary authors were Lisa Schmitt and Karen Cornetto, said the district’s open records office, who are no longer listed on the district’s employee directory .
Yet “whether it’s comprehensive sex education or a survey, if you’re bringing stuff like that [sexuality] up you are potentially creating upset or conflict or just planting the idea” in young minds that may not be developmentally ready for it, said pediatrician and education researcher Karen Effrem in a phone interview about Austin’s survey. Research suggests that simply asking questions about specific behaviors, such as teen suicide or drug use, increases those behaviors.
The ill-defined subject matter of “school climate surveys” justifies asking any number of personal questions under the guise of assessing student feelings, and this practice is growing nationwide, not just in Austin. Many times, parents have no idea their children will be asked questions like this until after it happens, because they sign blanket approvals for such evaluations at the beginning of every school year. It’s Not Just Austin, It’s Everybody
School climate surveys like Austin’s received a boost from the Republican-re-engineered Every Student Succeeds Act, the most comprehensive federal law regarding K-12. It updated No Child Left Behind in 2015. The revamp included allowing states to show “accountability” to the federal government on non-objective criteria such as children’s “socioemotional learning” (SEL).
So ESSA expanded No Child Left Behind’s much-detested mandates for testing children on academics into encouraging evaluations of children’s non-academic behaviors and feelings. Such soft measures are known as the “fifth indicator ” in agreements between states and the federal government that keep federal subsidies flowing to K-12 schools. Special interest groups are using ESSA as a wedge to push schools into expanding school climate surveys.
Non-academic school climate questions on students’“mindset” and “motivations” were added to the National Assessment of Educational Progress starting in 2017, the most reliable indicator of U.S. K-12 achievement over time also known as the Nation’s Report Card. Its various subtests are administered every spring in every school district in the nation. The NAEP’s governing law clearly states that the tests may not “evaluate or assess personal or family beliefs,” but it appears that provision is being skirted.
NAEP’s 12th grade school climate survey, for example, asked , “How often do you talk about things you have studied in school with someone in your family?” It also asked students to describe beliefs about themselves such as how hard they work and whether they like various aspects about school, and who lives in their home (i.e., a stepparent, mom’s boyfriend, etc.). Its fourth grade climate survey asked nine-year-olds to identify themselves as members of a specific race or ethnicity, their perception of their work ethic, and happiness and interest in school.
The eighth grade climate survey attached to the 2018 civics exam asks students to reveal whether they have their own bedroom, a smartphone, and a family clothes dryer. It also asks students to write their ZIP codes, and whether 13-year-olds think “I have good ideas for programs and projects that would help solve problems in my community.” And it asks how often the children “Discuss current political events or issues with others (for example, people in my home or friends)” and “Read about current political events in the media.”
The NAEP 2019 pilot test in reading asked eighth graders whether “I felt awkward and out of place at school” and “I felt my teachers treated me fairly.” That probably describes almost every eighth grader ever. Probes Pushed By Special Interests, Federal Government
Schools are also beginning to monitor students’ emotions at the behest of school safety initiatives, both local and federal, including an approach known as Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports. “ESSA contains multiple provisions that affect early-childhood standards and curricula, and those provisions encourage and in some cases mandate inclusion of SEL,” says a 2019 Pioneer Institute report .
Special interest groups have been pushing for variations on the SEL idea for decades on the basis that schools can and should substitute for parents in shaping children’s character traits, social dispositions, and feelings. “One 2017 study by a pro-SEL organization estimated that K–12 public-school systems spend approximately $640 million each year on specific programming and practices designed to instill SEL,” the Pioneer report says. “Teachers also reported that they spend about eight percent of their time on SEL, which would translate into another $30 billion annual investment.”
The report notes that the nationwide growth in similar initiatives has been driven by federal involvement in education, codified earliest in President Bill Clinton’s Goals 2000 legislation in 1994, and deepening in every subsequent federal education law. Austin was a relatively early adopter of this education trend, and partners with the major SEL advocacy organization, CASEL (formerly the Collaborative to Advance Social and Emotional Learning), to increase its use in classrooms. CASEL receives federal funds.
One of CASEL’s board members leads a federally funded Common Core testing organization, called Smarter Balanced. Common Core itself contains requirements that schools assess students on nonacademic measures such as “cooperation” and “persistence.” Schools often incorporate these kinds of requirements by politicizing curriculum, such as this example the Pioneer report gives of Common Core-compliant curriculum in Utah: “students use their voices to advocate solutions to social problems that they care deeply about. They are involved in learning…social advocacy.” Unreliable Surveys Waste Tax Dollars and Kids’ Time
One of the major problems with relying on semi-psychological assessments like these school climate surveys is that they are extremely unreliable, said Effrem, the Pioneer report’s coauthor, in a phone interview.
“Even surveys and psychological screenings and things that are done by psychiatrists, highly trained psychiatrists, have enormously high false positive rates,” she said. “A lot of the self-report surveys are prone to bias and prone to the kids answering the way they think they should answer… So I don’t really care who does the survey, having them done at all and dealing with really controversial or subjective topics like feeling safe or gender identity, just isn’t a good idea.” Very little reliable evidence underlies what essentially amounts to experiments upon U.S. kids.
A meta-analysis study often cited by socioemotional monitoring proponents examined 213 studies on the topic spanning 270,034 students. It found the vast majority of so-called SEL research did not examine such programs’ effects on students’ academic achievement, “there is no standardized approach in measuring social and emotional skills,” and that ” Only a few studies tested and found a temporal relationship between [SEL] skill enhancement and other positive outcomes.”
Self-reported information, the dominant mode of information collection in psychological assessment, is well-known to be extremely unreliable. That is likely one of many factors contributing to the scientific replication crisis that acutely affects the field of psychology. In approximately the past five years, nearly every scientific domain has been up-ended by the discovery that thousands of research findings, even those that had reached the level of “settled science,” could not be reproduced when the studies were re-run.
Education research was also long known to be substandard , politicized , and biased even before the replication crisis was discovered. Thus, very little reliable evidence underlies what essentially amounts to experiments upon U.S. kids using U.S. tax dollars and precious moments that could instead be devoted to better instruction. Still the tax dollars, platitudes, and federal programs flow on, unchecked by reality. Schools as Referral Centers for Government Programs
It’s hard to escape the conclusion that none of this is really promoting the goals publicly proclaimed for such initiatives, such as helping children.
“School climate surveys are basically being used to justify more money for subjective social-emotional stuff, whether it’s software or teaching, professional development, whatever, and data collection that is profiling kids,” Effrem said. “If you do these school climate surveys and they then say ‘We have to be mentally screening these kids,’ it will lead to a rash, as experts have admitted, of kids being referred for psychiatric evaluation and treatment when they don’t need it.”
Conveniently, many public employees and mental health “experts'” job security is only increased by labeling more children with psychological problems, and possibly increasing psychological problems by exposing children to identity-destabilizing material such as the false idea that gender is merely a feeling untethered to any biological reality. Research and parents’ experiences with rapid-onset gender dysphoria in teens supports the theory that increased exposure to sexual politics increases children’s transgender identification.
And since federal taxpayers sponsor health care for one-third of the nation’s children, through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the more children labeled as having mental problems and referred for related government services, the more it appears the nation “needs” these programs. It’s a win-win for people with political agendas, and a lose-lose for parents, taxpayers, and children.

Why Only Cultural Reactionaries Would Rebuild Notre Dame,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/cultural-reactionaries-rebuild-notre-dame/,"By Sumantra Maitra April 18, 2019
The scenes of black smoke and the burning, collapsing spire of the Notre Dame Cathedral looked like a scene from the apocalypse—the collapse of civilization itself, like a Thomas Cole painting . It was the symbol of France as the central empire of Europe, le gloire of the greatest of powers to defend the frontiers of what used to be known as the Christendom for centuries. It was a testament of time that stood the Hundred Years’ War, one of the darkest revolutions in human history, Napoleonic hegemony, and both world wars, brought down by what essentially was human incompetence and indifference.
For years, Notre Dame was underfunded, a security risk, and ignored by the powers that be: petty humans who were more interested in their petty squabbles over who lords over which piece of land, what warning sign should be where over which beverage, which dating app one should use, and how many calories one should consume.
But there were also signs of hope. As our eyes in Europe were transfixed on the television screen, random masses of patriotic French men and women, of different skin color and origin but bound by a common sense of purpose, kneeled in front of the statuettes singing “Ave Maria ,” a visual that was not as much a sign of defiance, as after every single terror attack, but a symbol of grateful submission to the unknown.
Things can get a lot worse. The firefighters who heroically fought the inferno to save the Holy Crown—the burned but not destroyed husk of a structure from the 12th century that stood within the imposing hall—almost involuntarily bowing before a glowing cross, and the miraculously untouched Rosace. Nothing can explain what saved it, other than a sheer miracle.
Notre Dame means Our Lady. The Judeo-Christian values that shaped Western civilization and the Western canon are there in every molecule of air one breathes in Europe. It seeps through, and it was visible in front of Notre Dame in the masses of people praying and singing. When all sense of rationality fails during an unexpected catastrophe, faith, and a sense of community and belonging, are the only things that give us hope.
Ben Shapiro was correct in stating that if one needs to rebuild society, one needs to see what holds it together in the first place. The reactions to the Notre Dame fire were predictable. I refuse to give them any more publicity than they already are clamoring for, but there were tweets saying that the hysteria over this destruction of one of the greatest representations of human endurance was uncalled for, because people didn’t die, because there are other cathedrals, and because Flint doesn’t have clean water.
Most of these people, for those of you wondering, are born and brought up in the West, products of our times. What’s with all the wailing — like, chill dude!
It’s an abhorrent idea that art, beauty, architecture, religion, literature, cathedrals, and statues do not matter, but it is also wholly understandable. This is what individualism looks like; no one can see the greater good. Is this tragedy affecting me directly, or corroborating my deeply held political and philosophical beliefs? No, therefore mourning it is meaningless and ultimately irrelevant. There’s no common dream, hope, or loyalty to anything.
What good is a fresco drawn by Michelangelo, compared to 700 toilets that could have been built with the same money? After all, Notre Dame is the symbol of everything that modern education teaches us to hate; it is Euro-Christian, and therefore supposedly predicated on racism, sexism, and conservative social hierarchy.
This is the logical end game of Rawlsian liberalism, the rationalist utilitarian strain of thought that permeated society since the Enlightenment, only to be kept at bay by bouts of reaction. It sees nothing beyond temporal emoting of a narcissistic self. It worships no selfless sacrifice, no virtues, no duty. Everything is predicated on utility—and therefore economics.
In their odes to enlightenment, our modern saints of the Church of Humanist Liberalism often forget that there was no single phenomenon called the Enlightenment. In fact, timeless creations from Caravaggio to Chopin, Samuel Taylor Coleridge to George Chambers, are often the products of reaction. One might not remember Justin Bieber 200 years from now. One would still remember Lord Byron’s “The Curse of Minerva,” or Bach’s “St. Matthew’s Passion.”
“Anguish over the decline of civilization is the affliction of a reactionary,” Nicholas Davila wrote, “the democrat cannot lament the disappearance of something of which he is ignorant.” Civilization cannot last without unity of purpose, a common cause or sense of solidarity, and reverence for righteous hierarchy, that there are causes and feelings greater than individuals. Without order there is chaos, and nothing is a surefire recipe for disorder than unchecked hyper-individualism. We don’t realize what we have, but we will miss it when it is gone.
Why would your neighbor go to war for you—or for your country—if you cannot even agree that a cathedral that stood for more than 900 years is a testament of joint history and civilizational legacy, and not some misplaced eyesore reminder of the so-called “Dark Ages”? It’s ironic that what the liberal rationalists call the Dark Ages gave us Notre Dame and Westminster Abbey. What do we seek to conserve now and leave for our future generations to marvel at? Where’s the Colosseum of our age? Who will paint “ The Ninth Wave ” of our times?
The art, literature, and music of our time does not revere divinity or beauty anymore, due to relativism. Our supposedly enlightened class considers graffiti in South London to be equal (or better) art than “Orpheus and Eurydice” painted by Peter Paul Ruben. What will we be remembered as a civilization for, other than the individual brilliance of a handful of prodigious men and women of science?
I am far from being religious. But I live in the heart of the West, and if longing for classical Western canon makes me a reactionary, I’ll gladly accept that.
I didn’t get to see Notre Dame as it was, unfortunately, but my parents did. And I hope for the sake of humanity that France rebuilds it, with the help of the world, so I can visit at the first opportunity. For what is the purpose of civilization if not the creation and preservation of timeless beauty and transcendent grandeur for posterity?

Sports Writer Jeff Pearlman Compares Having More Than Two Kids To Tossing Garbage Into The Ocean,thefederalist.com,Georgi Boorman,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/sports-writer-jeff-pearlman-compares-two-kids-tossing-garbage-ocean/,"By Georgi Boorman April 18, 2019
Sports author and podcaster Jeff Pearlman casually floated the idea of population control on Twitter on Monday: “Just saw a Tweet from a guy I know, announcing how excited he and his wife are to be having child No. 6. Does there come a point when, in the name of earth’s survival and limited resources, we’re allowed to say, ‘Hmm. I dunno, man …'”
No, let’s not share in the joy of acquaintances who are blessing the world with another child. Let’s leverage our indubitable wisdom on climatology and public policy to proclaim “earth’s survival and limited resources” are at stake and question whether they are doing the responsible thing.
Oh, but he didn’t stop there. When a Twitter user named Lisa clapped back with, “As a mom of 6 kids, I’m gonna say no,” our erudite intellectual thoughtfully responded, “Serious Q, Lisa–why? Earth truly can’t sustain this. Not hypothetical, factual.” He then went on to say the estimable Jeff Pearlman-approved number of children to have is, “I dunno. 2?”
Lisa objected, leaning on demographers’ projections that the world population will peak before the end of the 21st century. “I think it’s a slippery slope to start telling people how many kids they can or can’t have. My body, my choice.”
But Chairman Pearlman of the People’s Republic of Know-It-Alls would not be swayed. “It bothers me when people tell me not to throw my garbage in the ocean. My garbage, my choice.” Population Control Leads to Horrible Policies
The fecundophobia of some members of the American elite has blossomed into full-blown hatred. Around this time last year, comedian Nikki Glaser tweeted “Don Jr. and his wife have FIVE kids. No one should be having five kids. Why are people still allowed to have 5 kids?”
In general, many people in the mainstream feel comfortable dehumanizing and devaluing babies and children, which is why tweets like Pearlman’s (which oddly equates people having as many kids as they want with people throwing garbage in the ocean whenever they want) and Glaser’s must be roundly refuted.
If calling out dangerous, immoral opinions on Twitter were ever cheap sport for pundits with time on their hands, it isn’t anymore. The fact that children born alive after abortions can literally, legally be treated as garbage in the state of New York now should not be lost on you. The fact that 232 Democrats in the House of Representatives have refused to even vote on ensuring all children born alive are treated as children, not garbage, should not be lost on you, either.
If there are a few voices at the back croaking weakly in protest, we can’t hear them over the fascist chants for government to regulate anything and everything in the name of the climate “crisis,” up to and including our own bodies (ironic, for the “my body my choice” crowd).
I wonder if aspiring Population Czar Pearlman realizes how many people have been violated and killed based on exactly the policy he’s referring to in the name of “sustainability.” Would you like to know how many people in India were forcibly sterilized out of fear of a population “bomb” that never existed ? Around 8 million men and women.
Would you like to know how many people are missing from the Chinese population due to their one-child policy (now a two-child policy)? An estimated 300 million. More than 20 million Chinese people were sterilized in 1983 alone. Families pregnant with an unauthorized child have been threatened with exorbitant fines they couldn’t possibly afford, thus forcing them to seek abortions or literally pay the price.
In 1990, when a small town protested after the Chinese government violently ripped 250 children from the wombs of their mothers, officials sent an army to occupy the territory. The villagers’ armed resistance triggered what is known as the Barren Massacre—the indiscriminate slaughter of hundreds by the People’s Liberation Army (another bitter pill of irony). We know that forced abortions and sterilizations are still occurring on 1 million mostly Uyghur captives held in internment camps in China, according to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Autonomy Onslaught, Here We Come
The radical environmentalists who ceaselessly lobby government for a turn at the levers of power have never been interested in preserving your autonomy. Every natural human right, including the right to procreation and the right to life itself, must bow down to Nature as god.
There has never been such a thing as effective mass population control without violating the rights of the individual, and there never will be. Solutions range from heavy taxation to biological warfare . Celebrated playwright George Bernard Shaw pleaded for a “ humane gas ” that would kill “instantly and painlessly” to cleanse the population of those who “cannot pull [their] own weight.” But even something as relatively anodyne as per-child taxation is a strike at the knees of all who would not submit to the desanctification of individual human life.
It’s no wonder we’re having to refute ignorant Twitterati who compare children to garbage when people as supposedly enlightened as bioethicists have claimed that “the life of a newborn baby is of less value than the life of a pig, a dog, or a chimpanzee.” I wonder if Pearlman and Peter Singer ever slouch in overstuffed armchairs, puffing cigar smoke and egotism into each other’s faces as they wax poetic about the golden days of eugenics and the blatant attempts to keep the poor and the “unfit” from breeding. You know, that heyday of the early 20th century when 60,000 Americans were sterilized ? Sports, social hygiene—interchangeable disciplines, really.
That’s where we’re really heading, aren’t we? Why would we indiscriminately limit children from every family when we could do so much good for the planet if we uprooted the “weeds” from the garden of society and kept them from breeding. Wait a minute, that sounds familiar.
Ah yes, we’ve heard that from population-control fanatic Margaret Sanger , founder of Planned Parenthood. In the born-alive debate, the left is already leaning almost exclusively on the false notion that all late-term abortions not directly related to maternal health are of fetuses “incompatible with life.” Unfit , you might say. “Lebensunwertes Leben .” It’s almost like some of them haven’t left that awful genetic supremacist ideology behind or something. The World Isn’t Ending, and Neither Should Families
All this death and oppression building like a violent storm on the horizon is supposedly justified by science, but it’s mostly echo chamber dogma put forth by people whose predictions pretty much always fail to come true. As David Harsanyi has pointed out, sea levels did not rise 20 feet in the 14 years since “An Inconvenient Truth” (nor did they even rise one foot), a billion people did not die of starvation due to overpopulation, and farming hasn’t collapsed due to increased temperatures. Instead, we are more prosperous than ever. Extreme poverty has been cut in half in the last two decades.
The real kicker is, American fertility is already below replacement rate and, in fact, sits at a 30-year low. If this trend continues, we won’t be able to sustain this nation’s massive welfare state because we won’t have enough workers to generate payouts to the old.
If we’re going to keep our sacrosanct entitlement system intact, then whose lives are authorized for neglect now? Whose lives will be devalued for the “greater good”? All those vulnerable senior citizens tucked away in long-term care facilities, who are already getting the message they’re better off dead.
You see, whether the fertility rate goes up or down, whether the overall temperature ticks up or down, the problem isn’t the flawed science so much as the perverted morality that promotes the abuse and murder of individuals in the name of some greater collective goal, for which the science seems all too often just a means to that end.
You don’t get to a point of suggesting population control and comparing babies to garbage just by believing the earth has a fever. You get there by denying that humans are made in the image of God and that their rights derive from Him, not the government.
That’s why refuting bad methodology and cautioning against tenuous conclusions, as important as they are, is not enough to stop the onslaught against the sanctity of human life. There will always be another excuse, another crisis. A crisis doesn’t determine our morality, our morality determines how we deal with a crisis. Maybe Pearlman should take a seat on the bench until he gets his head around this basic rule of civilized society."
Airbnb’s Anti-West Bank Policy Shows Why Laws Against BDS Matter,thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/airbnbs-anti-west-bank-policy-shows-laws-bds-matter/,"By Melissa Langsam Braunstein April 18, 2019
Want to fight The Man? If you’re too young to have fought for civil rights, you’ve got the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement (BDS).
BDSers wrap themselves in the cloak of justice, but their high-minded rhetoric quickly devolves into hate, because at bottom, stigmatizing democratic Israel isn’t hopeful. BDS is a high-stakes game of pressure that affects individual students , performing artists , and corporations, as the movement pursues a long game of destroying Israel . As Airbnb learned when they sided with the BDS bullies last year, it’s not necessarily a wise business decision. Airbnb’s Politicized Decision about West Bank
Last November, Airbnb made headlines when they announced that, after consulting with various experts, they would de-list approximately 200 properties in Jewish communities within Israel’s Judea and Samaria regions, better known stateside as the West Bank. The company’s rationale was that these locations “are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.”
On its face, this was an odd move for a business. An American for-profit corporation that serves private, paying customers went out of its way to take sides in one of the world’s most sensitive and emotional political disputes. In response, lawsuits were filed on behalf of affected hosts, would-be hosts, and travelers.
The San Francisco legal complaint made the case that Airbnb acted in response to pressure from the BDS movement and its allies — the groundwork for which the United Nations helped lay . Now, Airbnb denied supporting “the BDS movement, any boycott of Israel, or any boycott of Israeli companies” last November. However, that’s not how it looked to either supporters or detractors of that policy, all of whom read the situation as Airbnb taking sides in the BDS battle.
Airbnb reversed itself last week. So, the company will not de-list the relevant properties, and an Airbnb spokesman told The Federalist that associated profits will be directed to a still unnamed nonprofit organization that is not connected to either Israeli or Palestinian issues.
In a call with The Federalist, Rabbi Abraham Cooper , the associate dean and director of global social action agenda at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, observed, “Whatever Airbnb thought they were going to achieve by making this move, what they were doing was emboldening those who want to punish Israel for real and imaginary sins and singularly call it out time and again for isolation.”
That action led to strong, real-world reactions for the company. Beyond the lawsuits, Politico Pro noted that Airbnb “was also blacklisted by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet because the plan appeared to support a boycott on Israel.” This matters because Florida is both populous and a popular tourist destination. Florida also represents only one of the 27 states that currently have state laws enabling governments to avoid working with companies that boycott Israel.
Airbnb declined to comment on why they changed course—whether it was the threat of legal action, financial loss, state-level anti-BDS legislation, or simply a recognition that they’d erred—but the shift was likely fueled by some combination of those factors. This underscores the importance of fighting BDS on all fronts: legal, legislative, financial, and in the court of public opinion.
Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, who participated in the Delaware suit against Airbnb, emailed, “Other international companies need to learn the lessons from Airbnb’s mistake and understand that boycotting Israel and discriminating against Jews are unlawful acts which will ultimately result in dire legal consequences, public condemnations and embarrassment.”
Hopefully, Airbnb’s about-face will inspire other companies to think twice before bending to BDS, which Cooper describes as “a top tier concern of world Jewry.” But as far as deterrents go, this episode highlights the urgency of enacting anti-BDS laws not only at the state level, but also at the federal one. Legislation Can Help
The Senate passed anti-BDS legislation when they adopted Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s S. 1 in January. S. 1 bundled four Middle East-related bills. One of those four bills was the Combating BDS Act of 2019 , which allows state and local governments, as well as employee benefit plan staff, to avoid doing business with—that is, giving public dollars to—companies that boycott Israel.
By contrast, U.S House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has not been eager to pass the House’s companion bill, H.R. 336 , “Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act of 2019.” To catalyze forward motion, Reps. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) and David Kustoff (R-TN) initiated a parliamentary maneuver to force consideration of the bill last week. If this discharge petition garners 218 votes, Pelosi would have to introduce the bill. According to Politico Pro, “All 197 Republicans are sure to sign on, which means 21 Democratic signatures are needed.”
In another year, finding 21 Democrats willing to support pro-Israel legislation should have been a cakewalk. However, 2019 is not any old year. Given Democrats’ internal ferment over Israel, Pelosi does not want to touch this bill.
Of course, there’s nothing in the bill that should be controversial. Regardless, S. 1 became a political hot potato among Senate Democrats precisely because of its anti-BDS provision,. With an eye on Democratic primary voters, all of the Senate’s Democratic presidential aspirants, save Amy Klobuchar, voted against it.
BDS is not an issue that allows for splitting the baby. As Darshan-Leitner noted, “BDS is an anti-Semitic campaign which purports to care about human rights but whose real goal is to completely replace the Jewish State with a Palestinian one.” That’s the shell game, in a nutshell. So those who oppose BDS should oppose the movement vigorously.
For those at home who want to help repel BDS, here are two suggestions: First, if you live in one of the 23 states that currently lacks an anti-BDS law, ask your state representatives and governor to change that. Second, keep your eye on the House. Call your member of Congress and make sure he or she signs this discharge petition, especially if you’re represented by a self-identified pro-Israel Democrat.

Citigroup Won’t Shoot Straight About Discriminating Against Gun Companies,thefederalist.com,Lawrence Keane,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/citigroup-wont-shoot-straight-discriminating-gun-companies/,"By Lawrence Keane April 18, 2019
Citigroup’s getting asked some hard questions about the fiscal sanity of their decision to discriminate against firearms businesses, and their answers aren’t likely to soothe investors.
Justin Danhof, general counsel for the National Center Public Policy Research and Free Enterprise Project, posed a simple question in a shareholder meeting: “Can you tell us—your investors—exactly how much money we stand to lose because of this decision, and explain why you have this right while Warren Buffet has this wrong?”
Danhof was referencing Buffett’s 2018 refusal to impose his political views on investors. The “Oracle of Omaha,” who runs Berkshire Hathaway, rebuffed antagonist Andrew Ross Sorkin when he read a shareholder question during a CNBC interview about doing business with gun manufacturers.
“I don’t believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses,” he said. Earlier in 2018, he stated his position just as clearly: “I don’t believe in imposing my views on 370,000 employees and a million shareholders. I’m not their nanny on that.” Invest in Business, Not Politics
It’s telling that one of America’s most successful investors sees injecting corporate virtue signaling into investment and banking issues as losing proposition. It’s not that Buffett is a gun rights champion. He’s a board member of billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety, which champions extreme gun control, and supported Hillary Clinton for president when she campaigned on a platform of reinstating and expanding the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.
Buffett sees it as bad business for unaccountable corporate C-Suites to dictate public policy.
Citi CEO Michael Corbat tried to field Danhof’s question but stumbled out of the gate. Instead of owning up to a purely political decision, he offered half-truths. Corbat said Citigroup’s policy to discriminate against firearms manufacturers and retailers who refuse to abide by their policy of instituting age-based gun bans—deny a legal adult’s right to keep and bear arms—wasn’t a Second Amendment threat, rather a “good practice.”
Corbat tried to couch it that they would only do business with retailers who conduct full background checks and offer no financing for companies that use loans to convert legal firearms into illegal firearms. If it sounds confusing, it’s because Corbat was aiming to be.
All federally licensed firearms retailers are required by federal law to conduct an FBI background check at the point of sale before they can transfer a firearm to a consumer. This is done each and every time. This is not a “best practice,” it’s a law the industry supports. Also, no firearms manufacturers use any money—lent, invested, or earned—to convert legal firearms into illegal ones. It’s a quick way lose a manufacturing license and head to prison. Purposefully Misleading Investors
Corbat is purposefully conflating the actions of individual criminals with that of an entire law-abiding industry that provides the means for Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights. Citigroup’s actions, and Corbat’s answers, are a threat.
Real solutions to the criminal misuse of guns look a whole lot more like campaigns to make background checks work as intended by entering all disqualifying records, partnerships with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to prevent “straw purchases” of guns and make firearms retailers less vulnerable to theft and robbery, and using enhancing penalties for those who steal guns to commit further crimes in our communities.
The irony here, as Danhof pointed out to Corbat during the shareholder meeting, is Citigroup’s high-rise executives were claiming the moral high ground by using their financial might to influence public policy while it benefitted from public tax dollars—presumably including those paid by gun owners and firearms manufacturers—that ponied up the $45 billion Citigroup bailout.
“To be clear, the company is impinging on the constitutional rights of some of the very Americans who bailed Citi out after you all made a series of poor business decisions,” he told Citi officials. “Maybe you should have just said ‘Thank you,’ instead.” What’s the Bottom Line?
To the original question, how much money do investors risk losing by this politically driven decision? Corbat wouldn’t say. He admitted, “We’ve had people take business from us around the policy,” adding the move hasn’t “cost us a meaningful amount of money.”
But it has. The state of Louisiana barred Citigroup from competing for a $600 million road improvement project for interfering the lawful commerce-in-arms. U.S. Sen Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and U.S. Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) introduced the Freedom Financing Act (S. 821/H.R. 2019) that would prevent certain big banks from accessing taxpayer-funded insurance if they institute discriminatory policies against the firearms industry.
“Corbat’s admission that Citi has lost business due to its opposition to the Second Amendment is telling. But it’s concerning that he refused to say how much,” Danhof said in a statement . “This proves that Citi made a purely political decision.” It’s time for banks to focus on banking and let voters weigh in on politics.

"No, The American Justice System Is Not Riddled With Stupid, Corrupt Police And Prosecutors",thefederalist.com,Evan McClanahan,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/no-american-justice-system-not-riddled-stupid-corrupt-police-prosecutors/,"By Evan McClanahan April 18, 2019
I enjoy a good true crime story, so you might say that I live in the best of times. Behold the podcast revolution, which offers any number of true crime tales, “Serial” being the one that “broke through” and has created many imitators. And behold Netflix, whose “look at all the innocent people locked up in jail!” series—“Making a Murderer,” “The Staircase,” and “An Innocent Man”—have created a healthy skepticism about the fairness of our criminal justice system.
But for years there have been plenty of true crime shows that favor the prosecution. “Forensic Files,” for example, with its inimitable narrator Peter Thomas, offered 22 minutes of scientific instruction on how the good guys captured the bad guys. (Some turns out to be junk science these days, by the way.)
“Cold Justice” looks specifically at unsolved cases with the hope that one week of made-for-TV investigation can present enough evidence to the district attorney for an arrest. And, of course, fictional versions of these kinds of shows have sprung up aplenty. “CSI” was essentially a fictional combination of “Forensic Files” and Sherlock Holmes.
So what we have are contrasting looks inside the nebulous, scandalous, and at times wondrous world that is the American criminal justice system. If you only listened to one side, the side that paints the American judicial system as thoroughly broken and fraught with injustice, you will leave feeling utterly hopeless. If you only listened to the other, you will leave incredibly frustrated that the wheels of justice move as slowly as they do, with rare moments of celebration when an actual criminal is proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Maybe most people listen to only one or the other. I happen to watch “Cold Justice” and listen to the “Wrongful Conviction” podcast. “Cold Justice” is a flawed program, both as a television product and because of it assumes that a team of two to three experts can crack a case that no one else could for years on end. Also because it focuses on “cold” cases, it has an unusually high burden of difficulty.
The “Wrongful Conviction” podcast exists to demonstrate that it really isn’t that hard to put innocent people in jail and far too many of our prosecutors and DAs convict the wrong people to satisfy the demands of justice from a scared public and antsy voters.
If you watch “Cold Justice,” you appreciate the unique burdens on those who are actually trying to solve crimes. They often lack the expertise, funding, and time to conduct thorough investigations. There is often insufficient evidence at the crime scene to pass the burden of proof, especially if the criminals have watched a few episodes of “CSI” and remembered not to leave fingerprints behind.
Witnesses can give contradictory statements. Suspects have a “right to remain silent” and the right to have a lawyer present, even at the state’s expense. The burden is, as it should be, on the investigator to re-create all of the circumstances surrounding the crime so that there is no “reasonable doubt” as to who committed the crime.
If you listen to “Wrongful Conviction,” you realize how wrong that process can go. Investigators get tunnel vision and narrow in on one suspect, ignoring important clues and evidence. They coax confessions out of innocent people who will say just about anything to get out of the interrogation. They do not formally arrest a suspect so they don’t have to read them their Miranda rights, or they take the time to ingratiate themselves with a suspect, earning their trust before turning the tables. It is undeniable that a certain, unknowable number of investigators, prosecutors, and DAs shortchange the process and commit willful acts of injustice.
So which one is the most accurate account of what is taking place right now in the world of criminal justice? Well, surely, no one show or series of shows can tell the whole story. Each podcast or show has a particular point of view, a narrow focus that really doesn’t balance out the good with the bad.
But watching both shows can provide insight, such as: You do not have to talk to the police. People really do confess to crimes they did not commit. The words “I want a lawyer” are among the most powerful four words in the English language in America. And many crimes go unsolved.
We should expect, in a sinful world, that dealing directly with sin would be a complete mess. That we get justice from time to time is probably a miracle. Conservatives, who tend to be “law and order” types, should listen to those who have been wrongfully convicted, and should possess a healthy skepticism of the police state we are becoming. And more education say, in civics classes, on the rights we possess to remain silent and have an attorney present might serve the innocent well.
In the meantime, I am not convinced that it is open season on the innocent in America. Yes, civil asset forfeiture is criminal and there are more than enough cases of injustice to go around. But the burden of proof remains with the prosecution and, given all of the unsolved crime in our nation, that burden remains high.
So while I am glad to learn about injustices done by investigators and prosecutors and I do hope for reforms, I am also aware that there are many more investigators and prosecutors who follow the law and do not seek a conviction without good evidence first. Perhaps the overall lesson is, listen to both sides. Criminal justice is complex and broken, and no narrative can possibly tell the whole story.

How Robert Francis O’Rourke Sabotaged Obamacare,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/18/robert-francis-orourke-sabotaged-obamacare-skimping-taxes/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 18, 2019
On Monday night, the Wall Street Journal reported that former U.S. representative Robert Francis O’Rourke had underpaid his taxes for 2013 and 2014. When O’Rourke released his tax returns Monday night, the Journal contacted an accountant, who noticed the error:
O’Rourke and his wife, Amy, appear to have underpaid their 2013 and 2014 taxes by more than $4,000 combined because of an error in the way they reported their medical expenses, according to tax returns the couple released Monday evening .
They took deductions for those costs without regard to the limit that only allowed that break for medical and dental expenses above 10% of income for people their age. Had they not taken the nearly $16,000 in medical deductions, their taxable income would have been higher.
But why did they over-report their medical expense deduction? If you’re curious, go and fetch a copy of the Consolidated Print of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . Why, lookie what we have here:
SEC. 9013. MODIFICATION OF ITEMIZED DEDUCTION FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (a) of section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ‘7.5 percent’ and inserting ‘10 percent’.
(b) TEMPORARY WAIVER OF INCREASE FOR CERTAIN SENIORS.— Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
‘(f) SPECIAL RULE FOR 2013, 2014, 2015, AND 2016.—In the case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2012, and ending before January 1, 2017, subsection (a) shall be applied with respect to a taxpayer by substituting ‘7.5 percent’ for ‘10 percent’ if such taxpayer or such taxpayer’s spouse has attained age 65 be- fore the close of such taxable year.’
As one of many tax increases, Obamacare raised the medical expense deduction. Instead of allowing individuals to write off medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of income, individuals could only write off only medical expenses exceeding 10 percent of income—raising revenue by limiting this deduction.
However, seniors could report at the lower 7.5 percent level for 2013 through 2016. In 2013 and 2014, Robert Francis reported at the lower 7.5 percent level, even though he and his wife aren’t seniors. Oops.
Several things come to mind upon reading this news, the first being one word: SABOTAGE. Democrats frequently like to claim that the Trump administration is “sabotaging” Obamacare. But by failing to pay an Obamacare-related tax increase, Robert Francis quite literally did just that—he sabotaged the law, failing to fund its entitlements by failing to pay his newly increased tax bill.
Second, did Robert Francis ever bother to READ Obamacare? Sure, he wasn’t a congressman when the bill passed, because he wasn’t a congressman for long, but one would think a member of Congress would bother to educate himself about such an important, and visible, piece of legislation. I talked several times with my mother, a senior who uses the medical expense deduction, about the import of this provision on her taxes. But then again, I actually bothered to read the bill.
Third, Robert Francis should remind himself that, if congressmen need to hire an accountant to do their taxes, maybe he should think about coming up with a simpler tax code? I wrote about this issue in a different context last year—millennials with children themselves who still have their parents do their taxes for them—but the same principle applies. Granted, an accountant helps prepare my return, but I know where every item on my return came from, and I even prepare a draft return before my accountant does, so I have an early idea where I stand with the IRS.
More to the point, this episode once again reveals how Democrats want to bequeath to the nation laws that they do not understand. Recall that Max Baucus (D-MT), then the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a main author of Obamacare, said he didn’t need to bother reading the bill because he hired “experts” to do it for him. Except that one of those supposed “experts” admitted four years later that, on the law’s employer mandate, “we didn’t have a very good handle on how difficult operationalizing that provision would be at that time.” A government too big to manage—that’s liberals’ greatest legacy.
As James Madison reminded us in Federalist 51, “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place oblige it to control itself.” Maybe Robert Francis should think about that the next time he’s out on the campaign trail—or writing that check for back taxes to the IRS.

5 Biggest Moments From Bernie Sanders’ Fox News Town Hall,thefederalist.com,Courtney Shadegg,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/17/5-biggest-moments-bernie-sanders-fox-news-town-hall/,"By Courtney Shadegg April 17, 2019
Twitter isn’t real. How do we know? Earlier this week Bernie Sanders did a Fox News town hall and, contrary to what warring Twitter factions would have us believe, we all lived to see another day (and we might even be better for it).
Sanders certainly is. He took advantage of the opportunity to sharpen his skills before the upcoming Democratic primary debates. More importantly, he tapped into the vast Fox News audience—and it’s a big audience. In the first quarter of 2019, Fox averaged 1.4 million total viewers a day. Contrary to its reputation, not all of those viewers are conservative—according to a 2017 Pew poll, more than half of Fox News viewers identify as Democrat or “other.”
Here are the most noteworthy and contentious moments from the town hall. 1. Sanders Won’t Apologize for Being a Millionaire
Sanders began the town hall in Bethlehem County, Pennsylvania, by simultaneously defending his millionaire status and somewhat humorously promoting his book, saying: “That money … came from a book that I wrote. A pretty good book, you might want to read it. It was a bestseller, sold all over the world, and we made money. So if anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I’m sorry, I’m not gonna do it.”
Sanders went on to express his opposition to President Trump’s tax cuts. This prompted host Bret Baier to ask why, if Sanders so vehemently opposes Trump’s tax cuts, is he taking the 26 percent effective tax rate instead of paying the higher rate Sanders is advocating America adopt.
Sanders responded, “Pfft, come on. I paid the taxes that I owe.” He added, “And by the way, why don’t you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes? President Trump watches your network a little bit, right? Hey President Trump, my wife and I just released 10 years. Please do the same.”
Baier continued to press on the issue of income by pointing out that Bernie seems to “vilify” millionaires and billionaires when they actually give a lot of money to charity, pointing out that Sanders only gave 3.4 percent to charity himself. In a rare moment, Bernie seemed genuinely uncomfortable answering the question, saying, “My wife and I do give money to charity … we do what we do.” 2. Bernie Targets Fox News for Not Being Uber-Liberal
The socialist candidate frequently pushed back against both the Fox moderators and the network throughout the evening. The tense exchanges began when host Martha MacCallum asked if Sanders would be willing to pay the 52 percent “wealth tax” Sanders has campaigned for, telling him he could offer to write a check. Sanders quipped back, “You can volunteer too.”
Over audience cheers and clapping, Sanders suggested MacCallum pay more, saying, “You make more money than I do.” MacCallum countered that she never suggested a wealth tax. Baier added that McCallum also isn’t running for president. The exchange ended with Sanders accusing Baier and MacCallum of defending the tax bill and suggesting they move on to the next question.
Another notable moment happened when Sanders was asked about socialism. Before answering, Bernie took a shot at Fox News. That prompted Baier to jokingly interject and ask if this was going to be an ongoing issue. Sanders took a moment to reply, saying, “Not everybody thought I should come on this show.” He continued, “Your network does not have a great deal of respect in my world, but I thought it was important to be here.” 3. Cheers for Dropping Employer-Sponsored Insurance
When asked about socialism, Bernie took the opportunity to explicitly state that health care is a human right. He also said there is something “embarrassingly wrong with United States of America being the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care for all people.”
Sanders made his case for Medicare for All, calling it a widely popular government-run program for seniors “which is quite effective.” Clarifying that while the program is government-run, unlike the veterans’ health care system, it is not government-provided health care. Sanders then assured viewers that most veterans think their health care system is “pretty good, just ask the American Legion.” He mentioned that with with Medicare for All everyone can go to any doctor or hospital they prefer, claiming individuals will somehow have immense freedom of choice.
Sanders also trotted out the partisan claim that Trump’s budget proposal would cut Medicare by $845 billion over 10 years. In truth, President Obama proposed similar Medicare reforms. These reforms aren’t cuts; Medicare spending would still increase just at a slower rate.
Baier then turned to asked the audience for a show of hands of who had employer-sponsored health insurance. Roughly half of the crowd raised their hands. Baier then asked who would be willing to transition to a government-run system? Most of the hands in the room shot up, including many who hadn’t indicated they had private insurance.
MacCallum pressed Sanders on who would pay for his Medicare for All plan. Sanders explained that a self-employed family of four currently paying $28,000 for health care would no longer pay premiums, copays, or deductibles. Instead, “they’ll pay more in taxes.” 4. Bernie Was Booed on Abortion
While an abortion question was bookended with cheers, the largely pro-Bernie crowd booed when Bernie, asked if a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy up until the moment of birth, responded, “I think that happens very, very rarely, and I think this is being made into a political issue. At the end of the day, I think the decision over abortion belongs to a woman and her physician, and not the government.” 5. Bernie Says Ilhan Omar Isn’t an Anti-Semite
On Ilhan Omar, Sanders said she has to do a better job speaking to the Jewish community, before saying, “Do I think she is anti-Semitic? I don’t.” Sanders went on to say he hopes every member of Congress fights anti-Semitism, racism, and anti-Muslim activity. He finished by saying it’s important to note, “It’s not anti-Semitic to be critical of a right-wing government in Israel”
There is very little many Fox viewers can agree with Sanders on. But given our current political environment where each side believes the stakes are greater than ever before, an event like this is a win for all of us. We should encourage more televised healthy dialogue. Courtney Shadegg is a government and public relations consultant.

7 Ways The Mueller Report Exposed The Media’s Fake ‘Bombshell’ Stories,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/7-ways-mueller-report-exposed-medias-bombshell-fake-news-stories/,"By Madeline Osburn April 19, 2019
After two and a half years of countless mainstream media “scoops” and “bombshells” that turned out to be false or nonexistent, the American people finally have some concrete answers on Russiagate. When Special Counsel Robert Mueller released his 448-page report on Russian interference in the 2016 election on Thursday, some of the investigation’s conclusions debunked once and for all many misleading, and anonymously sourced, conspiracy theories.
Here are some of the most prominent stories the press got wrong about the Russian collusion narrative. 1. Michael Cohen Never Went To Prague
The infamous Christopher Steele dossier, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party, alleged that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with Federation Council foreign affairs head Konstantin Kosachev in Prague. Desperately wanting to confirm this, news outlets sent reporters to hotels all over Prague checking hotel logs.
In April 2018, McClatchy reported Mueller had obtained evidence of Cohen’s visit to the Czech Republic, according to two anonymous sources. In December 2018 , they reported that Cohen’s cell phone, or a device registered to him, was pinged off towers near Prague.
The Mueller report debunked this piece of the dossier once and for all when the special counsel wrote, “Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.” McClatchy has now added a two sentence editor’s note to their two reports on Cohen.
EDITOR’S NOTE: Robert Mueller’s report to the attorney general states that Mr. Cohen was not in Prague. It is silent on whether the investigation received evidence that Mr. Cohen’s phone pinged in or near Prague, as McClatchy reported. 2. Carter Page Was Not a Russian Agent
Carter Page was the main link between the Trump campaign and Russia. He was a one-time foreign policy adviser on the Trump campaign, has spent time in Russia, and has many contacts with the foreign adversary. The dubious Steele dossier alleged that Page held secret meetings with allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trips to Moscow.
These connections are perhaps the only evidence presented by the media who were convinced Page was a Russian spy (and the only evidence used by the FBI to seek a surveillance warrant against Page, but I digress).
Mueller finally put this myth to rest in his report, asserting they found no evidence Page coordinated with Russia on behalf of the Trump campaign.
Russian intelligence officials had formed relationships with Page in 2008 and 2013 and Russian officials may have focused on Page in 2016 because of his affiliation with the Campaign. However, the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. 3. Donald Trump Did Not Direct Cohen to Lie to Congress
In January 2019, BuzzFeed News dropped what was supposed to be “bombshell” report, alleging that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress about a potential real estate deal in Moscow. They also reported that Mueller’s office had evidence of these alleged lies.
The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.
In February, Cohen told Congress under oath that the president never directed him to lie, and now the Mueller report is confirming the contrary report as false:
Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen’s testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did not direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the specifics of his planned testimony. 4. Cohen’s Call With a Russian Did Not Prove Collusion
In November 2018, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes reported on live television that “The President was compromised by a hostile foreign government, full stop.” Hayes proposed this was the only conclusion to take from Cohen’s admission that he lied to Congress.
The Mueller report investigated Cohen’s phone call with a personal assistant to a Russian official, and found no evidence that they ever followed up or acted on that initial phone call about a Trump Tower in Moscow.
“Cohen could not recall any direct follow-up from Poliakova or from any other representative of the Russian government, nor did the Office identify any evidence of direct follow-up,” the Mueller report concluded. 5. Paul Manafort Was Not Funneling Polling Data to Putin
Many reporters used Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s past business dealings in Russia to prove he was a Russian stooge, but one reporter, Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo, was particularly confident that Manafort’s activities proved collusion on the Trump campaign once and for all.
These new revelations combined with earlier reports effectively end the debate about whether there was ‘collusion’ between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. There was. It wasn’t marginal. It was happening at the very top of the campaign. The campaign manager was secretly funneling campaign data and information to a Russian oligarch closely tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin…
The Mueller report thoroughly debunked the theory that Manafort was sharing polling data with Putin in order to win the election.
The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort’s sharing polling data and Russia’s interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the time of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts. 6. The Trump Campaign Did Not Make Republicans Soften Their Position on Ukraine
MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow passionately presented her theory that in 2016, before the Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign convinced Republicans to soften their policy positions on Russia, and to abandon advocating for supplying Ukraine with weapons to fight off Russian invasion.
“We definitely do have evidence that the Trump campaign was working to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue,” Maddow said.
The Mueller report debunked this conspiracy theory outright:
The investigation did not establish that one Campaign official’s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. 7. Jeff Sessions Was Not a Russian Spy
The Washington Post reported a “big scoop” in March 2017, alleging that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Russians and lied about it in his confirmation hearing. They reported that, as a Senator, Sessions had a private meeting in his office with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
“The previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia’s alleged role in the 2016 presidential election,” the Post wrote.
They also reported that Sessions and Kislyak met and talked at an event, which turned out to be a Heritage Foundation event that included 50 other ambassadors in the room.
The Mueller report states that the special counsel investigated Kislyak’s encounters with both Sessions and members of the Trump campaign, and found neither to be evidence of collusion. He wrote that Kislyak’s interactions with Trump campaign officials were “brief, public, and non-substantive,” and that Kislyak and Sessions’s meeting in the Senator’s office discussed nothing “more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.”
These are just a few of the truths finally unearthed in the aftermath of Russiagate. At this point, the damage these media outlets have done to their own credibility may be beyond repair.

"No, Today's America Would Not Surprise The Founders In The Least",thefederalist.com,Benjamin R. Dierker,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/no-todays-america-not-surprise-founders-least/,"By Benjamin R. Dierker April 19, 2019
Pundits on all sides frequently claim the Founding Fathers would not recognize America today. Automatic weapons, internet, air travel—oh my! In fact, however, it is unlikely the Founders would express much shock at today’s bloated government or partisan political culture.
Putting aside that they understood the concept of innovation, and even had repeating firearms , this group of men understood something far more fundamental: human nature. Baked into virtually every meticulously crafted line of the Declaration, Constitution, Federalist Papers, and treatises of the day was a recognition that man has both incredible capacity for cooperation and devastating potential for destruction. Equipped with knowledge of history and of human nature, the Founders had possibly the greatest predictive power of any group of people throughout history. Big Government Is as Old as Sin
This awareness of human nature is why James Madison remarked in Federalist 38 that Solon the Athenian statesman “had not given to his countrymen the government best suited to their happiness, but most tolerable to their prejudices.” It was their understanding of history, and the successes and failures of the ancient and modern worlds, that led the Founders to create a federal republic with separation of powers, checks and balances, dual sovereignty, and a written Constitution. By following this example and adding further institutional safeguards, they sought to form the government most tolerable of our prejudices so that all people could pursue happiness.
Along with a government suited for men, not angels , Madison and company put separation of powers and checks in place not to keep the government static, but to keep it balanced. They knew it would grow, and that is precisely why they devised it so carefully.
It is hard to picture Madison red-faced and wide-eyed watching Fox News or a C-SPAN broadcast of a congressional hearing. Surely things like the federal budget and the entitlement regime would be pulse-quickening, but Declaration-era writings make clear that the Framers and Founders not only knew of the potential, but foresaw the likelihood of such growth and power.
Even the legendary Benjamin Franklin quip, “A republic, if you can keep it,” contains the pearl of wisdom and recognition that order does not stick around naturally. In fact, the natural state of things is disorder and devolution into chaos. Would Franklin be surprised to see decay in the republic? I suspect if anything, he would be shocked it still exists.
Endless foreign war falls short as well. George Washington who, as commander of the Continental Army, was greatly assisted by foreign military power, knew intervening beyond our shores was dangerous. Would the father of the country and issuer of the Proclamation of Neutrality be surprised at endless foreign conflict? Seems to me he understood the consequences and had the foresight to avoid it during his tenure. Political Culture
Perhaps what truly would astound the first Americans is the vitriol and spectacle of political culture. The 2016 presidential campaign included friends turned rivals, intense polarization, exceedingly rich aristocrats, lifelong political creatures, and everything else that makes for a fantastical fall-of-an-empire story.
Merely typing “ creole bas ” (as in “creole bastard”) into a search bar will pull up a Siri suggestion and Google prediction for Alexander Hamilton. The founders’ mudslinging was so great that hundreds of years later, this political insult still defines the man, at least according to Google. Lest we forget, Hamilton was shot and killed by the sitting vice president of the United States. I’m sure Aaron Burr cracked a smile from the grave when Donald Trump said he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue without losing any voters.
While many insults are tossed around today, I suspect “hermaphroditic character” is not common to most ears. But Thomas Jefferson, that genteel and polished statesman, taunted John Adams as “A blind, bald, crippled, toothless man who is a hideous hermaphroditic character with neither the force and fitness of a man nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.”
By no stretch of the imagination would polarized politics, infighting, insults, or even the 24-hour news cycle shock even the most mild-mannered of our Founders. They were men hardened by tyranny; victors of revolution; students of history; political innovators. Not only would they recognize this aspect of the modern state, they would feel right at home . Technology and Change
People often patronizingly infantilize those who came before us. This primitive view of the past is not only inaccurate but astonishingly conceited. Undergraduate political science students may have the internet, but many of the Founders spoke multiple languages, could read and write in the ancient scripts, quoted and understood the great philosophers, and were fighting wars while still in their teens.
Some say if the Founders could have known how deadly guns would become, they never would have penned the Second Amendment. To take this view, one has to believe not only that they were idiots, but that they could not read. Of course they were aware of the concept of technological advancement—for weaponry in particular. They had heard of a sword, spear, bow, and arrow. Yet they used a magic boom stick! That they couldn’t fathom another development is idiocy, and ignores the astounding innovation that took place in real time during their lives.
More importantly, this generation of dueling, revolutionary, treasonous, tar-and-feathering, 18th-century rabble-rousers would not be shocked by mass shootings. Of course, like all decent people, it would be a sickening realization, but they lived through and read about the history of man. It’s a history filled with genocides, war, torture, and hysteria. The form of such violence is simply a new form, but not a new phenomenon. New Settings, Same Stories
And the form of things is important. Of course remote controls and Skype would flabbergast them, just like visual reality shocks the Greatest Generation. But the Founders had roads and bridges, simple machines, and innovative tools for their day. The interstate highway system, F-150s, and television may be impressive developments, but not so much so that their minds could not comprehend. Since they were literate about ancient Rome, with amazing running water and sewage systems, it is likely certain things would disappoint them about the modern world.
But these all come back to human nature. The Framers understood that men could unite for common purpose, accomplish enormous feats, and promote the good. They also knew of the evils dwelling within the heart of men. This country today is populated by the same kind of men, with the same innate passions and prejudices, simply using different facts and tools.
So of course they would not recognize today in simplistic terms any more than you would not recognize a classmate from elementary school. Things change, but on a relatively predictable course. Things being different do not make them unrecognizable, and the Founders understood change better than most, being keen students of history. Most importantly, they understood that human nature doesn’t change, and they planned accordingly. Benjamin Dierker is a law student at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.

The Collusion Dream Is Dead But The Conspiracy Lives On,thefederalist.com,Ben Domenech,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/collusion-dream-dead-conspiracy-lives/,"By Ben Domenech April 19, 2019
The President of the United States did not conspire with the Russians. Neither did his family. Neither did his friends. Neither did his campaign. At the end of the Robert Mueller investigation – now clearly staffed and advanced by partisans who loathe this president – not one single American, after all that, has been indicted or charged with any crime for conspiring with the Russians in any way, shape, or form to steal the 2016 election. That is now an indisputable fact. The uncomfortable reality is that we spent two years being fed the most irresponsible allegations advanced by an ignorant punditocracy gone savage for this idea, which should raise all sorts of questions about our political, intelligence, and media elites who sold us this crazy story and promised the American people the proof that never came.
The juiciest portion of the report from the perspective of the media yesterday was the president’s outburst upon being told of the appointment of Mueller as special counsel following Jeff Sessions’ recusal and the firing of James Comey – from the searchable report here:
[W]hen Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m f***ed.” The President became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, “How could you let this happen, Jeff?” The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had “let [him] down,” contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him, “you were supposed to protect me,” or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency . It takes years and years and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”
He wasn’t wrong! The cloud created by this investigation in the aftermath of Comey’s utterly deserved firing (for incompetence above all else, but it’s just as justified for any reason, including being an Emo Giraffe ) would hamper the administration at every turn, in foreign and domestic politics, and ultimately became a constant battle for the president throughout the past two years.
And now we know it was all for naught. Well, glad that’s settled – except for the bitter enders who continue to insist they see the ghosts. And one can understand why: If you spent two years confident that Don Jr. was going to jail, it’s impossible to persist as a media commentator admitting your wrongness – better to double down and insist the conspiracy goes even deeper than you ever suspected.
The obstruction portion of the Report was even less impressive. It advances a broad definitional theory of obstruction that takes eight pages to explain – one that is clearly set up as a response to Bill Barr’s memo on the subject – that I’d love to see a single elected official explain coherently. There’s much fun to be had in counting the footnotes that are Tweets, public interviews, and press conferences. As Rick Klein notes , the Report is more about making a political case against the president than a legal one. And that’s very much how it reads.
The president frequently behaved in private as he does in public: he threatened, proffered pardons, and cajoled those around him to make this investigation end or go away. He was at every turn bounded, rejected, or ignored by those who work for him who were unwilling to break any laws on his behalf. Don McGahn should win an MVP award. Does this make the president look bad? Of course it does! Is it surprising? To me, not at all – he was doing all this in public, too. This is what being governed by the first 2,000 people through the gate at the Bruins game looks like.
But at the end of the day, no laws were clearly broken, so Mueller, like Comey before him, decided to reach a “no exoneration” conclusion that smears the target of the investigation without advancing a legal argument for his indictment – kicking the matter instead to Congress, where politicians are left with a partial roadmap to impeachment, but hardly enough fuel for that train.
How can we know that to be the case? Just look at the instant reaction of Democratic leadership, where Steny Hoyer is speaking for Nancy Pelosi. They have zero interest in taking the matter up. In taking this position, they are relying on voluminous poll data showing that the American people long ago tuned out this investigation and do not believe impeachment is justified. They are also taking signals from the 2020 Democratic field, where none of the leading candidates is pushing for impeachment, and where questions about Mueller or Russia are virtually nonexistent on the campaign trail. That’s unlikely to change.
The challenge of course for Democratic leadership is that the biggest constituency for impeachment is the media, which yesterday was urging Democrats to impeach the president. They are happy to leave this question to the voters . Media partisans immediately freaked out at Hoyer for saying what any responsible leader ought to say. The mantra of the media is that the White House is dominated by a “culture of lying” – shocking, I say. 2019 George Stephanopoulos repeated that this morning, and watching him make the case that a culture of lying is an impeachable offense would be pretty hilarious news for 1998 George Stephanopoulos. But if you’re willing to claim out of nowhere that 20 years of watching Fox News turned Bill Barr into a Trumpian figure, you’re willing to go pretty far out there .
So this sets up an interesting phenomenon. The Democratic Leadership is wisely pumping the brakes on impeachment. The majority of the Democratic conference is with them. The majority of the American people are with them. But influential partisans are in favor of such a foolhardy escapade, despite all the facts we now know, driven by their hatred of this president and a refusal to acknowledge how wrong they were about how he got elected. Much as its authors tried, the report does not aid them in this effort. As David Harsanyi notes , “It went from ‘Russia stole the election with Trump’ to ‘Trump spoke about trying to undermine the investigation that was being used to smear him every day for two years.’” That’s just not going to fly. But influential elites in politics and media are now reduced to this conspiracy of dunces, imitating Homer Simpson chasing after that marvelous pig, insisting it’s still good."
Rebuilding Notre Dame Requires Rebuilding The Culture That Created It,thefederalist.com,Auguste Meyrat,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/a-famous-cathedral-burned-as-did-all-that-it-represents/,"By Auguste Meyrat April 19, 2019
As far as tourist sites and monuments go, the Notre Dame Cathedral is one of the best places to visit. It is beautiful, big, right at the center of a tourist-friendly city, and—best of all—completely free of charge.
It is a welcome change from Paris’s other famous monument, the Eiffel Tower, which costs a fair amount of money to climb and is located away from the center of town, forcing tourists to make a treacherous walk through parks and streets infested with aggressive peddlers accosting vulnerable tourists with their petitions and tacky souvenirs. By contrast, Notre Dame is safely situated near all the other great attractions of the city: the Louvre, the Luxembourg Gardens, the Musee D’Orsay, the Champs-Elysees, and the River Seine. It is the great centerpiece of the historical theme park that old Paris has become.
This is what French leaders and the majority of people around the world are lamenting. In the fire that struck the great cathedral, they saw the destruction of the ideal tourist site.
Thus, instead of responding with outrage to find the person who set fire to an enormous stone structure that has weathered nine centuries of so many wars and revolutions, officials quickly chalked it up to an accident related to renovation efforts and have already discussed plans for rebuilding . This is just an unfortunate thing that has no meaning or motive behind it—something to be sad, but not angry, about. A Naive, Superficial Response
Except that these things do have meaning. Only those who see Notre Dame as merely an exquisite monument could respond to it in such a superficial, willfully naïve way. Consider the context of the fire. It happened at the beginning of Holy Week amidst a nationwide crisis of church desecration, to Notre Dame Cathedral, the most famous cathedral in the world and most visited site in Europe . It seems proper to seek a better explanation. It may very well be an accident—and if so, that’s quite an accident—or it may be something more sinister.
Because leadership and the media in France have already adopted an appeasement policy that refuses to acknowledges possible crimes among certain minority groups or possible government incompetence or corruption, it highly unlikely that anyone will learn the truth behind the fires. Already, they have quickly ruled out the possibility that this was not an accident , yet without much evidence. Nevertheless, the symbolism of the burning cathedral and the lame response is unmistakable for those loyal to France or to the Catholic Church: the West has officially entered a post-Christian phase in history.
Whatever can be said about the material progress of the modern secular era, it can also be said that it does not build cathedrals like Notre Dame. Only a truly devout, dynamic, and inspired medieval city like Paris in the 1100s, housing legendary figures like St. Thomas Becket, St. Bernard, and Peter Abelard, could build something so grand and impractical.
For those wondering what great building Paris produces today, they should visit the Pompidou Centre, an inside-out architectural monstrosity that houses modern art monstrosities. For all its many flaws, it is fair to say that there is something familiar about Pompidou that modern man does not feel in Notre Dame, a special kind of vacuity and disorder peculiar to contemporary life.
The images of Notre Dame on fire reminded people of unpleasant truth that the building is simply too beautiful and magnificent for the world today . The world, and France in particular, does not deserve it; Christianity, Catholicism in particular, does not deserve it either.
In the name of progress and mass appeal, France and the Catholic Church have both abandoned their venerable traditions and betrayed the very core of their identities. Nevertheless, they will continue to prop up their old monuments and pretend as if nothing has happened. Whether it turns out to be true or not, it seems fitting that the combustible scaffolding used for renovations was ignited by a careless construction worker paid by the French government. By trying to maintain the beautiful (profitable) illusion, they ended up inadvertently revealing the ugly reality.
Many writers have delivered moving tributes to Notre Dame, and those should not be disparaged. They prove just how powerful and important this church is to the world. But in praising the building, they should praise the forgotten values that created this building, for this will be the only way to truly rebuild it. Learning to Care for Beauty Again
Catholics need to recover the beauty of Notre Dame, a beauty derived from genuine faith and strong community. They need to quit ruining their sacred spaces with modern art and architecture —an incompatible style that emphasizes function over form and by extension worldly concerns over heavenly ones.
There is nothing Catholic about lifeless, brutal buildings designed to house dehumanized collectives. True Catholic architecture should do the opposite, physically striving for the infinite and expanding the souls of those who worship a living God.
For their part, the French need to recover their history and national pride. They must realize that they are more than their welfare state and their many monuments. They have inherited the greatest cultural patrimony in the world, and they should rise to this occasion as rightful heirs. They should reject the vulgarity and falsehoods of their postmodern philosophers and ditch the inferior trash of popular culture.
This does not mean adopting an ethnocentric xenophobia, but a cultural confidence that lifts outsiders up to their level instead of stooping down to theirs. It is apparent that the French suffer from an acute cultural insecurity that causes them to elect spineless globalists like Emmanuel Macron, seek safety in a crumbling European Union, and enable the existence of unassimilated, crime-infested ghettos .
In other words, society needs to follow the example of Fr. Fournier , a true Catholic and true Frenchman, who risked his life to save the relics of Notre Dame. Just as he saved the heart of church, and just as the firemen to whom he ministers saved the heart of Paris, so too should all people of goodwill save the heart of Christianity and Western culture. And nothing less than Fournier’s kind of heroism will be required.
It is not enough to reflect on the fire and consider the loss in money and morale it may bring. Rather, this is the moment to reflect on what it symbolizes—a post-Christian West and the great neglect of truth, goodness, and beauty. This is not a mere matter of rebuilding a cathedral; it is a matter of rebuilding a world. Auguste Meyrat is an English teacher in the Dallas area.

Maggie Haberman Thinks It’s Weird For The White House To Play ‘Edelweiss’,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/maggie-haberman-thinks-weird-white-house-play-edelweiss/,"April 19, 2019 By Ellie Bufkin
Yesterday was not a good day for the mainstream media. The Robert Mueller report left journalists associated with outlets like CNN, the Washington Post, and the New York Times reeling for a hook that would redeem them of their cosmically false reporting on whether President Trump colluded with Russia to manipulate the results of the 2016 election.
New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman has been at the forefront of speculative “reporting” dating back to before Trump won the White House. In recent reporting, she took the opportunity to use Rep. Ilhan Omar’s anti-Semitic comments to call Trump a racist , and of course she had her own personal truth about Russian collusion before the release of the Mueller report concluded there was none. Haberman has certainly been known to bend the news to make the president and his supporters look as evil as possible, even in the absence of evidence.
On Thursday, as press gathered at the White House to eventually hear the news that Mueller had not only swung and missed at proving any Russian collusion, but also came up empty on evidence of obstruction, Haberman had an especially interesting take regarding the White House music selection. Does…anyone at that White House understand the significance of that song? https://t.co/IK9h8fOwNj
— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 18, 2019
“Edelweiss” is original to the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, “The Sound of Music,” and dates back to 1959. More recently, a version of “Edelweiss” was used by the Amazon series, “The Man in the High Castle.”
The series, based on a novel by Phillip K. Dick, takes place in an alternate version of the United States in the 1960s. In the show’s version, the Axis powers won World War II and have split up the United States as German states and Japanese states.
So the version of “Edelweiss” used by the series is meant to sound creepy and uncomfortable. Those unfamiliar with the origins of the song might even think it was supposed to sound like a German folk song now being sung in a zombie-like chorus in the fictionally occupied United States.
Based on Haberman’s tweet, I have to assume she watches “The Man in the High Castle.” While the Amazon series created its own version of the song that guts its emotional sentiment and original purpose, “Edelweiss” was written for “The Sound of Music” as a tear-jerking tribute to Captain von Trapp’s homeland of Austria.
In the musical, based on a true story, the von Trapps are forced to flee their homeland following the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. The captain was no fascist, and while he loved Austria and its beautiful, pillowy, alpine flowers greeting him every morning, he knew he must escape to preserve his integrity and protect his family.
In “The Sound of Music,” Captain von Trapp singing “Edelweiss” is one of the most emotional musical numbers of the entire film. He attempts to softly strum a guitar and deliver the lyrics to a small crowd but becomes overwhelmed with emotion when he reaches the line “bless my homeland forever.” His family joins him on stage to help him finish. That night, they flee Nazi persecutors who are trying to recruit the captain into the Nazi war effort.
The namesake flower of the song is also associated with anti-Nazi Austrian Resistance groups, like the “Edelweiss Pirates,” which was comprised mainly of children and teens. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, both Jewish and fiercely anti-Nazi, wrote the song at a later point in the musical production because they felt Captain von Trapp’s patriotism needed to be underscored.
While the White House band likely played “Edelweiss” because it is a beloved showtune penned by legendary American songwriters, the love and patriotism that was written into it make it the perfect song for the White House. Perhaps Haberman believes “Edelweiss” in the modern world is a symbol of a fictional television takeover by Nazis. But the reality, however inconvenient to her narrative, is that because of the sacrifice of so many we still live in the land of freedom without threat of Nazi persecution.

CNN Can’t Do The Mueller Report Math,thefederalist.com,Mark Hemingway,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/cnn-cant-do-the-mueller-report-math/,"April 19, 2019 By Mark Hemingway
If there’s one thing we’ve learned in the Internet age, it’s that journalists make a lot of mistakes. (Believe me, I’ve made my share of boneheaded ones.) But there are a few areas where journalistic ignorance really seems to persist, and basic math is one of them. With that in mind, look at this chyron from CNN last night, passed on to me by an old colleague. Notice anything wrong?
I’m pretty confident my nine-year-old could look at that and tell me that 36 is not 12.43 percent of 448. Thirty-six divided by 448 is 0.0803, or 8 percent almost right on the nose. However, 448 divided by 36 is 12.44, so it appears that someone did the math exactly backwards, slapped the percent symbol on the end, and put it on the air. (How they got 12.43 instead of 12.44 is further puzzling.)
Anyway, perhaps this isn’t the most consequential error ever, but it does seem very illustrative of a particular problem. Math is hugely important to journalism, and it’s important to remember that a great many journalistic mistakes go unnoticed.
How many articles have you read where there are lots of numbers flying around and you have no idea how the author extrapolated them? It’s always a good thing to keep in mind as you digest the news that there’s a good possibility what you’re reading is in error in some significant way. Yet few people bother to do much beyond passively take in information.
Years ago, the writer Michael Crichton defined this as the “ Gell-Mann Amnesia effect “:
Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the ‘wet streets cause rain’ stories. Paper’s full of them. In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know. One positive thing to come out of the Trump era is that another media critic, whom I am related to by marriage, has noted that we might be seeing the end of Gell-Mann Amnesia. When entire news operations dedicate themselves over a period of years to trying to undo an election result they campaigned against and never saw coming, it’s pretty hard to look at the news the same way again. You realize that their reporting doesn’t add up—sometimes quite literally. Mark Hemingway is the Book Editor at The Federalist, and was formerly a senior writer at The Weekly Standard.

Star Lawyering Protected President Trump From Firing Robert Mueller,thefederalist.com,Ilya Shapiro,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/star-lawyering-protected-president-trump-firing-robert-mueller/,"By Ilya Shapiro April 19, 2019
Don McGahn is one of the few people who came out looking better after the Robert Mueller report than going in. The former White House counsel, who stepped down in October, saved President Donald Trump from his worst instincts, displaying a legal savvy and high ethical standard that served both the president and the country well.
Indeed, by preventing Trump from firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, McGahn prevented a political crisis—not to be confused with a constitutional one—that would’ve made the Russia-collusion narrative seem like a jaywalking allegation. When you add that to his execution of a laser-focused strategy on judicial nominations—including two Supreme Court justices and a record number of circuit judges—McGahn is the early leader for MVP of the Trump administration. (Full disclosure: I worked with McGahn at Patton Boggs more than a decade ago, and we have remained on friendly terms.)
Mueller’s report concluded that McGahn was a “credible witness with no motive to lie.” From the 30 hours the White House lawyer spent talking to the special counsel and his team, we learn some of the most portentous developments of the seemingly interminable investigation.
Almost immediately after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017—after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused from Russia-related investigations, a necessary move given his campaign involvements but one the president never forgave—Trump wanted to dismiss him. McGahn warned that taking this action would look like an attempt to “meddle in the investigation.”
The president didn’t let it go, calling McGahn at home over the course of a June weekend to push him again to tell Rosenstein to sack Mueller. Here’s what Mueller’s report says about that fraught moment: “McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.” McGahn later told White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter that he had planned to resign rather than follow through on the order.
When the president later learned McGahn had told Mueller about the episode, he questioned his counsel’s judgment. McGahn explained that “he had to” answer truthfully because there was no attorney-client privilege. The White House counsel’s loyalty is to the office of the president—and for some purposes to the executive branch of which the special counsel was a part—not to the man who occupied it.
Trump then asked, “Why do you take notes? Lawyers don’t take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.” McGahn replied that he was a “real lawyer” and that creating notes only helped (assuming nothing illegal was being discussed). He was right, and in that moment proved himself more helpful to the president than any number of yes-men—non-notetaking lawyers or otherwise—who made an appearance during this saga.
But wait, there’s more. In January 2018, news broke about Trump’s order to McGahn to fire Mueller. According to the Mueller report, the president tried to persuade his counsel to deny the allegations. McGahn refused multiple times. “Did I say the word ‘fire’?” the president asked, according to the report.
“What you said is, ‘Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can’t be special counsel,” McGahn replied.
“I never said that,” Trump replied, according to McGahn’s recollection. Trump again pressed McGahn to “do a correction” and McGahn refused.
As Mueller concluded, “The President’s efforts to influence the investigation [and thus create potential legal headaches] were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”
Hindsight is 20/20, and nobody knows what would’ve happened had McGahn relayed Trump’s order to Rosenstein, or if he had resigned (or been fired) either in June 2017 or January 2018. But legal pundits who have followed the case recall news cycles devoted to the difference between a special counsel and the Watergate-era “independent counsel,” whether interfering with Mueller’s investigation would constitute obstruction of justice, and even whether the president can pardon himself. Had McGahn acted differently, we might’ve found out the answers to those theoretical questions.
When McGahn became White House counsel, he was known as a sharp-elbowed political lawyer who had previously been chairman of the Federal Election Commission. The professionalism he displayed in his tumultuous 21-month tenure as White House counsel have only elevated his reputation. And that’s before we take into account his masterminding of the judicial lists that propelled Trump to victory in 2016—and their translation into judicial appointments that will likely be the 45th president’s most lasting policy legacy.

"25 Years After The Rwandan Genocide, The West Still Hasn’t Learned The Right Lesson",thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/25-years-after-rwandan-genocide-the-west-still-hasnt-learned-the-right-lesson/,"By Helen Raleigh April 19, 2019
April 7 of this year marks the 25th anniversary of the start of the Rwandan Genocide , and July 15 marks the end of it. Back in 1994, more than 800,000 ethnic Hutus and Tutsis perished in a 100-day killing spree.
Twenty-five years later, it is still hard to comprehend how something so shocking took place. Twenty-five years later, many of us want to know: Is Rwanda a better country now? What lessons have we learned? What can we do to prevent such a ghastly event from ever happening again?
I recently had an opportunity to ask these questions and more to Christine Uwizera Coleman, a Rwandan genocide survivor and a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives and preaches here as a minister. How the Genocide Started
The ethnic conflict in Rwanda has a long history. The majority of Rwandans are Hutus. Only less than 15 percent of Rwandans are Tutsis, but they dominate the country’s political and economic landscape. The two sides had engaged in low-level violence against each other for years.
In October 1990, a Tutsi rebel group, Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), led by Paul Kagame, started a rebellion against the government led by Rwanda President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu. The civil war between the two sides intensified the two groups’ long-standing ethnic conflicts.
On April 6, 1994, Rwanda President Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprien Ntaryamira, another Hutu, were on their way back from peace talks with the RPF when their plane was shot down, killing both Hutu leaders and everyone else on board. Hell broke loose right after.
To avenge Habyarimana, Hutu militias started a well-organized systematic killing of Tutsis, including setting up road blocks and conducting house-by-house searches and killing. Kagame led RPF to fight back immediately with their own systematic killing of the Hutus. What Christine Saw During the Genocide
In 1994, Christine was a 22-year-old student at Rwanda University. Her dad was a Hutu and her mom was a Tutsi. They both passed away in the ’80s due to illness. Christine told me she doesn’t identify as either Hutu or Tutsi because she has family on both sides, but in Rwanda, everyone had to carry an ID card that listed one’s tribal information.
Since children inherited the tribal identity of their fathers, Christine and her siblings were identified as Hutus. On April 6, she visited her older sister Francoise and her new baby niece, Bambine, in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Later that day, she bid them goodbye and went to visit her ancestral home in the countryside with one of her brothers. She never saw Francoise and Bambine again.
Christine was told later by other survivors that the killing was the worst in the city. The Tutsi RPF rounded up Hutus, including her sister Francoise’s family and two of their maids, in Remera Stadium. They were starved, tortured, and later killed, including baby Bambine.
It didn’t take long for the organized murders to reach the countryside, where Christine was. The first killings she witnessed took place in a monastery right after Sunday Mass. A group of armed men broke the monastery door and started killing everyone inside indiscriminately.
The 100 days from April 6 to July 15 were a living hell for most Rwandans. In her book, the “Blazing Holy Fire,” Christine recounts that “killing reached every corner, every family; people met death at every turn. Those killings divided people, families, broke marriages and best friends.” Christine made a vow that if God spared her life, she would devote the rest of her life to Him.
At the end of the 100 days, the Tutsi RPF, with support from Uganda’s army, beat the Hutu militias and took control of the entire country. Their leader, Kagame, became the president, and he still holds the office.
To the outside world, the genocide officially ended on July 15, 1994 and Kagame was hailed as a hero who saved the day. But Christine told me that RPF’s organized killing of Hutus, even civilians, continued after July 15. She showed me an unclassified document from the U.S. State Department dated in September 1994 that supports her claim.
Christine joined 2 million Hutu refugees in running to the Democratic Republic of Congo after the RPF took power. She worked as an aide to a United Nations mission in the refugee camps. Eventually, with the help of her American boss, she immigrated to the United States in 1997. She did traveling ministry for several years. In 2004, she became a pastor and founded her own church, the Blazing Holy Fire, in 2008. Is Rwanda a Better Country Today?
Whether Rwanda is better today depends on who you ask and by what measure. On the surface, the country seems to enjoy order and peace since the genocide. Schoolchildren are discouraged from identifying themselves as Hutu or Tutsi, but rather encouraged to think of themselves as Rwandans. Its economy is one of the fastest- growing in Africa. Still, it has a long way to go. Two-thirds of its population live below the poverty line. Youth unemployment is higher than 40 percent.
Kagame has occupied the office of the presidency since 2000, and has been nationally influential since 1994 as vice president and minister of defense. He “won” three elections and received close to 99 percent of the votes. It looks like he has no plan to leave office any time soon, since Rwandans “voted” for a constitutional change for him to be president for life. Of course, there is plenty of evidence that his overwhelming support is built on fear .
Human rights organizations , the United Nations, and the U.S. State Department all issued damning reports on the Kagame government’s ongoing human rights violations, including arbitrary, unlawful, or politically motivated killings; forced disappearance and torture by state security forces; threats to and violence against journalists; and persecution of Christians and censorship.
Coleman told me everyone is being closely monitored in Rwanda. People are afraid that if they dare to speak any criticism of Kagame and his government, they and their family might suffer. When Coleman decided to speak up about the human rights violations in Rwanda, she stopped communicating with her family members there out of fear that her activism would put them in danger. Has the West Learned the Right Lesson?
After the genocide, many blamed the Western powers such as the United States, United Kingdom, and France for doing too little to stop the genocide. Yet ethnic conflicts are always so complex. Many times it is hard for outsiders to tell the villains from the innocents. And the West, including the United States, has a very mixed record of interventions in the past. Not all lead to success.
It seems that since the Rwandan genocide, the West has been trying to correct its wrongs with money. Not surprisingly, 40 percent of the Rwandan government’s budget depends on foreign aid, with the United States and United Kingdom the two biggest donors. Despite the troubling human rights reports about Rwanda, the money keeps coming. Kagame can often be seen easily mingling with Western politicians and business people, even getting former U.K. prime minister Tony Blair to advise him.
Michela Wrong, a journalist for The Spectator , wrote a piece on Rwanada with an alarming title, “Rwanda is sliding into a new tragedy. And this time we’re funding it.”
I asked Coleman if she thought the West has learned its lesson. She shook her head. In her opinion, Kagame is able to manipulate the international message about Rwanda. “People in the west need to learn the truth about Rwanda,” she says. “The West needs to learn the truth of whom they are dealing with before lending their support. ” Otherwise, all the West is doing is spending taxpayers’ money to prop up one ruthless authoritarian after another.
I asked her if she thought the genocide could happen again. She said yes. The ethnic tension still exists—it’s only being suppressed by a strongman.

"After 50 Years, Kenneth Clark’s ‘Civilisation’ Still Poses Trenchant Cultural Questions",thefederalist.com,Clay Waters,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/kenneth-clarks-civilisation-revisited-at-50/,"By Clay Waters April 19, 2019
2019 marks the 50th anniversary of “Civilisation,” British art historian Kenneth Clark’s masterful television survey spanning the genius of artists, architects, writers, and philosophers from the “Dark Ages” to the modern day. The weekly installments of the series that totals 13 hours were captured on motion-picture-quality 35mm film, busting the show’s budget but riveting British audiences in the spring of 1969.
It garnered an even larger following on the fledgling Public Broadcasting Service in the United States, making Clark a highbrow cult hero in America. It served as the template for sagas like Carl Sagan’s “Cosmos” and Alistair Cooke’s “America: A Personal History of the United States . ” Not bad for a late-’60s program basking in the achievements of dead white males. In fact, that may make the series as relevant as ever.
These days the very word “civilisation” (I’ll stick with Clark’s British spelling) tends to stick in the throat, as people are reluctant to voice the once-effortless assumption that there is a single Western civilisation worth preserving, or even celebrating. That background makes “Civilisation” a half-century old and with a serious-minded reputation, positively edgy in 2019.
Sadly, it’s all too meaningful right now as well. The opening montage of Episode 1, “The Skin of Our Teeth,” includes Michelangelo’s David, Botticelli, The Vatican, St. Paul’s in London, and the Arc de Triomphe, concluding with Clark standing on the bank of the Seine, the Cathedral of Notre Dame in the background, and posing the question he spends the rest of the series answering: “What is civilisation? I don’t know. I can’t define it in abstract terms, yet. But I think I can recognize it when I see it, and I’m looking at it now.”
That scene has acquired tragic poignancy with the devastating fire inside the Cathedral of Notre Dame on April 15. The church, completed in 1345 after over a century of building and thankfully still standing after the fire, has borne witness to eight centuries of French history and is one of the most important symbols of Western civilisation (although left-wing journalists will smear you for noticing). The disaster serves as a tragic reminder of how fragile our “civilisation” truly is.
Clark’s globetrotting took him and his production team to what was by one count 11 countries, 118 museums, and 117 other locations , hitting the highlights of man’s achievement through the lens of men of genius.
Clark, who died in 1983 aged 80, wasn’t the effete elitist his later left-leaning critics made him out to be. Before finding public fame through “Civilisation,” he was indeed a well-known art critic and youngest-ever director of London’s National Gallery, one of many high-level boxes he ticked in High Art circles over his lifetime.
But Lord Clark of Saltwood also had the common touch, or was at least able to mimic it, opening the National Gallery early on the day of a big football match to draw in the public, and keeping the museum open during the Second World War in defiance of the Blitz. The priceless artwork had been shipped off to Wales, but each month, one painting was brought out of storage for exhibition. He also commissioned piano concerts to boost public morale. (He even voted Labour.)
In Clark’s mind, the enemy of civilisation was fear—fear of war, of the supernatural, anything that would make it not seem worthwhile to plant or build or create. The resultant loss of creative energy rendered societies vulnerable to barbarism. Lord Clark really sticks it to the barbarians. Every time he says the word you can sense a liberal wincing. A high-class “Civilisation” drinking game would involve a sip of sherry anytime Clark says “confidence” or “barbarism.”
“The Skin of Our Teeth” serves as a bold opening statement, with Western civilisation barely surviving the (yes) barbarian destruction of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, ushering in what is known commonly as the Dark Ages. The unsettled scene moves to the rugged shores of Iona, an island on the western coast of Scotland, which became the center of Celtic Christianity for four centuries. There, monks and produced illuminated manuscripts, perhaps including the Book of Kells, and, Clark argues, preserved civilisation.
In succeeding parts, Clark chronicles Charlemagne, Gothic architecture, Dante, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo DaVinci, Bach, Rousseau, Wordsworth, Napoleon, and the Impressionists (whew!) among many, many other people, places, and things.
In “Grandeur & Obedience,” Clark celebrates The Vatican as the first great instance of town planning. In fact, Western civilisation was basically the creation of the church, he claims, an institution he admires in a once-removed, clear-eyed way, seeing it as a necessary and force while acknowledging the imperfect, sometimes brutal people who composed the clergy (Clark would enter the church on his deathbed 14 years later).
Among the bits of wry humor scattered throughout “Civilisation” are anecdotes like one demonstrating the insatiable curiosity of Leonardo da Vinci, who, upon discovering a centenarian in a hospital in Florence, “waited gleefully for his demise so he could examine his veins.” Describing Viking gravestones carved with both Christian symbols and those of the Norse god Wotan, Clark cracks, “What’s called hedging your bets.”
Liberal unease with Clark’s patrician style and enthusiastic celebration of (mostly) white men of genius (and perhaps his crack about the “moral and intellectual failure of Marxism”) was evident in the BBC’s 2018 sequel of sorts, “Civilisations,” with the extra “s” signifying woke pluralism. One of the three presenters of “Civilisations” was classicist Mary Beard, who admitted she was uncomfortable with Clark’s “great man approach to art history — one d-mn genius after the next” while reviewing James Stourton’s biography of Clark for (naturally) the left-wing newspaper The Guardian .
Yet the sequel, a kind of corrective, was also an acknowledgment of the enduring power of Clark’s accomplishment. A half-century later, it holds up. If the lingering closeups of art and architecture aren’t quite as fascinating now, blame it on the Internet and 50 years of color television. Clark’s delivery cannot go out of style, because it was never in.
Near the end of the series (which is hosted on YouTube), Clark laid out his own positive philosophical tenets: “I believe that order is better than chaos, creation better than destruction… and I am sure human sympathy is more valuable than ideology.” Points that clearly need rehearing, a half-century on."
Wokesters Go After Democrat Cartoonist For Objecting To Abortion,thefederalist.com,Libby Emmons,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/wokesters-go-democrat-cartoonist-objecting-abortion/,"By Libby Emmons April 19, 2019
Cartoonist Nathan Pyle is pro-life, so if you’re not, don’t laugh at any of his cartoons, and seriously, do not share them. That’s the new rule according to social media mobs, and if you don’t like it, you probably shouldn’t tell anybody.
Pyle is the creator of the cartoon Strange Planet , and his Instagram has nearly 2 million followers. The cartoons feature cute little aliens finding futility in the basics of human life, but it took this Nylon article bashing his personal ethos about the sanctity of life for me to hear about the guy and follow his account, giving him approximately 2 million viewers and one.
“When looking at Pyle’s personal Instagram, though,” writes Casey Miller for Nylon, “it’s clear that we shouldn’t have been surprised that he has such conservative views. The first line in his bio is ‘I follow Jesus,’ which should clue you in about his religious leanings.” That Jesus is always steering people wrong, I guess. Sanctity of life, promotion of love and kindness, a vow of poverty, dedication to the downtrodden, tending to the needy—I mean, where will it end?
The other night a friend and I were heading downtown from midtown, a glorious walk in the wonderland of New York City, and she was telling me about a book she liked. She hesitated, unsure if she should continue. The book, it turns out, was written by a conservative. He wasn’t just a conservative, but a conservative who had given money to a PAC that used that money to advocate for conservative viewpoints. “I don’t care about that,” I said, because I don’t care about an author’s perspective, I only care if the work is good.
This kind of boycott, not of a company with bad practices or a poorly behaving country, but of an individual whose work is not enjoyed because the viewer disagrees with his personal political perspectives, is something relatively new. It’s like an individual blacklist, where a consumer of entertainments will only indulge in works by creators who espouse similar political views.
Pyle’s old tweets were dug up, and people found out that yes, he really is opposed to abortion. For people like Pyle, who have adoptees in their life, the concept of abortion can be a difficult one. Mothers who carry their babies to term then give them up after birth have done a great service for those of us who love people who were adopted, and landed like blessings in our lives. Many families would not be made were it not for these mothers who undertake what must be an excruciating but loving task.
Pyle got wind of this call for boycotts of his work, and he probably felt like his career was being threatened, because it was. That’s got to be a scary thing, because once the mob gets hold of you, there’s no telling where they’ll drop you. He responded with his own post on the matter.
“My wife Taylor and I have private beliefs as they pertain to our Christian faith. We also believe separation of church and state is crucial to our nation flourishing. Our votes go toward the Democratic Party. Additionally we are troubled by what the Republican Party has become and do not want to be associated with it,” Pyle posted on @nathanwpylestrangeplanet on April 9.
This semi-refusal to stand up for his views, and asking for people to understand that his views are private, definitely has the smack of fear about it. The mob could turn so easily on this cartoonist. He disavows the Republicans but not the pro-life view; he advocates for the Democrats, despite their pro-abortion view. Is it a capitulation? Are his views not that strong? Does he not know there are basically no national Democratic politicians who are pro-life? Does he merely want to keep his career intact?
Why did he feel the need to counter the article at all? His work is not political in nature, and his views are personal and apparently haven’t even affected his political choices. There was no need to combat Nylon’s attempted take-down. His best approach would have been to either ignore it, or make a cute little alien cartoon about it. Maybe something like “Alien 1: These humans don’t like it when you suggest they not kill their babies. Alien 2: They don’t even like it when you don’t suggest it.”
This “out the cartoonist” also seems like a gratuitous hot take about a guy who is publicly apolitical, and simply writes cartoons about cute little aliens. It’s not like Pyle was out there mucking it up in the fray with the rest of the outspoken on social media. He was making cartoons, believing in Jesus, voting Democratic, and holding quietly pro-life views. Why drag him into the Twittersphere? Can’t a guy just live his life?
The new personal boycott thing has got people scared. I’ve spoken with conservatives on the same private Facebook groups I am, and they never speak out or voice an opinion for fear they’ll be maligned and blocked en masse simply for their political views. Once the contrary views are exposed, the labels start flying, and perfectly reasonable people who disagree go from perfectly reasonable to being called bigoted simply for having, for example, Christian views.
Agreeing with the political views of an artist whose art you like doesn’t make the art better, especially since in most cases the work doesn’t even reference politics in any way. Do we think that by personally boycotting an artist, or siccing mobs on him, we’ll get that artist to change his views? Are we trying to punish him for holding perspectives we don’t agree with? Are we doing anything other than virtue signaling to other people who hold our views? Or letting people know that we’re so dedicated to our political perspective that we refuse to read cute little alien comics on Instagram?
These are only the rules if we capitulate to them. But we can also decide to like cute little alien comics, and just have a laugh. The guy is not out there killing abortion doctors, or nominating pro-life activist judges; he’s just a guy who writes comics. If you don’t like it, write your own comics.

Inside The Life And Christianity Of Legendary Sci-Fi Author Gene Wolfe,thefederalist.com,Tony Daniel,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/inside-life-christianity-legendary-sci-fi-author-gene-wolfe/,"By Tony Daniel April 19, 2019
Science fiction writer Gene Wolfe died on April 14 at the age of 87. Even though I consider it one the greatest science fiction novels ever written, I taught Wolfe’s The Shadow of the Torturer (1980) for only one term, back when I was teaching my Introduction to the Literature of Fantasy and Science Fiction class. Like The Sound and the Fury and Swann’s Way, both of which it resembles in ways, it’s a hard book to teach to a general undergraduate class. And Shadow is one of the most accessible of Wolfe’s novels.
There is also Peace (1975) , his amazing novel told from the point of view of a ghost. There’s the beautiful and strange A Soldier of the Mist (1986), the scroll journal of a Greek warrior with a brain injury that makes him unable to turn short-term recollections into long-term memories. This was written long before the movie Memento came out, by the way. The soldier has to re-read the journal every day. Yet it gets longer and longer.
Plus, his condition causes him to be peculiarly open to the Greek gods that surround him in a very physical way, and to be able to interact with them. He is Martin Heidegger’s man of pure being who existed before the advent of Western philosophy and our subsequent breakdown into bicameral mindsets that Heidegger and Julian Jaynes posit occurred after Aristotle and his damnable categories.
Wolfe was Catholic, and his writing is deeply affected by his faith. He was a convert greatly influenced, possibly even converted, by reading G.K. Chesterton. But he was a Catholic convert as an artist, as well—or perhaps his mind gravitated to where his imagination already dwelled.
Wolfe’s imaginative output teems with Catholic and early Christian symbolism. He called himself a writer who happened to be Catholic, but Catholic archetypes are baked into his stories and books at a deep and subtle level, like a cook’s signature spice you never notice until you do, then you can’t help but tasting in everything.
Wolfe was a veteran of the Korean War. He returned shell-shocked, ready to dive under a table at any loud noise, and exhibited other signs of PTSD. He credits his wife, Rosemary, whom he married soon after his return, with saving him and bringing him back to life.
Wolfe began a tradition of writing a sonnet to Rosemary each year on their anniversary. These were later collected and are very good, very precise in the way of an engineer with a poet’s soul, which is yet another facet of Wolfe’s work. What if possibly the greatest writer of science fiction was also the man who designed the machine that makes Pringles potato chips? Well, he was a key member of the team that invented Pringles.
Wolfe used the G.I. Bill to attend the University of Houston and became an engineer at Proctor and Gamble, where he worked on the development of Pringles. Eventually, he settled into a career as an editor at the trade magazine Plant Engineering, and began writing science fiction in earnest.
Wolfe was a student in the famous Clarion Writers Workshop put on by science fiction writer and editor Damon Knight and his wife, writer Kate Wilhelm. Through Knight and the Clarion Workshop, he was introduced to science fiction fandom and conventions, and, especially after he became a professional writer, he was a convention habitué. In fact, Wolfe claims that he wrote The Shadow of the Torturer in part to provide a distinctly dressed character whom fans would dress up as in masquerades. He certainly did that with Severian.
Wolfe was a political conservative and staunch anti-totalitarian—very much an anti-communist during the Cold War. He never let this get in the way of his friendships, however, which stretched across writers and readers of all political stripes. The books he produced in the 1970s, such as mainstream magic realist novel Peace and the science fiction novella “ The Fifth Head of Cerberus ,” (1972) are tours de force, and with a string of great short stories established him as a writer’s writer. Utterly Evocative
Of course, my teenage self didn’t know any of this when I first encountered The Shadow of the Torturer at Gateway Books in Quintard Mall of Anniston, Alabama one summer in 1980. It had a wonderful cover by none other than the legendary Don Maitz (multiple winner of the Chesley Award , and the artist of the original Captain illustrations for Captain Morgan’s Rum, among many other works. Maitz has been the cover artist of several books I’ve edited at my day job, by the way).
The Maitz cover is a picture of a dude standing on some kind of dais or balcony. His face is covered by a strange, black mask, and he’s holding a peculiarly inscribed sword without a pointy tip. He’s wearing a swirling cape that seems somehow blacker than black in color. For a 16-year-old in 1980, it was utterly evocative.
This is Severian. He’s a junior torturer for a government-appointed guild about to graduate from apprentice to journeyman when we first meet him. Severian claims to have a photographic memory, and the four books of the Book of the New Sun series (it’s science fiction; there is always a series, if possible) are told in first person from his viewpoint, which we come to see is quite unreliable at times. This is the guy Wolfe wanted the fans to dress up like (and throughout the 80s, some did).
I don’t know what I was prepared for when I bought the book. Maybe for something like Stephen R. Donaldson’s Thomas Covenant series, which I was heavily into at the time and I find kind of funny in its earnestness now. What I got was utterly different from anything I’d ever read before (and by the age of 16, I’d read quite a lot).
First of all, although it had a plot, there wasn’t much of one. Severian is in charge of the upkeep of a noblewoman who is being tortured in the vast guild chambers, which, we find much later, are actually the vast halls of an immense, dormant space ship as big as a city. It was a peripatetic novel, with Severian on a coming-of-age journey away from the Citadel through the urban sprawl that has been built around it for miles and miles.
Severian falls in love with the young torture victim and, in an act he knows will end his time with the guild, exhibits mercy and helps her to kill herself. He is indeed terminated for this, in a manner of speaking, but he’s still bound to the guild, so his torturer’s license is revoked and he is assigned to be a lowly executioner in one of the city’s distant suburbs.
Away Severian goes, into a libertarian paradise and inferno of archetypes where baroque beauty blooms in all the cracks, and caveat emptor reigns to the nth degree. People and things in the city are not only out to use you and take everything you’re worth, they are sometimes trying (and quite able) to literally eat your soul and torture you for thousands of years.
While this may seem a fantasy world, it is not. It is actually a far, far future world of science fiction. It’s probably set on Earth—the planet is called “Urth” in the books—where the sun is sputtering and dying, and humanity has entered into a long, baroque decadence and mostly forgotten its ancient roots (you would too after a billion years or so).
It’s a world heavily influenced by Jack Vance’s Dying Earth stories, but less pure Vance and more like Vance processed through Jorge Louis Borges’ Labyrinths . People duel with enormous, deadly flowers. Vast libraries contain entire ecosystems within their depths. Giants, which are possibly uplifted apes or maybe genetic splices, and dwarves, who are perhaps aliens, travel together in caravans putting on mystery plays for a socially stratified populace, and robbing people blind behind their backs.
The world has a medieval feel, but we are not certain any of these characters are truly human in the first place, including Severian. It may even be a world entirely recreated eons in the future by a race who have discovered the smoking remains and archetypical artistic output of vanished humanity and sought to revivify it. The general lack of futuristic devices and weapons (although some show up at times) stems from the overall lack of energy and vital order in this exhausted far, far, far future.
There are secret societies putting deadly conspiracies afoot, guilds galore, strange gods who might be aliens or genetically transformed humans, gnostic cults of all sorts. Any world-building weirdness you encounter in “Game of Thrones” has an even weirder counterpart in Shadow of the Torturer. George R.R. Martin would be the first to admit he was influenced by Wolfe.
The sword Severian wields, named Terminus Est , is a mercury-weighted executioner’s blade made for beheadings, but Severian uses it at times as a fighting weapon. As the book continues, we slowly realize that Severian is groping his way toward a destiny—or rather that destiny, which is as palpable a force as Wolfe’s Catholic sense of fate and the unerring, unbending will of God can make it, is moving toward him. It’s bound to swallow him up like a wave swallows a surfer—that is, unless he can find a way to scramble into balance on his board. He acquires a gem-like item that heals him and is slowly remaking him into something beyond human.
This allows him to survive a poison flower “bite” that ought to have killed him. He pulls a dead girl from a swamp and is able to revive her, although her memory of the past is as faulty as his is certain. After Severian performs both a ritualized execution and plays the part of an executioner in a mystery play with shades of Scaramouche from Punch and Judy shows, the two escape an angry crowd and go forward together into an uncertain future that includes, we understand by the end, Severian eventually becoming the savior and ruler of this world, the next Autarch who will rule from the Citadel.
What’s going on here is a darker, but still very Christian, version of Pilgrim’s Progress . Severian is an even more fallible Christian, if a Christian were a journeyman torturer on the way to heaven (or, in this case, actual outer space by the end of the series. And yes, the giant rocket ship everyone thinks is a palace does figure in this). He is also Christlike, with the ability to raise himself and others from death or near death, including his eventual traveling companion and future girlfriend.
Wolfe says of his main character: “He is a man who has been born into a very perverse background, who is gradually trying to become better. I think that all of us have somewhere in us an instinct to try and become better. Some of us defeat it thoroughly. We kill that part of ourselves, just as we kill the child in ourselves. It is very closely related to the child in us.” ‘The Best Science Fiction Writer of Them All’
I didn’t know what it was I was reading: science fiction? High fantasy? Some kind of unknown genre that was yet to be invented? All I knew was that I couldn’t put The Shadow of the Torturer down that summer. A lot of other young science fiction readers who later became writers and editors have felt the same way over the years.
It seemed to me (and still does) that this creation of Wolfe’s is what the far future might really be like. Or rather it is what the far future might feel like if you were transported there with no preparation and told to fend for yourself. Strange, deadly dangerous, almost unfathomable—yet somehow also still shaped by basic universal morality. Also, it’s a place where a guy could become a hero—albeit, in this case, a hero with the rather telling flaw of also being an executioner for a callous dictator who seems not to give a whit about any of his subjects.
Wolfe throws in all sorts of archaic and almost-words, such as “chrism,” “avern,” “mensal” and “nidorous,” plus the color of Severian’s blacker-than-black cloak: “fuligin,” a word for which I searched every dictionary I could get my hands on in those pre-internet days, and never found. Wolfe’s other big influences are undoubtedly William Faulkner and Marcel Proust. There is the same baroque richness, decadence, and underlying Christian imagination to Faulkner’s work.
Plus, like Faulkner, Wolfe loves an unreliable narrator. As for Proust, Wolfe’s great theme throughout his work is how memory of events and built-in human symbols (Wolfe would probably say they were put there by God) combine to create a meaningful present reality, how the remembrance of things past makes today into a thing at all.
Another aspect of Wolfe’s long career was his writing about writing. This can be found in his nonfiction The Castle of the Otter (1982) and elsewhere. He didn’t do this a lot, but every word of what he did say is invaluable—and I’ve included it in every writing class I’ve taught.
My favorite Wolfean admonition is his peculiarly medieval method for getting over writer’s block. Wolfe suggests imprisoning your muse in a blank room, as it were, and cutting her off from all muse food including books, television, movies, walks in nature—whatever feeds the soul—until she gives you something. Presumably, this would include all of social media, Netflix, YouTube, podcasts, and the rest, these days. He excuses this rough treatment by reminding us that our subconscious, muse, or whatever you want to call it, is just us in the end, and we are not actually torturing anyone other than ourselves when we do this.
In the past couple of decades, Wolfe’s reputation has declined. His output waned as he spent many years caring for his wife Rosemary as she coped with Alzheimer’s disease. She died in late 2013. Even though he sought to mitigate the dense, allusive prose of his work in the 1970s with Shadow, it is still a book that’s difficult for some to get into. It might help to be 16, in desperate love with an unattainable object of desire, and still believe you might turn out to be the Emperor of Earth before you’re done.
I’m quite sure that Wolfe’s reputation will recover and grow in the coming years. He’s as good as the best we’ve had in American letters, and, though there are many great contenders, he’s my pick for the best science fiction writer of them all.

Five anonymous parents recently filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn Supreme Court against the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and its commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot. At issue is an emergency order making measles vaccinations mandatory, which opponents claim violates their religious beliefs.
Clearly, this is a highly sensitive issue, especially since the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn has been hit quite hard by this latest measles outbreak. Across New York City, just shy of 300 cases have been reported, many of those in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. However, based on prior case law, the Brooklyn Supreme Court has compelling reason should it rule against the parents in this case.
In essence, the suit touches on the difficult question of when personal religious beliefs are outweighed by public safety concerns. According to the New York Post :
Mayor de Blasio on Tuesday declared a public health emergency over an outbreak of measles in Williamsburg and ordered mandatory vaccinations in the Brooklyn neighborhood under the threat of $1,000 fines — and even the possibility of forcible injections .
The unprecedented move, which covers more than 212,000 people living in an area covered by four ZIP codes, followed the diagnoses of 285 cases of measles in the city — mostly in Williamsburg — since October.
Under the order signed by Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, everyone who lives, works or attends school within the 11205, 11206, 11211 and 11249 ZIP codes and isn’t already immune to measles must be vaccinated within 48 hours.
Parents are responsible for getting their children vaccinated, and the only exception is for people who can prove they ‘should be medically exempt.’
Health Department inspectors will also visit Jewish religious schools to make sure that yeshiva students who haven’t been vaccinated ‘are being appropriately excluded [from school] under this order,’ Deputy Mayor of Health and Human Services Herminia Palacio said.
According to the Post , opponents to this order allege that the measles outbreak isn’t serious enough for the quick 48-hour vaccination requirement, since no deaths have been reported in the outbreak. They also allege that they are being forced to vaccinate for rubella and mumps, which they claim is risky, and that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine carries risks for children under 12 months of age and young women who may become pregnant.
The lawsuit claims that “the respondents’ emergency orders unnecessarily override the petitioners’ and their children’s religious practices and the children’s lawful exemptions from vaccination to attend school, which they have obtained in full compliance with Public Health.”
This is a very difficult issue, as it pits the right to individual autonomy, informed consent, and the free exercise of religion against the city’s need to protect the public. However, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s order appears to be somewhat well-supported from a legal perspective.
In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), the United States Supreme Court considered the issue of mandatory vaccinations with regard to a smallpox outbreak. In discussing the Jacobson case, the AMA Journal of Ethics explained:
There the Court ruled that the police power of a state absolutely included reasonable regulations established by legislature to protect public health and safety. Such regulations do not violate the 14th Amendment right to liberty because they fall within the many restraints to which every person is necessarily subjected for the common good. Real liberty for all cannot exist if each individual is allowed to act without regard to the injury that his or her actions might cause others; liberty is constrained by law. The Court went on to determine in Jacobson that a state may require vaccination if the board of health deems it necessary for public health or safety.
While people have varying opinions about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, the question is whether such concerns and the decision not to vaccinate should outweigh the potential public health risks. The answer to this question, based on Jacobson , appears to be no. A subsequent question is whether the decision not to vaccinate based on deeply held religious beliefs should be protected when there is a risk or threat to the public.
Interestingly, as noted by Stat News , Jacobson did not involve a religious exemption from vaccination. In other words, the argument against mandatory vaccination revolved around the harmful effects of the smallpox shot on the plaintiff and his son. It had nothing to do with Jacobson’s religious beliefs.
According to Stat News, citing Wendy Parmet, a professor of public health law at Northeastern University, “multiple cases over the years have, if indirectly, created the impression that the Constitution does not enshrine the right to object to vaccination on religious grounds. It’s pretty clear there is no constitutional right to a religious exemption.” Moreover, according to The Jewish Star , some rabbis have opined that there are no legitimate religious grounds to oppose vaccination. There are, however, clear religious grounds to make vaccination of kids obligatory.
Undoubtedly, this case will slowly work its way through the court system. Of course, by the time it reaches the end of the road from a legal standpoint, the outbreak could be over. Regardless, it will be interesting to see how the courts handle this difficult and very delicate legal issue. Elad Hakim is a writer and a practicing attorney.

Revisiting ‘See No Evil’ From ‘Batman: The Animated Series’,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/19/revisiting-see-no-evil-batman-animated-series/,"April 19, 2019
Spoilers ahead .
“See No Evil” is the first episode in which a villain created for the series works well. Perhaps the creative team learned from reimagining Mr. Freeze for “ Heart of Ice ” that the key is motivation. In this episode, Lloyd Ventrix is an ex-con, but his new crimes are driven by a desire to reunite his family.
His behavior is a very recognizable sort of domestic criminality, though strong stuff for a show primarily targeted at children. The difference is Lloyd coming into possession of a suit which renders him invisible. The suit also affects Lloyd’s mind, though there may be a chicken/egg issue here.
The script by comics veteran Martin Pasko thus pays homage to H.G. Wells’“The Invisible Man” (1897), James Whale’s famous 1933 film adaptation, and even Paul Verhoeven’s “Hollow Man” (2000). These works also employ the trope of the mad scientist, whereas Ventrix steals his means of invisibility (perhaps influencing the character of Rodney Skinner in the film version of “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” from 2003). There is even a tangential discussion in “Shazam!” (2019) of whether invisibility is an inherently dark super-power.
The script is well-served by director Dan Riba and the voice talent behind the Ventrix family. Lloyd is voiced by Michael Gross, whose performance spans the warm father from “Family Ties” in the ’80s, the dishonest husband who landed in prison trying to recover his old life, and the increasingly deranged sociopath fueled by invisibility. His young daughter Kimmy is voiced by Elisabeth Moss, who would go on to “The West Wing,”“Mad Men,” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Lloyd’s ex-wife Helen is voiced by Jean Smart of “Garden State,”“24,”“Designing Women,” and The X-Men spinoff “Legion” (among many others). She brings a weary anger to her estrangement from Lloyd which grounds the narrative in reality.
The Dong Yang studio’s animation is also in the series’ top tier. Depicting an invisible man—and an invisible car—presents challenges in any medium, let alone a cartoon. Beyond these flashier moments, the detailed highlighting and shadowing of the characters brings artistry to what could be seen as a “small” Batman story. The Plot
Our drama opens in a downscale Gotham suburb. Kimmy talks to her “imaginary” friend Mojo, who is holding her doll in midair. Mojo gives Kimmy a locket and promises to bring her the pearl necklace she wants on his next visit. Kimmy tells Mojo she and her mother are moving soon for a better life, causing Mojo to drop the doll as his voice grows pained.
Helen opens the bedroom door to check on her daughter and chuckles upon learning Kimmy is talking to her imaginary friend. (The simultaneously innocent and creepy tones of this scene are enhanced by Shirley Walker’s score, though the reprise of Kimmy’s theme during a later action scene is slightly distracting.)
Kimmy’s imaginary friend is really her father Lloyd, who goes to the Gotham Jewelry Expo the next day. While Bruce Wayne considers buying a watch, Lloyd locks himself in a bathroom and dons a grey plastic suit which turns him invisible by pressing a button on his wristwatch. Lloyd then loots the jewelry vendors as stunned bystanders see valuables disappearing into thin air.
Batman pursues the invisible thief, who knocks down a guard and bursts through the exposition hall’s doors to a construction zone outside. Lloyd’s footsteps are revealed by wet cement. Batman uses a smoke bomb and a can of paint to locate and mark him. Lloyd uses the watch to re-energize his suit and burn off the paint. Lloyd then delivers a beating to the Dark Knight, leaving our hero collapsed in the wet cement.
The following day, Lloyd approaches Helen during her lunch at Goth-Mart. The dapper ex-con tries to convince Helen he is doing well on parole, while she reminds him she has a restraining order issued against him. He pleads to visit Kimmy, but Helen wishes he would disappear. As Helen storms out of Goth-Mart, Lloyd muses to himself that she should be careful what she wishes for. Batman’s Journey
Meanwhile, Bruce visits WayneTech’s optics lab to investigate an invisibility project he heard about the prior year. Lucius Fox (Brock Peters of “To Kill a Mockingbird,”“Soylent Green,” and “Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home”) says the company was interested in working with a Dr. Karos, who withdrew his proposal before they could accept. Although Karos died a few months ago, his assistant Dr. Giddell still lives.
Batman breaks into Giddell’s lab to read files on the invisibility project and is briefly disabled when Giddell topples a bookcase on him. (This episode finds Batman repeatedly bested by people of normal strength.)
The Caped Crusader frees himself and questions Giddell, who claims the security guard will provide an alibi regarding the jewel heist. Batman notices a roll of plastic, prompting Giddell to explain that running electricity through filaments in the plastic bends light around the material, but also makes the plastic toxic—a problem Karos and Giddell could not solve. When Batman asks who else knew about the plastic, Giddell mentions Lloyd worked as the lab’s errand boy.
Batman warns Helen about Lloyd, while Lloyd invisibly kidnaps Kimmy by using the pearl necklace as a lure. At an abandoned drive-in theater, Lloyd tries to persuade Kimmy to get into his car, even revealing his disembodied head. Kimmy refuses, remembering her mother’s warnings about her father. This suspenseful scene benefits from its setting, a metaphor for the decline of the nuclear family and dissolution of the Ventrix family.
Batman, having discovered Kimmy was missing within minutes of the abduction, intervenes at the drive-in. Lloyd’s visble head allows Batman to floor him with a kick while Kimmy flees the scene.
Lloyd enters his car, which is covered in the special plastic and turns invisible upon starting. Lloyd tries to run down Batman in the drive-in lot. Batman jumps on the car’s roof, clinging desperately as Lloyd drives recklessly through Gotham traffic, removing part of the plastic and rendering the car partially visible. Lloyd ultimately crashes the car by driving off elevated train tracks. He delivers another beating to Batman, dismissing the masked detective’s warnings about the plastic.
Batman throws ninja Bat-stars at an old water tower in the rail yard, causing streams of water to reveal Lloyd’s location. The Caped Crusader takes full advantage to knock Lloyd unconscious.
A few nights later, Helen checks in on Kimmy, who says she was talking to Batman. Helen again dismisses this as an imaginary conversation as Batman makes his way from the Ventrix home. Aside from Helen’s odd disbelief, this final scene reminds us again of Batman’s concern for children. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois."
CNN Shows Zero Interest In Probing Conventional Wisdom On Watergate,thefederalist.com,Geoff Shepard,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/cnn-shows-zero-interest-questioning-conventional-wisdom-watergate/,"By Geoff Shepard April 22, 2019
CNN completed its four-part series on President Nixon last Sunday evening with a panel discussion between John Dean, Richard Ben-Veniste, Carl Bernstein, and Tim Naftali, led by Anderson Cooper. Last month, one of their producers had reached out to me, seeking someone to participate who would represent Nixon’s point of view.
The producer and I discussed the 39 documentaries, co-sponsored by the National Archives, that I’d helped to produce since 2010 on President Nixon’s various public policy initiatives, as well as my extensive research, writing, books, and lectures on the inside story of the Watergate scandal, where I served as deputy counsel during the last 10 months of the Nixon administration.
The producer assured me that CNN was committed to presenting a balanced view, but she never even called back, and I think I know why: I would have presented a dramatically different and disruptive point of view from the other pre-packaged panelists.
For example, I would have asked Dean, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 1-4 years in prison and disbarred from practicing law for his key role in the Watergate cover-up, why he was freed immediately after the cover-up trial (where he’d been the prosecutor’s lead witness) and had never actually spent a single night in jail.
While seldom mentioned, Dean’s leadership role in the cover-up included, in addition to obstruction of justice, rehearsing Jeb Magruder in advance of his perjured testimony in two grand jury appearances, embezzling some $4,000 of campaign funds from his office safe to pay for his honeymoon, destroying key evidence taken from Howard Hunt’s office safe, and improperly disclosing investigatory information to Watergate defense counsel.
I would have asked Richard Ben-Veniste, deputy of the special prosecutor’s Watergate Task Force and one of the lead prosecutors in the cover-up trial, just what was discussed in the secret meeting he attended between the four top prosecutors and trial judges John Sirica and Gerhard Gesell on December 14, 1973—just days after Sirica had turned over key White House tapes to the prosecutors.
I also would have asked how Ben-Veniste appears to have secretly assured Watergate grand jurors, as well as House Judiciary Committee staff, that President Nixon had personally authorized the blackmail payment to Howard Hunt, when he failed to prove that allegation in the later cover-up trial.
Finally, I would have asked just how he could have claimed, when the cover-up verdicts were announced, that “justice was done” when he knew of the whole series of secret meetings prosecutors had held with Judge Sirica, of prosecutors’ failure to share exculpatory information that would have seriously undercut the veracity of their two lead witnesses, and their highly improper indictment of Charles Colson (a prominent Republican) on the flimsiest of evidence, especially when coupled with their decision not to indict Hunt’s lawyer, William Bittman, who was far more culpable.
I would have asked Carl Bernstein, who admitted in 2012 that he and Bob Woodward had lied about not having interviewed Watergate grand jurors and had misrepresented their stories in “All the President’s Men” as having been sourced from interviews with re-election committee secretaries. I would have asked how he could have claimed after the Watergate convictions that “the system worked, the American system worked,” when Watergate trial judges met in secret with prosecutors and other interested parties on at least a dozen occasions.
A specially recruited, 100-person team of highly partisan officials, whose top 17 lawyers all had served in the Kennedy/Johnson Department of Justice, postponed any Watergate indictments while they launched investigations into every aspect of the Nixon presidency, sent IRS and FBI agents to interview some 150 GOP donors to the 1970 midterm elections, and investigated (and leaked the results from) each and every potential GOP candidate for the 1976 presidential election, including Jerry Ford, Nelson Rockefeller, Bob Dole, and even Ronald Reagan—none of whom had even the remotest connection with the Watergate scandal.
I would have asked Tim Naftali, the disgraced archivist who was the first director of the Nixon Library, just how it was that he produced a hugely one-sided Watergate exhibit, without even the merest mention of any of the above improprieties, when I had brought them to his personal attention in our many meetings over the prior year.
No, CNN had good reason not to include me on this panel: I would have brought up many, many issues and incidents that would challenge conventional wisdom about Watergate. Geoff Shepard joined Nixon’s White House staff as a fellow in 1969, upon graduation from Harvard Law School. He stayed for five years as a member of the Domestic Council and also served as deputy counsel during Nixon’s Watergate defense."
"No, Men Don’t Need Cuddle Parties To ‘Fix’ Their Masculinity",thefederalist.com,Libby Emmons,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/no-men-dont-need-cuddle-parties-fix-masculinity/,"By Libby Emmons April 22, 2019
Rage against traditional masculinity has been swift and fierce over the past half decade. From the proliferation of privilege theory that casts men as the top perpetrators on the power food chain, to hashtag movements like #MeToo and “the future is female” branding, to claims of toxicity, masculinity has taken quite a beating.
Men’s rights activists and organizations are derided and laughed at, while the women and men who take up the helm are critiqued for what is perceived as their reactionary views. When men jump on board with practices that are traditionally feminine, they are lauded, applauded, and signal boosted. Enter the male-only cuddle party, the men, and the psychologists who love them. Yes, People Do Need Touch
Chick flicks, sitcoms, and jokes about post-coital practices would have us believe that cuddling is entirely the purview of women, but we know for sure that human beings need to be touched, meaning men, too. It’s a basic human need. For those in solitary confinement, or the elderly, the hunger is more pronounced, and the lack of touch debilitating. For men without partners, spouses, or sexual contact, a demographic a recent Washington Post article revealed is on the rise, this lack of human contact can contribute to feelings of isolation.
Perhaps that’s why an educator at Pennsylvania’s Lehigh University recently jumped into the fully clothed cuddle pile in support of the local Men’s Therapeutic Cuddle Group in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. Dr. Christopher Liang, who teaches a gender, race, inclusion, and trauma lab at Lehigh, believes that men’s cuddle groups can redefine masculinity. This statement is predicated on the assumption that masculinity itself is problematic, and needs redefinition.
Cuddle parties have been a mainstay of the intimacy industry for years, making waves and rolling eyes from Silicon Valley to Brooklyn. Touted by Cuddle Party as “a playful social event designed for adults to explore communication, boundaries and affection,” a cuddle party is decidedly non-sexual, and rooted in the idea that human beings crave to touch and be touched. But is touch so far from the realm of masculinity that for men to engage in it is to redefine the term?
Liang was one of the creators of the American Psychological Association’s first-ever “Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Boys and Men.” In a release from Lehigh, he advocated for the Men’s Therapeutic Cuddle Group as something that “can do a whole lot of good” for men. If what he means by “a whole lot of good” is based in the concept of masculinity that is elucidated in the guidelines , then “good” is the opposite of what’s being put forward. Which Parts of Masculinity Should Be Scrapped?
Noted psychologist Jordan Peterson, of “12 Rules for Life” fame, assessed these guidelines for us laypeople, and concluded that “the authors are claiming that men who socialize their boys in a traditional manner destroy their mental health.” He goes on to say “that men who encourage their boys to be ‘self-reliant, strong and manage their problems on their own’ destroy the mental health of their children” and “produce adults who are a primary menace to their families and society.”
Is that what Liang means when he talks about redefining masculinity? Does he want to deconstruct masculinity to the point where it is not commonplace to teach boys to be ”self-reliant, strong and manage their problems on their own”? Even men who cuddle need to know how to get stuff done; they can’t stay all day in the cuddle pile. Men need to be able to address threats, they can’t be constantly vulnerable, because that vulnerability can harm their ability to compete in the world.
Unlike Cuddle Party, which is designated as a charitable organization by the IRS and has upcoming parties in Australia, Ireland, California, New York, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Washington, the Men’s Therapeutic Cuddle Group is an amateur affair. It was founded a few years ago as a means to help men cope with stress, trauma, and the desire to express a masculinity that was not inherently toxic. A co-founder of the group, interior designer Scott Turner, was quoted as saying, “So often, we’re taught that to be an emotional stoic is the mark of manhood. If you show any emotional weakness or vulnerability, that’s a failure to your title of a man.”
Femininity and masculinity have come under fire all over the place in recent years. Femininity in females is either considered a weakness or is cause to objectify them, while masculinity in men is perceived as harmful or toxic. Through it all, men are getting the message that there’s something wrong with being traditionally masculine, but there isn’t. Men are being asked to step aside, make room, and take stock of those attitudes they have that have contributed to othering and objectifying, and to cede power and influence to, well, not men. Vulnerability and Masculinity
It’s a mixed message, however, because while men are being asked to be less traditionally masculine, they are still held to the standards of that masculinity. The cuddle group is an opportunity for men to explore their emotional side with platonic affection, and for the men in the group, this seems to be a valuable undertaking. Men in the group use the new form of closeness as a means to deal with past trauma, learning to be vulnerable, and finding the language to ask consent. The problem is in assuming that being masculine means entirely hiding vulnerability, whereas masculinity contains within it the burden of taking existential risks.
My grandmother read parenting books during her time mothering four young children in the 1950s. The books told her to keep her children at a distance, not to hold them or cuddle them. She did as the books dictated, until she couldn’t anymore. She scooped up her children, cuddling them, holding them, covering them with kisses. She said it made her feel like a bad mother to disobey the book, physically showing love to her children.
The problem isn’t that culture tells men vulnerability isn’t masculine enough, or that standards of affection need be at arm’s length. The problem is that we negate, at every turn, what it means to be human, and to love. Touch is not anti-masculine; it never was. Masculinity doesn’t need to be redefined, nor does femininity.
These are valiant forces in culture that are viable expressions, with usefulness, and weight. Before they are destroyed, we need to know what is proposed to replace them. If the new rubric is one in which men and women are interchangeable, with neither able to take true risk, embark upon dangerous quests, or cover each other with kisses, we won’t like the loveless world we wind up with.

"If You Really Care About The Earth, Don’t Buy Earth Day Gear From Everlane",thefederalist.com,Libby Emmons,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/really-care-earth-dont-buy-earth-day-gear-everlane/,"By Libby Emmons April 22, 2019
This year for Earth Day, do something truly revolutionary to show your support for raising awareness about climate change: buy a sweatshirt from Everlane! Everlane has teamed up with The New York Times, and the result is cotton wear. Purchasing just one of these T-shirts or sweatshirts will fund New York Times subscriptions for nine public school students in the U.S.
Emblazoned with the word “Truth,” these shirts in subtle, naturalish tones simply scream awareness. They’re the kind of T-shirts that can really make a person feel good about his contribution to reducing planetary waste, and his carbon footprint. But that’s only because the wearer has convinced themselves of that, not because the shirts actually do anything worthwhile.
Clothing retailer Everlane touts “Exceptional quality. Ethical Factories. Radical Transparency.” They have a pay what you wish program, where selected items are for the low price of pretty much whatever you want. Their website is as in-depth on their factories and employee appreciation programs as it is on their $100 cashmere collection. The gear they move looks pretty nice, and it’s even refreshing to see a company take responsibility for its human impact.
The New York Times has been vocal on the present and future effects of climate change. For all of their in-depth research and reporting, however, they don’t do much coverage of efforts to adapt to climate change. Instead, they issue dire warning and retributions, excelling in efforts to raise awareness about how humanity must stop the very progress that has generated the wealth necessary to alleviate poverty.
Times staff wrote the verbiage for the shirts: “Truth. It affects us all. What we buy. What we put on our plates. What we recycle. What we waste. How we travel. How we stay informed. What we talk about. What we know. How we understand climate change. The truth is worth it.” Of course truth is a dicey term these days, where it’s been appropriated from noun to adjective (truthy, anyone?), and everyone seems to have his own.
If Everlane really wanted to give New York Times subscriptions to dozens or even hundreds of school children, it would be substantially more sustainable to provide those subscriptions without unleashing a whole batch of new, wastable clothing upon the world. The only problem is that simply funding some news subscriptions wouldn’t do anything for their marketing, or for consumers who want people to know just how much truthiness they are on board with.
What good are clothes if they can’t show everyone how much you believe in sustainability? So what if you’re participating in an industry that contributes exponentially to the worldwide waste chain? The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the average American tosses 81 pounds of clothing are tossed each year, and that despite the potential for up to 95 percent of textiles to be recycled, 85 percent end up in landfill.
Fast fashion, decline in clothing quality, and a perpetual trend cycle contribute to the drastic increase in clothing manufacturing. The swell in cheap clothing means that it can easily be jettisoned at the end of any number of micro seasons when the stitching wears out, the color fades, or the fashion is no longer relevant.
Getting rid of clothing that no longer fits, is no longer worn, or is no longer stylish, is also part of our self-congratulatory consciousness. Just as we are encouraged by big retail to buy until our closets are glutted with unwearables, we are encouraged to throw it all out, ideally via recycling programs or in the form of charitable donations.
How many truth-labeled, altruistic, cotton T-shirts and soft terry sweatshirts made by Everlane for the benefit of The New York Times’ proliferation in public schools will end up in landfill just a few, short years from now, or even months? Will the “Truth” label, and the virtuous sound bites, still be legible when the clothes are boxed, packed on barges, and sold in textile markets in the developing world? With they feel as quippy and righteous when they land in heaps of solid waste on the tall, growing mountain of our discarded textile trends?
If Everlane and The New York Times had actually considered this joint endeavor before manufacturing the clothing, they might have come up with the even more sustainable idea of just not doing it at all, and providing student subscriptions without having to make a whole bunch of T-shirts about it. This useless undertaking is all about the visual virtue, and not about the actual goal at all, which at its best is education, and at its worst is mere marketing.

Why Abortion Never Works Onscreen Even Though Hollywood Desperately Wants It To,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/abortion-never-works-onscreen-even-though-hollywood-desperately-wants/,"By Ellie Bufkin April 22, 2019
Abortion has recently become a tremendously popular topic in movies and television. Movies like “Gosnell” and “Unplanned” attempt to show the ugly reality of the abortion industry, highlighting the dangers to the mothers, the unscrupulous practices of the clinics, and—most importantly—exposing the reality that an abortion extinguishes a human life.
These movies absolutely have an axe to grind, and their impact is undeniable. Meanwhile, much of Hollywood keeps trying to use abortion as something light and funny.
Outside of films that are specifically exposing the abortion industry, however, abortion has also found its way into the narratives of movies and shows that use it as entertainment and even fodder for jokes. Sitcoms like “Shrill,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and “GLOW” all featured characters choosing to get an abortion in the wake of an unplanned pregnancy.
In these instances, the shows’ mission is quite clear: to advance the idea that ending the life of an unborn child is a casual medical procedure. Why shouldn’t we joke about it? Abortion Portrayed as No Big Deal
According to the shows’ narratives, the women who choose to abort are modern, strong feminists. Their babies are disposable because—to them—they are just inconvenient clumps of cells that can so easily be flushed away in the name of empowerment.
Although previously considered taboo, abortion did appear as a dark plot point in many films and shows over the years. Famously, in “Dirty Dancing,” a character has an illegal abortion at a dirty clinic and becomes infected. The whole affair is ugly, deeply emotional, and certainly no means to add levity or romance to the situation.
In “High Fidelity,” a character chooses to have an abortion in an act of desperation after the failure of her relationship. Later in the movie, she bursts into tears when she is casually asked by her ex-boyfriend if she ever wanted to have children. There was nothing casual about these storylines.
It’s the recent call to celebrate abortion as a woke rite of passage from movements like #ShoutYourAbortion that has changed the entertainment landscape. Abortion on film used to be quite uncomfortable; it was meant to be. It was a way to make the audience feel intense loss with the characters. It set a tone of tragedy and peril.
However, in last week’s episode of the HBO comedy “Veep,” a character chooses to have an abortion after deciding the baby’s father was too immature to date. Taking a cue from other recent comedy arcs, the show treated the entire arc like one big punch line. The character, Amy, even refers to her unborn child as a “baby” before she ultimately chooses to end his or her life.
“Veep” is known for its quick-witted, sharp-tongued writing and has consistently claimed that no subject is off limits for jokes. Staying true to their word, the trip to the abortion clinic included a confrontation with pro-life protestors, jokes about not wanting to see an ultrasound, and telling someone on the phone that her schedule was just “scraped clean.”
In reality, most fans of Amy and her unborn child’s father, Dan, were hoping for a baby . Progressive filmmakers, showrunners, and writers may have set their sights on pushing casual abortion as a fan-favored plot choice, but they may be in store for a cold reality. Most fans want a happy ending; they want to see the baby. Hollywood’s New Favorite Plot Twist
Being pro-abortion is not new for Hollywood. Replacing a bouncing happy baby with a joke-filled trip to the abortion clinic is.
Even in a 2017 episode of the HBO show “Girls,” created by noted abortion enthusiast Lena Dunham, the main character becomes unexpectedly pregnant and ultimately decides against an abortion. Perhaps this creative choice was meant to show how her character developed and matured over the series run, but more likely, it was written this way because who wants to see a baby die on TV?
“Girls” had a smaller story in an earlier season when a lesser character has a very casual abortion, barely mentioning it to her boyfriend after she returns from the procedure. The boyfriend has an emotional outburst in a state of complete disbelief, and is never able to look at her the same way. They break up soon after. This isn’t the epilogue to abortion that abortion-is-power feminists would have you believe.
Pro-abortion people want everyone to think abortion is nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing to feel sad about. The fact is that abortion is an awful, ugly tragedy in any situation, no matter if you believe it should be legal or not.
“Awful, ugly, and tragic” aren’t exactly the adjectives that match a happy conclusion. There is also no adorable, crying baby to bring all the characters together at the end of the story. There are many examples of otherwise very liberal shows and movies choosing the pro-life plot, simply because killing babies does not make a good story.
In “Sex and the City,” Miranda becomes pregnant with no intention of keeping her baby, and viewers were led to believe that she has gone through with the abortion until the very end of the episode. In a classic tear-jerking moment, we find out that she is keeping the baby. Another character goes through the episode reliving her long-ago abortion, wondering what life would be like with her child, reflecting on a choice she cannot unmake. For a show that was all about glamorizing carefree sex, they had a decidedly unglamorous take on abortion, handled with nuance.
In “Juno,” a charming teen becomes pregnant while still attending high school, and even plans to have an abortion. However, she finds the abortion clinic so offputting, and is partially persuaded by a protester outside, that she decides to continue her pregnancy and explore adoption. Similarly, “Knocked Up” finds the humor in an unplanned pregnancy, even showing how the developing baby starts to change and soften the parents before she is even born.
The fact is that the reality of abortion simply does not match the pro-abortion belief that it is easy and casual. Creating a story where a fictional character has no feelings about her abortion does not reflect reality. Writing snarky jokes does nothing to conceal the image of a character in stirrups at an abortion clinic having a tiny life sucked out of her. No matter how much fans believe that abortion should be legal, they’ll never root for a character to not have the baby.

Why The So-Called Equality Act Is A Bait-and-Switch Power Grab,thefederalist.com,Stella Morabito,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/called-equality-act-bait-switch-power-grab/,"By Stella Morabito April 22, 2019
Let’s place ourselves, for a moment, into the mindset of a statist. If you and your cronies wanted to control everybody’s lives, how exactly would you go about getting such raw power? Obviously, you wouldn’t come right out and say you have a special project designed specifically to cement a permanent one-party state.
You wouldn’t explain, full disclosure, that the ever-growing bureaucracy you have in mind would promote a surveillance state and coercion that produces toxic levels of social distrust. You wouldn’t clarify that the point is to keep tabs on everyone in every aspect of their lives, including their education, their businesses, their medicine, their housing, their families, and their churches.
No, of course not. You would mask your self-supremacist intentions with a benign and trendy word like “equality.” You’d pretend that your project was about helping a vulnerable minority. To prevent scrutiny, you’d quickly shame anybody who had a question about it and defame them as haters. At the same time, you’d give special favors to those who can be persuaded to support your con job.
That’s usually how such things are done, as the history of authoritarian systems proves. Sowing a Colossal Inequality of Power
So we have the “ Equality” Act , recently introduced by Democrats in Congress. It’s currently being considered in various committee hearings and is on track for a floor vote in the House of Representatives later this spring or early this summer.
On the surface, the “Equality” Act is supposed to protect LGBT folks from discrimination by adding the categories of sexual orientation and gender identity to all federal civil rights laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It would make claims of discrimination related to these characteristics legally actionable in the way racism is, and aapplying to virtually every area of life: the workplace, education, banking, jury service, federal funding, housing, medicine and psychiatry, and all public facilities.
It is a power grab in the guise of anti-discrimination. A bait-and-switch. It’s another attempt by a ruling micro-clique to exert mega-control over everyone else’s lives, including those it purports to protect. It allows the Mass State to maximize bureaucracy and social engineering, especially by its huge regulation of speech and expression. It erodes individual rights while claiming to uphold them.
Sane people of goodwill have a host of good reasons to object to the so-called Equality Act. And many of those reasons have been written up, including the de-sexing of toilets and showers, the compelled speech inherent in pronoun protocols and severe punishment for “ misgendering, ” the promised harassment of business owners, the invasion of girls’ and women’s sports by biological men who force on them an unequal playing field, the utter contempt for individual conscience, and more.
The net result of this act would be a huge inequality of power accrued to the state and drained from the individual. Below I offer five general reasons to object to this legislation.
I think they give us a more macro view of how it would destabilize a free society, by 1) undermining the First Amendment; 2) threatening the rule of law; 3) nudging us towards a social credit system; 4) redefining humanity; and 5) enshrining identity politics in law. In short, the “Equality” Act doesn’t really protect anybody. It undermines human freedom and dignity by legally stripping Americans across the board of inalienable rights. 1. It Undermines Everyone’s First Amendment Rights
Our First Amendment freedoms of religion, speech, press, and association are clearly targeted by the “Equality” Act. It explicitly invalidates the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act so that anybody caught in this bill’s legal web is pre-emptively stripped of the right to express his or her conscience without loss of liberty and property.
So the mask is off. All prior promises of conscience clauses in past incarnations of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) laws are hereby exposed as bait intended only to push through bad laws until conscience protections could be abolished.
This act would suspend the right to free expression in secular daily life. There can be no question that it will lead to compelled speech . One huge hint is the 2015 New York law that compels speech by slapping a fine of up to $250,000 for the crime of using a sex-matched pronoun on someone who doesn’t want that. Federal law would take a page from Twitter, which suspends the accounts of users who are viewed as not compliant with transgender politics.
Freedom of association would also take a big hit. With its emphases on perceptions of gender identity (both self-perception and one’s perceptions of gender identity), a defendant who may have been perceived to raise an eyebrow can be threatened with loss of livelihood and even jail time. It’s bound to sow social distrust and a fear of guilt by association with a defendant.
It will also have huge repercussions for freedom of association. As I’ll note below, the Equality Act would erase sex distinctions in law, which means open war on family relationships. We’ve already seen a court removing of parental custody of a minor child identifying as transgender for refusing to have their child injected with powerful hormones.
It also places Big Brother into the therapist’s office by banning any sort of talk therapy that might lead to a patient undoing a transgender decision or going from gay to straight, even if the patient wanted to do so. This one-way street goes under the moniker “conversion therapy,” which the “Equality” Act explicitly bans.
Nevermind that there are already plenty of laws against coercion and medical malpractice on the books. A ban on so-called conversion therapy uses a few cases of malpractice essentially to ban open conversations with a cognitive therapist. This is not the sort of law a free people seek. It is reminiscent, however, of the sort of law cult leaders have always sought to prevent people from leaving the cult. 2. The Ambiguities in the Bill Threaten the Rule of Law
The first thing that should hit any reader of the so-called Equality Act is the ambiguity of its language, especially with the bill’s outright emphasis throughout on “perceptions.”
We should ask ourselves: How does the rule of law survive such intangibles? The bill is set up to pass harsh judgments on how people are perceived or how people perceive things. Such haziness is guaranteed to create wide latitude for an arbitrary system of punishment and rewards, with no regard for (or even much possibility for) due process. It would have to calculate your intent, read your mind, check out your body language, pick you apart for any suggestion of malice.
It injects into numerous federal anti-discrimination laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a new protected class that is defined not by an immutable and noticeable characteristic like race and sex, nor of a person’s religious beliefs, which are inherent to First Amendment protections.
Instead, the newly injected category is “LGBT,” which refers to an entire panoply of personal relationships, social activities, attitudes, and various feelings of identity that can change from day to day. Granted, LGBT activists have succeeded in getting numerous state and local SOGI laws on the books. But a blanket fiat on the federal level is certain to open wider floodgates of abuse in interpreting and punishing any perception of discrimination, real or imagined.
Consider how much the “Equality” Act would rely on bureaucratic and court actors to divine the “perception” of the perpetrator or victim of so-called discrimination: it would have to calculate your intent, read your mind, check out your body language, pick you apart for any suggestion of malice. For example, it repeatedly refers to sexual orientation and gender identity as “ actual or perceived.” Many times throughout, the text notes that discrimination (or identity?) involves “ perception or belief even if inaccurate ” (emphasis mine).
This dependence on perception or belief about a person’s self-identity did not exist before. The language of this proposed law is more fluid than gender fluidity on steroids, and it’s wild stuff to push, especially at the federal level. It invites no end of accusations and lawfare that bodes ill for society and promises much human wreckage. The only people “empowered” by such a scam are those on the upper levels of this newly devised food chain who can call the shots. 3. Nudge Toward a Chinese-style Social Credit System
If passed, we shouldn’t be surprised if it eventually produces a social credit system not unlike what is happening in China , whereby your livelihood, education, career, mobility, and access to goods and services is based on a literal “score” of your compliance with government policy. To paraphrase Sir Richard Scruton’s excellent observation of how that works in China, I’d say that the so-called Equality Act would help create robots out of Americans, with the state programming what they can say and do.
As more people self-censor because of the risk of losing their livelihoods and social status, they simply become more prone to robotic compliance and conformity with limits on their speech. This is fast becoming the case in China, where citizens feel the need to build up their “social credit” to be allowed access to jobs, education, housing, and who knows what other goods and services. The so-called Equality Act’s restrictions on First Amendment freedoms would be a big step in that direction.
A social credit system that scores you for conformity would be a logical effect of the intent of the Equality Act: to punish free expression in just about every sphere of life, including the workplace, at school, in the public square, and in all public facilities, and any place that might be connected with federal funding. (By the way, Scruton was punished —stripped of his chairmanship of an architectural commission in Britain—simply for explaining what the social credit system does to people in China. That should be another lesson for us here.) 4. Redefining Humanity By Outlawing Sex Distinctions
The “Equality” Act is de-humanizing because it essentially de-sexes all of us in law. It does so in two ways. First, it abolishes the legal definition of sex as a physical reality by incorporating both sexual orientation and gender identity—which means your perception of your sex—into its very definition of sex. Wherever the term “sex” appears in federal anti-discrimination law, the so-called Equality Act parenthetically adds the words “including gender identity and sexual orientation.” Eliminating sex distinctions in law is the most effective path to abolishing state recognition of biological familial relationships.
Second, the act embeds a premise into its definition of gender identity that tells every American that his or her physical sex should not be legally recognized as real. Here’s its definition: “The term ‘gender identity’ means the gender-related identity, appearance, mannerism, or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, regardless of the individual’s designated sex at birth.”
The key phrase here is “regardless of the individual’s designated sex at birth,” which means that genitalia, or any distinction between male and female, would be irrelevant to any legal definition of sex. Many SOGI laws use the phrase “sex assigned at birth.” Either way, the premise is the same: physical reality has nothing to do with your maleness or femaleness.
This premise would apply to everybody universally, not merely those who choose to believe in a gender spectrum. More jurisdictions like Oregon are allowing people to opt out of sex distinctions altogether on official identification. With such laws, your sexual identity is deemed to be all in your mind, even if your perception is aligned with physical reality. So your sexed body essentially becomes unrecognized in law .
We should note that eliminating sex distinctions in law is the most effective path to abolishing state recognition of biological familial relationships. Once we no longer recognize male and female as distinct legal identities, any family relationships based on those distinctions—mother or father, son or daughter, husband or wife—fade away. 5. It Enshrines Socially Destructive Identity Politics
The so-called Equality Act depends entirely on a spirit of resentment embedded in identity politics. Identity politics can be summed up as the belief that your worth as an individual depends on your politically correct victim status. Identity politics have been a plague on the nation, dividing and pigeon-holing everyone.
Increasingly, it relies on the concept of “ intersectionality ,” which scores your status according to which groups you belong to by race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, and so on. If you are perceived as “white” and heterosexual, for example, gurus of identity politics will deem you guilty of “white privilege” in an effort to smear you and cut your voice off from public discourse.
Those who push identity politics rely heavily on promoting stereotypes and caricatures of people with no interest in getting to know people as individuals. Thus identity politics have been a plague on the nation, dividing and pigeon-holing everyone instead of allowing citizens to aspire to live happily as unique individuals with unique personalities.
This erases the intrinsic worth and dignity we all have as human beings. The regime of identity politics doesn’t allow people to interact freely with one another, which would allow us to achieve the sort of social balance we would need in order to optimize social harmony.
If members of Congress succumb to the toxins of identity politics by passing this act, they will have done enormous damage to the health of American society. In the end, it means that our worth would be assigned to us by the state, as is done in all authoritarian systems. The Mass State Decides What Equality Means
The reasons I list above all come down to one trenchant point worth repeating yet again: this proposed law is a thinly veiled power grab by statists. The LGBT demographic is simply the victim group used as their pawn, their vehicle, the means to that end.
For the moment, people who identify as LGBT might seem protected by it, but if enacted, the law is designed to generate a hydra-headed monster of the Mass State that will take on a chaotic life of its own. It’ll mete out “protections” by whim. In the end, it just won’t protect anybody.
That’s because those running the show won’t be concerned about anything but maintaining the unchecked power that measures such as this ambiguously worded bill would bestow upon them. Any bureaucrat or judge can simply cherry pick from the act’s wording to decide whether you qualify as “equal, unequal, or something else.”
George Orwell’s novel “Animal Farm” included the maxim that “some animals are more equal than others.” Along with the 1984 slogan “Slavery is Freedom,” Orwell could easily have predicted the “Equality Act.” It’s a weird new world.

"Why Relocating Illegal Aliens To Sanctuary Cities Is A Brilliant, Win-Win Idea",thefederalist.com,J. Michael Waller,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/relocating-illegal-aliens-sanctuary-cities-brilliant-win-win-idea/,"By J. Michael Waller April 22, 2019
Until the border wall with Mexico is built, what do we do with the illegal immigrants already in federal detention, and the million more expected to cross into our country this year? Nobody had any idea what to do.
In making an amnesty deal with Democrats, as rumors say his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are brokering, Trump risks angering his base by allowing tens of millions of foreign law-breakers to move ahead of those who respected our country’s laws and people by applying for citizenship lawfully.
Then, out of the blue on April 12, President Trump tweeted a win-win solution: Relocate foreign trespassers to states and communities that have already voted to welcome them. “We are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only,” he tweeted.
His law-and-order supporters seemed stunned. His critics suspected a vengeful trap. Few saw it as what could become the most magnanimous gesture of his presidency.
The president’s controversial move offers a political jackpot to liberals and socialists from coast to coast. Within a matter of months, Trump would expand leftists’ constituencies in states and towns that voted to become “sanctuaries” for illegal immigrants. Even better, this idea would grant sanctuary to countless foreign citizens from the frigid clutches of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. No sanctuary area is known to have placed a cap on the number of people it would welcome, so the opportunities are endless.
Trump has taken “winning” to a new level. Under his plan, everybody wins. Legal and constitutional hurdles stand in the way, to be sure. But the nation needs an interim solution, and Trump has found it. What This Grand Compromise Would Accomplish
First, the illegal immigrants would be sent only to progressive locales that celebrate diversity and inclusion with official sanctuary policies. This is means the poor, huddled masses wouldn’t be trucked to hurtful, bigoted, and racist communities in red states and other places with more respect for the nation’s laws. And they can stay as long as they like.
Many of those sanctuaries are among the nicest places in America. Foreign law-breakers can relocate to the posh and overwhelmingly white Nassau County, New York, or the Washington, DC suburb of Montgomery County, Maryland. Or much of the Pacific Northwest.
Trump’s political opponents would win bigly, too. The president’s plan would instantly expand his top opponents’ base of minorities to cultivate and aggrieve. Trump would instantly make sanctuary cities and states more ethnically, linguistically, and socially diverse.
Like Nassau and Montgomery counties on the east coast, the median income in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s sanctuary San Francisco district is in the six figures. Moving in thousands of illegals will lower the median income level to something more in line with the rest of the world’s. How about that equality.
Trump’s plan doesn’t neglect rural America. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ sanctuary state of Vermont is a shocking 95 percent white. By receiving thousands of new illegal immigrants every year, the Green Mountain state’s pale-faced population would quickly become browner and more diverse. And, because Vermont’s population growth rate is just one-quarter the national average, the sanctuary relocation plan would provide more workers to strengthen the state economy.
The Trump plan miraculously caters to special interests that oppose one another. California’s besieged agriculture industry, about to be wrecked by a $15-an-hour minimum wage, will receive new influxes of illegal immigrant laborers they can pay under the table, and the feds won’t be able to do a thing. Meanwhile the dying United Farm Workers union, whose members keep leaving in droves, could get a fresh injection of dues-payers.
The compromise would help Democrat political machines keep control in cities and states, but, because the sanctuary states themselves are already progressive, the population increase would have no effect on the Electoral College. Win-win again. Let’s Have an Equitable Distribution of Law-Breakers
The Center for Immigration Studies has compiled a list and interactive map that could guide where the illegal immigrants can live. According to CIS, eight entire states have become sanctuaries: California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont.
Let’s presume that, without a wall on the Mexican border, 1 million illegal aliens will cross into the United States in 2019 and every year thereafter. That’s what the trendlines suggest right now. The above eight states total about 81,130,000 residents. For equitable distribution, each state will receive 8,113 illegal immigrants for every million current residents. Here’s how an equitable relocation formula can work: California, with 39,776,830 residents, would receive 322,709 illegal immigrants in 2019; Colorado, with 5,684,023 residents, would receive 46,114; Illinois, population 12,768,320, receives 103,589; Massachusetts, with 6,895,917 people, takes 55,947 illegal immigrants; New Jersey, population 9,032,872, gets 73,284; New Mexico: sparsely populated with 2,090,708, houses 16,962; Oregon, with 4,256,350 residents, takes in 34,532; and Vermont, population 623,960, absorbs 5,062 illegal immigrants in 2019.
Of course, cities, counties, and towns in many of the other 42 states have declared themselves sanctuary zones. Targeted distribution to sanctuary cities, towns, and counties would spread the wealth beyond entire sanctuary states. So we would recalculate the distribution of illegal immigrants to all sanctuary jurisdictions.
Baltimore has almost the same population as the state of Vermont, so including sanctuary cities in addition to the eight states lowers the distribution ratio below 8,113 illegal immigrants per million citizens. Major population centers like New York City (population 8.5 million) and nearby Nassau County (1.7 million), plus Albany, Ithaca, and four other counties have declared themselves sanctuaries, but the rest of New York has not.
Those jurisdictions alone add another 11 million-plus people to the 81 million in the eight sanctuary states, So the per-capita distribution would go even lower. How to Pay for Everything
ICE can use current taxpayer funds to move the illegal immigrants to sanctuary localities, in a makeshift compromise between enforcing federal law (to detain and deport) and respecting state and local law (jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration law enforcement), and deliver the immigrants directly to those states and communities. It’s a curious twist that allows big-government progressives to enjoy federalism, too.
The sanctuary states and communities would develop their own policies to cover the costs of settlement and welfare. Sanctuary state and local taxpayers would bear sole responsibility for funding what they voted to enact.
As with federal funding of state and local highways and schools, recipient communities are obligated to abide by federal laws and regulations to receive federal funding. They are not forced to accept federal money, but if they do accept, they must observe federal laws and regulations. For example, states must enforce the federal alcohol drinking age of 21 to receive federal tax dollars for roads, or Department of Education provisions to receive federal school funds. Those practices, in place for decades, are no longer controversial.
Since sanctuary locales, by definition, violate or refuse to observe federal laws, such jurisdictions logically forego federal taxpayer funding. This is fair to the taxpayers in jurisdictions that did not vote for ignoring federal laws.
This Trump compromise, if one accepts the gravity of what’s becoming a national crisis, is both consistent with the founding principles of states’ rights and local self-government. That should appeal to federalists. And it prevents federal intrusion into sanctuary states and localities should they wish not to obey federal law, a curious twist that allows big-government progressives to enjoy federalism, too. So it’s win-win. C’Mon, Democrats, Don’t Be Bigots Now
There are, of course, occasional mean-spirited people who oppose the Trump compromise.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced it as “vengeful.” She sounded as if, in her heart, she doesn’t really find illegal immigration an enrichment of the diverse social fabric of America. Indeed, some critics sound like they find the very thought of illegal immigrants being relocated to their own communities repulsive.
“I understand helping struggling immigrants but my city (Los Angeles) isn’t taking care of its own,” clucked Cher the entertainer two days after Trump raised his plan. “What about the 50,000+ citizens who live on the streets?” she tweeted (edited for clarity). “People who live below poverty line & hungry? If my state can’t take care of its own (many are vets), how can it take care of more?”
Trump knew he’d bridged the political gap. He had achieved the impossible by finding common ground. The president tweeted back, “I finally agree with Cher!” J.

"All 21 Marvel Superhero Films, Ranked",thefederalist.com,John Cooper,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/all-21-marvel-films-ranked/,"By John Cooper April 22, 2019
When Marvel kicked off production on “Iron Man” more than a decade ago, few would have thought they were creating a movie that would birth a shared cinematic universe spanning more than 20 films, grossing more than $18 billion to date, and changing cinema forever. With “Avengers: Endgame” set to arrive later this month, it’s worth looking back at how far they’ve come by ranking every film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Let’s go in reverse order, starting with the worst. The Pretenders
21. “Captain Marvel”
Let’s jump right in with a hot take: “Captain Marvel” is not a good MCU film. In fact, it’s quite possibly the MCU’s weakest. A thoroughly uncharismatic lead? Check. Plot holes large enough to pilot a Quinjet through? Check. Underwhelming action set pieces? Check.
While the majority of MCU films have delivered likable characters and memorable moments, this film was shockingly short on both—a shame given Carol Danvers’ iconic status.
20. “The Incredible Hulk”
Many fans hesitate to count Edward Norton’s take on “The Incredible Hulk” as part of the MCU, but hey, Tony Stark shows up at the end, and you can’t forget Gen. Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, who comes back later to make life difficult for the Avengers. This Hulk film is basic stuff, but it’s entertaining enough. I definitely prefer Mark Ruffalo’s take on Bruce Banner, though.
19. “Ant-Man”
This one will also get me in trouble with the fans, not only because everyone loves Paul Rudd (seriously, how does he manage to always look so young?), but because I rank it below “Ant-Man and the Wasp.” And if Marvel films have taught us anything, it’s that the sequel is almost always worse. But this one just feels cookie-cutter (looking at you, Corey Stoll), and while it has some enjoyable moments, the film is fairly forgettable.
18. “Thor: The Dark World”
This film gives us a better introduction to Asgard, something we didn’t really get the first time, and Thor springing Loki out of prison is entertaining, but this film didn’t really deliver much else, with a generic, under-developed villain as its chief fault. “The Dark World” was very much emblematic of the early-Phase 2 MCU.
17. “Iron Man 3”
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT WITH THE MANDARIN!? Sorry, am I yelling?
Seriously, though, why? This film could have been so, so good, but director Shane Black decided to undercut all dramatic tension with some very poor story-telling decisions. Tony finally coming to realize that he, not his suit, is Iron Man, is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy’s arc, but wow, what a missed opportunity.
16. “Iron Man 2”
We take for granted how successful this series ended up being, and much of the credit should go to Jon Favreau. This film is weaker, of course, than its predecessor, and man, is Sam Rockwell annoying as Tony’s nemesis. But Favreau’s style shines through in genuinely funny quips and his effort to show us a superhero grappling with, and overcoming, his own limitations. The Good Ones
15. “Doctor Strange”
Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange is impeccable casting, bringing just the right amount of cynical realism, balanced with scientific hope, to the role. This film was the first in the MCU to really introduce us to magic, and it’s a fun ride.
14. “Black Panther”
“Black Panther” is a solid film, and I walked out of the theater very pleased. It has many engaging components, like the Busan sequence and solid performances from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, and Martin Freeman. On subsequent viewings, though, it gets weaker. The third act is visually messy, and this film continued the MCU tradition of killing off compelling villains after one feature performance. RIP Killmonger and Ulysses Klaue.
13. “Ant-Man and the Wasp”
That’s right, it’s the rare sequel that’s actually better than the original. The stakes are higher in this installment, and the characters’ motivations are relatable. Evangeline Lilly is a criminally underused talent in the MCU. This film also took the best aspects of the first, like the X-Con Security crew, led by Michael Pena, and built on them.
12. “Thor”
Quite possibly the most underrated film in the MCU is “Thor.” (No, I’m not kidding. Yes, I will fight you.) The “fish out of water” plotline is a great way to introduce us to Chris Hemsworth’s charismatic version of the character. Another underrated part to this film? While many of the MCU films have very forgettable scores, Thor’s theme is iconic and incredibly moving.
11. “Captain America: The First Avenger”
If “Thor” isn’t the most underrated MCU film, this one is. Perhaps more than any other MCU character, I am always struck how Steve Rogers is good for the sake of being good, and how that affects everything he does. It makes his conflict with Tony even more believable, and it makes me always want to root for him, even if he may be wrong about something. That all starts in this film.
10. “Captain America: Civil War”
If Marvel wasn’t going to follow the true “Civil War” storyline, this was a good alternative. The conflict between Cap and Tony is real, the set pieces are fantastic, and we get some extra depth we’re not used to in a Marvel film. Hopefully we get more Zemo in the next phase.
9. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”
Volume 2 may never reach the classic, take-the-world-by-storm status as the original, but it never ceases to make me laugh. Drax’s constant one-liners, Baby Groot, and its subversion of expectations with the famous “Assemble!” circling shot are just a few of the highlights. Still waiting for that Adam Warlock payoff, though.
8. “Avengers: Age of Ultron”
While it didn’t live up to the original “Avengers” hype, there are plenty of things to love about this film, like Tony breaking out the Hulkbuster armor, Thor finally getting a chance to shine, the personalization of Hawkeye, new characters in Scarlet Witch and Vision, and, of course, James Spader as Ultron. The finale is entertaining, too.
7. “Spider-Man: Homecoming”
You wouldn’t think the third Spiderman in two decades would really be a breath of fresh air, but Tom Holland proved everyone wrong. Kudos to Marvel for skipping the backstory and putting us right into Peter Parker’s high school world, with Tony there to be a guiding hand. This movie isn’t “epic” like some others, but it doesn’t need to be. The Elite
6. “Guardians of the Galaxy”
The minute Chris Pratt started playing “Come and Get Your Love,” I knew I was going to enjoy this movie. Marvel took a huge chance pouring millions into this film, and wow, did it ever pay off. “Guardians” made me laugh from start to finish, the chemistry between the leads is strong, Lee Pace is an underrated villain (although again, Marvel, come on), and even a simple cameo from Thanos is chilling.
5. Marvel’s “The Avengers”
Besides “Iron Man,” no other film in the MCU has had such cultural impact. What Marvel did in this film had never been done before, but its success changed cinema for the better. So much of the MCU as we know it today stems from what Marvel created in this film, from the plotlines, of course, to the interpersonal relationships that are still paying off in films seven years later. And honestly, can you beat the “Avengers Assemble” shot and that theme?
4. “Avengers: Infinity War”
As much as “The Avengers” introduced us to superhero team-ups and launched so many interwoven storylines, “Infinity War” represents the near-culmination of those stories, and of those character arcs. It’s a beautiful movie to watch, and moments like Thor’s arrival on Wakanda are chill-inducing. Of course, Thanos as the lead villain does not disappoint, and hey, he’s even still alive for a second movie!
3. “Thor: Ragnarok”
I didn’t think an MCU movie would make me laugh just as much as the Guardians films. I was wrong. I was chuckling to outright laughing throughout this entire film. Hemsworth absolutely knocks this performance out of the park, Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster was a revelation, finally getting the reconciliation between Thor and Loki was moving—and that ‘80s vibe in the score is spot-on.
2. “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”
This was Marvel’s first real attempt at a genre film, and the Russo brothers nailed it. The spy-thriller approach worked perfectly for a movie featuring Cap, Black Widow, Nick Fury, and The Falcon. The concept that S.H.I.E.L.D. had just been a front for Hydra for decades was not only a game-changer for the film, but changed the course of the MCU. The score for this movie is also underrated. A near-perfect film.
1. “Iron Man”
Was there ever any doubt? The one that started them all, the one that introduced us to Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, reigns supreme as the top MCU film. I still remember seeing this with friends on opening night in college, and having an absolute blast.

"Barbara Bush’s Diaries Make Me Want To Tweet Less, And Journal More",thefederalist.com,Stephanie Green,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/why-barbara-bushs-diaries-make-me-want-to-tweet-less/,"April 22, 2019 By Stephanie Green
It seems that Barbara Bush, who died a year ago this month, was more Bridget Jones than Mamie Eisenhower. Caustic. Funny. Vain. Spiteful. These are just a few of the adjectives that come to mind as I read Susan Page’s new biography of the first lady, “The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty.”
Behind the pearls, sun hats, and spaniels, there was a woman sometimes living in opposition to herself, a tension revealed by a habit that now sets her apart, a throwback pastime that’s been excised by social media—the art of diary keeping. Page was given unprecedented access to Bush’s diaries, which date back to 1948, and include entries just days before her death.
This is where the feisty Barbara (the one I prefer) emerges: “My-oh-my it was a tense evening,” she writes about a dinner at the White House just days after the chaotic election of 2000 that, after weeks of hanging chad chaos, put her son in the Oval Office.
“What absolute nerve, “she fumed about then-President Bill Clinton. “He was impeached because he lied to the American people. I have come to the conclusion that he really does not know right from wrong.” Ouch.
Here’s another Barbara-barb. “Aren’t we a funny country? We all go to each other’s funerals and Library openings. At the funerals you can see people thinking like the cartoons with a bubble over their heads: This guy was a rotten lying mean guy and all these liars are saying these nice untrue things about him.”
The diary was a way for her to sheath her views from an intrusive public, ever more ravenous for the first lady’s thoughts on all manner of social issues percolating in the ’70s and ’80s. “The elected person’s opinion is the one the public has the right to know,” was Bush’s default talking point, but she retreated into her private world of note taking to weigh the pros and cons of the issues.
“Thoughts on abortion,” she scribbled on the page. “When does the soul enter the body is the #1 question,” the diary reads. “If the answer to that question is the moment the first breath is taken, then abortion is not murder. What does Barbara Bush feel about abortion,” she continued in the third person.
She also used her diary as a therapist, confiding in it her perceived shortcomings as a woman. “They discussed how to make me snappier,” she revealed about campaign operatives who wanted her to be more Dynasty-era glamorous. “I know it was meant to be helpful, but I wept quietly,” she wrote.
These entries are relics of a bygone era, much to the disadvantage of historians and biographers. Presidents and first ladies of today and tomorrow have their social media accounts, but they reveal what they want us to see—not the raw, the frail, and the inner workings of their minds.
Bush is often compared to Abigail Adams, the only other woman who had a husband and son who became president. Her best legacy, however, is another commonality between the two women: their penchant for the written word. Recall those “Remember the Ladies” letters she wrote to her hubby during the height of the Revolution.
Here’s a sampling from her return voyage to America in 1788: “further to be known from the page of History. I do not think the four years I have past abroad the pleasentest part of my Life. Tis Domestick happiness and Rural felicity in the Bosom of my Native Land, that has charms for me. Yet I do not regreet that I made this excursion since it has only more attached me to America.”
I am just as guilty as the next millennial for letting Instagram usurp my proclivity for writing. I did, however, journal about a trip to France last year, and will squirrel my notebook away in the hopes that one day my grandchild will find it amusing. My musings mostly centered on the historic places I saw, and my minor irritations in coach. I’ll never reach the heights of Abigail’s 18th-century eloquence.
The photos on my social media accounts tell, literally, a filtered story, much like Bush’s public appearances. But a diary allows you to go deeper, reflect honestly, and record your unvarnished voice in a given moment, even if it falls short of Abigail’s prose, and Barbara’s acute insights.
After seeing how Bush’s life (and those of her precursors) was so enriched by this written conversation with herself, I’ve decided to tweet less, and journal more — if for no other reason than to savor experiences, and relish in the fact that I’m still here. As Bush wrote, “Amazing life. Lucky lucky me.” Stephanie Green is journalist in Washington.

Amazon’s ‘The Tick’ Is Better Than The Superhero Movies It’s Parodying,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/amazons-tick-better-superhero-movies-parodying/,"April 22, 2019 By Nathanael Blake
Earlier this month, Amazon released season two of “The Tick”—the delightful superhero spoof we need amidst today’s surfeit of comic book adaptations and their endless advertising barrages. If you want to laugh about our glut of superhero shows and movies, “The Tick” is for you.
The title character is a big blue superhero with mysterious memory loss, a sense of destiny, and a penchant for off-kilter heroic patter (“the mystery of me is an onion with many leaves”). Played with earnest, bombastic perfection by Peter Serafinowicz, the Tick doesn’t know much, but he knows heroes, villains, and dramatic narrative: “Destiny is doing the folding, and we are her origami swans.” The Tick’s cognitive deficits are compensated for by sidekick Arthur (Griffin Newman), a scrawny, traumatized accountant with a high-tech flying suit the Tick looted from bad guys at the start of the series.
Having vanquished villains and established themselves as heroes in season one, the Tick and Arthur are now confronted by superhero bureaucracy in the form of A.E.G.I.S. This is a funhouse version of comic book agencies such as Marvel’s S.H.I.EL.D. It seeks to assess, assist, and monitor superheroes, who also get a nice lounge with free Wi-Fi and delectable pastries.
This turn to the government creates tension between the protagonists. While the Tick breaks testing machines and chafes at inaction and filling out forms, Arthur has no powers without his suit (which he can’t entirely control) other than a knack for paperwork, but he is awed at being part of A.E.G.I.S. The Tick, despite his childlike excitement and enthusiasm for almost everything new, meets agents and heroes as colleagues, while Arthur struggles to keep his fanboy impulses under control.
The new characters at A.E.G.I.S. join a familiar supporting cast, from Arthur’s family to the vigilante Overkill, who is despondent that he can no longer live up to his name because the Tick made him promise to stop killing people (“If Overkill can’t kill people, then he’s over, man”). Superian—a discount Superman—also returns, suffering from social media-induced depression and angry at his cable news critics.
As for the dark side, season one’s villain, the Terror, is on ice for season two. This sidelines a truly great bad guy, but it is a pleasing contrast to the usual practice of supervillain catch-and-release—some comic book asylums might as well have revolving doors. However, the Terror’s “human Tesla coil” henchwoman Miss Lint returns, and new villains rise.
The stage is set for drama, comedy, heroes, villains ,and some surprisingly cute moments with lobsters. Standard tropes are mined for laughs, such as when Arthur infiltrates an underground gambling den—instead of glamour and glitz, there is just a bumbling accountant trying to be suave.
Secret identities are a difficulty. The Tick doesn’t have an alternate identity, and Arthur’s is a little too obvious, which leads to him losing his job. Per his boss: “We’re simply not insured for your kind of hobby.” Arthur may be inept at having a secret identity, but other characters can manage it, so the second half of the season indulges in a game of masks, as secret identities and superpowers are revealed all over the place. It’s a bit silly, which is the point.
Yet perhaps because the characters live in an absurd world, playing them earnestly gives them pathos beyond that of standard comic book fodder. For a superhero comedy, “The Tick” is surprisingly character-driven. Perhaps not having enormous sums of money to spend on CGI forced the show to do a better job of character development. This is why, in a genre where almost anything can be undone and even death is rarely permanent, “The Tick” still manages to feel like it has real stakes, in contrast to Marvel, which killed off half of its heroes without anyone caring.
Although the villains are often cartoonish, season two closes with a suggestion that some of them had a point— perhaps an alien superhero is not the savior humanity needs, especially if that leaves mankind a superhuman mental breakdown away from extinction.
The new season of “The Tick” is easy viewing, with 10 episodes at about 25 minutes each. The show has also toned down the profanity and violence from the first season, dropping from a TV-MA rating to TV-14, putting it on par with most of the material it is parodying.
But “The Tick” is more fun than the big-screen, big-budget spectacles it satirizes. It works to get details right, from the Tick’s emotive antennae to a cola commercial in the background. It provides laughs, and it uses the all-too-human weaknesses of its characters (including the superhuman ones) to craft better dramatic narratives than are found in the explosion extravaganzas ruling the box office.

Why Chip And Joanna Gaines’s Ubiquity Holds Perils And Promise,thefederalist.com,Casey Chalk,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/chip-joanna-gainess-ubiquity-holds-perils-promise/,"By Casey Chalk April 22, 2019
I can’t escape Chip and Joanna Gaines, just named two of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people . Everywhere, including every grocery store checkout counter, I’m greeted by the smiling faces of the co-founders of the popular HGTV program “Fixer Upper.”
When I recently visited my aunt in southern Virginia, she had a copy of Joanna’s magazine, The Magnolia Journal, full of recipe and home decor recommendations. On a recent drive to visit my in-laws, Joanna’s visage was on billboards all down Interstate 85, advertising her products at a regional furniture chain.
In Atlanta I discovered her 2018 bestselling book, “Magnolia Table: A Collection of Recipes for Gathering,” on my mother-in-law’s coffee table. During our stay, my television-starved wife (we don’t have cable) kept tuning in to the “Fixer Upper” marathon. Although the pervasiveness of the couple’s influence can seem a bit overwhelming, there’s good reason we should hope and pray that the Gaines craze stands the test of time. A Family Standing for Good in the Public Square
The Gaines are most famous for their five-season HGTV hit show “Fixer Upper,” in which Chip, the construction expert, and Joanna, the home designer, work with clients to buy and remodel homes in the area around Waco, Texas. The last episode aired in spring 2018.
This is only one of many of their entrepreneurial enterprises . Chip apparently has business deep in the blood: he’s bought a neighborhood laundromat and talked a bank into a loan for equipment to start a lawn-mowing service. The couple opened the first “Magnolia Market” in 2003, where Joanna developed her design style and skills. After a couple of kids, they closed their shop and focused on Magnolia Homes, their construction business.
They reopened Magnolia Market, which they soon outgrew, replacing it with Magnolia Silos in downtown Waco. They also now have multiple books and a magazine , and are planning to develop their own television channel .
Although it is never explicitly communicated in their many business ventures, a deep conservative vein runs through everything they do. “Fixer Upper,” for example, was premised on the concept of taking some of the ugliest lots in Waco and turning them into something beautiful. Yet Joanna always sought to preserve whatever artifacts and parts of the buildings could be reused, including one of their favorites, shiplap.
Joanna also routinely relied on local antique stores to provide home decor, as well as local businessmen to build custom features. As they explain, “We loved the idea that we were ‘making Waco beautiful one home at a time.’”
They succeeded in spades, and have, quite amazingly, made the local community life of Waco something attractive for viewers watching from coast to coast. Did I ever think I would turn to my wife and utter the words “Maybe we could live in Waco”? More fundamentally, they’ve created a template for how Americans can foster and renew pride in their local communities.
The Gaines model conservative values in other respects. They now have five children, after Joanna gave birth to their latest in 2018 — something for which they’ve taken heat from the liberal side of their fanbase. This is at a time when the United States’ birth rate continues to decline , now at 1.8 children per woman, well below replacement level.
Data shows that the people more like to have more children are more likely to be religious and live in red states (and be politically conservative). The Gaines are also practicing Christians, attending Antioch Community Church in the Waco area. In another sign of their religious convictions, Chip took several of their children to an evangelical ministry in Uganda in 2018. The Danger of Selling Your Life
The Gaines have shared much of their lives with their fans and customers — their stories, their personalities, their family, their passions, even some of their character flaws . This is a dangerous business, fraught with threats. Selling one’s life, as the Gaines effectively have done, risks a backlash against any perceived flaw or failure.
Indeed, many fans criticized the couple for attending a church that teaches homosexual behavior is sinful, and whose pastor has been outspoken in opposing same-sex marriage . For those in the entertainment industry, associating with such an organization can spell doom and destruction. Other websites have catalogued every little controversy that has ever haunted the couple. Chip has acknowledged that at times he felt “trapped” in the grind of their popular television show.
The Gaineses, in many respects, have placed themselves in a tenuous position by offering their lives and persons for public consumption and scrutiny. It would not take much to wreck all that they have worked to accomplish.
Not long ago, my wife saw the Gaineses featured on the front cover of the tabloid In Touch Weekly . I’d wager money that any future controversy will result in a front-page story. One can imagine many scenarios that could cause the sinking of the Gaines image and industry. God knows we’ve seen plenty of examples of popular conservative-leaning celebrities who have suffered an unceremonious dethroning from their seat atop pop culture. Why Supporting the Gaineses Matters
What the Gaines family has offered America over the last several years is singularly unique. They’ve presented the country with a creative, fun-loving, hard-working, religiously devout family at the top of their game. In the process, they’ve made a lot of money, and earned incredible respect and devotion from an ever-widening fan base.
Americans — and humans, for that matter — love people to celebrate and cheer for. Unfortunately, as we so often witness, Americans love a good controversy, and have demonstrated a deep, ever-capable willingness to kick their heroes to the curb if they violate certain social standards or mores. Often such topplings are justified, but they can just as easily be cruel and unfair.
This is why we should offer our moral support and prayers to the Gaines family. Saturation must feel great for a brand, but it also poses dangers, such as becoming a fad, or making a bigger target for opponents. But what they stand for is an amalgamation of much of what is good about America: entrepreneurial tenacity, strong moral character, a devotion to one’s family and home community, and an abiding faith in God.
I wish them my deepest regards for their success. For as long as they stay in our country’s limelight, it means there’s still a chance for the conservative way of life to be considered a legitimate source for good in our nation’s public square.

How Jordan Peterson Lost His ‘Debate’ Against Slavoj Zizek,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/jordan-peterson-lost-debate-slavoj-zizek/,"By David Marcus April 22, 2019
It was billed as an intellectual clash of the titans. On one side, Jordan Peterson, the tsk-tsking Canadian psychology professor who is the fastest-rising public thinker in the world, and a lodestar for the directionless (mostly directionless men). On the other was Slavoj Zizek, the Slovenian philosophy professor who has, for decades, broken down everything from Kant to Lacan to pop culture with some of the most fascinating, if often haphazard, ideas of his time. Excitement was in the air last Friday in Toronto as they squared off for a live audience and paying livestream audience around the world.
The debate was titled “Happiness, Capitalism vs. Marxism.” As the title gives away, this was not really a debate in any usual sense of the word. There was no proposition, no affirmative or negative to defend or argue. Rather, this was a wide-ranging discussion around the ideas of capitalism and Marxism, instead of a head-to-head analysis of which is superior in promoting happiness, whatever that is. This is something that Peterson did not seem to understand, and that misunderstanding threw him badly off track right from the start.
The format was 30-minute opening remarks, followed by 10 minutes each for rebuttal and then a question and answer period. The Canadian guru of cleaning your room and defeating your dragons went first. This was a major disadvantage. Peterson, who seemed out of sorts, was tripping over himself, and engaging in long awkward pauses very unlike his usual style. He laid out 10 reasons why the Communist Manifesto is an absurd document.
As these kinds of surveys go, it was not bad. It finally landed on the reasonable idea that Karl Marx is envisioning a dictatorship of the proletariat to replace the power of capitalism, and assuming, without evidence, that the proletariat are good and the capitalists are bad. Yet everywhere, these dictatorships have turned into brutal killing machines. It was a very good college lecture. It was not, however, an assemblage of ideas that could compete with the rhetorical powers Zizek would next bring to bear.
Almost immediately Zizek made clear that he would not be playing the same game as Peterson. He opened by decrying how both of them have been condemned by the academy’s political correctness. Then he forayed into a more nuanced discussion of the relative value of capitalism and Marxism in creating happiness. His opening salvo was cutting and important. It was China. Peterson had extolled the virtues of capitalism in terms of raising people out of poverty, but so too has communist China over the past two decades, so how can this be explained?
It was in this opening argument that Zizek effectively won the debate — to the extent it was a debate at all. Peterson had trapped himself into a zero-sum game, Zizek had opened up a universe of overlapping ideas, taking in economics, politics, and even tech. At one point he wondered how an unbridled free market could avoid pursuing biotech, genetic manipulation, and bio hacking that will almost certainly create a new apartheid between high-tech wealthy supermen and the world’s poor trapped in frail and faulty human bodies.
By centering his arguments on the comparative value of each economic and political system to create happiness, Zizek gave a far more compelling account of both. His opening was by far the most interesting half hour of the nearly three-hour event. By the time he was done, Peterson seemed a little stunned. He opened his rebuttal by admitting his opening statement had effectively been rendered useless. He thought it was because he had misunderstood the terms of the debate, and maybe he had, but he had also been swept into Zizek’s rhetorical web, and there wasn’t much of a way out.
Peterson did have a very good moment in the question and answer period, something of an own goal by Zizek. The Slovenian polymath insisted that Peterson name actual Marxists on the progressive academic left. His point seemed to be that identity politics, often called postmodern neo-Marxism, is not and never has been real Marxism, which focuses almost solely on class rather than identity.
Peterson tore this assertion to shreds, deftly explaining that, after the atrocities of Stalin and Mao became apparent in the late 1960s, continental philosophers like Foucault, who had been avowed Marxists, needed a change of course. So they simply replaced class with identity but maintained the same Marxist systems and power structures in their philosophy. It was a lively and fun exchange.
When the debate becomes available for free streaming in a few weeks, it’s worth a watch if only because it is entertaining. Peterson and Zizek almost come off like an intellectual comedy duo. The former is the straight man, tall, thin, in a perfect suit, pacing and reading notes off a laptop, his gestures limited to the flickering of fingers while making a point. Zizek the comedian (he was much funnier) is bulky, unkempt, tugging at his shirt and nose like a cokehead while seated reading from sheets of paper. They could not be more different, but somehow complimented each other.
All in all, our society can use more of this. Seeing two thinkers who delve as deeply into our modern society as Peterson and Zizek do creates enormous fodder for all of us to consider our place in that society. In a world that operates so much on the surface, three hours of deep philosophical talk is a welcome breath of fresh air.

Islamic Terrorism Remains The World’s Greatest Threat To Peace,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/22/islamic-terrorism-remains-the-worlds-greatest-threat-to-peace/,"April 22, 2019 By David Harsanyi
After the horrific mass murder of 50 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch , New Zealand, there was widespread coverage and a torrent of mainstream news networks contemplating the threat of white supremacy. These conversations, completely reasonable and necessary in the face of violent attacks from a racist gunman, soon began deteriorating into politically motivated and specious claims contending that “white supremacy” had become the predominate terror threat in the world.
Well, the coordinated bomb blasts aimed at Christian worshippers on Easter Sunday, which killed at least 290 people and injured hundreds more, demonstrates the kind of meticulous planning, funding, resources, and support that is still exclusively the domain of radical Islamic terrorism. It’s not merely that the act was planned to maximize the death toll, but that it is a continuation of long-standing efforts by Islamists to destroy the Christian communities left in Asia.
Those who kill in the name of Islam are part of a worldwide, historic, ideological, and political movement that includes, to various degrees and various reasons, radicalized men and women from both great factions of the faith. Then again, terrorist groups—as well as their recruitment and propaganda outfits—are often functioning in Islamic regimes, which either actively sustain terror , tolerate these groups, or pay them off to engage in terrorism elsewhere.
The Christians who remain in the Islamic world are often oppressed in other ways. In a number of these nations, publicly praying in any faith but Islam is forbidden and, in many, converting to Christianity is still punishable by death. “ Islamic extremism remains the global, dominant driver of persecution, responsible for initiating oppression and conflict in 35 of the 50 countries on the list,” according to Open Doors, a worldwide Christian group.
The idea that a similar threat exists in the West is risible. There’s not a single Western country that doesn’t afford Muslim citizens the same rights it does as all other citizens. No government on Earth supports white supremacy.
There is no funding infrastructure for those who support white power. There is no Christian or Jewish denomination, or any notable political factions, in those nations that imbue white supremacy with any theological or ideological legitimacy. There is no white supremacist government trying to obtain nuclear weapons, and none sending their terrorists to other countries. In the world’s free nations, where any political party can participate in the process, the power of racist groups is minimal.
Yet the American left continues to downplay the danger, first by arguing that Islam has nothing to do with Islamic terrorism, then by lumping every white-skinned person who commits a terrorist act into one imaginary coherent political movement to contrast against it. It’s true that Americans have been spared much Islamic terror since 2002—a year that, curiously, nearly every graph media uses to measure domestic terrorism starts—but only because we’ve spent billions of dollars each year and immense resources, both in lives and treasure, keeping it out of the country and fighting it abroad.
Another reason the majority of Americans might not comprehend Islamic radicalism’s reach is the skewed intensity of the media coverage. Political correctness and a chilling fear of being labeled “Islamophobic” makes it difficult to honestly report on terrorism around the world.
In addition to the massacre this Easter in Sri Lanka, at least 200 Christian civilians have been murdered in Africa by Islamic militants thus far in 2019—many of them killed by machete, some by bombings. Many more Christians have been murdered during the past calendar year.
In November 2018, for example, 42 people were slaughtered in an attack on a Catholic mission in the Central African Republic. In October, 55 Christians were murdered by a group of Islamists in Nigeria. Another 29 were killed when 10 churches were burned down in Ethiopia last summer. Another seven Coptic Christians were gunned down in Egypt—and others spared only because of the good work of police .
There are pockets of racists in the world, and individuals who engage in terrible acts of violence against innocent people. These are dangerous men, capable of doing tremendous damage . But no group threatens global peace the same way that political Islam does. None has its reach or material and theological support. None has created more mayhem and death in the world since the end of the Cold War. The Sri Lankan massacre is just another harrowing reminder."

Medicare Report Reality-Checks Bernie Sanders’ Socialist Delusions,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/medicare-trustees-report-reality-checks-bernie-sanders-socialist-delusions/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 23, 2019
Many of the left’s policy proposals come with the same design flaw: While sounding great on paper, they have little chance of working in practice. Monday brought one such type of reality check to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and supporters of single-payer health care, in the form of the annual Medicare trustees report .
The report once again demonstrates Medicare’s shaky financial standing, as the retirement of 10,000 Baby Boomers every day continues to tax the program’s limited resources. So why would Sanders and Democrats raid this precariously funded program to finance their government takeover of health care? Medicare’s Ruinous Finances
Before even dissecting the report itself, one major caveat worth noting: The trustees report assumes that many of the Medicare payment reductions, and tax increases, included in Obamacare can be used “ both ” to “save Medicare” and fund Obamacare. In practice, however, sheer common sense suggests the impossibility of this scenario—as not even the federal government can spend the same dollars twice.
The last trustees report prior to these Obamacare gimmicks, in 2009, predicted that the Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) Trust Fund would become insolvent in 2017—two years ago. To put it another way, under a more accurate accounting mechanism, Medicare has already become functionally insolvent. Obamacare’s accounting gimmicks just allowed politicians (including President Trump) to continue to ignore Medicare’s funding shortfalls , thus making them worse by failing to act.
Even despite the double-counting created by Obamacare, the Part A Trust Fund faces significant obstacles. Monday’s report reveals that the trust fund suffered a $1.6 billion loss in 2018. This loss comes on the heels of a total of $132.2 billion in trust fund deficits from 2008 through 2015, as payroll tax revenues dropped dramatically during the Great Recession.
Worse yet, the trustees report that trust fund deficits will continue forever . Deficits will continue to rise, and by 2026—within the decade—the Trust Fund will become insolvent, and unable to pay all of its bills. Replacing One Decrepit Program with an Even Worse One
Another little-noticed element of the report also hints at the problems single-payer supporters face. For the third straight year, the trustees issued an “excess general revenue Medicare funding,” further illustrating the program’s questionable finances.
In 2003, House conservatives included this mechanism in the Medicare Modernization Act, which requires the trustees to make an annual assessment of the program’s funding. If general revenues—as opposed to the payroll tax revenues that largely cover the costs of the Part A program—are projected to exceed 45 percent of total program outlays, this provision seeks to prompt a debate about Medicare’s long-term funding.
Compare this provision, which triggers whenever general revenues (i.e., those not specifically dedicated to Medicare) approach half of total program spending, with single payer. As these pages have previously noted , here’s what Section 701(d) both the House and Senate single payer bills would do to Medicare:
(d) TRANSFER OF FUNDS.—Any amounts remaining in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i) or the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1841 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395t) after the payment of claims for items and services furnished under title XVIII of such Act have been completed, shall be transferred into the Universal Medicare Trust Fund under this section.
Both bills would liquidate both of the current Medicare trust funds—and abolish the current Medicare program—to pay for the new single-payer plan. But how do Democrats propose to pay for the rest of the estimated $32 trillion cost of their program? Sanders referenced a list of potential tax increases (not drafted as legislative language), but the House sponsors didn’t even bother to go that far.
In sum, single-payer supporters would take a program on shaky financial footing, and replace it with a program that Democrats have little idea how to fund. Apart from the fact that the American people can’t afford this “reform”—how much of that $32 trillion tax increase would you like to pay?—American seniors certainly can’t either.

Here's What Rep. Ilhan Omar Gets Wrong About 'Black Hawk Down',thefederalist.com,Kyle Lamb,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/fought-battle-mogadishu-heres-ilhan-omar-gets-wrong-black-hawk/,"By Kyle Lamb April 23, 2019
Earlier this week, a 2017 tweet from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) surfaced in which she attacked the men who helped defend from starvation and civil war the country she abandoned in the early 1990s. In her tweet, Omar blasted “American forces” for killing “thousands of Somalis” during the Battle of Mogadishu in October 1993. “#NotTodaySatan,” Omar wrote .
I take special exception to Omar’s disgusting comments because I served in the Battle of Mogadishu, which was later portrayed in the movie “Black Hawk Down.” If you aren’t familiar with the real story behind “Black Hawk Down,” let me set the scene for you.
In late 1992, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Restore Hope in support of United Nations initiatives to restore some semblance of law and order to Somalia, which was wracked by devastating famine and violent warlords eager to use the chaos and hopelessness to establish corrupt fiefdoms.
The purpose of American involvement in Somalia was to protect the peacekeepers tasked with the near-impossible mission of delivering vital food and medical supplies to the starving, war-torn population. As the aid grew, so did the opportunities for graft from warring clans who saw the humanitarian crisis as a way to cement their power throughout the country.
The Habar Gidir clan, one of the more powerful clans around Mogadishu, was led by the notorious warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, who made the distribution of international aid to those who needed it nearly impossible. Instead of equitably spreading food and medical supplies, Aidid and his henchmen spread terror and death.
On June 5, 1993, two dozen Pakistani soldiers working for the United Nations peacekeeping effort were attacked and killed by forces loyal to Farah Aidid (three Americans were injured in that attack as well). The next day, the U.N. passed a resolution condemning the attack and calling for the arrest of those responsible and of those inciting and organizing other attacks against U.N. forces. The man most responsible for the violence was Aidid himself, who unilaterally declared himself president (he was never recognized as a legitimate political leader).
Task Force Ranger was the 1993 military effort ordered by President Bill Clinton to capture Aidid and his lieutenants so the U.N. could deliver food and medical aid without fear of being attacked or killed by Aidid’s forces. The American soldiers Omar attacked in her tweet — the men of Task Force Ranger –weren’t sent to Somalia for fame or fortune. They weren’t there because of a deep desire to visit the God-forsaken nation of Somalia. They were deployed to support peacekeepers who were desperate to rescue the country from starvation and the ravages of civil war. To do that, they had to capture the men responsible for it.
By the time Task Force Ranger had been launched, Aidid’s network of drug-addled, Khat-dealing gun runners had taken over Mogadishu and were doing everything they could to oppress any and all rival clans, including that of Omar, the Majeerteen. In other words, we were sent halfway across the world to help protect people just like Omar and her family. Nineteen incredible men gave their lives defending her country while serving ours. They deserve to be lauded for their service, not attacked for it.
I am thankful Omar and her family and countless others were able to escape to neighboring Kenya while we fought to protect those left behind, but I simply cannot comprehend her attitude towards those of us who fought to protect her country and countrymen from warlords who plunged Somalia only further into violence and starvation. I am glad that Omar can now enjoy the very freedoms we fought to protect, like the freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion affirmed in the U.S. Constitution, but I don’t understand why she uses those freedoms to slur the men and women of the U.S. military who made her security and liberty a reality.
The simple truth is that Omar enjoys the fruits of American combat deaths, yet she can’t even bring herself to acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice that was made on her behalf, either as a Somali or an American. Her clan didn’t stand a chance against Aidid and Habar Gidirs, so I don’t blame her for leaving. But I do blame her for attacking those of us who had zero personal interest or investment in her nation for doing our jobs on behalf of our country. And I blame her for smearing American servicemen because we answered the call of our nation to address the violent barbarism of hers.
Unlike Omar, I’m not a politician. I don’t have power or influence. I don’t have a vote in Congress or the ability to direct America’s foreign policy. I’m just one of the men who strapped it on as a member of Task Force Ranger and went into harm’s way to help bring peace and security to her and her people. And let me tell you, she missed a helluva fight. Sergeant Major Kyle E. Lamb (retired) spent more than 21 years with the United States Army, most of those years with U.S. Army Special Operations.

7 Glaring Omissions In The Mueller Report That Kill Its Credibility,thefederalist.com,Ben Weingarten,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/7-glaring-omissions-mueller-report-kill-credibility/,"By Ben Weingarten April 23, 2019
Robert Mueller’s special counsel was presented to the American public as unimpeachable. From its beginning, a distinct minority in politics and media, including several Federalist writers, were skeptical, citing the special counsel’s past prosecutorial abuses , the past alleged misconduct of its pivotal investigators, and the team’s peculiar partisan makeup .
Once in action, its seemingly limitless powers , heavy-handed usage of such powers, and more questionable if not dubious indictments , far removed from “collusion,” seemed to confirm our worst fears. While there is much within the Mueller report that further suggests this skepticism was well-founded, what is perhaps most probative is what the report omitted .
The following are seven of the most glaring omissions from the collusion section of the redacted Mueller report—since collusion, not obstruction, was the theory from which the investigation stemmed. 1. No Attempt to Grapple with the Investigation’s Troubling Underpinnings
Russiagate in many ways appears to be the fruit of a poisonous tree of epic proportions. Allegations of a treasonous Russian conspiracy led to beyond novel legal theories, including the ludicrous invocation of the Logan Act, pervasive unmasking, spying on a presidential campaign by a political adversary based in part on a salacious and unverified dossier gleaned from sketchy Russian sources by a foreign agent and paid for by an opposition campaign, chicanerous circularity in the warrants backing the spying, the use of informants to perhaps entrap campaign members, a deluge of leaks (some of which were illegal), and much else.
We can layer on top of these malevolent acts the biases, ethical infractions, outright criminality, and clear double standards applied by law enforcement figures common to the Trump-Russia and Hillary Clinton emails investigations.
The collusion section of the Mueller special counsel report barely addresses any of the foregoing. How could such an investigation have any credibility without dealing with any, if not all of these issues? 2. No Discussion of Whether the Special Counsel’s Appointment Was Legitimate
From the special counsel’s inception, former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy and others have harped on a single fundamental question: Was the special counsel appointed in accordance with Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations?
A special counsel must be appointed based on a criminal investigation. The Mueller special counsel stemmed from a counterintelligence investigation. A special counsel’s scope must be tailored to “a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated.” The Mueller special counsel order did not seem to adhere to this standard, and in practice, its scope was virtually unlimited .
The Mueller report does not even attempt to address this basic challenge to its legitimacy. Nor does it deal with the arguable conflicts of interest and improper actions taken by those associated with its creation, including former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe , former FBI director James Comey , and the man overseeing the special counsel, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—who, as Sean Davis points out , was a participant, witness, and perhaps target of the investigation himself. 3. No Discussion of Special Counsel’s Perceived Bias
The appearance of conflict based upon the composition of the special counsel team is striking. To highlight the affiliations of just a few members: Andrew Weissmann attended Hillary Clinton’s election night 2016 party and cheered on Obama DOJ holdover and former acting attorney general Sally Yates’ defying of a directive from President Trump.
Jeannie Rhee represented Hillary Clinton in a lawsuit regarding her private emails, as well as the Clinton Foundation, and previously served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the Obama administration. Aaron Zebley defended former Hillary Clinton staffer Justin Cooper, who installed her infamous private email server.
Democrats with deep ties to the administration under which the Russia investigations commenced, as well as Donald Trump’s presidential opponent, predominated in the special counsel’s office. Meanwhile, Mueller, as former FBI director, was a creature of the political establishment, and the institutions from which the investigations sprung. That his report does not grapple with any of the misconduct of the high-ranking individuals behind those investigations in and of itself raises questions.
One would think Mueller would have at least sought to create the appearance of neutrality among the investigators, especially given the anti-Trump biases exposed in the investigations preceding it. Yet Mueller did not, nor did he apparently feel it necessary to address this issue in his report. In fact, he fails even to discuss the circumstances surrounding the removal from his team of its most outspoken Trump hater known to the public, fired FBI agent Peter Strzok. 4. Skating Over the Papadopoulos Predicate for the Collusion Investigations
The Mueller report asserts that the investigation into collusion began when a foreign official (presumably unnamed former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer) told the FBI that Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos conveyed to him that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton that could help the Trump campaign. There is not even an attempt to grapple with the theory that Papadopoulos was set up, based on sketchy approaches from U.S. government informants and foreign counterparts who seemed to be fishing for validation from Papadopoulos that he had knowledge about this Russian “dirt.”
The focus of Papadopoulos’ contacts is Joseph Mifsud, who is described as “a London-based professor who had connections to Russia…” The Mueller report omits that Mifsud, who made the original claim to Papadopoulos about Russian dirt that Papadopoulos then regurgitated, also had extensive ties to Western intelligence agencies .
Was Mifsud planting this information on Papadopoulos? On whose behalf? Meanwhile, such contacts seem an awfully thin starting point for such a critical investigation. Yet the Mueller report fails to give a thorough explanation for why Papadopoulos’ contacts justified the start of the Trump-Russia investigation. 5. Never Mentions Steele or His Dossier in the ‘Collusion’ Section
Amazingly, in spite of the centrality of former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele’s so-called dossier to former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant applications, and the dossier’s dissemination across the highest levels of the intelligence community and law enforcement, neither Steele nor his dossier are mentioned once in the collusion section of the Mueller report. Steele and his “reporting” solely appear in the obstruction section of the report, largely in passing.
The paucity of attention to Steele’s work—and its origin, how and to whom it was disseminated, and what role it played in the “collusion” investigation—smacks of an attempt to downplay its significance. 6. Excluding Relevant Information About Numerous Actors
It is simply stunning the level of exculpatory evidence or at least needed context the Mueller report omits. While Steele and his dossier merit their own section, here are several other significant examples: Steele’s benefactor and Fusion GPS colleague, its founder Glenn Simpson, are never mentioned by name. Relatedly, critical information about Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is missing. In relevant passages about Veselnitskaya and the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower “bombshell” turned dud meeting she led, the Mueller special counsel fails to mention that Veselnitskaya (i) worked with Fusion GPS on behalf of Russian clients, and (ii) met with Simpson the morning of the Trump Tower meeting, as well as the night before and after it. Was the Trump Tower meeting, as journalist Lee Smith has hypothesized , a setup? The Mueller report omits the critical details that would underpin such a theory. Also unclear, and undisclosed, is why the Justice Department granted Veselnitskaya special entry to the United States multiple times in 2015 and 2016. In discussing Page’s background , the Mueller report notes his contacts with Russian agents, who supposedly tried to recruit him as an asset, beginning in 2013. The report notes that those agents were charged by U.S. authorities in 2015. What the Mueller report omits is that Page effectively served as an FBI asset in helping the bureau make the case against at least one of the agents. Further, one of the agents charged described Page in a secret recording as an “idiot.” Are not these facts relevant when Page was put under FISA surveillance and treated as a traitor? The Mueller report describes Felix Sater as a “New York-based real estate advisor” who worked with and lobbied disgraced former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen extensively in an effort to execute the Trump Tower Moscow project, touting its political benefits and the ability to garner support from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Not mentioned is Sater’s colorful background : The Soviet Union-born Sater spun a stock swindling conviction into a lengthy career as a major CIA, DIA, and FBI asset, participating in numerous critical operations. Was Sater planted in the Trump organization? While he disputes it, should not the special counsel have included this full background, and sought to remove all doubt? The Mueller report ties former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Russia by way of his prior work for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Not mentioned: Deripaska had served as an asset to Mueller’s FBI dating back to 2009; he was sought out by senior DOJ official Bruce Ohr and FBI in 2015 to help on organized crime investigations; FBI agents reportedly floated the theory of Trump-Russia collusion to Deripaska two months before the 2016 election, which Deripaska dismissed out of hand. None of this was mentioned in the Mueller report. Why? The Mueller report references Roger Stone and Trump campaign advisor Michael Caputo’s contacts with a Russian citizen named Henry Oknyansky. Oknyansky and an associate supposedly came to Stone by way of Caputo seeking to sell “derogatory information” on Hillary Clinton. Stone rebuffed them. Left unstated: Oknyansky, according to federal court filings and 14 visa waivers , has been an FBI informant for nearly two decades. Did he approach the Trump campaign in such a capacity? Last but not least, intelligence informant on the Trump campaign Stefan Halper , who made contact with both Papadopoulos and Page, is never mentioned in the Mueller report. 7. Raising Potential Russia Violations about Trump Not Applied to Clinton
The Mueller report explores the novel theory that the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign officials and Veselnitskya could have had campaign finance law implications. While it ultimately declines to assert any such violations, it notes:
[C]andidate-related opposition research given to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute a contribution to which the foreign-source ban could apply. A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision of funds, but also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns frequently conduct and pay for opposition research. A foreign entity that engaged in such research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things of value.
The above well describes the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funding of the Steele dossier. On this basis, and considering Rosenstein’s desire to “ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” should not the special counsel’s office have investigated the Clinton campaign for campaign finance violations associated with the Steele dossier?
The special counsel appears to have purposely sought to exclude any details pointing to an attempt to frame the Trump campaign by doctoring a Trump-Russia collusion narrative and entrapping campaign members, in spite of the fact there was no collusion, and ample evidence backing such a theory.
It simply ignored the real or perceived deficiencies of the special counsel’s investigation. It also refused to call into question any of the defects associated with the investigations that preceded it.
These takeaways challenge the idea that the special counsel engaged in anything resembling an intellectually honest, objective, and good faith investigation. Rather, it would seem to indicate that wittingly or unwittingly, this was more politicized smear job and de facto coverup.
Then, although “collusion” was the starting point for the special counsel’s investigation, when the Mueller team found none it nevertheless proceeded to obstruction. But there was nothing to obstruct. The Mueller special counsel could have ended its report at Volume I because absent Volume I there could be no Volume 2 .
By presenting the collusion section as it did, similarly to the obstruction section, the counsel damaged the Trump administration to the greatest extent possible without affirming its criminality. It seems that Mueller pulled a Comey .
We must have a thorough investigation of the investigators. The growing cacophony of attacks on Attorney General William Barr are a testament to it.

"If We Cancel Kate Smith, We Must Cancel The New York Yankees",thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/cancel-kate-smith-must-cancel-new-york-yankees/,"April 23, 2019 By David Marcus
It was announced this week that both the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Flyers would stop using their traditional recorded version of Kate Smith singing “God Bless America” during their games. This happened after it surfaced that Smith had performed songs now considered racist during during her hey day in the 1930s. The Flyers, with whom Smith is more closely aligned as the good luck charm for their 1974 Stanley Cup run, even removed a statue of her from the Philadelphia sports complex.
In a brilliant monologue, sports commentator Jason Whitlock broke down the absurdity of these moves. The whole video is worth watching. Among other things, Whitlock points out that the song “That’s Why The Darkies Were Born,” recorded by Smith in the 1930s, was satire that was also performed by black civil rights legend Paul Robeson. I hope Robeson, one of the most important black figures of the 20th century, won’t have to meet this same fate. This is damn well said by @WhitlockJason on insane “God Bless America” singer controversy. pic.twitter.com/7roaE2M1eU

But I would like to focus for a moment on the New York Yankees, which is arguably the most important sports franchise in the world. The irony of this team cancelling Smith for actions she took almost a century ago that are only mildly problematic, while their own team refused to hire black ballplayers, is astounding.
Smith sang a silly song. The Yankees systematically denied qualified black baseball players the right to make a good a living for more than half a century. So why is Smith being exiled while the Bronx Bombers go along like nothing happened? The answer is that throwing Smith under the bus more than 40 years after her death costs nothing. It is the empty virtue signaling that corporate America prefers to reflecting on their actions.
If we must lose Smith — if her statues must be taken down, if her songs must be silenced — then how do we justify allowing modern players, including black players, to wear the uniform of a team that denied black Americans agency and personhood? Any fair treatment of this situation would require that the Yankee pinstripes be retired right along side Smith.
Amidst the controversy, Stephen Smith of ESPN chimed in to try to explain why banishing Kate Smith is acceptable. His co-panelist Will Cain argued that if we go down this road of dragging everyone who did something inappropriate nearly a century ago, who will be left? He even pointed out that maybe Barack Obama should be cancelled for his bigoted views on gay marriage, and that was only a decade ago. Smith thought he had an answer.
He said, “That’s pretty d-mn easy for you to say, because you’re not the offended party. It’s real easy for the group that is not the offended party to take that position.” Cain replied, “There will always be an offended party, Stephen A, and they’ll make that argument to you one day.” Count on it. . @stephenasmith , @maxkellerman and @willcain discuss teams distancing themselves from singer Kate Smith amid claims of racism. pic.twitter.com/fMU7TlyGp0
— First Take (@FirstTake) April 22, 2019
Smith’s deeply misguided point seems to be that if some group of people are offended — and it’s not entirely clear who actually is offended by Kate Smith — then their destructive desires must be entertained and acted upon. No discussion is needed, no context is required, no good works come into play. Just tear down the statue and throw the offender into the dustbin of history.
Fair enough. I am deeply offended by the fact that the New York Yankees refused to field a black player for the first half of the 20th century. Don’t tell me that’s just how it was. Don’t tell me it was the rule. Branch Rickey and the Brooklyn Dodgers had the courage to break that rule in the 1940s, well before the beloved Yankees did. How can this be forgiven? How can we celebrate their legacy while Kate Smith’s is destroyed?
The only fair and just thing to do here is for the New York Yankees franchise to fold, along with all but the expansion Major League Baseball franchises that came into being after integration. We can replace them quickly with new teams, teams that never denied black people the right to play. If Kate Smith is being cancelled for her actions 80 years ago, then so must the New York Yankees be.
These are the rules. Well, sort of. These are the rules when it doesn’t cost anybody any money. These are the rules when we decide to deride the memory of a woman who achieved greatness at a time when that was very hard.
She immortalized a second national anthem, and raised millions to support the war effort in World War II. Yet she is a problem for singing a satirical song. But Joe DiMaggio is a hero even though he consented to outright racism that helped him secure his job. Let’s end the Yankees. Please sign my petition.

Stop Assuming The Intellectual Dark Web Is A Political Movement,thefederalist.com,Free Expression,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/stop-assuming-intellectual-dark-web-political-movement/,"By Libby Emmons April 23, 2019
The Intellectual Dark Web (IDW) has been badly misunderstood by thinkers on both the left and right of the political spectrum. Perhaps the problem is assuming that people who malign this group of classically liberal pundits are thinking, because in many ways, that’s exactly the opposite of what they’re doing.
Justin Charity, a political writer for The Ringer, recently wrote an attempted takedown of the IDW crowd. He posited that these guys like Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and Claire Lehmann are always complaining about political correctness, restrictive speech rules on college campuses, cancel culture, wokeness, and wrongthink.
Charity writes:
The term ‘political correctness’ unites conservatives, libertarians, and vintage liberals in defense of various comedians, rappers, and columnists; and now ‘wrongthink’ unites conservatives and libertarians in defense of George Zimmerman and Alex Jones. ‘Wrongthinkers’ aren’t frustrated with liberals who have somehow failed to discover them, their biases, their anxieties, and their ideas; ‘wrongthinkers’ are frustrated with liberals who have declined to take their ideas and their style seriously in the first place.
Instead of reading the work put forth by IDW outlets like Quillette (for which I am a contributor), some leftists assume that, because the writers and journals don’t jump on board with progressive ideology, they must be alt-right. Meanwhile, conservatives know these IDW cats are not particularly conservative. So what are they? Those who classify themselves as part of this group would say, first and foremost, that they are critical thinkers, proponents of no ideology, beholden to no tribe.
When the left took a more progressive turn, and branded critical identity theory as a guideline for perspective, policy, morality, and social interaction, classical liberals—who believe first and foremost in the rights of the individual and the necessity of critical thought—found they had no place left to call home within the party. These intellectuals became politically homeless. They were reading articles about the problems inherent in whiteness, how men and women were interchangeable based on feelings, how relative oppression levels shape everything, and about how Western culture is apparently the perpetration of pure evil. How the Intellectual Dark Web Took Hold
As the English-speaking intellectual world tightened up due to globalism, social media, the emergence of international online journals and podcasts, and the cross-pollination of writers and ideas, the IDW began to take shape. Writers who dissect ideas for a living were aghast to find that the work they had been doing was now to be viewed through lenses that had nothing to do with intellectual rigor, but were entirely about emotional realities based in grievance, oppression, and identity.
Using these theories as the exclusive basis for how to think about governance, economics, foreign affairs, social policy, and the humanities is intellectually lazy at best and veering towards malevolence at worst. Writing in The New York Times, Bari Weiss and Damon Winter characterized the loose affiliation of IDW pundits this way:
Most simply, [the IDW] is a collection of iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities who are having a rolling conversation — on podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, and in sold-out auditoriums — that sound unlike anything else happening, at least publicly, in the culture right now. Feeling largely locked out of legacy outlets, they are rapidly building their own mass media channels.
Academia tightened up. Contrarian academics weren’t getting published. The gatekeepers who put out the journals and books had to be circumvented. Intellectuals who were being shut out of academia had to take hold of the means of production and get into online platforms. This is how they landed on YouTube, in podcasts, and creating their own blogs and journals. The Classical Notion of Free Speech
Liberalism once claimed freedom of speech as its cornerstone. For those who come from either left or right and veer into the milieu of the IDW, it is the classical primacy of free speech that compels them. The reason the IDW is cast as conservative is because conservatives and libertarians are the ones currently advocating for free speech at all costs, even if what’s being said is vile. This used to be the domain of the left, which stuck to ideas such as “I despise your views, but I respect your right to have them,” (Jules Feiffer’s “Little Murders”).
Leftists en masse have since abandoned free speech as a driving principle in favor of an ideology that would penalize speech either by law or social disapprobation. This is what the IDW is fighting. These classical liberals, who believe in personal responsibility, rationalism, logic, and critical thinking, but not entirely aligned with contemporary conservative views, Donald Trump, or trans ideology or privilege theory, are a roundly misinterpreted group.
It is not, as Charity writes, that the IDW thinkers are frustrated that contemporary liberals don’t take their ideas seriously, but that their ideas used to be considered classically liberal ideas. Now the ideas of the IDW are too nuanced for the leftists, who are more comfortable shouting slogans and rattling off feelings-based position points that are often contradictory.
Uri Harris, writing for Quillette , recently asked if the IDW is ideologically diverse. He cites a recent, non-rigorous survey of some notable IDW thinkers to show that they personally tend to link with far-left ideas, while pointing out that these thinkers mostly end up speaking with, and on, conservative platforms.
Yet Harris is asking the wrong question. Political ideology has no claim to the IDW, because political perspective is not the driving thought behind the movement. Rational Thought Contradicts Today’s Progressive Dogma
The shifting sands of progressive ideology, where morality shifts depending on the level of oppression of the person holding the moral view or the relative privilege being wielded in service to a moral perspective, does not meld with rational thought. In fact, recently many on the left have begun asserting that rationalism itself is a racist concept, born of whiteness in the Enlightenment, and that its shackles need to be cast off. Some years ago, the very concept of debate was countered by student groups who attended debates, then refused to debate according to the standard terms, instead throwing down spoken word on the basis that the structure of debate itself was racist.
What can intellectuals do when everything they believe in regarding individual liberty is recast as cultural imperialism? They find themselves cast out, politically homeless, and yes, aghast when the very foundations upon which they have ever thought everything—foundations based in philosophy, dialectical theory, Kantian metaphysics, Judeo-Christian morality, and then thought about and rethought again for clarity toward human equality—are thrown out for no other reason than that those who conceived of these things are now considered oppressors.
The Intellectual Dark Web is an attempt to think clearly, as objectively as possible, with an awareness of potential biases, in an upholding of modernist critical thinking. Those who fall within this group do not share political perspectives because it is not a political movement. IDW is an intellectual movement, where individual freedom is paramount, free speech is non-negotiable, and rational, critical thought is the only reasonable way to discern anything about either the natural world or the self. The IDW is not in service to an ideology, because it questions the basis of any and all ideologies.
That is what makes it a threat to progressivism. The alt-right reaps a benefit from the IDW merely because the IDW does not believe in free speech restriction. But the right should be aware that the compulsion to not censor speech does not equal advocacy of their views, but just an acknowledgement of their right to have them.

Sanders Thinks The Boston Marathon Bomber Should Be Able To Vote From Prison,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/sanders-harris-think-boston-marathon-bomber-able-vote-prison/,"April 23, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
In his CNN town hall on Monday night, Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT) said convicted criminals, including those who committed acts of sexual assault or terrorism like the Boston Marathon bomber, should have the right to vote.
Ignoring the fact that these individuals have violated public trust and, in some cases, taken away their fellow neighbor’s right to vote by murdering them, Sanders argued criminals’ right to vote is inherent to democracy.
“I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy,” he said. “Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away, you’re running down a slippery slope.”
“I believe even if they are in jail, they’re paying the price to society, that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy,” Sanders added.
Sanders’ home state of Vermont is one of two states that allows people vote while they’re in prison.
When CNN anchor Don Lemon asked Senator Kamala Harris whether she believes people in prison should have the right to vote, she said she was open to it.
“I think we should have that conversation,” Harris nodded.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg broke with other 2020 presidential hopefuls when asked the same question in his CNN Town Hall on Monday night.
“No. I don’t think so,” he said. “Part of the punishment when you are convicted of a crime and you’re incarcerated is you lose certain rights. You lose your freedom.”
Many U.S. court cases, including at the Supreme Court, have upheld these voting restrictions as constitutional, citing the 14th Amendment and the government’s right to withhold the right to vote due to “participation in rebellion, or other crime.” Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

Almost Everything You Know About Alcohol Prohibition Is Wrong,thefederalist.com,Timothy Hsiao,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/almost-everything-know-alcohol-prohibition-wrong/,"By Timothy Hsiao April 23, 2019
It’s generally accepted that alcohol prohibition in the United States was an abysmal failure. Alcohol consumption remained relatively unchanged, the black market thrived, and the homicide rate skyrocketed, all of which eventually lead to the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. According to many, the lesson to be learned from this experiment is that government initiatives to ban certain things—whether it be marijuana, pornography, gambling, or guns—are always doomed to failure.
This, however, is flat-out wrong . The actual data tell us a very different story. Yes, alcohol prohibition did fail, but not for the reasons that many think. Accordingly, the failure of alcohol prohibition cannot be used to justify legalizing other goods or services.
Now, before you jump to assumptions and accuse me of being a puritan, I’m not advocating that we return to alcohol prohibition. My point is simply that we cannot use the failure of alcohol prohibition to argue against other kinds of prohibition. There are many good and convincing arguments against, say, gun prohibition , but comparing it to the failure of alcohol prohibition is not one of them. We should not use bad arguments for good conclusions.
For drug prohibition especially, alcohol prohibition may actually teach us a lesson in the opposite direction. Alcohol prohibition may have failed politically, but in terms of reducing overall consumption, it was a qualified success. Thus, on an issue like marijuana legalization, there are good historical reasons to think that keeping marijuana illegal would in fact be effective at reducing both overall distribution and consumption. Prohibition Did Reduce Alcohol Use and Abuse
As Duke University economist Philip Cook explains in his carefully researched book “ Paying the Tab ,” the evidence shows that Prohibition had a clear effect in reducing overall alcohol consumption. Deaths from cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholism (which are proxies for alcohol consumption) fell dramatically. Life insurance companies reported declines in alcohol-related deaths. According to Harvard criminologist Mark Moore , the best estimates are that consumption fell by around 30-50 percent. Moore also notes that hospitalizations for alcohol psychosis and arrests for drunk and disorderly conduct also declined.
Alcohol prohibition in the United States was not a single event. National prohibition was the culmination of a number of smaller alcohol control measures enacted during the 1910s, starting with state prohibitions and followed by wartime restrictions enacted during World War I. These measures all had the effect of facilitating a downward trend in consumption.
Although consumption did start to rise towards the later years of Prohibition, per capita ethanol consumption rates remained lower than what they were at during the 1911-1914 baseline period used by most scholars. Consumption levels during Prohibition never exceeded pre-Prohibition levels—indeed, that did not occur until the 1970s, which is perhaps a testament to its lasting effects.
So why do many people falsely think that Prohibition had no effect on drinking rates (or that it even increased them)? The answer is that while overall consumption fell, rates varied between regions and social classes. Prohibition was most effective in reducing consumption among working class and low-income individuals ( who tend the most susceptible to alcohol-related harms ). Prohibition made it more difficult and expensive for these individuals to obtain alcohol through illegal channels, so many decided to forego it. But for those in the upper class who were able to absorb the costs, Prohibition’s effects were less pronounced.
Thus, to journalists who reported on the proliferation of speakeasies, it seemed as if “everyone” continued drinking. But they were only observing the behavior of a segment of the population: namely, those who were able to afford illegal alcohol. They did not pay attention to the noticeable change in drinking habits among those whom alcohol harms the most, and for whom Prohibition is the most likely to benefit. These individuals could not easily obtain illegal alcohol, so their drinking levels plummeted.
Now obviously Prohibition did not completely eliminate alcohol consumption. It did, however, have a fairly significant effect on reducing it. Thus, it seems that with respect to alcohol consumption, prohibition was not a failure. In fact, it was a success .
Yet some would still consider this a failure: the mere fact that consumption continued (even if it was significantly decreased) shows that prohibition doesn’t work. But this is a ridiculous standard. By that same line of reasoning, laws against murder, rape, and theft do not “work” because murders, rape, and theft still happen despite being illegal. If perfection is our benchmark for success, then nothing would ever be successful. Prohibition does not need to be perfect, it just needs to be effective. Prohibition Did Not Increase Crime
Many associate the Prohibition era with a sharp rise in crime. Images of shootouts, turf wars, and assassinations immediately come to mind.
But actually, there’s little evidence for a rampant crime wave. First, the homicide rate experienced larger increases during the pre-Prohibition period between 1900 and 1910 than during all of Prohibition, which is not what we would expect if Prohibition were a catalyst of crime. That said, the apparent increase in homicide during the entire period of 1900 to 1933 may be entirely illusory. According to sociologist Douglas Lee Eckberg, rising homicide rates are likely the result of bad data collection : the number of jurisdictions whose homicides were being counted increased, which gave the appearance of a spike in homicide.
Building on Eckberg’s findings, economist Emily Owens found that “murder rates did not increase when alcohol markets were criminalized ,” and that “observed crime trends during the early 20th century are primarily explained by demographic changes.” Other factors, such as societal changes occasioned by World War I, immigration, and increased urbanization during the Roaring Twenties, largely accounted for the change in crime rates. In fact, Owens found that the “passage of legislation banning the commercial sale of alcohol had a net negative effect on the homicide rate,” meaning that alcohol prohibition may have reduced the homicide rate!
These findings were corroborated by Rowan University economist Brandon Livingston , who found that “alcohol prohibition decreased homicides for two years after enactment, but had no effect after two years.” There may have undoubtedly been some crimes that were made possible only because of Prohibition, but the evidence suggests that prohibition had no overall effect on crime. Indeed, it may have even reduced it. The Black Market Doesn’t Mean Prohibition Failed
Yes, there was a black market for alcohol during Prohibition. Whenever there is any kind of Prohibition, there is bound to be a black market. But the mere presence of a black market does not mean that Prohibition is a failure (unless we think of success in terms of absolute perfection, which I’ve argued is silly).
Prohibition is a deterrent to behavior. If you threaten sellers with legal penalties for selling a product, they will, of course, be less willing to sell it. This in turn makes it more difficult to obtain the product. The more difficult it is to obtain it, the more expensive it becomes. The more expensive it becomes, the less willing people are to obtain and use it. In essence, Prohibition drives up the cost of a given product, which in turn reduces demand.
Highly motivated individuals may not be deterred by this, but the barriers put in place by Prohibition do have a real effect at reducing overall proliferation of a given product, especially among those who are not highly motivated.
National alcohol prohibition increased the price of illegal alcohol by a factor of two or more. While it was still possible to obtain alcohol through illegal channels, individuals were overall less motivated to do so because it cost them substantially more. It is should come as no surprise, then, that overall consumption went down. Many judged that it just simply wasn’t worth it.
So while the black market did “flourish,” alcohol was still less available than it would be if it were legal. The existence of underground black markets did not mean that Prohibition was a failure, any more than the continued existence of thieves means that laws against theft are failures. So Why Did Prohibition Fail?
Prohibition ultimately failed for political reasons . Although it did have an enforcement problem, this wasn’t due to its impracticality. The Volstead Act contained a “joint enforcement” provision that required states to work together with the federal government to enforce prohibition. However, many “wet” states simply refused to enforce the law, while others repealed laws that were designed to facilitate enforcement.
Until Herbert Hoover took office in 1929, the federal government did little to allocate manpower and funds to enforce Prohibition. The result was that Prohibition enforcement efforts were chronically undermanned and underfunded . This lack of attention to enforcement—and not its impracticality—constituted the Achilles’ heel of prohibition. Had the Volstead Act been written differently, this problem could have been avoided.
The final blow came when the Great Depression changed voters’ priorities. In the midst of economic hardship, it was argued that repeal would generate tax revenues which could then be used to support struggling families. This same argument is used today to justify marijuana legalization. In the case of alcohol prohibition, however, initial tax collections after repeal fell very short of projections, which should make us think twice when applying this same argument to marijuana.
Even after repeal, the “dry” cause retained a great deal of support. In the late 1930s, more than 40 percent of Americans supported prohibition, and an equal number indicated that they abstained from alcohol completely. That number remained relatively unchanged even until 1960, when 38 percent of Americans described themselves as abstainers. Moreover, even after national prohibition was repealed, many states retained state-level prohibitions for some time. It wasn’t until 1966 that Mississippi became the final state to legalize the sale of alcohol.
What can we learn from all of this? Well, the chief lesson is that we should stop comparing alcohol prohibition to other kinds of prohibition. Yes, it did fail, but the reasons for its failure cannot be extrapolated to other forms of prohibition. Instead, each issue should be evaluated on its own merits. Prohibiting guns or drugs may be very bad policies. But if they are, they’re not bad because they can’t work. On the contrary, history tells us that prohibition can and has worked. We should rely on better arguments. Timothy Hsiao is a professor of humanities and philosophy at Grantham University. His website is http://timhsiao.org"
Sri Lanka Attacks Highlight Growing Worldwide Persecution Of Christians,thefederalist.com,Kenny Xu,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/sri-lanka-attacks-highlight-growing-worldwide-persecution-christians/,"By Kenny Xu April 23, 2019
On one of the holiest days of the Christian calendar, on Easter Sunday suicide bombers attacked and killed more than 200 people worshipping at Christian churches in three separate locations in Sri Lanka. While no group has taken responsibility for these actions, the tactics were borrowed from jihadist playbooks, and Islamic State supporters have cheered on the bombing, calling it “revenge” for past injustices against Muslims.
These attacks are only the latest and deadliest in an uptick of violence against the Christian minorities in Sri Lanka, who make up 17 percent of the populace. In 2018, Buddhist extremists burned down both Muslim-owned shops and Christian churches across the country, while the state police and civil authorities were criticized for not adopting stronger measures to protect the religious minorities targeted.
Violence against Christians spreads far beyond Sri Lanka. Pew Research lists Christians as the most harassed faith in the world, with significant levels of persecution in 144 countries, according to 2016 data. People of all faiths should care about this, because the world climate is growing increasingly hostile to religious freedom as religious fundamentalism creeps into national politics and people increasingly define themselves in opposition to other people’s faiths.
The idea of religious toleration, a proud feature of some parts of Middle Eastern history, is losing currency among a fundamentalist wave in the region. Throughout the twenty-first century, more than 2 million Christians have been displaced from countries like Egypt, Syria, and Iraq due to the effects of Islamic fundamentalism and sectarian violence in the region. Few groups have suffered as Christian minorities have due to the rise of Islamist political parties such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and ISIS in Libya, with arson , displacement , and even beheadings occurring in these persecutory domains.
It is not just backwards Islamist regimes who are persecuting Christians, either. China’s authoritarian atheist government, fearful of the revolutionary potential of Christian minorities, is tightening its restrictions on the country’s Christians, enforcing its laws against Chinese “house churches” (churches that operate outside the purview of the official state church ) and evangelistic speech with greater severity than in previous years.
South Asia is also becoming a hotbed for anti-Christian persecution. According to Open Doors USA, an organization tracking Christian persecution across the world, Indian Christians now face an “extreme” level of persecution, up from “high” just five years ago, due to spikes in Hindu extremism targeting churches, as well as halfhearted government responses failing to protect these minorities. Open Doors USA now claims with evidence that one in three Christians in all of Asia currently face some form of persecution.
Even in the enlightened West, religious freedom is facing its biggest challenge in centuries. Journalists have reported a record 47 documented desecrations of church property in France for February 2019. In Germany, three-quarters of resettled Christian refugees claim to experience persecution, mostly from the Muslim refugees which surround them. The number of attacks on Catholic churches in the whole of Europe is already up 25 percent compared to the number of attacks during a similar period last year.
While many European journalists rightly blame mass migration from majority-Muslim countries for these religious persecution issues, migration is not the only factor here. Just as significant is Western Europe’s culture of enforced secularism, a world where religious speech is policed and religious symbols (such as burqas ) are not allowed in French public schools or German business settings.
Western Europe no longer inspires religious freedom. Western Europe is instead now a land where public religion is actively discouraged, a world where religious differences are often hashed out in the dark rather than debated in the daylight.
No matter your faith, we should be concerned about the state of religious freedom in the world today. For thousands of years, the world had little concept of religious freedom—you were whatever religion your prince was, cuius regio, eius religio —but the death of millions in the Thirty Years’ War in Europe finally shook the continent into adopting rudimentary principles of religious toleration, to keep everyone from slaughtering each other.
These principles were eventually condensed into a single line in the U.S. Constitution, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” That’s the first line of the First Amendment.
It took thousands of years and millions of lives to enshrine the principle of freedom of religion into the liberal tradition of governance. Just when we Americans thought we could export this principle to the rest of the world, instead we are seeing it crumble before our very eyes, with Christian minorities harassed and persecuted for their faith in ways we’d never dreamt of.
Christian minorities are just one religious group facing persecution across the world. One only need to remember the horrific shooting of 50 Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand to understand that religious persecution cuts across all faiths. Many of the same attacks against Christians are made against Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jewish minorities all over the world. Today, however, the horrible Sri Lankan bombings have cast Christian minorities in the world’s tragic spotlight.
The persecution of religious minorities across the world should make all Americans here grateful for our country’s stronger protections religious freedom, despite their legal and cultural erosions. It should remind us that these freedoms are never free, and that they must be guarded jealously against illiberal forces that seek to undermine them in the courts and in the court of public opinion . And it should motivate us to stop being complacent while people of many faiths bear sickening persecution for practicing what they believe. Kenny Xu is a senior Mathematics Major at Davidson College.

The Democratic Presidential Primary Is An Arms Race In Crazy,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/the-democratic-presidential-primary-is-an-arms-race-in-crazy/,"By David Harsanyi April 23, 2019
When asked at a CNN town hall this week if he believed that incarcerated felons should be allowed to vote, socialist presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders responded: “This is a democracy and we have got to expand that democracy, and I believe every single person does have the right to vote.”
What about someone like Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , the Boston Marathon bomber? “Yes,” Sanders went on, “even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say, ‘Well, that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote. Well, that person did that. Not going to let that person vote,’ you’re running down a slippery slope.”
Slippery slope, indeed.
After spending decades incessantly repeating the “America is a democracy” lie—liberals, of course, tend to scoff when you point out this jejune detail —the only logical conclusion, ideologically speaking, is terrorist suffrage, I guess. “Every vote” means every vote.
Now, there’s a rational argument to be made for allowing Americans who have served their time and paid their debt to society to fully participate in American political life. Certainly those who’ve never committed violent crimes shouldn’t have to surrender their civic rights forever. The notion that incarcerated murderers should be weighing in on gun laws or that child molesters should have a say on local school bond issues or that a terrorist’s vote should have an effect on American foreign policy, however, undercuts the liberal contention that casting a ballot is a sacred act.
Most of the cynical anti-republican ideas that Democrats are willing to entertain these days—getting rid of Electoral College , giving children the right to vote , etc.— are popular because gullible activist types believe they would create more Democrats. There’s probably a better way to rally support for the Green New Deal than enlisting the Unabomber’s support. (Then again, when we consider the specifics , maybe not.)
There’s no denying that Sanders’ collectivist ideas have gained traction on the contemporary left. Sanders—a Marxist who spent time in the Soviet Union praising a system that offered no genuine voting rights to anyone; not even to the political prisoners being held in the still functioning-Gulag—could have been the nominee of the Democratic Party in 2016 had the primaries been run “democratically.” He’s certainly not alone.
In this crowded primary field, even allegedly moderate Democrats can’t say “no” to every extreme idea for fear of being cast from the group. The same night as Sanders’ CNN town hall, another presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was asked the same question: “People who are convicted, in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber, on death row, people who are convicted of sexual assault, they should be able to vote?” asked Don Lemon.
“I think we should have that conversation,” Harris responded.
CNN helpfully notes that this was a “noncommittal answer.” Technically, it’s true. I’ve already seen reporters laying the groundwork to rationalize her comments. In fact, I look forward to the 2,000 “fact check” articles next year explaining why the GOP is wrong to tie Harris to this idea. But try, if you can, to imagine a Republican candidate acquiescing to a discussion about the prospects of giving mass-murdering white supremacists a vote, and I’m sure you can understand why no one should regard Harris’ answer as noncommittal. (UPDATE: The next day, after considerable criticism, Harris “ clarified ”— which is to say, changed — her position. We have yet to learn why she felt the need to entertain the idea. )
“Having a conversation” is euphemism for “Sure, I back every puerile and sophomoric idea you socialist crackpots come up with, although I don’t know if I can explicitly do so during the general election, so here’s an unscrupulous political answer that telegraphs my moral support, but also gives me a measure of plausible deniability should I actually win the nomination.”
It’s not just voting voting rights for terrorists. Saying you’re willing to “have a conversation” about any issue is implicit support for the underlying idea. The only question is whether you believe it’s politically feasible. Would Harris have a conversation about legalizing fully automatic firearms? Of course not. Would she be open to having a conversation about banning post-20-week abortions? No. Harris won’t even have a conversation about banning post-abortion abortions . Any deviation from wild-eyed progressivism has the potential to brand you a heretic in this environment.
Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been the leading instigators of this dynamic, but they’re not alone. It’s a group effort. Every time a candidacy lags, the contender will offer a new attention-grabbing plan to confiscate wealth for some socialistic policy proposal. Want to form a commission to develop slavery reparations proposals? Let’s have a conversation . “Free college?” Let’s talk. Nationalize the entire health care industry? Let’s start a dialogue. You want to pass a law that guarantees every American a job? Yep, let’s huddle on it .
How about a plan that eliminates all fossil fuel energy production, the lifeblood of American industry and life, and replace them with windmills, bicycles, and choo choo trains? Nearly every Democratic Party presidential hopeful —including Harris, Sanders, Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Julián Castro, and Beto O’Rourke—says we need to get a conversation going .
Democrats who keep promising groups of people free stuff are just thinking “ outside the box ,” after all. It should be noted that some candidates have avoided the perfunctory habit of injecting legitimacy into every crazy idea. Pete Buttigieg, for example, deserves some credit. When asked about allowing terrorists to vote, he simply said “no.” Maybe others will follow his lead as the party goes off an ideological cliff.
At this point, Republicans should figure out ways to pose questions to Democrats in public and stimulate extremist contagion: Do you support allowing non-citizens voting rights? Do you believe all abortions should be paid for by taxpayers? Do you believe that border walls should be torn down ? Do you think it would be okay for presidents to unilaterally institute bans on fossil fuels to save the earth if Republicans had “ refused to act “?
Let’s have a conversation! "
Niche-ified Pop Culture Could Lead To Either A Renaissance Or A Dark Age,thefederalist.com,Auguste Meyrat,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/niche-ified-pop-culture-lead-either-renaissance-dark-age/,"By Auguste Meyrat April 23, 2019
What happens when the mainstream isn’t mainstream anymore? With online streaming and the digitization of entertainment, it is now so much easier for artists to find their audiences and create a niche.
No longer does a writer, filmmaker, or musician have to defer to the approval of a producer, editor, or some other gatekeeper. He or she can now self-publish, go to YouTube or Soundcloud, and market their creation through social media and gain a following.
This has not necessarily obliterated the gatekeepers, many of whom have adapted to the times and oversee online media, but it has diminished their hold on popular culture. While in the past Americans had little choice but to consume what the handful of major television networks and music companies offered, they now have plenty of alternatives. They have access to nearly every creative product, and, with the help of computer algorithms tracking their selections, can customize their media input.
This has led to niche markets where artists appeal to narrow audiences with highly specific preferences instead of a wider one with a broad set of preferences. Dispensing with most mainstream options, people tend to resort to what is comfortable and agreeable to them, fueling the niche-ification of entertainment. The Death of the Pop Culture Gatekeepers
All this summarizes Emily Jashinky’s argument about this recent evolution of popular culture. At the end, she asks what this change means for our culture. Considering other examples in history of mainstream cultures dividing into niches, the outcome will certainly be mixed. Depending on how people respond, however, the proliferation of alternatives could either contribute a veritable cultural renaissance or accelerate a new dark age.
Long before there was Netflix and Spotify, there was Johannes Gutenberg and Martin Luther. Prior to the Reformation, the Catholic Church unilaterally defined politics, religion, and culture for Christendom. For centuries, kingdoms and empires in Western Europe had few alternatives to the material and spiritual order set by the Catholic Church.
If any leaders, philosophers, writers, or artists had something to say, they needed a churchman’s imprimatur before sharing that thought with others. Those who tried to bypass this process were usually excommunicated, ostracized, or condemned as heretics—and often for good reason, since they threatened the social order with an unapproved, and therefore probably subversive and erroneous, idea.
Once Luther posted his 95 theses and popularized his ideas using Gutenberg’s printing press, the great mainstream that was the Catholic Church broke up into so many tributaries of competing beliefs and theories. People had choices in how and what they worshiped, what they read, and how they wanted to be governed. The Good of the Monoculture
Even though people today learn to look back at this time in purely positive terms, a strictly regulated monoculture had many benefits: civil unity, neighborliness, high standards for arts and letters, and greater spirituality. Unfortunately, these goods accompanied the evils of intellectual stagnation, corruption, and various forms of oppression. The Reformation and printing press reversed (or at least mitigated) these evils, but at the cost of diminishing the virtues.
One can see a parallel tradeoff in modern arts and entertainment in the past decade. People gain in choice and innovation, but they lose common standards and slowly fragment into walled-off niches. Whereas generations in the past could bond over global phenomena like the baby boomers with The Beatles, Gen Xers with “Star Wars,” or millennials with Harry Potter, today’s iGen struggle when one group listens to K-pop and reads manga, another follows people on Twitch and are hyperactive Redditors, while another listens to ’80s New Wave and reads Mojo magazine.
Some may argue that greater choice and alternatives to the mainstream can improve the culture by offering channels for new ideas and promoting healthy competition. After all, the two major political parties will adopt arguments from smaller parties on the fringe in order to better represent constituents and find new solutions to social problems. Similarly, successful painters or chefs can take ideas from other cultures and thereby enrich their paintings or dishes. And, even if the Reformation caused problems for the Catholic Church, it also inspired the Counter-Reformation, which brought about some of the greatest thinkers, artists, and saints that have ever lived.
Then again, these new ideas and competitors may just as well destroy or marginalize the predominating culture. As Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI suggested recently , the Catholic Church’s current scandals are caused by adopting secular values and abandoning orthodoxy. Arguments meant to modernize the church and increase its appeal were sold as reforms, but instead compromised the church and reduced much of its meaning and relevance. As for competition, the Reformation may have brought about great achievements from Catholics, but it also permanently tore Christianity to pieces and paved the way for secular ideologies hostile to religion in the following centuries.
Something similar has happened to the world of fine art. In the past century, rival artistic movements have inspired new masterpieces and expanded the range of creative output, but they have also pushed most art to a point of shallowness and irrelevance. Either art and music become cliché and simplified fodder for mass consumption, or they become a form of quirk meant to appeal to snobs who want to be different. Meanwhile, the true masterpieces remain hidden behind so much overhyped, under-scrutinized garbage. The Scourge of Choice Paralysis
Today’s loss of a mainstream creates a new problem that has no real analogy to the past: choice paralysis . The extreme abundance of choices can turn the pleasurable activity of listening to a song or watching a movie into something stressful. More and more time that should be spent enjoying entertainment is now spent sifting through the endless options—and it is almost certain that a person will make the wrong choice, or at least feel like he did.
To maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of overturning the mainstream, it has become necessary to educate general audiences in matters of taste. With no popular standard to serve as a point of reference, audiences in search of quality entertainment will need the help of critics—people who do the job of sifting, cutting through marketing propaganda, and applying objective standards of appraisal. Otherwise, these audiences will waste their time on so much dreck and be fooled by a compromised algorithm or clever advertisements.
This new deference and attention to critics will also require a general education in the arts. People do not need to become experts, but they should be able to understand the experts and the rules they apply to whatever medium. This means appreciating art and entertainment as disciplines and modes of knowledge, not just forms of pleasure. If people approach entertainment without any knowledge of objective aesthetic values—as many do now—they will select the ones that offer the greatest dopamine rush, setting aside so many works of beauty and brilliance for binge sessions of “Fortnite” and pornography.
Before the cynic tosses aside this whole discussion of art and entertainment as a “first world problem”—which, to some degree, it is—it should be stressed just how much art influences culture. Art informs the imagination, which in turn informs opinions and perceptions, which informs actions and behavior.
It is not unreasonable to judge a culture by its art or a person by her artistic preferences. Art often says much more about a place or a population than economic or scientific statistics do. Consequently, a culture that ceases to treat its art seriously and subordinates it to lower things like politics, pleasure, or commerce will lose its integrity, along with its identity.
With this in mind, there is reason to hope that this new phase in entertainment will be positive. If Americans resist the urge to huddle in niches and use entertainment for validation and pleasure (instead of the better purpose of edification and discovering beauty), then they will continue progressing towards a brighter future with stronger communities.
If they allow computer algorithms and superficial values to guide their media consumption, then all this choice will simply be a perfected form of distraction, dulling the senses and confusing the mind. In a time of so many choices, the one between thoughtful appreciation and mindless consumption will decide everything else. Auguste Meyrat is an English teacher in the Dallas area.

"Yes, ‘Chick Flick’ Is Still A Perfectly Valid Label",thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/chick-flick-is-a-perfectly-valid-label/,"April 23, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
I wanted to walk through Netflix’s viral protest of the term “chick flick” point by point, but that would have required them to display a higher level of coherence. You can read the full Twitter thread here .
Like many positions adopted by contemporary virtue signalers, it seems the company’s social media team started from a cool-sounding conclusion and groped clumsily for ways to get there, guided to their desired destination by the beguiling North Star of wokeness. (Debate over “chick flick,” by the way, is old. The label has rankled scores of easily rankled feminists for decades.)
That said, here’s their central contention: “Overall,” @NetflixFilms proclaimed at the end of a gripping six-tweet thread, “there’s nothing inherently gendered about liking a light-hearted film with a strong female lead and emotional arc. So next time you call something a ‘chick flick,’ you better be referring to Chicken Run.”
“Chicken Run” is an apt reference here. The year of its release probably marked the last time anyone actually used the term “chick flick.” That was 2000. Quick PSA: Can we stop calling films “chick flicks” unless the films are literally about small baby chickens? Here’s why this phrase should absolutely be retired (thread):
— Netflix Film (@NetflixFilm) April 15, 2019
The argument “there’s nothing inherently gendered about liking a light-hearted film with a strong female lead and emotional arc” is just bizarre, and predicated on the ascendant notion there’s something wrong with “gendering” products. Men and women like different things, and our entertainment options should absolutely cater to those divergent interests. But if you don’t buy into that reality, as is increasingly the case on the left, the world you seek is one in which a timeless masterpiece like “Crossroads” would either be advertised unsuccessfully to men or scrapped entirely (a world I hope I’m never alive to see).
Netflix’s anonymous Twitter pundit also complained that “chick flick” is a trivializing categorization, which I suspect is really at the heart of their disgruntlement. I think there’s a legitimate point to be made about slapping the “chick flick” label onto a movie like “Pretty Woman.”
There are absolutely female-led romantic comedies with broad appeal and high quality, to which the “chick flick” label would be misapplied—and with the effect of cheapening the film, as the thread complained. Even something like “Legally Blonde” probably doesn’t deserve the label, if we agree it’s “trivializing.” (I will for the sake of this argument, because I think there are varying perceptions on what it means, and Netflix doesn’t even know whether that point is essential to its own argument anyway.)
But then there are movies like “Crossroads.” Or “The Longest Ride.” Or “A Christmas Prince.” Clearly there’s an entire genre of easy-viewing films geared pretty much exclusively towards women that probably deserve to be trivialized, and perhaps deliberately so in many cases.
They’re the mindless movies that help us unwind after a long week. We like them. We crave them. That doesn’t make women less sophisticated consumers—indeed, there’s a parallel genre for men (“Gone in 60 Seconds,” most of these ), and I don’t think most people would object to the creation of a playfully pejorative term for it either. Gloria Steinem has proposed “prick flick,” but that may be a little graphic.
It’s okay that we have a gendered and trivializing label for these movies because they’re reasonably gendered and reasonably trivial. There may be something to the question of why we only have such a label for women’s films, although my guess would be it has more to do with the convenience of the rhyme than the patriarchy.
As is often the case with feminist complaints like these, disagreement with the cultural construct (think Barbie dolls) seems actually to be more of a discomfort with women’s preferences. Try as they might to free women from the spell of patriarchal social conditioning, something tells me the chick flick will endure. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist.

Violence Against Women Act Would Abuse Battered Women To Destroy Gun Rights,thefederalist.com,Matthew Larosiere,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/violence-women-act-abuse-battered-women-destroy-gun-rights/,"By Matthew Larosiere April 23, 2019
When politicians pass laws to please their bases, we often forget the costs inherent in these acts. “In every age it has been the tyrant who has wrapped himself in the cloak of patriotism, or religion, or both,” Eugene V. Debs, prominent labor activist, remarked in a 1918 speech.
Debs invoked the profound irony through which humans often lose their liberties to thunderous applause. We’re currently facing another potential loss of due process rights for poor Americans if politicians get their way.
Both the government-insulating 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts, and, more recently, the supposedly anti-terrorism 2001 PATRIOT Act stripped Americans of fundamental rights under the guise of a sympathetic cause. Now it’s happening again, as the modified version of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is on its way to a Senate vote . The History of the Act
Originally passed in 1994, the VAWA funded the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, and included several other measures aimed at curbing domestic violence. The act contains a sunset provision and was reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013, never expiring until the government shutdown of 2018-19. The act hadn’t changed much since 1994, except for adding protections for same-sex couples and victims who were unlawful immigrants. Now, though, it’s a different story.
Not everyone is happy with this latest version. The National Rifle Association (NRA) opposes the reauthorization, and has recently taken a considerable amount of heat for doing so. Critics are painting them as heartless for their opposition to a law that ostensibly protects victims. Of course, the NRA being on the receiving end of progressive rage is nothing new, but this time the pro-gun organization is quite right. The new bill contains sweeping changes that would eliminate the fundamental rights of many Americans, disregarding due process.
Three changes stand out as particularly alarming: The elimination of a hearing requirement before civil rights are suspended as a result of a restraining order, the new definition of “intimate partner,” and an expansion into misdemeanor crimes of “stalking.”
Many states will grant a restraining order with little evidence. There are sometimes good reasons for this. Sometimes it might be clear enough that someone is in danger for the state to intervene before anyone is hurt, but revoking someone’s civil rights is a serious— and dangerous —solution, one not to be used lightly. Restraining Orders Don’t Allow for Due Process
The VAWA previously struck a balance here by only removing the gun rights of a person subject to a restraining order if the person was actually notified of a hearing, and had an opportunity to participate in it. This means before a person’s rights were taken, he or she was able to present his or her side of the story—a crucial hallmark of due process. The new version all but eliminates the hearing requirement, expressly contemplating ex parte restraining orders (where the subject person never appears) as automatically removing someone’s rights.
The restraining order problem is compounded by the new definition of “intimate partner,” as the law only to handles situations involving “intimate partners.” The previous definition was pretty logical. It included one’s spouse, former spouse, the parent of one’s child, and cohabiting partners. The new, nearly 200-word definition includes “dating partners” and “former dating partners”—definitions so vague one might wonder if it includes the dog walker.
This is what lawmakers are calling “closing the boyfriend loophole .” This isn’t actually a loophole. The law was intended to address situations where the victim and abuser are in close proximity, where the risk of a repeated attack is high, and thus the severe measures made more sense to protect the purported victim.
This change seriously expands the reach of the provision, far beyond the scope of its original intention. With these two changes, someone’s ex could get a restraining order, and the ex would know nothing about it until receiving notice that his or her rights have been stripped. This result is unacceptable. Stalker Expansion Could Also Spell Trouble
The “stalking” expansion is another modification that seems good at first, but fails a closer reading. Previously, the VAWA prevented anyone who had ever been convicted of crimes of domestic violence from buying or owning a gun, but this now includes misdemeanor crimes of “stalking.” Now, one might agree that there are reasons to keep guns out of the hands of convicted “stalkers,” but there’s a lot more to this change than first meets the eye.
“Stalking” is loosely defined in the law. It includes any crime that “would reasonably be expected to cause emotional distress” to a “domestic partner.” Of course, I probably wouldn’t want to go camping with a convicted “stalker” of any definition, but a misdemeanor conviction under these grounds is a massive departure from crimes of “domestic violence.”
The fact that these are misdemeanor charges is more than a technical distinction. People facing misdemeanor charges are often given less serious treatment, both by disinterested public defenders and fast-and-loose prosecutors more interested in pursuing a conviction than they are the truth. This is especially concerning given the fact that many people facing misdemeanor charges are financially disadvantaged , often unable to afford a good defense. They’re left susceptible to the efforts of slick prosecutors who coerce guilty pleas, even when the state lacked a strong case against them to begin with.
When we think of an appropriate punishment for a misdemeanor offense, we think of jail time under a year and fines—not a permanent deprivation of fundamental rights. That’s a serious punishment. This means that someone convicted of a misdemeanor charge of “stalking” (which, as defined, could include excessive phone calls) at 18, could spend the rest of his or her life volunteering for a battered women’s shelter, helping old ladies cross the street, and feeding unwanted kittens—without ever restoring his or her civil rights. Should that really be part of a misdemeanor conviction? Expansive Changes Should Concern Everyone
Whether you agree with the provisions or not, the fact is that these are significant changes touching many Americans, many of whom may have been convicted years ago and since reformed. Don’t be fooled by attempts to frame gun rights supporters as anti-victim. What these changes do instead is create a new class of victims—poor Americans, who are significantly more likely to face criminal accusation and prosecution without competent legal counsel.
Telling people that they have no right to defend themselves for the rest of their lives sends the message that their lives are worthless. There were reasons to pass the VAWA, and there are still reasons to maintain it. But we must remember what Debs pointed out over a century ago: we can’t let ideologically motivated politicians sneak serious due process violations into popular laws just because the label sounds compelling.

What Research Says About How Religion Affects Your Health,thefederalist.com,Nicole Fisher,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/23/research-says-religion-affects-health/,"By Nicole Fisher April 23, 2019
Religion and spirituality are among the most important of cultural factors, giving structure and meaning to behaviors, value systems, and experiences. Near the holy days of Easter and Pesach, our bodies, minds, and spirit turn to renewing and reaffirming our faith for the year to come.
Consequently, theologians, scientists, and other thinkers have attempted for centuries to understand the effects religion can have on human beings, both mentally and physically. Despite ample reason to believe that faith in a higher power is associated with improved health, very little is still known about the effect religion has on the living body.
Perhaps surprisingly, there is still very little quantitative research published in peer-reviewed journals exploring the relationship between religiosity and health. A primary reason for the lack of institutional knowledge in this area of study is that as the centuries have progressed, scholars in medicine, public health, psychology, sociology, spirituality, religion, economics, and law have all gone to distinct silos.
Subsequently, there is a growing body of research , but it exists in disparate fields, with little overlap addressing the implications for health. There is also much contention about working definitions of terminology like “religious,” “faith,” and “spiritual,” making research difficult to standardize and impossible to randomize. Healing Has Long Been Linked to Religion
That said, the lack of knowledge about links between religious behaviors and health is fascinating given that health care is deeply rooted in religious institutions , and vice versa. Religious organizations built many of the first hospitals, and clergy (supplementing small church wages) were often practicing physicians and medical providers. This was true both in the Middle East and in the American colonies, and included much focus on mental health services , with both positive and negative recorded histories.
As time passed, the link between religion and health care has slowly fallen to the wayside in favor of strict clinical practices and medical protocols. Despite multiple studies over the last several decades concluding that those who are religiously involved live longer, and that many patients welcome spiritual beliefs into their care, this is no longer the norm in America.
For example, researchers at the Mayo Clinic concluded, “Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide. Several studies have shown that addressing the spiritual needs of the patient may enhance recovery from illness.”
Given how much we are learning about the influence social-emotional aspects of life can have on overall health, however, religious beliefs and activities should be an area of intense focus for medical researchers. And it’s a shame that practitioners don’t work more intentionally with religious communities and their leaders to treat the whole patient.
With that quandary in mind, I set out to learn more about existing academic research looking at the influence faith can have on health. First let’s look at what it says about how beliefs can influence a person’s behavior and health outcomes, then at how the health system in the United States integrates faith into the care process. The major takeaways are as follows. Mental Health Literature on religiosity and health overwhelmingly looks at patients’ mental health and belief systems. A surprising 80 percent of research on spirituality/religiousness and health focuses on mental health. This is because most associations with faith are related to how one thinks about the world and his role in it. Words like connectedness , hope , optimism , trust, and purpose are often associated with religious beliefs. All have been shown to boost mental health. Compassion, forgiveness, and gratefulness are also strongly associated with individuals who are spiritual and religious. Practicing these qualities is thought to be associated with decreased stress and increased resiliency . Religious practices tend to give one a sense of purpose greater than oneself. This desire to help others promotes social activities and reciprocal support systems. Being in a religious social group further increases the likelihood that you are surrounded with likeminded people with a shared belief system, reducing social conflict. Intriguingly, although religion and spirituality correlate to an external locus of control (God as a higher power in control of our destiny), most research concludes that those who are religious have a strong internal sense of control . Research from Duke University suggests this is because as people pray, and ask God for guidance, they feel a sense of control over their situation, helping them cope with depression and anxiety. Negative religious beliefs can (and do) play a part for some individuals. For example, fear that one is being punished or abandoned by God in the face of medical problems. These negative thoughts associated with religion can be linked to higher rates of depression and lower quality of life. Additional stress in these cases can also damage mental health. Physical Health While mental and physical health are intricately intertwined, the physical manifestations of spirituality and religious beliefs are considered indirect . That means our belief system drives the way we think and behave, which then affects our health-related actions. For example, people with greater depression and anxiety have more physical health problems. In turn, worse mental health and physical health lead to lower quality of life and a shorter life expectancy. And vice versa. Caring for one’s physical body is emphasized in many faiths, including Judeo-Christianity which says, “Do you not know that your bodies are templesof the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies” ( Corinthian 6:19-20 ). This leads many religious individuals to take better care of their bodies by actions such as abstaining from drinking, prioritizing meditation, and not partaking in activities that harm the body. Patient-Physician Relationship A 2018 survey of American physicians and patients suggests that about 64 percent of physicians believe in the existence of God or a higher power, and more than 90 percent of patients claimed the same. This is consistent with a Pew study, which concluded that about 90 percent of Americans believe in a higher power . In contrast, 25 percent of physicians reported uncertainty in their beliefs. Between medical protocols and a higher disbelief in religion, it’s not surprising many doctors do not engage patients about faith. While many health workers may think it inappropriate to ask patients about beliefs and faith, patients disagree. One study concluded that 77 percent of patients thought physicians should consider patients’ spiritual needs. More specifically, 48 percent welcomed or desired that their physicians pray with them, and another 37 percent wanted physicians to discuss religious beliefs with them. Despite these desires, the same study found that almost 70 percent of patients claimed their physician had never broached the topic of religion with them. Existential questions cannot be answered by medical professionals, yet they often accompany seeking medical care. This is particularly true for those with more traumatic or chronic conditions. Thus, when seeking answers to questions such as, “Why me?” or “What is the meaning of this?” people often look outside traditional health care settings—including religion—to find answers. Therefore, it is natural behavior for humans to turn to faith when touching the health care system.
Based on the consistent and slowly growing body of literature, it is known that religion, faith, and spiritual practices are intimately tied to overall health. Now, we need the care system and the research community to integrate the knowledge into the patient experience and continuum of care. Further, this is a time to call on our religious communities and leaders, as well as health leaders, to work together by putting the whole person at the center of care.

Father Guilty Of 'Family Violence' For Calling His Trans Daughter A 'She',thefederalist.com,Jeremiah Keenan,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/father-gagged-found-guilty-family-violence-calling-trans-daughter/,"By Jeremiah Keenan April 24, 2019
Last week, Justice Francesca Marzari of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, declared a father guilty of “family violence” against his 14-year-old daughter on the sole basis that he had engaged in “expressions of rejection of [her] gender identity.” These “expressions” revolved entirely around his polite refusal to refer to his daughter as a boy in private, and his steady choice to affirm that she is a girl in public.
As previously reported , the BC Supreme Court ordered in February that 14-year-old Maxine* receive testosterone injections without parental consent. Accordingly, Maxine began regular injections at British Columbia (BC) Children’s Hospital over the course of the last two months.
Her father, Clark*, strongly objects to this treatment and immediately sought to reverse the decision in the BC Court of Appeal. Hoping to raise awareness of his case, Clark gave a number of interviews to media outlets, including The Federalist. In these interviews, he repeatedly referred to his daughter as a girl, stating to The Federalist that “she is a girl. Her DNA will not change through all these experiments that they do.”
While many might take this to be an honest statement of biological fact, Marzari quoted it as a prime example of Clark’s “family violence of a public denial of [Maxine’s] gender identity.” Marzari convicted Clark of this violence, and issued a “protection order” preventing him from speaking to journalists or the public about his case.
While the main thrust of Marzari’s ruling focused on Clark’s public statements, Marzari also ordered that Clark be enjoined from “exposing” Maxine to any materials that might “question whether [her] gender identity is real or the treatments [she] seeks are in [her] best interests.” This order arose from the fact that, in mid-March, Clark invited his daughter to watch a video of a small-time Canadian conservative commentator with him.
The video contained a section discussing Maxine’s case, which she quickly recognized. She told her father she “did not want to watch the video, and went to [her] room.” This incident, according to Marzari, was a clear case of an “attempt to persuade [Maxine] to abandon treatment,” and, hence, of family violence. Family Violence via Talking in Public?
What Marzari found particularly egregious, however, was not Clark’s private interactions with his daughter but his “continued willingness to provide interviews to the media … in which he identifies [Maxine] as female, uses a female name for [Maxine] … and expresses his opposition to the therapies [Maxine] has chosen.” According to the court, this willingness placed Maxine at “a significant risk of harm.”
This harm was not so much feared because Maxine’s anonymity might be breached (it is worth noting that Maxine previously sought to have the press publish her real name), but because Clark’s “family violence of a public denial of [Maxine’s] gender identity” was regarded as likely to cause Maxine distress. Marzari argued that such a denial about such a “deeply private aspect of [Maxine’s] innermost thoughts and feelings” was likely to lead to a variety of dangers, “including self-harm.”
Marzari argued that the “people and organizations” to whom Clark granted interviews had shown themselves “fundamentally opposed” to transgender ideology, yet Clark “continued to support the media organizations posting his commentary with additional interviews.” This kind of attitude was, in Marzari’s view, justification for enjoining Clark from sharing any information with journalists—or with practically anyone outside his legal team—about his daughter’s “sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, mental or physical health, medical status or therapies.”
The court also emphasized that Clark must not allow relevant documents (petitions, affidavits, letters, court orders, etc.) to come into the hands of third parties not “authorized by order of this court,” or with “written consent” from his daughter.
While forbidding Clark to speak to the public about his daughter’s case, Marzari stated that she was not overriding Clark’s “freedom of thought and speech.” “There is no requirement that [Clark] change his views about what is best for [Maxine],” she explained. “It is only how he expresses those views privately to [Maxine] and publically to third parties that is affected.”
The fact that Clark is now not allowed to express his views publicly to anyone at all was, apparently, understood to be a fairly imposed consequence for his previous court-objected behavior. Had he strictly abstained from referring to his daughter “as a girl or with female pronouns,” he might not have been guilty of family violence and so subject to this order.
While the judge’s view of matters enjoys support on the political left, some feel the ruling is biased and politically motivated. Kari Simpson, president of Canadian pro-family organization Culture Guard , argued that Marzari’s decision severely limits Clark’s freedom of speech. Citing Marzari’s significant and recent history of LGBT and pro-abortion activism before her 2017 appointment to the BC Supreme Court, Simpson argued that she was operating as an “activist judge” more interested in delivering a ruling convenient to her cause than enforcing laws designed to protect families and children.
Unfortunately, the gag order on Clark makes it difficult to report his reaction to this new development in his case. In the meantime, his appeal of the court’s original ruling regarding testosterone injections is set to be heard on May 14.
*Clark and Maxine are not the real names of the father and daughter involved. Their identities have been concealed by court order. Court documents use the initials CD and AB, respectively, and media refers to Maxine as simply “Max.” Jeremiah Keenan is a pro-life activist and freelance writer.

Why 'Cobra Kai's' Suburban Charm Makes It An American Original,thefederalist.com,Katya Sedgwick,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/why-cobra-kais-suburban-charm-makes-it-an-american-original/,"By Katya Sedgwick April 24, 2019
The morning after we watched the first episode of “ Cobra Kai ,” my husband told me he dreamt happy dreams about the Valley all night. Happy dreams about the San Fernando Valley?
Well, he was born and raised there, if it helps to understand the mysterious workings of his REM sleep stage. But to utter anything positive about any suburban “air-conditioned nightmare” would have been anathema in the Bay Area only a few years ago. That is no longer the case, as everyone talks about swapping his prized Victorians for McMansions, preferably out of state, making a small fortune in the process. (Might as well—they’d removed all the walls in the Victorians, in effect turning them into those “open concept” McMansions.)
“Cobra Kai ,” the YouTube Premium series premiering its second season on Wednesday, is a show that belongs to a specific place, and that place is the Valley. Don’t believe the lazy thinkers accusing creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg of orientalism and “cultural appropriation.” Critics can always spot something borrowed—no really, Karate is a Japanese form of martial arts that the Japanese themselves lifted from the Chinese—after which the “cultural appropriation” narrative writes itself. It’s just that this type of analysis has nothing to do with the show in question.
In the San Fernando Valley, this appropriation-spotting exercise does not require much effort because the place is, and has always been, what would have been called “multicultural” a decade ago. When my husband was growing up, it was the kind of end of history place where Jews and Christians toasted the same Wonder Bread. So a karate dojo belongs in the Valley because its inhabitants are curious people, and kids need something to do.
The Valley looks like all other American suburbs, only more so. It’s hot, stretches out all the way into the hills, and nobody walks there. If back in my husband’s childhood, neighborhood kids all played together on their sprawling front lawns, filling the cul-de-sacs with laughter and photo-ops, that era is long gone. I can drive for hours now, and not see a single soul. They are all in backyards, probably swimming in their pools. On the outside, it looks more lifeless than ever intended.
The Valley might be nondescript, but it was built with a distinct sense of purpose, which is to raise the next generation of America. Form follows function so closely, it’s barely allowed to exist. In terms of parenting convenience, however, it can’t be beat.
Fittingly, probably a good half of coming-of-age movies in the 1980s were filmed there. One of those films was “ The Karate Kid .” This 1984 children’s classic kicked off its own franchise, but by 1989 its creator Robert Mark Karmen had seemingly run out of ideas. Besides, by then the children who fell for the original’s gimmickry and easy plot-lines were all grown up and on the way out of the suburbs.
“The Karate Kid” relies excessively on tropes to propel its storyline and establish characters. The viewer has to take it for granted, for instance, that figures dressed up as skeletons for a costume party have to be the bad guys. The writing is so sloppy that the generation raised on the film started noticing hero Danny La Russo can be easily recast as a bully .
This brings us back to the genius of the American suburb: It’s so generic and boring that when teens get restless there is no alternative to making your own fun. With a spark of inspiration, in the country where the sky is the limit, things fall into place.
The DIY ethic that made everything from garage bands to Apple computers possible, and that drives people to knock down the walls of their 100-year-old houses, is a product of the American suburb. It made “ C obra Kai” possible too, by turning “ The Karate Kid” on its head, while continuously referring back to it in the most nostalgic manner.
When we see the “ Cobra Kai” protagonist Johnny, played by William Zabka (Who knew he was such a good actor?) pick himself up by the bootstraps, it’s very much within the do-it-yourself suburbanite tradition. The first season started off as inspirational and optimistic but because, apart from the work ethic, nothing I’ve described above carries any kind of moral message, the fatherless Johnny failed to fashion himself into a father figure, and ended up creating a monster.
Visually, “ Cobra Kai” is nondescript, just like the Valley itself. Save for the occasionally attractive female leads, the screen offers no visual feast. There are the never-ending strip malls, very tall palm trees, and hills. Sometimes people from Southern California call this landscape “surreal.” I’m not sure about that.
The blandness of “ Cobra Kai” is both true to the original and refreshing. “ The Karate Kid” was no eye candy either. It was ’80s-drab, not that the middle school demo cared for any of that.
Digital technology gave filmmakers too much to play with. The ability to manipulate the picture can become a kind of substitute for narrative; I’m thinking of critically acclaimed films and TV series like “ Better Call Saul .” That series’s plotline all but evaporated in a few seasons.
“Cobra Kai” doesn’t need to be visually enticing because it’s moved by the narrative. In fact, since its charm is very DIY, the series is better off looking ordinary. Fittingly, it’s on YouTube, so the medium is the message. Anyone can make a movie and put it on YouTube. Each episode was only a half-hour long, and the briefness itself is very Punk Rock, which circles back to the DIY ethic.
So is the world of fandom. Zabka, it turns out, never got over that Johnny character he played 30 years ago. And the kids who grew up watching the cheesy “ Karate Kid” movies were stuck on them long enough to figure out, many years later, the real hero of the first, and the best of the three original films, is Johnny.
If the critics’s opinions are depressing dead-ends, visit the Reddit discussion groups. Those are full of excitement and deep textual analysis, the kind of conversations filmmakers want viewers to have about who is right and who is wrong. Critics, of course, are too cool for these questions.
I’m looking forward to the second season, but I’m worried, too. If the series hinges on a novel perspective, spirited storytelling, and Zabka’s acting, it will not take much for the whole experiment to go south. Not with Zabka’s acting, I’m quite confident in that. But Hurwitz and Schlossberg may feel a temptation to answer the woke critics who see cultural appropriation and toxic masculinity everywhere. The charge is total nonsense, the fans couldn’t care less, and the writers should be above it, but I just have a feeling that they might decide to address it.
I hope the new season will avoid an increase in production quality. The charm of “ Cobra Kai” is its DIY aesthetic, and I hope they stick with that. I don’t know how it all is going to work out, but season one was such a perfect fusion of form and function, the show became an instant classic.

James Clapper Knew There Was No Evidence of Collusion In 2016,thefederalist.com,H.A. Goodman,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/james-clapper-knew-no-evidence-trump-russia-collusion-2016/,"By H.A. Goodman April 24, 2019
Long before the special counsel probe ended in confirming there was no collusion between President Trump and Russia, the U.S. government knew there was no evidence of a vast conspiracy between Trump and a foreign power.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate “ties between President Trump’s campaign and Russian officials” on May 17, 2017 . President Obama’s director of national intelligence James Clapper had access and was privy to all the “evidence” the U.S. government collected since the Russia investigation began in July 2016 .
From July 2016 until Clapper’s appearance on “Meet the Press” in March 2017, not one shred of evidence linked anyone in Trump’s campaign to allegations listed in the Christopher Steele dossier or Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos’s meeting with Australian diplomat Alexander Downer. Clapper stated to Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on March 5, 2017 that the National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence Agency had collected “no evidence” regarding “improper contacts” between Trump and Russia:
CHUCK TODD: Well, that’s an important revelation at this point. Let me ask you this. Does intelligence exist that can definitively answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?
JAMES CLAPPER: We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, ‘our,’ that’s N.S.A., F.B.I. and C.I.A., with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report.
CHUCK TODD: I understand that. But does it exist?
JAMES CLAPPER: Not to my knowledge.
CHUCK TODD: If it existed, it would have been in this report?
JAMES CLAPPER: This could have unfolded or become available in the time since I left the government.
CHUCK TODD: At some–
JAMES CLAPPER: But at the time, we had no evidence of such collusion.
So, President Obama’s top intelligence official and a man with access to FBI, CIA, and NSA surveillance on President Trump’s campaign stated categorically that no evidence existed of “any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians.” This was two months before Rosenstein appointed Mueller special counsel, and Clapper’s knowledge dated into 2017. So why did Rosenstein appoint Mueller?
Furthermore, the intelligence gathered for the reports Clapper referenced was compiled in 2016 and resulted in assessments of confidence, not any guarantees or certainty of the Russians even hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Clapper’s referenced joint Department of Homeland Security and FBI report begins with an actual warranty disclaimer:
DISCLAIMER: This report is provided ‘as is’ for informational purposes only. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained within. DHS does not endorse any commercial product or service referenced in this advisory or otherwise.
This report makes serious allegations of election interference, alongside a disclaimer that states DHS “does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information” of Russia interfering in the election.
The description of Russia’s cyber campaign against the United States is not backed by the United States in terms of a legal guarantee, as stated in the disclaimer. There is no certainty or guarantees regarding Democratic Party suspicion that Trump obtained Facebook ads or helped Russians hack the DNC in this report. The DHS report, like Clapper’s admission on “Meet the Press,” is simply a guess based on suspicion, not a statement on evidence. Like Obama CIA director John Brennan said during congressional hearings (0:15 on the link) , “I don’t do evidence, I do intelligence.”
As for the ODNI report Clapper compiled from the DHS report and intelligence derived from the NSA and possibly other agencies, there’s an even more amusing warranty disclaimer within Annex B, the last page of the document :
Judgments are not intended to imply we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary…
High confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in a judgement; such judgments might be wrong.
Therefore, if the FBI and CIA are highly confident that Russia hacked the DNC in order to embarrass Clinton, or that Facebook ads were part of a sophisticated Russian campaign, the ODNI report categorically states “such judgments might be wrong” and “judgments are not intended to imply we have proof that shows something to be a fact.” Americans still don’t know which Russian Facebook ads influenced a specific number of voters in certain swing states to vote Trump, nor did the U.S. government ever confirm the DNC-hired Crowdstrike’s analysis of DNC servers.
Finally, the infamous Steele dossier is linked directly to Hillary Clinton, as explained in a Washington Post article titled “ Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research that led to Russia dossier ” by Adam Entous, Devlin Barrett, and Rosalind S. Helderman:
The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trump’s connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin, people familiar with the matter said.
Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research.
After that, Fusion GPS hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer with ties to the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community…
The Clinton campaign and the DNC, through the law firm, continued to fund Fusion GPS’s research through the end of October 2016, days before Election Day.
Since both the DHS and ODNI reports have warranty disclaimers stating nothing written in them should be taken as fact, and the Steele dossier used by fired FBI officials James Comey, Peter Strzok, and Andrew McCabe is linked to Clinton’s funding, why was President Trump investigated by Mueller? The narrative of Russian meddling is only bolstered by “high” to “moderate” confidence assessments of the NSA, FBI, and CIA, not certainty.
Mueller’s appointment, and the behavior of FBI and intelligence officials that preceded this two-year investigation, point to violations of U.S. Code 371 and a conspiracy to defraud the United States . If mere allegation, suspicion, and dossiers were enough to form investigations then Attorney General William Barr should simply pick up Peter Schweizer’s “Clinton Cash,” a book documenting alleged pay to play schemes of the Clinton Foundation, to generate evidence to open a special counsel into the Obama-era uranium deal.
Democrats, however, would never allow what they did to President Trump to be leveled at them, and nothing about Clinton warrants suspicion in their minds. Ultimately, Barr and Republicans must uncover why Clapper and others investigated Clinton’s political rival with “no evidence” of a crime. H. A.

Planned Parenthood Wrote Regs Forcing Religious To Pay For Abortions,thefederalist.com,Nicole Russell,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/lawsuit-planned-parenthood-wrote-california-regs-forcing-religious-groups-pay-abortions/,"By Nicole Russell April 24, 2019
Nearly five years ago, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) forced religious organizations to pay for abortions in their health insurance plans, which blatantly violated their deeply-held religious convictions. Three churches joined in filing a lawsuit against the department, citing their First Amendment right to remain exempt from providing abortions. Litigation ensued.
Recently in discovery, attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the organization representing the churches, unearthed 2014 emails that show the department reversed the existing exemption and required that all insurance plans cover abortions largely due to lobbying from abortion giant Planned Parenthood’s political arm. Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, is a major contributor to Democratic politicians, but presents itself to the public as a provider of women’s care rather than a highly political operation. Planned Parenthood Rewrites California’s Regs
Before the fall of 2014, a provision in health insurance plans in California exempted religious organizations from paying for abortion through health insurance. However, on August 22, 2014, Michelle Rouillard, director of California’s DMHC, said the department had made a mistake and would now require insurance companies to cover abortions—even for religious organizations.
What prompted such a change? After hearing that the state had allowed Catholic universities to be exempt from providing abortion coverage due to their faith, Planned Parenthood legislative advocates began persuading the DMHC to drop the exemption or face a mandate from new legislation.
According to this Open Secrets information, in 2012, Planned Parenthood affiliates in California, specifically Mar Monte, donated thousands to Democrats running in federal races and against Republicans running in federal races. According to this site, which tracks organizations that donate to local candidates, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California hired 28 lobbyists over the last 12 years and donated thousands of dollars to more than a dozen Democrat candidates who won their state races. It’s easy to see why Planned Parenthood could threaten legislation if the DMHC wasn’t willing to provide a “regulatory fix.” After all, plenty of California legislators are in Planned Parenthood’s pockets.
The emails, dated from February to May 2014, detail numerous exchanges with DMHC officials and Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California’s legal counsel and legislative advocates. The emails provide markers of meetings that occurred and show a gradual progression of lobbying efforts: They start with Planned Parenthood simply requesting to know why the state exempted religious universities from sponsoring abortions, then Planned Parenthood begins trying to persuade the DMHC to reverse their exemption, and ultimately the department even requests Planned Parenthood’s assistance to make this happen.
One such email, from a Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California legislative advocate Brianna K. Pittman, to Lark Park, a policy advisor to California’s governor at the time, Jerry Brown, states:
Just wanted to follow up on this email to set up a time to meet about PPAC’s priorities this year. While there, the most timely is a spot bill to address the issue that DM HC has approved, and Catholic Universities have been purchasing, large group employee health plans that exclude certain types of abortions. We met with Donna Campbell at HHS yesterday to discuss this and explore whether there is a regulatory/ administrative fix or if legislation is needed. I believe that HHS will be looking into the issue and talking with both DMHC and the Governor’s office, but I wanted to flag it and give you the background we shared with HHS. We have a spot bill to address the issue in case there is not a regulatory fix.
On March 11, Pittman, emails Park again:
Do you have time to sit down with us to discuss PPAC’s priority legislation this year? We have a handful of sponsored bills, including a bill we are looking into that would ensure employers can’t exclude abortion or other types of reproductive health care services from their employee health insurance plans. There have been a couple of Catholic Universities that are excluding certain types of services from their health plans, and it appears that DM HC has approved these plans at some level.
About a week later, Planned Parenthood executives offer their proposed agreement. Pittman emails Donna Campbell, deputy secretary at the Office of Legislative Affairs at the DMHC:
As we mentioned in the meeting, this is of significant concern to Planned Parenthood and many of the reproductive rights groups that we work closely with. While we would prefer to see this resolved without legislation, we are concerned with DMHC’s ability to find a solution, based on several months of conversation and the inconsistencies in DMHC policy on abortion coverage we uncovered in health plan approval documents, all of which led up to our meeting last week. We really want to find a comprehensive resolution to this issue, whether legislative or administrative … Our folks would feel positive about pursuing an administrative solution, in lieu of legislation this year, if the Administration would….not approve any further plans that exclude coverage for abortion or other reproductive health care service. This includes a clarification that there is no such thing as an elective or voluntary abortion exclusion. (Emphasis mine.)
In April, Campbell emails Pittman that they’re still working on the “‘updated’ interpretation, if you will” and a few months later, Rouillard announced no insurance company is exempt from paying for abortions for their employees, and since religious organizations were the only ones who were exempt, they were—and remain—specifically targeted. California Violated First Amendment Rights On Purpose
While there was allegedly some confusion within the department, due to its size, about whether plans excluded abortion coverage, the emails show a concerted effort that went beyond repairing communication breakdowns. The emails show Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California were determined to ensure all insurance plans covered abortions, particularly those providers of religious organizations, since the only complaints about the exemption until that time had come from Catholic universities.
In a phone call, Jeremiah Galus, the lead attorney on the case, told me, “It was clear the department mandated abortion coverage in a way that seemed innocuous … when really it was quite planned.”
While this sounds a lot like the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case—the landmark Supreme Court decision that that allowed religious employers to decide not to fund abortifacients through company health insurance—Galus informed me that case was litigated under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a federal law. Since this is a state issue, so far only in California, this will be litigated purely under the First Amendment.
It was already bad enough that the California department rescinded their original provision acknowledging religious organizations’ pro-life preferences and mandated a reversal of the abortion exemption. Planned Parenthood was standing over the the department demanding a “regulatory fix” to remove the abortion exemption. This is a grievous demonstration of Planned Parenthood’s political power, abused to deny religious organizations their First Amendment freedoms. California should not have been colluding with Planned Parenthood to make these changes, nor should they have cowered under the demands of an unethical organization to do so.
Planned Parenthood already advocates for something that’s not only harmful but an increasingly ho- button issue in American politics, particularly as more Americans favor abortion regulations than ever before and “heartbeat bills” continue to pepper state legislatures. Evidence that the organization successfully lobbied the cowardly California DMHC to infringe on the First Amendment rights of religious organizations under the guise of “reproductive rights for all” is shameful, but not surprising.

Neocons Don’t Deserve All The Blame For The Iraq War,thefederalist.com,Edward Chang,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/neocons-dont-deserve-blame-iraq-war/,"By Edward Chang April 24, 2019
With each passing of the 2003 invasion of Iraq’s anniversary comes a fusillade of commentary placing the blame squarely on “neocons.” For the past 16 years, this political movement has been singled out by critics on both the left and right as responsible for the nation’s foreign policy woes.
It’s for good reason: neoconservatism constitutes a powerful and influential force in American defense and foreign policy-making circles. Their reflexive hawkishness, combined with a sense of moral righteousness and resolute determination to remake the world in America’s image, along with major financial and political capital, coalesce to make neocons, along with their left-wing counterparts, the liberal internationalists, the dominant voice in American foreign policy.
But has it become far too easy to blame them? Has the term “neocon” become yet another overused, “meaningless label,” as Max Boot recently put it , to describe individuals and policies one finds distasteful? The prevailing narrative depicts the United States’ invasion of Iraq as the brainchild of a cabal of political heavyweights, intellectuals, and think-tanks pulling the strings, but a closer, more honest look reveals the origins of the Iraq War to be more multifaceted. Let’s Review the Timeline
By March 2003, the United States had been engaged in armed conflict against Iraq for 12 years. After Desert Storm, the fighting between the two countries continued in the skies throughout the 1990s into the ‘00s, as Saddam Hussein defied the United Nations-mandated no-fly zones in the north and south of the country, alongside the economic sanctions against his country.
By the time George W. Bush entered the presidency, there was no end to the fighting in sight. Saddam continued to exhibit belligerence, firing routinely upon U.S. and allied aircraft in the no-fly zones. With an administration staffed with neocon all-stars like Elliott Abrams, Paul Bremer, Richard Perle, and Paul Wolfowitz, it was easy to believe the Bush White House would use the hostilities in the skies over Iraq as a justification for war and regime change in Baghdad.
This was not so. The no-fly zones were unpopular among Congress and the public, and concerns over losing aircrew prompted the Bush administration to initially scale back the intensity of Operations Northern and Southern Watch. To go as far as to launch preemptive war, the Bush administration would need something more than just combat aircraft being shot down while patrolling no-fly zones.
That something came in the form of 9/11. After the devastating terrorist attacks, the United States had the legal, logical, and moral justification to pursue a campaign of justice against all its enemies. 9/11 became and, continues to be, a convenient excuse for an aggressive, interventionist American foreign policy. We Were Already Involved in Iraq
There are two key points to absorb. The first is that there was a fair likelihood the United States and Iraq would have eventually fought another major war, given active, pre-existing armed hostilities. Baghdad under Saddam’s rule was as responsible as Washington under Bush was in the resultant Operation Iraqi Freedom. At the very least, the cycle of Iraqi provocation followed by limited U.S. military responses would have continued indefinitely.
The second point is, had a 9/11-like event not occurred, it would have been difficult for the Bush or any future administration to sell an invasion of Iraq. Even in the wake of the resounding victory in Desert Storm, then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was aware of both the risks of overthrowing Saddam’s Ba’athist regime and the political and public opposition such an operation would garner. The Bush administration’s de-escalatory approach to the no-fly zones in the months leading up to September 2001 supports the idea that even a neocon “dream team” would face great difficulty in taking the country to war without heavy political and public backing.
Therefore, it was the combination of 9/11 and the ongoing conflict between the United States and Iraq that culminated in the invasion of the latter in 2003. While viewed as a “war of choice,” conditions were such that two things were true at once —another U.S.-Iraq war was likely, and it would take a major casus belli to start it. Without 9/11, the Bush administration would be limited to the same tools available to the Trump administration as it pursues its “ ferocious tack ” on Iran—all options short of war. Huge Majorities of Americans Supported War
The neoconservatives clearly exploited the opportunities 9/11 wrought. But it is rather too convenient and disingenuous to heap all blame on them, given how popular the Iraq War was at the start. While evoking strong sentiments at both ends of the spectrum, overall public opinion was extremely supportive for the conflict at the outset.
How supportive? In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted just days after the invasion, a whopping 72 percent of Americans expressed support for the war, while only a quarter expressed opposition. If the Iraq War was deeply unpopular by its end , it unequivocally was not at the beginning. This is fact often forgotten by the war’s critics, many of whom were initially supporters.
While Americans, along with much of the world, view U.S. foreign policy in largely beneficent terms, the decision to conduct regime change via the most powerful military in history in not one, but two countries, one of which had nothing to do with 9/11, prove that America, like all nations, will lash out vengefully and violently under times of duress, out of love for country (patriotism) and in promotion of national interests (nationalism). Both were on full display following 9/11, but the latter motivated the Iraq War more than the former.
Scholar Walter Russell Mead referred to this distinctive brand of American nationalism as rooted in the “Jacksonian” school of American foreign policy in an essay published in The National Interest in 1999, then later in his masterwork, “ Special Providence .” Described by Mead as more a “folk community” rather than a distinct political ideology or movement, Jacksonianism encompasses a set of beliefs, impulses, and values associated with the “heartland” and “Middle America.”
This is critical to understanding it. Unlike neoconservatism, it is the doctrine of commoners, not the product of intellectuals, or policymakers. This is a crucial to absorb because it reveals neoconservatism for what it is—the thinking of an elite, vocal minority and hardly representative of American public opinion at large. We Hate You Until We Need You to Die
Despite comprising the heart and soul of a nation, Jacksonians are also dismissed or downright “deplored” (a word Mead uses) by the same cultural and political elites as ignorant, backwards, or simply representative of a culture and history that deserves to be cast, along with “outdated” notions such as nationalism, to the dustbin of history. The convictions and motivations of the Jacksonians make wars like Iraq possible.
Until times of trial. During America’s darkest hours, it is this Jacksonian community that rises to the challenge and supplies the blood, sweat, and tears of a nation. In the days and months following 9/11, it was this Jacksonian community that spoke heartedly for the country through fervent displays of patriotism, enlisting in the military in large numbers, and even through song, like country musician Toby Keith’s 2001 hit “ Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue .”
But it is also the convictions and motivations of the Jacksonians that make wars like Iraq possible. By associating support for the war with patriotism, Jacksonian sentiment dabbled in their own form of political correctness, that opposing the war was anti-American.
More importantly, Jacksonians think that when one’s nation is under assault, the only answer is to pursue absolute destruction of all enemies, at any cost, for as long as it takes. When President Bush declared , “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,” he was not channeling neoconservatism—he was channeling Jacksonian martial and unilateral sentiment. Caroline Glick once opined that it is Jacksonianism, not neoconservatism, that dominates the Republican Party’s foreign policy. Elites Didn’t March to War Alone
Finally, there is the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force, in which almost 40 percent of the Democratic House Representatives and 58 percent of Democratic senators effectively voted in favor of invading Iraq. The results speak for itself—the Iraq War was very much a bipartisan war, no matter how hard the Democrats have attempted to distance themselves from it. The Iraq War was very much a bipartisan war, no matter how hard the Democrats have attempted to distance themselves from it.
None of this absolves the neocons of blame for the Iraq War. They were its greatest supporters, spending considerable money and time promoting regime change in Baghdad. The point is that it takes more than a relatively small, though politically influential, elite to affect policymaking.
The war was the product of four key ingredients: pre-existing hostilities, a political movement bent on global deliverance, vengeful nationalism, and bipartisan political support. Remove one of these four legs, and the Bush administration would, at minimum, been far less eager to sally forth into the dark.
As the Trump administration becomes increasingly under the influence of neoconservatives and tensions increase with Iran, the lesson of Iraq going forward is that Congress and the American people are very much a part of the decision to take the nation to war. A war with Iran may not be as likely as some believe, but neither was another war with Iraq until 9/11 happened and the national mood changed dramatically.
In times like these, there will be neoconservatives ready to act as white knights and sweep America off its feet once again. Edward Chang is a defense, military, and foreign policy writer.

We Loved The Magicians' Quentin Coldwater Right Before Losing Him,thefederalist.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/learned-love-magicians-quentin-coldwater-right-losing/,"April 24, 2019
Spoilers below for ‘The Magicians’ season four finale.
All love dies eventually. No matter how hard, how firm, how solid, our love goes the way of dust in the end. And so it is with the season 4 finale of “The Magicians,” a show I’ve been following since Lev Grossman’s trilogy, since since the first episodes on SyFy.
On Twitter earlier this year, show co-creator Sera Gamble posted about how she and John McNamara first got together, bought the rights to the books, and wrote the pilot on spec. To put in the kind of work that takes is an act of love. It cannot be done without love of story, world, and primarily love of character.
That is why it was so sincerely shocking to see series lead Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph) killed in the final episode of season four. It was like a puncture wound. It took all the air out of the room.
“The Magicians” has been running on SyFy for four beautiful seasons, and will be bringing a fifth. With a cast of talented, gorgeous actors, the plotlines keep veering entirely off course only to land in new, unexpected realms of fantasy and storytelling.
“The Magicians” blends elements of campy fantasy genre dramas with a sense of humor and a real fine arts sensibility. The premise is that Brakebills is a magical school for magicians, a Hogwarts for cosmopolitan kids with way too much personal baggage, an overload of attitude, and robust superiority complexes that barely mask the insecurity beneath.
There are multiple dimensions and worlds, each with their own timelines, natural laws, and properties. One of these is Fillory, a mythical land that has only existed in fiction written by Christopher Plover (Charles Shaughnessy), Quentin’s favorite novels, until the Brakebills kids realize it’s actually real.
Plover has been a background figure in the series, despite his Fillory books taking on a driving life in the narrative. When we find him in the season finale shunned, disgraced, in a back room of the interdimensional library of magic, he wants back into the mortal realm. In his defense, he says: “Problem is, no one will ever let you change. People always see you for what you’ve done, never for who you are.” He could very well be talking about Quentin Coldwater, who does not appear, until this bitter end, to be the main character of his own life.
In the books, Quentin, the ultimate Fillory fanboy, is kind of annoying. In the show, too, he began as kind of a lead afterthought somehow, the least colorful and the most uninteresting hero. Finally he is tasked with saving Fillory, the refuge of his heart, play place of all his childhood fantasies.
That you can never go home again isn’t simply a cliche, it’s also the truth. Standing at the edge of everything he ever wanted, Quentin gives this impassioned plea. “You know the worst part of getting exactly what you want? When it’s not good enough. Then what do you do? If this can’t make me happy, then what would? Fillory was supposed to mean something. I was supposed to mean something here. But it’s random, it’s so random that the only way to save my friends is to yell at a f-cking plant. Honestly, fuck Fillory for being so disappointing. Y’know maybe I was better off believing that it was fiction. The idea of Fillory is what saved my life. This promise that people like me, people like me can somehow find an escape. There has got to be some power in that. Shouldn’t loving the idea of Fillory be enough?”
It should. We want it to be. We want love to be enough, love of place, love of home, love of lover, love of love, but it isn’t, and we can’t make it be. We need to be our own escapes, we need to save ourselves.
No one is really out there to fix it all for us, no matter how much they want to, no matter how many plants we yell at. (Seriously, just watch the show.) In the end, the place that saves us is the place in our hearts, where the light shines, where the flowers grow, and where even in sadness we find the joy that is a gift to us from the beginning of time.
It took a few seasons for Quentin to live up to himself. He didn’t even have a magical discipline until two episodes ago (in the trilogy it’s book three). His love interest, the smartest, hottest, angst-iest magician, Alice (Olivia Dudley), has been a phosphoromancer (the magical manipulation of light) since season one, but Quentin has been muddling about without any real idea as to his meaning or purpose. It’s a sick irony that only shortly after he learns what type of magic he’s innately best at, he’s able to use to it to save the day, save magic, save Alice, and destroy himself.
It hurts for a writer to kill off a character he loves. These characters have not been crafted so much as they have been extracted from the hearts and minds of the writers who created them, who drew them out, lovingly, with grace and urging, from the ether of imagination. It must have been agony to write the script where Quentin dies of his own masterful spellwork. As hard as it was for Alice to watch him go, it must have been even more excruciating to pen the lines that released him from the world of the living magicians.
By the time Quentin makes his spectacular exit, with the captivating track “Cruel World” by Active Child and a slow-motion pyrotechnic golden sparks sequence, he and Alice are back in love. Quentin knows his worth, and can harness his ability for the first time. Moreover, we love him, we viewers who have had such trouble wrapping our hearts around Quentin Coldwater as the driver of the story arc. Right when we love him most he is snatched away into the realm of darkness.
“Magic comes from pain,” says Quentin from the afterlife, and he’s not wrong. Magic does come from pain. We all know it, and don’t want to admit it. We want to believe that we can be well-adjusted and super normative and still breed masses of creativity and brilliance, but it doesn’t quite work that way.
I had a writing professor in college, Cassandra Medley, who said, “Go to the place where you’re afraid, and start from there.” In fear, in terror, in the agony of our hearts, we create and reform ourselves, and in so doing, the magic of love is made.

Why I Refuse To Attend My College’s LGBT Graduation Ceremony,thefederalist.com,Brad Polumbo,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/25/refuse-attend-colleges-lgbt-graduation-ceremony/,"April 25, 2019 By Brad Polumbo LGBT icon Ellen DeGeneres once mused , “Do we have to know who’s gay and who’s straight? Can’t we just love everybody and judge them by the car they drive?” This was obviously a joke, but it contained a kernel of wisdom. After coming of age in a time of gay oppression, with her show canceled after she came out as lesbian, DeGeneres knew that the full potential of American values could never be realized until all people, regardless of sexual orientation, were treated alike. So in a fair world, this means sexuality should be irrelevant to a student’s education. Many modern campus progressives reject that vision. I recently realized just how far the LGBT left has strayed from this egalitarian mentality when I received a curious invitation from administrators at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, from which I’m set to graduate this May. The note invited me, a gay man, to attend a special “Rainbow Graduation,” an event supposedly “hosted every year to honor our graduating seniors within the LGBTQ community.” I wasn’t flattered to receive this invitation, I was mortified. Self-segregated celebrations are the exact opposite of the egalitarian vision of gay rights I believe in, where all Americans ought to be treated the same, with sexual orientation little more than a footnote in our public life. Yet identity politics ideology has become so pervasive on college campuses and the progressive elite that they’re blinded to the individualism gay advocates once stood for. Now, they champion regressive groupthink. How else could one possibly justify such a spectacle? The annual event regularly features keynote LGBT speakers, and is attended by LGBT students and their guests. Additionally, awards are given out to LGBT student leaders, sympathetic staff, and program participants. Interestingly, a “Spectrum” award is given to a student deemed most influential within the self-segregated LGBT residential community on campus. These types of events send a chilling message about how progressives view LGBT students. Are we incapable of standing out from the student body on our own merits, rather than our sexual proclivities? What’s more, it reinforces the odd notion that sexuality alone is worth celebrating. No one should face discrimination or violence for his identity, but we also shouldn’t act like the sheer act of being gay is an accomplishment. It really isn’t, even if some people still do have to overcome additional obstacles due to their orientation. And it’s not as if the modern university is such a homophobic, repressive place that students need solace to enjoy a graduation ceremony. The intention may be to provide “safe space” for LGBT people to celebrate, but in reality there is almost nowhere in the world safer or more accepting for gay people than an ultra-left campuses like UMass. In the absence of any real necessity, such a spectacle seems performative, not productive, like just another liberal attempt to cultivate the victim status that has become the new campus currency. But it’s a stunt that could have real consequences. This type of approach sets gay people back, because actual acceptance comes through assimilation. These kinds of events, decorated with rainbows and featuring controversial progressive speakers, only make gay students stick out like a sore thumb. But LGBT students are your neighbor in the dorm room next door, the classmate you borrowed a pen from, or the TA who taught your freshman seminar—and you might never know it. That’s, frankly, how it should be. Efforts to make a spectacle out of sexuality, which should really be irrelevant in an education setting, only set assimilation efforts back. This is a recipe for failure. After all, the most effective arguments for gay marriage were made in the court of public opinion not by railing against the traditional institution, but through framing same-sex marriage through the lens of widening a venerable social norm to include more everyday Americans. Ultimately, this was successful. Yet the developing strain of identitarianism consuming the advocacy class threatens this progress. It has the potential to further polarize LGBT issues and ostracize LGBT people from American life, when what we really should do is attempt to spread a message of mutual tolerance. In their effort to pursue equality, progressives may set us all back. The “Rainbow” graduation at UMass isn’t some one-off event. Rather, it’s emblematic of a nationwide trend: Colleges around the country have special LGBT student centers, graduation ceremonies, and even self-segregated LGBT dorms. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to solve this backwardness, but I do know that even DeGeneres wouldn’t dare call it progressive. Brad Polumbo is a freelance writer.

Nobody Was A More Complete Russian Stooge Than The U.S. Media,thefederalist.com,Scott Schroeder,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/25/nobody-complete-russian-collusion-stooge-u-s-media/,"By Scott Schroeder April 25, 2019
For the past two years, the mainstream media has reported hysterically on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. To listen to their apoplectic rants, one would believe it was the first time the Russians had ever interfered in U.S. domestic affairs.
Although this falsehood played embarrassingly well with cable news audiences, one doesn’t have to consult a CIA historian to realize that Russia has actively engaged in meddling and disinformation operations for decades to sow discord among Americans and undermine their confidence in U.S. institutions.
The 2016 Russian disinformation campaign was indisputably Russia’s most successful anti-USA propaganda operation to date. It divided families, ruptured friendships, and caused millions of Americans to question the legitimacy of their country’s leader and the system that elected him.
However, Vladimir Putin’s golden arrow was not the half-million dollars of social media advertisements and posts that seeded this turmoil, it was Russian intelligence’s minor contribution to Christopher Steele’s dossier, solicited by the Hillary Clinton campaign. What’s painfully ironic is that it did not cost Putin a dime. In fact, he likely pocketed a few Rubles from it. The Steele Dossier
This Steele dossier was the predication of the investigation into President Donald Trump, which has been at the epicenter of the country’s deep divide. The dossier was a weapon, but like all weapons, Putin needed hands to wield it: He needed accomplices. Who would put the weapon into action? Who would spread the deception to the American people and convince them that their lives and their country lay in the hands of a deranged lunatic who answered to a foreign power?
Apparently, Putin understood all too well the misplaced loyalties of the leadership Barack Obama placed in America’s judicial and intelligence institutions. He also understood the American media’s disdain for Republican presidents. He observed the escalation of the media’s attacks on Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan, and the media’s willingness to engage in lies and deception.
Although Putin is an intelligent and calculating villain, never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined such success from so little effort. It is likely he underestimated how hellbent the corrupt government officials and an unscrupulous media were to overturn the will of the American people.
Obama’s Deep State actors ran with Putin’s disinformation to initiate an unprecedented investigation on a sitting president—an investigation that lacked a shred of credible evidence to justify any level of investigation. Nonetheless, anything as illegal as an attempted soft coup predicated on knowingly false, malicious, unsubstantiated reports requires accomplices.
The perpetrators needed to convince the American people that their seditious activities had merit, so messaging to the American people needed to be consistent and repetitive. It required constant bombardment, day and night, of accusations bolstered by convincing charlatans to erode any doubt in the minds of the media audience that their outlandish accusations were true. The Media’s Role
Working together and coordinating their false pretenses, the mainstream media were successful. They convinced a large portion of the American public that their elected president was illegitimate. They convinced many that their election system and their governing documents were flawed. In doing so, they fomented discord and pitted American against American. In short, the American media accomplished Putin’s goals.
We now know that neither President Trump nor anyone in his campaign or administration coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 elections. We know that the Steele dossier, developed in collaboration with Russian intelligence operatives, was the basis for the investigation into President Trump. We are all aware of the damage this investigation and the false allegations made daily in the mainstream media did to the country in terms of financial costs, diverting attention and resources from real issues, while dividing the country.
In light of what has been learned, who should Americans blame for the fraud perpetrated on the country? Who should be the focus of the country’s ire? Putin? That would be be like sticking your hand in the lions cage and being angry at the lion for biting you. The finger should be pointed inward.
Those who serve in government positions should be trusted to do what is right and in the country’s best interests. The mainstream media should be trusted to inform the American people objectively and honestly. Both failed. However, the actions of a few bad apples in government, fueled by the accusations of a global foe, would not have been successful without the efforts of an army of journalists who worked tirelessly to convince the American people of a lie.
The sensible response of Americans would be to accept the phony Russian collusion story as a fraud and move on as a united country. Yet the mainstream media will not let this happen. They continue to hold the country hostage by continuing their baseless attacks. They continue to sow discord among Americans and undermine Americans’ faith in their government, all to Putin’s delight.
Putin will never change. He will continue to meddle in America’s domestic affairs and elections. He will continue to sow discord and undermine the U.S. government. Putin hardly needs to plant spies and engage in social media disinformation campaigns anymore. He’ll still do that, but that’s not where he’ll get the most bang for his buck.
Putin has found a loyal ally in America’s mainstream media. As he learned in 2016, he needs to do very little, as his collaborators will do his heavy lifting. As long as Putin and the American mainstream media share the same goals, America will remain divided. Unless Americans learn to change the channel.

5 Times The Mueller Probe Broke Prosecutorial Rules That Ensure Justice,thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/25/5-times-mueller-probe-broke-prosecutorial-rules-ensure-justice/,"By Adam Mill April 25, 2019
CNN recently published an article arguing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller should not have issued a report suggesting the president may have committed obstruction of justice without actually reaching this conclusion. CNN is obviously disappointed because inside the leftist echo chamber the obstruction case seems undisputable.
For example, the Mueller report suggests that the president committed some kind of sin for wanting to fire former FBI director James Comey for being a party to the plot to blackmail or frame the president. Some believe presidents should fire FBI chiefs who participate in hoaxes against their boss.
Mueller did no favor to CNN’s client Democrats, who now face three terrible choices: (1) Impeach President Trump using their majority in the House, which will lead to a self-destructive trial in the Senate; (2) Drop it and move on in defiance of a rabid get-Trump base; or (3) use their majority in the House to drag the country through a Mueller 2.0 investigation, which runs the risk of distracting from Democratic messaging in the upcoming 2020 election.
Like Aesop’s scorpion on the frog’s back, the partisans on Mueller’s team just couldn’t help themselves. The Mueller report poisons public opinion without bringing charges. It should have been written on a postcard, because the outcome of a criminal proceeding is binary : Guilty or not guilty. There’s no middle ground under constitutional principles. President Trump is not guilty until the Senate convicts him otherwise.
Do you remember why Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote that Comey should be fired? If Rosenstein is still capable of embarrassment, it must have been hard to stand behind the lectern as he did what he has told us prosecutors and cops should never do.
Let’s review his words about Comey: “the [FBI]Director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation. Derogatory information sometimes is disclosed in the course of criminal investigations and prosecutions, but we never release it gratuitously. The Director laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial. It is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.”
Yet here we are, at the end of another highly political investigation with another public trashing of a target without indictment. People accused of “obstruction” or “collusion” (whatever that is) or any other crime are supposed to get their day in court. Prosecutors aren’t supposed to use the newspaper as a courtroom.
There are rules against using the power and authority of a prosecutor to smear a defendant without giving him his day in court. If Democrats impeach the president, he will receive a long-overdue opportunity to defend himself in the Senate. That is exactly why it will never happen.
Americans should be concerned about the conduct of the Mueller probe and its supervisor, Rosenstein. Let’s take a look at some of the basic law-and-order rules Mueller and Rosenstein broke during the probe of the Russia collusion hoax. 1. Using Leaks And Press Conferences to Trash Un-charged Targets
Rule 3.8 of the American Bar Association’s rules of professional responsibility for prosecutors provides,
A prosecutor shall, except for statements that are necessary to inform the public of the nature and extent of the prosecutor’s action and that serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose, refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused and exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law enforcement personnel, employees or other persons assisting or associated with the prosecutor in a criminal case from making an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be prohibited from making under Rule 3.6 or this Rule.
Mueller’s team violated this rule from virtually day one, and their final report makes no effort to hide this fact. Footnotes 561-563 cite news accounts that the president was being investigated for obstruction of justice. The sources for those news accounts? Likely Mueller’s team.
Much of the “obstruction” evidence comes from the statements of White House counsel John McGahn. We’ve known since at least January of 2018 about McGahn’s statement from “four people told of the matter.” Who would four people be who would confirm what McGahn said? Again, likely the leaks came from Mueller’s team.
For a longer list of Mueller leaks, read here . In fact, the entire report relies heavily on news accounts and indictments, neither of which constitute evidence but do remain effective for public reputation smearing.
Rosenstein, always an excellent source of legal guidance he liberally violates, spectacularly failed to direct Mueller to adhere to this principle , ““The guidance I always gave my prosecutors and the agents I worked with during my tenure on the front lines of law enforcement were if we aren’t prepared to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt in court, then we have no business making allegations against American citizens.”
So why didn’t he order Mueller to edit out the report’s innuendo and accusation that the team did not have the gumption to prosecute? Rosenstein understands the unfairness of what he did. And he did it anyway. 2. Using Their Power to Crush Client-Attorney Privilege
Rule 3.8 also provides,
A prosecutor shall not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client unless the prosecutor reasonably believes:
(1) the information sought is not protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege;
(2) the evidence sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation or prosecution; and
(3) there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the information;
When one considers the fact that Mueller knew early on, if not from day one , that there was no Russia collusion, it’s pretty hard to argue that the special counsel’s many invasions of attorney-client privilege were “essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation.”
Mueller has inflicted incalculable damage to the sacred principle of attorney-client privilege. We now know that prosecutors had search warrants collecting electronic files of the president’s private attorney within weeks of the special counsel appointment. Mueller’s team went on to coordinate a raid of Michael Cohen’s office, leading to shocking and public invasions of the attorney-client privilege.
One of Mueller’s first acts was the warrantless seizure of all of the president-elect’s emails for the entire team without regard to privilege. Add to that the now-public disclosure of Trump’s communication with McGahn, which resulted in no illegal presidential action.
We want our president, and all Americans, to be able to have a confidential conversation with his legal advisor, possibly blowing off steam or even contemplating unwise acts, without those conversations ending up in a special counsel report. It is the essence of an attorney-client relationship that the attorney is given the opportunity to confidentially guide his client away from rash action.
Because of the damage Mueller has done, future presidents may now avoid their White House counsel for fear that a special counsel will publicize the conversation. Instead, the president may act without counsel. That’s bad. 3. Prosecuting Despite Knowing They Can’t Prove Their Case
Rule 3.8 also provides “The prosecutor in a criminal case shall: refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause.”
Notwithstanding that the key collusion allegation had already been disproven before Mueller first turned on the lights in the special counsel’s office, for nearly two years Mueller has been trying President Trump in the court of public opinion . This is more than a mere expression. The venue for trying the president is in the Senate under Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution, and the constitutional framers always intended that senators make their decisions based in part on the opinions of the electorate they represent.
There’s no apparent legitimate explanation for the Mueller probe to have continued the “hunt” for Russia collusion after both the House and Senate concluded their investigations finding the same thing Mueller eventually admitted. Yet another election in 2018 proceeded under that cloud and the Democrats made significant gains from motivated voters looking forward to the impeachment of a Russia-colluding president. Was the investigation left open just to gin up process crimes and tempt the president to “obstruct” an otherwise stationary investigation?
Imagine responding to a subpoena from Mueller and having to cough up voluminous financial and personal records. Now consider the fact that Mueller issued approximately 2,800 subpoenas—almost six per business day while the probe remained open. How on earth did they even review that much information?
Imagine yourself sitting through an interview with an FBI agent that might last hours. Imagine trying hard to answer the same question over and over again without contradicting yourself. Imagine searching your memory for what you said in an email or text message years ago, praying your memory remains true lest you be charged with a felony.
Now consider that 500 Americans were interrogated by federal agents during the probe—one per business day. Finally, imagine federal agents looking through your private email, pictures, and other electronic data. Imagine FBI agents swarming your house with guns drawn. Mueller executed approximately 500 search warrants against our fellow Americans, all to no end. 4. Special Counsels Aren’t Supposed to Be a Partisan Hit Squad
Federal law regarding the “Independence of the Special Counsel” says: “An individual named as Special Counsel shall be a lawyer with a reputation for integrity and impartial decisionmaking, …. The Special Counsel shall be selected from outside the United States Government.”
Mueller should not have been selected as the special counsel, due to his close personal relationship with Comey. Further, his entire staff was clearly not impartial.
As one example, the prominent attorney Jeannie Rhee worked for the Clintons to keep Hillary’s emails out of public view only months before joining the Mueller team to investigate Hillary’s political opponent. Clinton might face legal consequences for secretly starting the Russia collusion hoax using campaign funds.
Is it a surprise that Clinton’s role in hiring Fusion GPS appears nowhere in the report? Instead, on the very first page of the report, Mueller’s team repeats the myth that the investigation began with Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos bragging to an Australian diplomat. This is the desperate cover story the media pushes to hide Clinton’s obvious effort to use campaign money to frame her political opponent.
Prosecuting Papadopoulos was key to advancing this myth because it distorted an early but innocuous “Russia has dirt” conversation into a sinister predicate for the entire hoax. Who worked on the Papadopoulos prosecutions? Jeannie Rhee .
Many of the other investigators involved in the investigation were “not from outside the United States Government,” and were already heavily involved in the hoax. You can read an in-depth analysis of the partisanship of the Mueller team here and here . This is not only a terrible look but actually contradicts federal law governing special counsels. Does anyone care? 5. Rosenstein Used His Government Position to Protect Himself
Federal conflict of interest law ( 28 C.F.R. § 45.2 (a) ) says:
Unless authorized under paragraph (b) of this section, no employee shall participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with: (1) Any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution; or (2) Any person or organization which he knows has a specific and substantial interest that would be directly affected by the outcome of the investigation or prosecution.
The Mueller report repeatedly references the indispensable role Rosenstein played as a witness (when he was supposedly supervising the investigation). As I predicted , the special counsel found no fault with Rosenstein’s participation in the Comey firing. Would Rosenstein have approved a report that said otherwise?
Of course not. This created a powerful motive for Rosenstein to hang around until the report was submitted. And that’s exactly what he did . Consider this line from the report: “Sessions and Rosenstein criticized Corney and did not raise concerns about replacing him. McGahn and Dhillon said the fact that neither Sessions nor Rosenstein objected to replacing Corney gave them peace of mind that the President’s decision to fire Corney was not an attempt to obstruct justice.”
What’s missing? Oh, how about a little post-Comey firing incident in which Rosenstein discussed recording his conversation with the president in order to recruit cabinet members to oust Trump under the 25th Amendment. One can imagine the awkward conversation in which Mueller asked Rosenstein for permission to interview Rosenstein.
Footnote 426 specifically cites Rosenstein’s May 23, 2017 statement to the special counsel as evidence. May 23, 2017? That’s less than a week after Rosenstein appointed Mueller to investigate the president for firing Comey. The conflict of interest was known immediately and should have been addressed.
The explanation justifying Rosenstein’s continued participation is nonsensical. In any case, Rosenstein should not have overseen the investigation into the president’s motives because, guess what, the investigator ended up taking a view of the facts that helped Rosenstein.
The get-Trump crowd has been carrying the scorpion of the Mueller investigation on their backs for nearly two years. The damage this has done to America may never be undone. The zealots claiming Trump to be a threat to the rule of law have proven themselves right by using their outrage to trample important constitutional principles such as the presumption of innocence, the right to defend oneself from criminal accusations, attorney-client privilege, and the right to be free from unreasonable searches.
None of that seemed important if we truly had a Russian agent occupying the White House. But we don’t. The anti-Trump zealots, not Trump, threatened these cherished principles that ensure equal treatment under the law for all Americans, even the president, regardless of political party.

Why Sticking Everyone's College Debt To Taxpayers Is Stupid And Immoral,thefederalist.com,Inez Feltscher Stepman,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/25/sticking-everyones-college-debt-future-taxpayers-stupid-immoral/,"April 25, 2019 By Inez Feltscher Stepman
Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed a college debt payoff that she claims out-socialists Bernie Sanders. She may be right. Her proposal calls for not only universal “free” college, but also totally wiping out the college debt of 95 percent of borrowers, with some benefits available for people up with incomes reaching all the way up to $250,000.
The plan is being sold as a boon to cash-strapped millennials and Gen-Zers, but the real recipients of largesse will be the institutions that offer those magical degrees: the universities. The biggest losers will be middle-class Americans.
Americans’ collective $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, mostly in government-backed loans, is likely to be the next looming financial crisis. Instead of underwriting loans that hand out money to “subprime” borrowers who couldn’t afford their mansions, the government now loans money to 17-year-olds to major in basket weaving, and taxpayers depend on debt-staggered students to pay it back despite unrealized income promises. The only happy partners in this equation are the universities, which continue to turn ever-higher tuition, millions in direct federal grants, and tax-free endowments into sprawling diversity departments staffed by administrators with six-figure salaries.
Regressive Democrat proposals for “free” college, like Warren’s and Sanders’, will ensure that the gravy train for universities continues at the expense of the average family making $60,000 a year and the two-thirds of Americans who do not have a college degree. College debt is—paradoxically though it may seem—largely a problem of the upper classes, with the top income quarter of households holding close to half the debt, and the bottom quarter just 10 percent.
Republican responses to such proposals have been predictably flaccid. While there is an effort to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, the piece of legislation that governs federal money streams to universities, cutting (or even freezing) subsidies is reportedly not even on the table. Instead, Republicans seem to be kowtowing to Democrats’ demands for more money in return for federal micromanagement of degree programs that look a lot like No Child Left Behind for higher education.
Even an amendment that protects freedom of speech under assault on college campuses is being treated by both parties as a distraction from the goal of sending more money to universities–because they’ve done such an excellent job with the funds taxpayers have sent them for the past several decades. The only positive in Republicans’ plans so far is refusing to allow different standards for innovative for-profit schools than for four-year institutions.
Universities once appealed to the public fisc on the basis of two assurances. First, they claimed that college-educated students would be wiser additions to the body politic: better voters, citizens, and neighbors. To advance that promise of wisdom in the days of safe spaces, intersectional Olympics, and “ cuddle parties ” is to beg for ridicule. Sixty percent of college graduates do not know how a constitutional amendment gets ratified, and only half know how long a senator’s term is.
Second, in return for our investment, colleges promised their graduates would boost the economy. A college degree, we were told, was the golden ticket to a successful life. While college graduate salaries still compare favorably with those of non-credentialed workers, it’s becoming clear that when debt and opportunity cost are taken into account, there are better ways to advance into the middle class.
Instead, what Americans have received is a breeding ground for some of the most irrational left-leaning ideas and a generation so besieged by student debt that it is a factor in one in eight divorces . One in five millennials expects to die without paying off their loans, and more than a third say their college debt wasn’t worth it .
Conservatives should have sympathy for millennial borrowers, who did everything their parents and culture told them to do to be successful, only to become the most debt-laden generation in history. Countering a culture of credentialism mania with apprenticeships and trade alternatives is a positive step, but the first rule of finding yourself in a hole should be to stop digging. There’s no reason for the average American to subsidize the elite sorting mechanism universities have become.
“Free college” proposals like Warren’s promise to make the route to success attainable for all young Americans. In reality, they grant yet another windfall to a university industry that has expanded by exploiting taxpayers and student debtors, while offering neither much in return for their outlays. The sons and daughters of the elite will receive $5 for every $1 in debt forgiveness given to poorer families, and college costs will continue their skyward march.
Our higher education system is failing students and taxpayers alike. The only entities making out like bandits in a sector awash with millions are the universities. “Free college” proposals are just more of the same, but with a few zeros attached to the price tag.

Trans Admission To HBCU Undermine What It Means To Be A Black Man,thefederalist.com,Justin Mcclinton,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/trans-admissions-to-all-male-historically-black-college-undermines-what-it-means-to-be-a-black-man/,"By Justin McClinton April 26, 2019
Beyonce’s new Netflix movie about her Coachella performance exposes the audience to the culture of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). HBCUs appeal to people because of their history and tradition.
These colleges continue to provide an education to black students, although all races are welcome to attend, that emphasizes being positive members of our community. While people like Beyonce and billionaire Robert Smith shining the spotlight on HBCUs can benefit the institutions, I fear mainstream culture has began to corrode the mission of some of these colleges. That includes my alma mater, Morehouse College, which has been an all-male institution — until now. Morehouse, the Powerhouse
Morehouse is an all-male college that boasts alumni such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Howard Thurman. The Atlanta-based college, like the city it is located in, has a strong gay male culture. In 2009, students cross-dressing on campus led administrators to create a dress code that explicitly forbade students from wearing women’s clothes.
Despite the dress code, the shifting culture around gender identity brought many young men who consider themselves gender non-conforming. I attended Morehouse with several non-conforming students who are biologically male, and I consider them just as much my Morehouse brothers as any other alumnus.
When Morehouse hired last year its first non-alumni president in five decades, I feared he would bring the sort of corrosive liberal policies that define predominantly white colleges and universities. This fear may have been founded, since the men’s college has recently changed its admissions policy to include the acceptance of transgender people who are biologically female.
The new policy states, “Morehouse will consider for undergraduate admission those applicants who live and self-identify as men, regardless of the sex assigned to them at birth.” This makes it clear the agenda of its Ivy League-educated president is to make Morehouse just like the liberal, white campuses that he is accustomed to. The “who live” part of the policy is the most troubling.
When I was a student at Morehouse, we were able to celebrate our differences and learn from one another. This was, in large part, due to the fact that the majority of us were black men. That common understanding is what makes Morehouse different from other colleges. This is undermined by stretching the definition of “black man.” If anyone can be a black man, this cheapens the experience of students currently on campus.
It is unsettling that a bureaucrat will get to determine what it means for a student to “live” as a man in order to determine whether someone with two X chromosomes should be allowed to attend an all-male college. Accepting students who are biologically female undermines the fact that the campus is historically all-male.
Morehouse was founded in 1867 to provide black men a college education. This tradition has stood more than 150 years, only to be undermined by people who don’t care about the history of the college. Spelman College, an all women’s HBCU located next to Morehouse, has instituted a similar policy to allow transgender males to attend. They celebrated when a trans man graduated from campus, even though this person was biologically female. Gender Ideology Undermines the Unique Value of Each Sex
This redefinition of biological “sex” is merely the tool of destructive identity politics, and it does not belong at HBCUs. These sorts of policies are especially out of place at single-sex campuses that don’t even allow students to have overnight visitors of the opposite sex.
Single-sex colleges and the notion that sex is assigned at birth cannot coexist. An astute Twitter commenter pointed out that the logical end of these liberal gender policies is also the end of single-sex institutions. A student at Morehouse has suggested that because “they” do not use masculine pronouns the college should stop using masculine pronouns . While these single-sex colleges might seem out of date, upholding tradition is the greatest defense against the degenerative, liberal forces that threaten our nation.
HBCU traditions are under threat thanks to outside influences that promote a western universalism based on faulty leftist ideology. Just like feminism has been used to manipulate women, identity politics continues to be used to manipulate minorities. The fact that Morehouse and Spelman have accepted these policies points out how dangerous it is to be beholden to external parties. Accepting this foolishness is little more than a cash grab. HBCUs will quickly find out that chasing liberal validation will only result in fool’s gold.
Paying lip service to the liberal elite plays on people’s emotions to gain political power. Statements like this from the current president of Morehouse: “I think Morehouse having the courage to speak to issues of masculinity in today’s environment is important,” diverts attention from the real issues facing America’s black communities. A positive black masculinity is best used to address the issues we have building strong family structures. Accepting a belief system that views traditional masculinity as toxic diverts this mission.
HBCUs have remained a beacon of hope in promoting traditional values, but they are clearly not impervious to the constant threat of liberal thinking. The Far-Left Doesn’t Represent Black Men
Morehouse and black people in general are in no way advanced by the far left’s views. The slippery slope toward “eliminating sex distinctions” is a threat to the black nuclear family.
Identity politics foster “a spirit of resentment” that pits the sexes against one another. The worst aspect of identity politics is that it makes citizens easier to control. This agenda conveniently makes all struggles the same.
A white man once proclaimed to me it was okay for him to refer to himself as a “pink n—er” because he is gay. Intersectional thought like this compels people to compare struggles and assume they are equal. Predominantly white colleges have disavowed their own traditions in order to keep up with the times, causing much of the value in American higher education to be watered down. HBCUs should not follow suit.
HBCUs are going down that same path because out-of-touch bureaucrats believe that is in the best interest of these institutions’ future. Yet these campuses are too precious a resource to water down in a time where all forms of tradition stand against the agenda of America’s corrupt elite.

Middlebury College Fracas Shows How Democracy Turns Totalitarian,thefederalist.com,Paula Rinehart,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/newest-middlebury-college-fracas-illustrates-democracy-turns-totalitarian/,"By Paula Rinehart April 26, 2019
A few years ago, a Polish statesman and philosophy professor with a hard-to-spell name, Ryszard Legutko, captured the imagination of many with his claim that “liberal democracy,” as it was being practiced in the west, is turning totalitarian. How could democracy begin to mimic Communism, minus Soviet-style brutality? It was an intriguing thesis.
Like many readers of Legutko, I was mesmerized by his book, “ The Demon in Democracy .” In 2016, when the book was published, democracy-turned-despotic still seemed a remote possibility, more like a small dark cloud on a distant horizon.
This past week, on the campus of Middlebury College, students and faculty proved Legutko’s point without him having to speak a word. Actually, he didn’t get to deliver the address that Middlebury invited him to give because after his plane landed, he received notice that he had been “disinvited.” The same campus that assaulted Charles Murray a few years before missed the chance to redeem its reputation as a place of academic inquiry.
What was Legutko’s crime? He’s not a big fan of multiculturalism, this is true. He holds the same traditional views on marriage to which faithful Catholics have subscribed for centuries. These and other thought transgressions mark him guilty. He must be silenced. Punished.
“He’s a f-cking homophobe,” students protested . Marginalized students would have their “academic freedom” compromised because Legutko’s presence causes them so much pain they cannot learn. Professors at Middlebury declined to exercise the courage of right-sizing students’ perspectives on the nature of academic learning, which always includes a variety of viewpoints. An audio tape of the student-faculty meeting records professors docilely agreeing with students, promising never to make this mistake again. “You should be outraged,” one adds.
Legutko was eventually ushered into one professor’s class, where about 40 students got the privilege of hearing him. Small ripples of applause could be heard as Legutko made comparisons and drew irrefutable parallels between liberal democracy and communist practice and ideology.
The vilification of those who differ, the use of social engineering and social control to punish, dividing all issues into victims and oppressors—what Legutko describes is no longer a small cloud on the horizon. It’s the air we are breathing. Legutko simply does the work that only someone raised in a communist state can do well, which is to name “liberal democracy” as old-school totalitarianism in modern garb .
Sadly, the larger consortium of Middlebury students missed out on hearing a true intellectual whose breadth of knowledge in history, economics, philosophy, and religion would normally send a person scrambling to take notes. Legutko is the embodiment of a genuinely educated person.
Legutko has been a prophetic voice warning that liberal democracy is a rigid orthodoxy determined to create a political mechanism for selecting people, organizations, and ideas that subscribe to its grand march of progress. He traces in detail how a hyper-focus on “equality” becomes a most clever means to garner power for the state. Sexual politics, he explains, is the major weapon used to destroy the old order and the instrument to forge a new one in which the individual is “coerced into the freedom” of the libertine life.
In decades past, professors from western universities were quietly smuggled into Soviet classrooms. Now, we are the ones spiriting the divergent voice into our midst through the back door, hoping we are not called out by a new version of secret police.
The irony must be particularly rich for Legutko. The students and faculty of Middlebury College provided a live demonstration that profoundly proved his treatise: only a narrow band of thought will be allowed in the brave new world being crafted in the name of “democracy.”
Legutko never got the hearing he deserved at Middlebury . But his rejection proves the utter truth he writes, “In its essence, liberalism is unabashedly aggressive because it is determined to hunt down all non-liberal agents and ideas, which it treats as a threat to itself and to humanity.”
When he’s invited back to this country, to some American university courageous enough to practice academic inquiry, perhaps he can address the question behind the question: so where, exactly, shall we go these days to learn?

When seeking to become the leader of the free world, it’s important to have a few key issues. Obviously, eradicating geese should be part of any candidate’s platform, but winged sky trash isn’t the only natural enemy we should be worried about. No, there is another enemy‒one much more pleasing‒that we need to consider, especially when it’s spring.
We’re talking about flora, not fauna. Mr. T may have focused his ire on trees , but he really should have gone after anything that blooms. Sure, it’s pretty and spring is a lovely season, what with all the flowers and fresh growth and the return of the leaves, but it also aggressively attacks those of us in the populace who suffer from allergies. Our sinuses fill, our brains turn to mush, we sneeze. It’s really a hassle.
Some may say it’s not really that much of a hassle, but now more than ever, it’s important to give all our grievances a public hearing. It’s especially important when those grievances involve the environment, which my advisors tell me is an issue that matters to lots of people who may or may not vote, but do like to gripe on social media.
In any case, in 2020, you have a choice. You can go for those who want to play Johnny Appleseed or you can go for those who have your ability to breathe freely in mind. (My advisors also caution me that trees and other flora may be important to helping us breathe and that “the environment” isn’t an issue people care about because they want to defeat it, but I make it a point not to listen to them too much and instead focus on what various cranks on the internet say.)
So let us rise up and declare not war, because that takes a lot of effort, but instead declare an ongoing conflict with nature. America: We’ve got grudges and we know how to use them. If you feel your anger waning, I offer my services as Grudge Monitor. The Grudge Monitor is never appeased nor should you be.

Some candidates will try to sell you on mushy platitudes about pragmatism and common sense solutions and getting along. Those candidates are fools. As my internet-commenting “advisors” tell me, now is the time to get our dander up. ANGER UPS MY GAME

Because it’s best to get things off our chest. Or out of them, as it were. Also, stay angry, my friends. Much like sneezing, holding in an eye roll can be dangerous.
It is important to note that we’re not declaring an act of conflict on fauna, especially fauna that is delightfully aggressive. Plus people like candidates who have a pet. Who’s the crazy one now, I ask, as I return my badger to its Babybjörn carrier.

Now for a few words from one of my informal advisors. I have a plan. It’s convoluted, relies heavily on junk science, and will most likely fail.

Now we’ll take a few questions. I don’t have any answers, but I will start a dialogue. I like to answer questions with questions, creating a perpetual interrogative time loop.
Like if you question my plan to destroy most flora, I’ll change the subject to our foundering space program. In space, no one can hear you yodel.

If that question doesn’t satisfy you, and if you’re not into jousting, we can agree to disagree via other means. Get the sumo suits ready I’ve had it with your shit

If you’re still not satisfied, I can change the topic again. For example, we often denigrate puppeteers, but what if they’re not the geese of performing artists and what if we need to protect our Second Amendment rights for the actual worst?

Some might argue that destroying all flora on earth is a bad idea, especially since a variety of allergy medicines exist and spring only last a few months. To that I’d say, are you afraid of bold solutions? Of having a conversation about things? Of progress itself?
Maybe you are. I’m not asking you to be rational. But if irrational is what is most important to you, I promise to be the most irrationalest candidate ever. And if that doesn’t work, I’m also willing to make smaller promises that I know will appeal to the masses, even if they offend those rapt by my windblown look. I’d brush my teeth and hair for you.

Kansas Supreme Court Issues Shocking Victory For Abortion Supporters,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/kansas-supreme-court-issues-shocking-victory-abortion-supporters/,"By Margot Cleveland April 26, 2019
Today, in a 6-1 decision , the Kansas Supreme Court held in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt, that the state constitution guarantees a right to abortion.
The named plaintiffs, Herbert Hodes and his daughter Traci Nauser, are two late-term abortionists who challenged Kansas’ ban on live dismemberment abortions—abortions which cause death by ripping the limbs and torso off of a fetus. Over the last several years, federal courts have declared similar bans on dismemberment abortions unconstitutional, but today’s decision is significant because, unlike other cases, it is based on a state constitutional right to abortion. The Majority Opinion
The majority in Hodes , held that Section 1 of the Kansas Bill of Rights enshrine a right to abortion in the state constitution, by providing “All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” This language, the Court concluded, guaranteed citizen “rights that preexisted the formation of the Kansas government,” and included in the “natural, inalienable rights” protected by Section 1 are “the right of personal autonomy, which includes the ability to control one’s own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self-determination.”
The Kansas Supreme Court reasoned:
“This right allows a woman to make her own decisions regarding her body, health, family formation, and family life—decisions that can include whether to continue a pregnancy. Although not absolute, this right is fundamental. Accordingly, the State is prohibited from restricting this right unless it is doing so to further a compelling government interest and in a way that is narrowly tailored to that interest.”
After concluding that the Kansas constitution guarantees a right to an abortion, the state Supreme Court remanded the case for a determination of whether the Kansas Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act violates the newly defined constitutional right.
While the outcome was expected, given that former Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, an abortion supporter, had appointed four of the seven Kansas Supreme Court justices, the 6-1 vote surprised some in the pro-life community. In addition to Sebelius’ appointed justices, Justices Marla Luckert and Lawton Nuss signed on to the majority opinion. The opinion was issued as a per curiam decision, thus not naming an individual justice as the author. The Dissent
The sole dissent came from Justice Caleb Stegall. In his lengthy dissent, Stegall stressed that “this case is not only about abortion policy—the most divisive social issue of our day—it is more elementally about the structure of our republican form of government.” Continuing, Justice Stegall explained:
“Here we venture onto a battlefield as old as politics itself. And as we argue about the structure of government—and ultimately delineate the proper conditions for just rule—we must never forget that we are also actively engaged in ruling.
The structural idea that gave birth to Kansas as a political community, which has achieved consensus support across most of our history, is that the proper conditions for just rule are met via participatory consent to secure and promote the common welfare. Today, a majority of this court dramatically departs from this consensus. Today, we hoist our sail and navigate the ship-of-state out of its firm anchorage in the harbor-of-common-good and onto the uncertain waters of the sea-of-fundamental-values. Today we issue the most significant and far-reaching decision this court has ever made.
The majority’s decision is so consequential because it fundamentally alters the structure of our government to magnify the power of the state—all while using that power to arbitrarily grant a regulatory reprieve to the judicially privileged act of abortion. In the process, the majority abandons the original public meaning of section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights and paints the interest in unborn life championed by millions of Kansans as rooted in an ugly prejudice.”
The Kansas Supreme Court’s decision today represents the latest example of the left pushing for the expansion of abortion laws. Earlier this year, New York’s passage of an extreme abortion-until-birth law made headlines, as did a similar law that failed in Virginia. The Kansas case is different though, as the pro-abortion decision came from the unelected judicial branch: By creating a state constitutional right to abortion, the Kansas Supreme Court has usurped the legislative branch’s authority to enact pro-life laws consistent with the conservative values of Kansans. The Pro-Life Reaction
Mary Kay Culp, executive director of Kansans for Life, told The Federalist:
“This horrendous ruling is due to the Court’s false claim that there exists a ‘right to abortion’ in our 1859 state constitution that despite being unstated somehow deserves to trump 45 years of citizen efforts that have cut abortions in half, increased women’s right to know protections, and resulted in the first state law to send the heinous dismemberment abortion method packing.”
Over the last decade, abortion providers and advocacy organizations have quietly pushed a strategy of using liberal judges in conservatives states to invent a state constitutional right to abortion—both as a failsafe should the United States Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade and as a means of attacking state restrictions on abortion upheld by federal courts.
The strategy has proven successful, as seen by NARAL Pro-Choice America’s boast that “15 states’ constitutions provide greater protection of a woman’s right to choose than does the federal constitution.” For instance, while the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law prohibiting physician assistances from performing abortions, the Montana Supreme Court struck the law, concluding it violated the state constitution.
The Kansas Supreme Court decision cannot be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court because the power to interpret a state constitution rests solely with the state’s judicial branch. That leaves pro-life Kansans with one option—amend the state constitution. To do so, both the Kansas House and Senate must approve a proposed constitutional amendment by a two-thirds majority vote, at which point the amendment is placed on the state’s next November ballot for voters to decide.
With the state’s legislative session set to end next week, it is unlikely pro-life representatives will succeed in approving a proposed constitutional amendment before recessing for the summer. Absent a special election, the earliest Kansans could seek to overturn the decision, then, would be during the 2020 August primaries. Or, if delayed, the measure could be on the ballot for the November 2020 presidential election, at which time the future of Roe would also likely be on the line—as well as the lives of millions of human beings.
