Colorado lawmakers gave final approval to a stage that will radically alter the way in which the state regulates its oil and gas industry, changing the attention to protecting public health instead of encouraging production.
Opponents announced an effort. Get alerts:
The invoice survived fierce challenges in GOP lawmakers, who warned it could gravely damage a multibillion-dollar business and the industry. Passing arrived on a vote.
Conservation groups praised the bill as a step in protecting the environment and individuals.
“All these are the protections Coloradans are clamoring for,” said Sam Gilchrist, Western campaigns manager for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “They are vital for our health and security and are required nationally.”
Industry groups said that it threatens a critical sector of the nation economy.
Colorado is sixth in natural gas , standing fifth in the country for crude petroleum production and a major energy-producing state. But communities north of Denver have expanded into gas area and the abundant Wattenberg oil, triggering complaints from residents about lights, noise , air pollution and the threat .
The bill gives local governments the ability to restrict the areas of wells, besides altering the disposition of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates the industry. Under current law, only state authorities have that authority.
The bill changes the makeup of the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to weaken industry influence. It also sets harder needs for”forced pooling,” a practice which makes it possible for an energy organization to extract gas and oil owned by several parties — even people who thing — and then distribute the gains .
Republicans and the industry won a couple of concessions, such as a shift in the bill’s language new local and state restrictions would need to be”reasonable and necessary.”
The bill also makes Oil and Gas Conservation Commission members full-time professionals instead of part-time volunteers, responsible for decreasing delays in principle making and approving drilling licenses.
Weld County Commissioner Barbara Kirkmeyer and Arapahoe County Commissioner John Brackney said they will attempt to put a measure on the November ballot asking voters to annul the changes and create a state body.
“What we are attempting to do is narrow it into a separate commission and stop one party or the other from politicizing it,” explained Kirkmeyer, an outspoken proponent of gas and oil development.
The bill is the first drawback the industry has endured in many years in Colorado. Energy companies spent heavily on advertising to defeat a ballot issue in November which could have raised the minimum distance between fresh wells and houses and schools to 2,500 feet (750 meters), up from the current 500 feet (150 meters).
But in the election, Democrats won control of the state Senate while keeping their hold over the House and governorship, allowing them to push the rules.
The oil and gas industry states it leads $32 billion annually to the state economy, such as 89,000 direct and taxation and indirect occupations.
Analysts have so far avoided making predictions about the effect of the new rules. They point out it may have little impact in the heart of the Wattenberg area, where Weld County is not likely to enforce rules.
But communities including the Denver suburbs and Boulder, on the edges of the area, are all expected to impose their own limitations.
Adams County, on the southern border of the Wattenberg, enforced a moratorium before the bill passed. County officials said they feared a hurry of license applications from companies trying to get projects approved under the rules.
The overall impact of the bill is to increase the price of producing gas and oil in Colorado, which might induce some production to countries with more rigorous rules, said Bernadette Johnson, vice president market intelligence for Drillinginfo Inc., which supplies analysis and data to the gas and oil market.

Edmunds Assesses Expensive side effect of safety tech: repairs,www.dailypolitical.com,Tyrone Williams,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailypolitical.com/2019/04/07/edmunds-assesses-expensive-side-effect-of-safety-tech-repairs.html,"NodeCoin Trading Down 2.1% Over Last Week (NODC) Edmunds Assesses Expensive side effect of safety tech: repairs April 7th, 2019 - Comments Off on Edmunds Assesses Expensive side effect of safety tech: repairs - Filed Under - by Tyrone Williams Tweet
Vehicle security technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace. The automobiles of today can watch your blind position, help keep you in your lane, hit the brakes in a crisis, and much more. But while the tech helps prevent injuries, there is an expected negative effectrepair expenses.
These technologies features in vehicles rely on cameras and sensors that are mounted parts such as windshields and bumpers. If you do get into an accident, the repairs may add up to approximately $ according to a recent AAA study. Get alerts:
We experienced this firsthand after a parking lot fender-bender abandoned what seemed to be scratches on Edmunds’ 2016 Toyota Prius long-term test vehicle. A visit to the body store, however, revealed the harm was more substantial. MINOR ACCIDENT TURNS INTO MAJOR REPAIRS
An episode such as ours could be adjusted to get approximately $1,000 in total. Sand down the old bumper, put in some Bondo repaint it and you’re done. Nowadays, the fix is more complex.
Following the episode, our Prius had profound paint scratches on its bumper and persistently displayed the”Blind-Spot Monitor Malfunction” warning light. We took it into a Toyota dealership in Los Angeles so we thought — since the damage was minor.
The dealership pointed out that the damage was extensive. Even the sensor needed replacing, and was ruined and out of alignment. The replacement sensor had a price tag of $1,000, and it needed to be calibrated. This repair take around three hours to finish and would cost an additional $465.
The seller suggested we get an individual shop to tackle the cosmetic damage along with the bent bracket to the bumper. That is where we heard of another repair issue. In some cars armed with tracks, producers today use a layer of paint onto the bumper so the paint will not interfere with the detectors. This paint job makes it harder to get a repair shop to repair and repaint. In many cases, a repair store will elect to wear a bumper that is new instead of repair the old one.
Finally, we had two options for our Prius: 1) fix the blind-spot monitoring system and depart from the scuffed bumper, costing $2,384, or 2) perform the repairs using a brand new end for a staggering $4,339.
CALIBRATION AND ADDITIONAL REPAIR COSTS
Bumpers and windshields are just two of the most common body fixes, and safety system calibration is a more price factor in these fixes. Difficulties that are important can be caused by even one level out of alignment, according to body repair specialists.
Windshield damage accounts for at least 14.5 million replacements a year, according to AAA, with some automakers requiring the usage of mill glass which meets strict criteria for optical clarity. Once the glass has been replaced, Additionally, many security systems that rely on cameras need recalibration.
This calibration can cost roughly $1,500, which is up to three times the amount to replace the windshield on a car with no technology. Insert another $850 to $1,900 in case the camera sensors that are front? Used with emergency adaptive cruise control? Need to be replaced.
Finally, back radar sensors utilized in bumpers with rear cross-traffic alert systems and blind-spot monitoring can include $850 to $ 2,050 in repair expenses, according to AAA.
WHAT ARE MY Choices?
If you’re currently relying on a safety feature that’s not currently working correctly, then you’re putting yourself and your occupants in danger. It will also have an effect on your vehicle’s trade-in and resale value. You can not hide the lights when you substituted your automobile.
One alternative may be to push an older vehicle without the safety technology that is costly. On modern cars, however, there’s really no way round it. You need to go into it knowing where your premiums may increase, if from pocket or through insurance, even you are going to wind up paying more for fixes. It is simply a indication of the more pricey, yet costlier, times we are living in.
EDMUNDS SAYS: Advanced safety features are becoming a standard fixture. They help prevent. But if you do get into a accident, make sure that you are prepared to pay the sum of a simple automobile restoration.

The most in-depth study of its kind to date, published in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet , revealed that globally, one in five deaths (11 million deaths) in 2017 were associated with poor diet, with cardiovascular disease the largest contributor, followed by cancers and type 2 diabetes.
The countries with the lowest rates of diet-related deaths, however, were Israel (89 deaths per 100,000 people), followed by France, Spain, Japan and Andorra.
At the other end of the spectrum, Uzbekistan received the dubious distinction of the country with the highest rate of diet-related deaths (892 deaths per 100,000 people), followed by Afghanistan, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu. The United Kingdom ranked 23rd worldwide (127 deaths per 100,000 people), the United States was ranked 43rd (171 deaths per 100,000 people) and China was ranked 140th (350 deaths per 100,000 people).

Fully on board with their votes and money in keeping our borders open while keeping Israel an ethno state for their fellow J00s with secure borders that have walls along with a strict immigration policy. Cory Booker has stated he would rather have his hand taken off than abandon Israel and Pelosi was up on stage with dual citizen big Democratic donor Hiam Saban saying we should continue to dump our tax dollars all over Israel even after the federal government has been financially destroyed. Why J00s vote for them and shower them with money.
