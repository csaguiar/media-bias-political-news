Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., attends a Youth Climate Strike on March 15 in Washington. On Thursday, the New York Post drew criticism after featuring a partial Quote: by Omar with an image from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Tom Brenner/Getty Images The New York Post is facing a barrage of criticism after its cover on Thursday featured an image of the World Trade Center, burning in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, below a terse Quote: by one of the first Muslim women serving in Congress.
""Rep. Ilhan Omar: 9/11 was 'Some people did something,' "" the cover read . A caption underneath added, ""Here's your something ... 2,977 people dead by terrorism.""
The Quote: came from a speech Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., gave last month. She was speaking at a banquet hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, discussing how terrorism has led to a rise in Islamophobia.
National Minnesota Congresswoman Ignites Debate On Israel And Anti-Semitism ""Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,"" she told the crowd. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" (The Sept. 11 attacks occurred in 2001. CAIR was was founded in 1994.)
Days after the banquet, critics zeroed in on her description of the terrorist attacks, inciting outrage that bore resemblance to the condemnation she received after making remarks about Israel .
On Fox & Friends , co-host Brian Kilmeade told viewers, ""You have to wonder if [Omar] is an American first.""
""This woman is a disgrace,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted .

— Harry Siegel (@harrysiegel) April 11, 2019 Rep. Dan Crenshaw , R-Texas, a former Navy SEAL who lost an eye in a bombing in Afghanistan, said it was ""unbelievable."" ""You described an act of terrorism on American soil that killed thousands of innocent lives as 'some people did something.' It's still unbelievable,"" he later wrote on Twitter .
Rep. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., and assistant speaker in the House, told MSNBC , ""Those statements were not only hurtful to me, but extremely hurtful to everyone that was personally impacted by those terrorist attacks.""
But the Post 's incendiary cover, released at a time when owner Rupert Murdoch and Fox have come under intense scrutiny , has made it the target of a different strain of anger.
""Their intention was to be inflammatory, to generate sales at the expense of dividing our country,"" Hassan Shibly, head of CAIR's Florida chapter, tells NPR.
""Far too many people have tried to blame, even retaliate, against Muslim communities when we are victims of that attack just like all Americans,"" Shibly says.
Omar continues to receive death threats, he says. ""Obviously the first hijab-wearing, American Muslim woman [in Congress] is going to be the first target,"" he says. ""People's deep-seated hatred for the Muslim community is now being projected onto her.""
Joseph Azam, one of Murdoch's former top executives, described the newspaper cover as ""the virulent anti-Muslim bigotry being put out by various parts of the Murdoch empire."" Azam recently told NPR he left his post because he was sickened by the coverage of Muslims, race and immigration in Murdoch's outlets. ""They are going to get ppl killed - is that the goal?"" Azam tweeted Thursday.
House colleagues came to Omar's aid. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted, ""The NY Post knows exactly what it's doing - taking Quote: s out of context and evoking painful imagery to spread hate and endangering the life of Rep. Omar. Shame on them, and shame on Rupert Murdoch.""
Media Former Murdoch Executive Says He Quit Over Fox's Anti-Muslim Rhetoric Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,‏ D-N.Y., called the cover ""horrifying"" and ""hateful,"" before adding that Omar co-sponsored the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. She told reporters that the wrath against Omar was ""not a normal level of political debate or rhetoric.""
The New York Post did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.
On Friday, Omar herself Quote: d words uttered in the wake of Sept. 11 by former President George W. Bush, adding, ""Was Bush downplaying the terrorist attack?""
The newspaper cover wasn't the first time Omar was linked to the Sept. 11 attacks. A poster at a winter event sponsored by the Republican Party of West Virginia showed a photo of the congresswoman, wearing a hijab, beneath a photo of the twin towers engulfed by flames.
National Sign Falsely Linking Muslim Congresswoman To Sept. 11 Sparks Outrage In West Virginia A group called ACT for America, which had set up a table near that poster, describes itself as a national security organization and is labeled as an anti-Muslim hate group, promoted the Post cover on Twitter. It called Omar's rhetoric ""dangerous.""
According to a 2018 Pew Research Center estimate , Muslims made up about 3.45 million people in the United States in 2017, slightly more than 1 percent of the total population."

10 Coachella Performances Worth Watching On YouTube This Weekend,www.npr.org,Joshua Bote,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712430674/10-coachella-performances-worth-watching-on-youtube-this-weekend,"Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for GLAAD Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for GLAAD
Now in its 19th year, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is more than a music festival, or even a lifestyle. It's a capital-M moment that seems to stop the world. (And not entirely because Beyoncé willed it so last year.) Beyond the experience of bearing witness to celebrities of the A- and D-lists as they drench themselves in sweat and dust while gorging on trendy cuisine and novelty cocktails, Coachella's influence extends far beyond the festival grounds of Indio, California.
Even Coachella seems to be aware of this: For the first time ever, it's doubling down on its festival streams by showcasing both weekends of the festival. Emergent K-pop group BLACKPINK is set to broadcast its message of sensory-overload pop music in Times Square this weekend. Childish Gambino and Rihanna premiered a new film, and with the aid of Amazon and YouTube, will premiere it globally this weekend for free.
For those looking to avoid the hefty price tag of a festival pass — or reluctant to experience Coachella anywhere but on a couch — we've got you covered. The only catch: You'll need to watch it live on YouTube , as Coachella does not make its sets available after the fact as on-demand videos.
So, without further ado, here are 10 Coachella 2019 acts worth planning your weekend around, in chronological order. And if you're the adventurous sort, you can scan and skip between a whopping 83 live performances across three channels at youtube.com/user/coachella/coachellalive . 10 Coachella Sets We're Watching This Weekend Kacey Musgraves Jason Kempin/Getty Images for for Essential B Jason Kempin/Getty Images for for Essential B

Even if it's not quite golden hour elsewhere, getting to see Kacey Musgraves perform as the sun wanes in Coachella might just be worth the price of admission. (Lucky for you, it only requires access to a device that streams YouTube.) BLACKPINK"
"American Businesses Stayed Quiet On Chinese Hackers, Amid Concerns For Profits : NPR",www.npr.org,Laura Sullivan,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/711779130/as-china-hacked-u-s-businesses-turned-a-blind-eye,"Enlarge this image Top government leaders told NPR that federal agencies are years behind where they could have been if Chinese cybertheft had been openly addressed earlier. Bill Hinton Photography/Getty Images Bill Hinton Photography/Getty Images Top government leaders told NPR that federal agencies are years behind where they could have been if Chinese cybertheft had been openly addressed earlier.
Bill Hinton Photography/Getty Images Technology theft and other unfair business practices originating from China are costing the American economy more than $57 billion a year, White House officials believe, and they expect that figure to grow.
Yet an investigation by NPR and the PBS television show Frontline into why three successive administrations failed to stop cyberhacking from China found an unlikely obstacle for the government — the victims themselves.
About This Story This story is part of a joint investigation with the PBS series Frontline , which includes an upcoming documentary, Trump's Trade War , scheduled to air May 7, 2019, on PBS.
In dozens of interviews with U.S. government and business representatives, officials involved in commerce with China said hacking and theft were an open secret for almost two decades, allowed to quietly continue because U.S. companies had too much money at stake to make waves.
Wendy Cutler, who was a veteran negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, says it wasn't just that U.S. businesses were hesitant to come forward in specific cases. She says businesses didn't want the trade office to take ""any strong action.""
""We are not as effective if we don't have the U.S. business community supporting us,"" she says. ""Looking back on it, in retrospect, I think we probably should have been more active and more responsive. We kind of lost the big picture of what was really happening.""
None of the dozens of companies or organizations that NPR reached out to that have been victims of theft or corporate espionage originating from China would go on the record.
And for its part, the Chinese government officially denied to NPR and Frontline that it has been involved in such practices.

Here she delivers a 2015 speech at the Asia Society in Hong Kong.
Bruce Yan/South China Morning Post via Getty Images But that's not what former U.S. Attorney David Hickton found. When he took over in the Western District of Pennsylvania in 2010, he says, he was inundated with calls from companies saying they suspected China might be inside their computer systems.
""I literally received an avalanche of concern and complaints from companies and organizations who said, 'We are losing our technology — drip, drip, drip,' "" he says.
Hickton opened an investigation and quickly set his sights on a special unit of the Chinese military — a secretive group known as Unit 61398. Investigators were able to watch as the unit's officers, sitting in an office building in Shanghai, broke into the computer systems of American companies at night, stopped for an hour break at China's lunchtime and then continued in the Chinese afternoon.
""They were really using a large rake — think of a rake [like] you rake leaves in the fall,"" he says. ""They were taking everything ... personal information, strategic plans, organizational charts. Then they just figured out later how they were going to use it.""
But when Hickton went to the companies, eager for them to become plaintiffs, he ran into a problem. None of the companies wanted any part of it. Hickton says they had too much money on the line in China.
""What we were tone-deaf to is [that] we seemed to think we could just walk in and wave the flag of the USA,"" Hickton says, ""and it just didn't work.""
Even today, five years later, Hickton still won't name most of the companies involved — and they have never come forward.
Eventually he was able to convince five largely local companies and the steelworkers union to come forward, mostly, he says, because he grew up in Pittsburgh and went to school with a lot of the managers.

With him are then-Attorney General Eric Holder (left) and John Carlin, then the assistant attorney general for national security.
Alex Wong/Getty Images ""I knew these people,"" Hickton says. ""They trusted me. ... We couldn't ask them to be patriotic at the expense of engendering a shareholder case.""
But, he says, he could have included hundreds — or even thousands — more.
""We've made a terrible mistake by being so secretive about our cyberwork,"" he says. ""We have not fairly told the people we represent what the threats are.""
Government and business leaders interviewed by NPR and Frontline said individual companies were making millions of dollars in China over the past decade and a half and didn't want to hurt short-term profits by coming forward. They demanded secrecy, even in the face of outright theft.
But now the impact of that secrecy is coming to light, they say. Companies are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in future losses from the theft, and U.S. officials say they are years behind trying to tackle the problem.
Michael Wessel, commissioner on the U.S. government's U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, says it wasn't supposed to be this way. U.S. officials had high hopes when China officially joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
""There was a honeymoon period in the first six or seven years, a desire to try [to] make things work,"" Wessel says.
But, he says, starting around 2006, businesses began coming to him saying that China had stolen their designs or ideas or had pressured them into partnerships and taken their technology.
National Security Charges Against Chinese Hackers Are Now Common. Why Don't They Deter Cyberattacks? National Security In China's Push For High-Tech, Hackers Target Cutting-Edge U.S. Firms National Security Justice Department Charges Chinese Hackers In Bid To Curtail Cyber-Theft Just like with Hickton, Wessel says, they wouldn't come forward publicly.
""The business community wanted the administration to come in hard without anyone's fingerprints being on the reasoning behind it,"" he says. ""They wanted the profits, but they also didn't want the possible retribution.""
Wessel says that was never going to work. While nothing in the original trade agreements specifically mentions cybertheft, the U.S. could have brought criminal cases forward, enacted sanctions or opened investigations under rules set up by the World Trade Organization — if a company would let it.
Court cases and documents from recent years offer a clue into what experts believe has really been going on. The Chinese government has been accused of stealing everything from vacuum cleaner designs to solar panel technology to the blueprints of Boeing's C-17 aircraft.
Hackers from China, often with ties to the government, have been accused of breaking into gas companies, steel companies and chemical companies. Not long ago, Chinese government companies were indicted for stealing the secret chemical makeup of the color white from DuPont. China developed its J-20 fighter plane, a plane similar to Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor, shortly after a Chinese national was indicted for stealing technical data from Lockheed Martin, including the plans for the Raptor.
Chinese hacking made occasional headlines, but none really grabbed Americans' attention. There was one exception.
In 2010, Google went public in announcing that it had been hacked by the Chinese government. Thirty-four other American companies that were also part of the hack stayed silent. Most have kept it a secret to this day.

Vincent Thian/AP NPR tracked down 11 of the total 35 companies. All of them either did not respond to NPR's request or declined to comment.
A former top Google official who was closely involved in managing the hack told NPR that Google was ""infuriated"" that no other company would come forward, leaving Google to challenge China alone.
""[We] wanted to out all of the companies by name,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition their name not be used because they did not have permission from Google to speak about the incident. ""One of the companies we called, said 'Oh, yeah, we've been tracking this for months.' It was unbelievable. The legal department talked us out of it.""
""We felt like we stood up and did the right thing,"" the former official said. ""It felt like Helm's Deep, the battle from The Lord of the Rings in which you're impossibly surrounded and severely outnumbered.""
They just all hid under a rock and pretended it didn't happen.
James McGregor, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, on U.S. businesses reacting to Chinese hacking
James McGregor, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, who was there at the time, says the companies kept even business organizations like his from speaking out.
""What they should have done is held a press conference and say, 'We 35 businesses have been hacked,' and you would have put it right back on China,"" says McGregor. ""Instead, they just all hid under a rock and pretended it didn't happen.""
McGregor says their silence left little room for punishment, and worse, he says, it hid the extent of the problem.
Across the ocean, cybersleuth Dmitri Alperovitch was sitting at his desk at a security company in Atlanta when Google called looking for backup. He says when he took a look, he was stunned.
""I knew pretty much right away this is something very different,"" says Alperovitch, who is co-founder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. ""For the first time we were facing a nation-state and intelligence service that was breaking into companies — not governments, not militaries, but private sector organizations.""
But, he says, U.S. government officials were nowhere to be seen.
""They did not even publicly concur with the attributions that Google had made at the time,"" he says.

Here he speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in California on May 1, 2017.
Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images Obama administration officials say they did not turn a blind eye to the Google hack or cybertheft from China.
The administration was struggling with other important priorities, such as North Korea, Iran, the economy and climate change, says Evan Medeiros, Obama's top China specialist and then a staffer at the National Security Council.
""Direct confrontation with China does not usually result in lasting solutions,"" Medeiros says, noting that President Obama secured an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to halt the attacks and put together a regional trade agreement — the Trans-Pacific Partnership — to add pressure.
But neither measure lasted.
""Hindsight is always 20/20,"" he says. ""I wish that we had spent more time ... finding creative ways to punish them for creating a nonlevel playing field.""
Without those punishments, the attacks continued.
In the year after the Google hack, Alperovitch uncovered two more serious intrusions that, he says, involved thousands of American companies.
In the fall of 2011, he went to the White House to warn officials about what he had found. He sat down in the Situation Room with a half-dozen top administration leaders.
""The most surprising thing to me was the lack of surprise,"" Alperovitch says. ""I got the distinct impression that none of this was news. When I pressed them on why they were not taking stronger action against China, their response was, 'We have a multifaceted relationship with China.' ""

During the visit, the two leaders announced an agreement to halt cyberattacks.
Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images Alperovitch says White House officials told him that some of the same companies that were being victimized by China also wanted to continue doing business in China.
""They didn't want to take any action that would jeopardize that billions of dollars of trade we were doing at the time,"" he says.
Ask McGregor, the American business representative, how companies can complain about China's behavior to the U.S. government while simultaneously preventing the government from taking strong action, and his answer is blunt.
""Companies were afraid of China,"" he says. ""American business companies' incentives are to make money.""
McGregor today advises dozens of American companies in China, and he says they are confronting a new reality. China is no longer an up-and-comer — it's a true competitor and quickly closing in on America's high-tech sector. McGregor says company leaders are beginning to ask whether years of theft and hacking have given China an edge that the United States will no longer be able to stay in front of.
And U.S. government officials are asking whether federal agencies will be able to catch up on enforcement.
Top government leaders told NPR that federal agencies are years behind where they could have been if the theft had been openly addressed.
Even at the Defense Department, as late as 2014, cybertheft from China was not one of the Pentagon's top priorities.
""Our intelligence agencies were looking at the Middle East, at the Russians,"" says Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding, a China expert who worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council.
He says he had never given the issue of Chinese cybertheft much thought. But then, in the fall of 2014, he loaded a confidential briefing into his computer. It was case after case in which the Chinese government had stolen the product designs from almost a dozen high-tech American companies, in a couple of cases almost putting them out of business.
""It immediately changed my conception, my view of the world,"" he says. ""I realized I did not know how the world worked.""

Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images Spalding says he made it his mission to get the word out to other government agencies. But even in 2015, he says, he was met mostly with a shrug.
He says he went to the departments of Commerce and the Treasury, as well as the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. State Department.
""The two responses we got were, 'Oh my gosh, this is really, really bad.' And the second one is, 'That's not my job,'"" Spalding says. ""That was almost the universal answer we got every time we went to a senior leader. Bad problem but not my problem.""
Spalding, who retired from the Air Force last year, says in the final years under Obama and now under President Trump, agencies are finally starting to take some action. The Justice Department is bringing criminal cases, the trade representative's office is investigating China's dealings and both administrations have brought concerns to the Chinese directly.
But, Spalding says, it may have come 10 years too late.
""We all missed it,"" he says. ""We have to understand the problem and get to work on it."""
Power In The White House Is Growing With Acting Agency And Cabinet Department Heads : NPR,www.npr.org,Kelsey Snell,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862452/power-in-the-white-house-is-growing-with-acting-agency-and-cabinet-department-he,"Power In The White House Is Growing With Acting Agency And Cabinet Department Heads Power In The White House Is Growing With Acting Agency And Cabinet Department Heads Embed Embed
With so many acting cabinet secretaries who do not need Senate confirmation many Republican Senators are concerned the Trump administration is weakening their advice and consent Constitutional role.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The Senate's vote this week to confirm former oil lobbyist David Bernhardt for interior secretary means there's one less temp in President Trump's cabinet. It brings the number of acting heads of agencies and Cabinet departments from 13 to 12. More than any other president, Trump has used short-term appointments to keep the government running. NPR's Kelsey Snell reports that all that churn means the power in the White House is growing as the checks and balances of the Senate start to vanish.
KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: The Constitution is pretty clear about how the top jobs in federal government are supposed to be filled. It's right there in Article II, Section 2. The president shall nominate, and the Senate shall give advice and consent. Senator Lamar Alexander says it's a critical job with real consequences.
LAMAR ALEXANDER: But when it breaks down, we actually give the president more power because he can appoint all these acting people and ignore the United States Senate, which is just the reverse of what the founders intended.
SNELL: But the Tennessee Republican says that's not what's happening right now. Acting heads are running departments like Homeland Security and Defense and agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. And President Trump told CBS earlier this year that all that instability is by design.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I like acting because I can move so quickly. It gives me more flexibility.
SNELL: Trump may like it, but that's not what the Constitution intended.
ALEXANDER: Because our founders didn't want a king - so they said, we're not going to let the president have all the power.
SNELL: Unease over the instability within the Trump administration has spread in recent months as the number of vacancies and acting heads expanded. There's almost universal agreement among senators that there is a real risk in letting the standards slip too far, but there's not a lot of agreement about who's to blame or how to stop it. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy points to Democrats.
JOHN KENNEDY: I believe that at least part of the White House's thinking is that we could send over Alexander Hamilton, and the Democrats would object.
SNELL: He says Trump was forced to get creative. In many cases, the law gives presidents some latitude to use temps to fill in while a permanent replacement is confirmed. And Kennedy says it's only logical for the White House to use that wiggle room to get around some political roadblocks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says it's not just that. The Senate is doing its best to keep up with other nominees, including his pledge to fill a sea of federal court vacancies with Trump's conservative appointees.
MITCH MCCONNELL: I've got my hands full just trying to clean up the executive calendar we already have.
SNELL: McConnell downplayed the loss of power that happens when the Senate no longer has a responsibility to publicly vet and approve a nominee. He says when Trump finds a permanent agency head, the Senate will do its job.
MCCONNELL: I don't have any advice to give to the president about nominations, but I got - we got plenty of them to work on already. And if he sends up a nominee for an important position, like Cabinet post, it'll go to the front of the line. And we'll process it as early as we can.
SNELL: Florida Republican Marco Rubio has a different view. He has watched the agencies change in recent years. He says the partisan fights over nominees have been damaging to the entire process, but the lack of permanent bosses is causing serious problems.
MARCO RUBIO: I didn't used to believe that, but I've seen that when you're in an acting role, it's very different than when you're confirmed by the Senate, just in terms of the respect you command and even your control over the agency and the individuals underneath you.
SNELL: Texas Senator John Cornyn agrees with Rubio. Agency heads should be publicly vetted. They should have to be approved, and they should be there permanently.
JOHN CORNYN: It's not ideal, but it is certainly within the law.
SNELL: For all of their frustration, there's not much senators can do to exercise their constitutional power until Trump gives them permanent nominees to vote on. Kelsey Snell, NPR News, the Capitol.

SHAPIRO: Cleary's books have sold more than 90 million copies. As she told Oregon Public Broadcasting, she wasn't always a big reader.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
BEVERLY CLEARY: Oh, I remember a moment of terror in the first grade when we were in a reading circle. And I'd figured ahead what word I was going to have to read. And it was city. And I knew it wasn't pronounced kitty, but I couldn't remember.
CHANG: About two years later, she was browsing through a book when something happened.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
CLEARY: I was really just looking at the pictures and discovered I was reading it and enjoying what I read. It was quite a revelation.
CHANG: She started reading more and writing stories, too. The school librarian suggested she become an author.
SHAPIRO: She grew up, went to college and became a children's librarian in Yakima, Wash. She learned to write for children there, standing up in front of big groups and telling them stories.
CHANG: A few years later, she was ready to write books of her own.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
CLEARY: And I waited and waited, and no ideas came. And I thought about the little boy in the Yakima Public Library who (laughter) faced me rather ferociously once and said, where are the books about kids like us? And it changed my whole attitude.
CHANG: And the rest is history.
SHAPIRO: Thanks to Oregon Public Broadcasting and their documentary ""Discovering Beverly Cleary.""
CHANG: In honor of Cleary, April 12 is Drop Everything and Read day. So if you want to celebrate Beverly Cleary's 103 years, find some time on this Friday and read a book.

"Week In Politics: Trump's Border Strategy, AG Barr's Testimony Netanyahu's Win",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862445/week-in-politics-trumps-border-strategy-ag-barr-s-testimony-and-netanyahu-s-win,"NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times, about the Trump administration's border strategy, Attorney General Barr's testimony and Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in Israel.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
President Trump has promised a tougher approach to immigration. And sure enough, in a tweet today, he said he's giving strong consideration to, quote, ""placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only."" Here's what the president said at the White House today.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They want more people in their sanctuary cities, well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply, and let's see if they're so happy. They say, we have open arms. They're always saying they have open arms. Let's see if they have open arms.
CHANG: The administration has so far offered no details on what this would look like in practice, so lots of questions. And we're going to talk through them and more now with our Friday regulars E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times. Nice to see you guys.
E J DIONNE, BYLINE: Great to be with you.
DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Great to see you.
CHANG: All right. So President Trump is threatening to release migrants who've been detained into these so-called sanctuary cities. These are cities where local law enforcement has decided to limit cooperation with federal immigration officials like LA, Chicago, Denver. And in this tweet I read, the president said he's doing this because, quote, ""Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws.""
David, do you think this tweet is actually spelling out policy or does it feel more just like a political provocation?
BROOKS: Well, first, it's morally illiterate. These are human beings. We don't treat them as a sort of a subtweet of a prank. But it's of a piece with the Trump policy, which is not really a policy but just a posture of toughness. It's just showbiz. It's sort of performance art to make his base feel good.
And any mayor running this system would create a system. He would expand the detention centers. He'd get more judges to speed the back flow. We'd have a system where you could vet kids in their home countries so they don't have to walk all the way up here. You do a number of concrete things that any normal administration could do. But we don't do that because we just have a posture. We don't have a system. And as a result, we have chaos at the border.
CHANG: E.J., do you agree?
DIONNE: Yeah. Well, first of all, nothing should surprise us anymore about Trump. But the notion that he would use human beings, as David said, purely as political pawns, as what he sees as political punishment for those who disagree with him - I mean, what comes next, he audits - he urges audits of all income taxes of the people who want him to make his taxes public? I mean, there's just something deeply outrageous about this. And we've lost our capacity for outrage.
I think what you are seeing is the difficulty of reaching any agreement on immigration, which is always hard, even when people have goodwill. They - Bush - President Bush, the second one, tried to get immigration reform through. His party foiled him. There was a bill that went through the Senate under Obama. It was foiled. Now you have no goodwill at all coming from the White House, using it only as a political issue for Trump's re-election.
CHANG: Now, on solutions to immigration, E.J., your paper, The Washington Post, is reporting that when the White House first raised this idea months ago about putting migrants in sanctuary cities, ICE leadership said it was not a good idea. But are President Trump's threats to get tougher on immigration putting pressure on Democrats to come up with more viable solutions for the situation at the border?
DIONNE: Well, the one person who has put out a detailed immigration plan among the candidates for president is Julian Castro. And whether you agree with it or not, I think he set out sort of a position that would be compromised a lot if he ever tried to negotiate it. But at least he's come out there and says, here's what I will do. I think the party, like on a lot of issues, has - let's put it charitably - multiple minds where they should go.
And I think a lot of people say, what's the point of putting out a position when we know that we can't negotiate with Trump? Nonetheless, I think over time, they simply have to take a stand, say, here's what we'll do, and let that be their political position - i.e. we're going to try to solve the problem.
BROOKS: Shockingly, I'd be a lot harder on the Democrats. You know, Castro, I think it's - one of the things he does is he repeals a 1929 law making illegal entry a federal crime, which takes immigration very far. I think a lot of the candidates don't know where the left is on this. They don't know how far that we've gone toward open borders, and they don't want to make a mistake. And therefore they don't have policies. But it's making - I think it's politically and morally extremely foolish not to have a policy on what to do with the big central question on our southern border.
CHANG: All right.
DIONNE: I just want to say, on Castro, I think the fact that he came out there is going to put pressure on other Democrats to put out plans. It's still a long time before between now and the caucuses. But on the point that I think they have to say something and be reasonably clear, I agree with that.
CHANG: All right. I want to turn to Attorney General William Barr now. We're expecting a redacted version of the Mueller report to come any day now. And Barr was on the Hill this week testifying about that report. But he also mentioned something else that took a lot of people by surprise. He said that the Obama administration had spied on the Trump campaign.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I think there was - spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur.
CHANG: All right. So President Trump has repeatedly accused the Obama White House of spying on his campaign. Barr chimes in this week, seems to agree with him, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to say that Barr is doing President Trump's political bidding. David, do you agree with Pelosi on that?
BROOKS: I don't know. The guy does seem to be one for dropping tidbits and then not elaborating. And so I don't think he should have said the spying thing without explaining exactly what it was he was talking about because it was bound to be a bombshell. But in general, I'm willing to wait on this. A lot of people are leaping to conclusions and postures and attitudes without knowing what's in the report or how he's really doing. It'll be out in a few days. Let's just wait.
CHANG: All right.
DIONNE: Four strikes and you're out. I mean, he put out that summary which was - didn't even have a full quote from the Mueller report. He absolved Trump of obstruction by fiat. Now he does the spying thing. And he has been totally muddled. I think for Democrats, he has shown himself to be a partisan figure and not the attorney general of everybody.
CHANG: All right. In our last minute, I want to talk briefly about the Israeli elections. We saw Benjamin Netanyahu win a fifth term as prime minister. And I want to ask you, what does this outcome tell us? Because he won this pretty close election despite the fact he's fighting a lot of corruption allegations. David, you want to begin?
BROOKS: Well, first, if you're a Democrat, don't get overconfident because these kind of campaigns can win. Second, we're in a different situation. Israel tried to be a pluralistic ethnic country with the Oslo peace process and all that. It failed. Netanyahu is the kind of leader you elect when you fail to become a pluralistic democracy. We're still trying to do that. We want to be that kind of country.
CHANG: All right. E.J., in the last 30 seconds.
DIONNE: I think that Israelis, for now, have given up on the peace process. And they see Netanyahu as a tough guy who can hold things together. But boy, there are lessons for us in this. He ran a really scurrilous campaign against Arabs. He tried to decrease the Arab vote, and he succeeded. He is Trump's friend, and Trump helped him.
CHANG: That's E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times. Thanks to both of you.
BROOKS: Thank you.
DIONNE: Good to be with you.

toggle caption CCTV/Screenshot by NPR CCTV footage shows how three men clawed an ATM out of a wall and made off with a cash box in under five minutes. It is the eighth such incident in Northern Ireland since the start of the year.
CCTV/Screenshot by NPR Thieves in Northern Ireland have taken the idea of a smash and grab to a whole new level in a recent spate of brazen robberies.
With the help of a stolen excavator and a van with an ATM-size hole cut out of its roof, teams of thieves are clawing entire cash boxes out of local businesses and disappearing into the night.
Footage of the most recent theft on Sunday shows at least three men involved in that raid. One drives an excavator (stolen from a nearby construction site) toward an ATM built into the exterior wall of a shop outside of Dungiven. Over and over again he tears at the wall until most of that part of the building is destroyed. He then scoops up the ATM, swivels the arm over to a nearby van that just happens to have a hole cut out of its roof, and with the help of his two accomplices, sporting balaclavas, dumps the booty inside.
The entire endeavor takes about four minutes and 10 seconds.
All three eventually get away and neither the van nor the ATM protruding out of it has been seen again.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland said the Dungiven incident is the eighth ATM theft this year .
""As the weekend approaches, I want to reiterate our appeal to people across Northern Ireland to remain vigilant and alert to any activity that is unusual, out of the ordinary or suspicious, especially the movement of plant machinery late at night or early in the morning,"" Detective Chief Inspector David Henderson said in a statement Friday.
Henderson added that the recent attacks on ATMs will have devastating and long lasting effects on the rural communities where most have taken place.
""The livelihoods of our local businesses are being jeopardised by the thefts and they are forced to face the additional costs involved in repairing their premises. The populations served by the ATMs, which are often rural, are being denied access to cash facilities. Farmers and construction firms are suffering the loss of expensive equipment and machinery, a loss from which some will struggle to recover,"" he said.
Dungiven will be particularly hard hit. The last bank in the town shuttered its doors last year, leaving the rural community entirely reliant on a handful of ATMs ""including one that charges hefty fees,"" The Guardian reported .
""Some people were joking they should've taken that one,"" said construction worker Enda Kealey, according to the newspaper.
Last month, Northern Ireland police established a task force made up of detectives from the organized crime branch to track down the criminals involved.
""We are actively looking at it being several gangs involved,"" Henderson told reporters at a news conference, the BBC reported .
It is unclear how much money has been stolen so far."
Former Diplomats Reflect On Impact Of WikiLeaks Release Of Diplomatic Cables In 2010,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862490/former-diplomats-reflect-on-impact-of-wikileaks-release-of-diplomatic-cables-in-,"Former Diplomats Reflect On Impact Of WikiLeaks Release Of Diplomatic Cables In 2010 Former Diplomats Reflect On Impact Of WikiLeaks Release Of Diplomatic Cables In 2010 Embed Embed
Nearly a decade after WikiLeaks published thousands of diplomatic cables, one former ambassador describes it as ""the toxic gift that keeps on giving."" Diplomats spent years rebuilding trust with other governments.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The State Department was forced into damage control when WikiLeaks published thousands of diplomatic cables back in 2010. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it an attack on U.S. foreign policy and international alliances. Now that Julian Assange is facing charges related to that leak, we wondered whether it left a lasting impact on U.S. diplomacy. Here's NPR's Michele Kelemen.
MICHELE KELEMEN, HOST:
Retired diplomat Barbara Leaf was in Rome reading The New York Times on an unclassified computer on the day in 2010 when the WikiLeaks cables hit the news. She was shocked to see what's called a NODIS, or no distribution cable, which are normally very restrictive.
BARBARA LEAF: Then I was like, oh, my God. You know? I got to turn this thing off, you know? It was - but beyond the comic moment which, literally, I thought, did I just give myself a security violation by looking at a NODIS cable on an un-class terminal, it wreaked havoc. These cables wreaked havoc.
KELEMEN: That was especially true at her next assignment, in Iraq, where some embassy contacts had been harassed and threatened because they were named in diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks. She says she and her colleagues became far more judicious in what they wrote in those official reports.
LEAF: Some people, I would not name. Yes. Absolutely. I would not put names in cables because of that. Government officials are generally different. But when you're talking to some, you know, average citizen, or somebody who is willing to talk candidly about policies or activities of their government that they know, you know, it's - you know, it's a third-rail topic, or what have you, I didn't put their names in cables forever after.
KELEMEN: Diplomats write these cables to give Washington policymakers a sense of what's happening in the country where they serve. They used to be accessible even to military officers in the field until Chelsea Manning helped WikiLeaks gain access to them. Now access is even more limited. And that's a problem, says Mary Thompson-Jones, another former career diplomat who teaches at the U.S. Naval War College.
MARY THOMPSON-JONES: Not enough people read the cables. That was true then and that's true now. The only person that you're guaranteed is going to read your cable is the poor desk officer who's handling everything that has to do with the country to which you've been assigned.
KELEMEN: She downplays the lasting impact of WikiLeaks on the State Department, saying Julian Assange's moment has come and gone.
THOMPSON-JONES: Technology has moved at lightning speed since then. Every embassy has Facebook, it has social media. Ambassadors get out, and they're tweeting about things. So we're in a different era already than we were nine years ago.
KELEMEN: Looking back, some diplomats joke that there was an upside to the scandal. The world got to see what diplomats do and find out that some are pretty colorful writers. The downside was that government officials who didn't like how they were described gave U.S. diplomats the cold shoulder and didn't let them take notes in meetings. That lasted for a while, says Barbara Leaf, who was the ambassador to the United Arab Emirates until she retired last year.
LEAF: There was an exquisite agony that these governments, friendly governments, felt in talking to us for a very long time. I got out to UAE four years after this, and they were still gun shy about all of this. So, you know, it is the toxic gift that keeps on giving.
KELEMEN: The State Department says it stands by previous assessments that the WikiLeaks disclosures were harmful and put lives and careers at risk. A former spokesman says the impact was serious but admittedly hard to quantify. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, the State Department. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Some Experts Remain Skeptical As Boeing And FAA Work To Assure 737 Max Jet Is Safe,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862466/some-experts-remain-skeptical-as-boeing-and-faa-work-to-assure-737-max-jet-is-sa,"As Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration work to certify critical updates to the 737 Max jet following two deadly crashes, the FAA is under renewed criticism for saying the aircraft was safe.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Officials with the Federal Aviation Administration spent hours today speaking with pilots and executives at Southwest, United and American Airlines. They are the three U.S. airlines that fly the Boeing 737 Max. Questions about the FAA's role in certifying the plane have grown in the weeks since the second fatal crash of a 737 Max. The jet is still grounded. And now, the FAA has to reassure airlines and regulators in other countries that whenever it says the 737 Max is safe to fly again, that is, in fact, accurate. NPR's Russell Lewis reports.
RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: This week on Capitol Hill, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao continued her defense of the FAA amid questions about why it approved the Boeing 737 Max.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ELAINE CHAO: The department's goal is to ensure public trust in aviation safety and preserve the preeminence of the United States as the gold standard in aviation safety.
LEWIS: The U.S. is enjoying its safest period of air travel ever - one single fatality on a major U.S. commercial airline in the past decade. But following the crashes of 737 Max's in Indonesia and Ethiopia, questions are swirling whether the FAA has taken a hit as the world's premier aviation regulator.
SHEM MALMQUIST: So the answer is yes, the FAA has lost some of that credibility.
LEWIS: Shem Malmquist has been involved in aviation and aviation safety since the 1970s. He teaches advanced aircraft operations at Florida Institute of Technology and also currently flies the Boeing 777. He says people in the industry had assumed the FAA was doing everything it could to ensure safety. So was John Strickland, a longtime aviation consultant based in England.
JOHN STRICKLAND: Of course, at the end of the day, what matters is safety. There can only be one objective - that it delivers a safe aircraft which airlines can be confident in and that we, the traveling public, can be confident in.
LEWIS: That's one reason why aviation regulators in Canada, Europe and elsewhere say they plan to double-check the 737 Max software fixes once they're approved by the FAA. Strickland says that's surprising, and before these accidents, almost unheard of.
For decades, the FAA relied on manufacturers like Boeing to help in the review and certification of new jets. These planes are increasingly complex, with millions of lines of computer code understood best by the people who designed them. When the 737 Max was approved, it was one of the first jets signed off under new rules that gave Boeing even more authority in the approval process.
The FAA has told Congress for the agency to take over all certifications, it would need an additional 10,000 employees at $1.8 billion. Jim Higgins chairs the aviation department at the University of North Dakota. He says it's not as easy as just throwing more money at the problem.
JIM HIGGINS: Because it takes many years to train people to become aircraft design engineers for these types of aircraft and then many more to - for them to get the experience to be kind of in an oversight role.
LEWIS: The extra attention being shined on Boeing and the FAA is important, says Shem Malmquist, the Florida Tech professor and pilot. He says now that regulators in other countries are planning to scrutinize the 737 Max fixes, there's value in having men and women from varying backgrounds studying the updates.
MALMQUIST: I think there's something to be said by having different cultures from around the world looking at these things a lot closer. They may capture something just based on their cultural perspective that we didn't consider.
LEWIS: The FAA, for its part, says it welcomes the added scrutiny. Here's acting administrator Daniel Elwell.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DANIEL ELWELL: As recent events have reminded us, aviation safety has no borders or boundaries.
LEWIS: But don't expect a potential fix anytime soon. The updates to the Boeing 737 Max aren't expected for weeks and possibly months. Russell Lewis, NPR News.

Nile Rodgers On Streaming Payments And Songwriters' Letter To Spotify,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712777873/nile-rodgers-streaming-payments-songwriters-letter-spotify,"Enlarge this image Nile Rodgers, photographed in November 2018 in London.

toggle caption Dave J Hogan/Getty Images Nile Rodgers, photographed in November 2018 in London.
Dave J Hogan/Getty Images Earlier this week, a large group of successful songwriters sent Daniel Ek, the co-founder and chief executive of Spotify, a short and pointed letter in which they wrote of being ""hurt and disappointed"" and accusing Spotify of having ""used us and tried to divide us.""
In order to understand why that letter was sent, we need to go back to early February. It was then that a byzantine, but important, decision arrived which would see songwriters' royalties from streaming services increase dramatically over the next five years. But Spotify and several other music streaming services — except for Apple Music — then began appealing that decision. Thus, the letter (which, when asked by NPR, Spotify declined to comment on).
The Record Spotify Cops To Its Problems And Reveals The Massive Ambitions Of Its Founder Immediately after that appeal was filed, Spotify was roundly derided, accused of "" suing songwriters ."" The National Music Publishers Association, which represents the companies that manage songwriters' business interests, scathingly observed that ""no amount of insincere and hollow public relations gestures such as throwing parties or buying billboards of congratulations or naming songwriters 'geniuses' can hide the fact that these big tech bullies do not respect or value the songwriters who make their businesses possible."" It's a characterization which Spotify disagreed with and tried to explain away.
Nile Rodgers , the leader of Chic and recently appointed chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was one of the signatories to the vexed letter. Speaking as both an artist and an advocate on behalf of them, Rodgers gave NPR a brief overview of what's going on from his perspective.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
NPR Music: Who came up with the idea to send this letter to Spotify and Daniel Ek? What was the process of putting it together?
Nile Rodgers: I was asked by my manager to participate because of my position in the songwriting community, and I felt it was an important message to put out immediately and to support vocally. I think it's intelligently presented and the message is very simple. Spotify, Amazon, et al.: Do not bite the hand that brings you your subscribers.
You're the chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame – I have to assume that part of that role is advocacy on behalf of all those who don't make it into the Hall. What are the issues causing you the most concern?
I think it's important, first, to acknowledge that thanks to streaming and companies like Apple, Spotify and Amazon delivering our songs to the consumer conveniently, the best days for music and its creators are once again in front of it. We need to help them succeed, while ensuring we get our fair and equitable slice of the growing pie. Tremendous credit goes to Apple for acknowledging the songwriter's value and affirming the [Copyright Royalty Board] ruling! [ Ed. note: Rodgers is referring to Apple's decision not to appeal the decision raising songwriters' royalties from streaming. ]
Do you think artists' best interests are front-of-mind for Spotify, or any streaming service?
Daniel Ek and Jeff Bezos are highly intelligent people. They understand that people do not pay $10 a month to be able to push buttons on their technology — they spend their money to listen to The Beatles, Dua Lipa, Led Zeppelin, Beyoncé.
If great artists and songs start to disappear from these services, the money will then evaporate and go to whomever can deliver them. I suspect Spotify and Amazon now realize they have handled this badly, and I hope for a swift resolution that has no impact on their growth.
Are songwriters treated fairly in this brave new world of streaming? Or — is streaming even the root of the problem?
Songwriters are not treated fairly! In the U.K., we have created a £350 million publicly listed fund — the Hipgnosis Songs Fund — that has demonstrated to the financial community that hit songs are as investable financial instruments as gold or oil. Our ultimate aim is to use the leverage of that fund to place the songwriter at the top, rather than bottom, of the economic equation. Songs are the currency of the music industry and these creators should be acknowledged and rewarded.
Can streaming as it's structured now ever be equitable, or even profitable, for songwriters – particularly low- and mid-tier independent songwriters, who are often the performers as well? If not, what could a possible solution look like?
There is no question that streaming will become equitable for all involved. History has many answers, and if you look at The Beatles, when they signed their record deal in 1962 [their per-single royalties were fractions of a cent]. By the time they break up, it's over 20 times that. Part of that is because they are The Beatles, but a big part of it is that the business of the long-playing record became more sophisticated, and artists started getting a fairer share of the pie.
We are in the early days of streaming and in due course, with a lot of ""discussion"" and advocacy, we will get what we deserve. For now, Daniel Ek and Jeff Bezos should immediately withdraw their appeal and demonstrate to songwriters that this was an error in judgement and that they value [songwriters'] contributions."

"In Her Debut Novel 'Miracle Creek,' Angie Kim Taps Into Themes She Knows Well",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862497/in-her-debut-novel-miracle-creek-angie-kim-taps-into-themes-she-knows-well,"Angie Kim's debut novel, Miracle Creek, is a courtroom thriller that tackles heavy themes like immigration, parenting and autism.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The new novel ""Miracle Creek"" is a courtroom thriller. It's a world that author Angie Kim knows well. She worked as a trial lawyer at a big firm. And this book taps into other themes she's familiar with, too. Angie Kim's family came to the U.S. from South Korea when she was a child, just like the central characters in the book. And the story also centers on a group of mothers whose kids have autism. Kim has three children who've each dealt with medical issues and the batteries of tests and treatments that go along with them.
ANGIE KIM: Between all of that, I felt like these are the things that I think were in me that needed to get out because I felt the need when I was in those situations to feel like other people understood.
SHAPIRO: This is Angie Kim's first novel, And it begins with a tragedy. She writes, misfortune doesn't get sprinkled out in fair proportions. Bad things get hurled at you in clumps and batches - unmanageable and messy. ""Miracle Creek"" creates a frame for some of those messy threads in Angie Kim's own life, including a childhood where her parents worked from 6 a.m. to midnight every day.
KIM: I came from this environment in Korea where we were very poor. We had no running water. We had no indoor plumbing. And the three of us - my parents and me - we lived in one room. So we were very poor. And yet, at the same time, I had them with me always.
So to go from that environment to an environment where we were in this luxurious house with multiple indoor bathrooms, which was, like, magical to me - and color TVs, but at the same time losing my parents in the process for several years, it was really painful. And I think throughout my life, I felt this sort of rollercoaster between feeling so lucky to have the chance to come to America from...
SHAPIRO: And attend Harvard Law School and have high-paying jobs, right. You are the...
KIM: Exactly.
SHAPIRO: ...American dream success story.
KIM: Exactly. And how sometimes objectively, your life can look good or bad, so my - objectively, my life in Korea was, you know, poverty ridden and things like that. But then in the nooks and crannies, there can be moments of pure joy even when you are in that, you know, poverty stricken home.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. There is a passage where you write about one painful aspect of the immigrant experience. Will you read this? This is from page 163, about halfway through the book.
KIM: (Read) He'd expected this to happen eventually, had seen how children and parents switch places as the parents age - their minds and bodies reverting to childhood, then infancy, then non-being. But not for many years, and certainly not yet, when Mary still had a foot in childhood. In Korea, he had been the teacher. But after his move when he visited Mary's school, her principal had said welcome. Tell me; how are you liking Baltimore? Pak (ph) smiled, nodded and was deciding how to answer. Perhaps the smile-nod had been enough. When Mary said, he loves it here, running the store right by Inner Harbor, right, Dad? The rest of the meeting, Mary continued speaking for him, answering questions directed his way like a mother with her 2-year-old son.
SHAPIRO: That feels very real and very painful.
KIM: It really, really was. We all intellectually understand it's not their first language. So we understand that it doesn't mean that they're not smart for not speaking it or understanding it. And yet, somehow, language is so important in our society that it's become that way.
And I think that's the other reason why I was so drawn to autism as well because I think especially for the children on the autism spectrum who are non-verbal, it makes me think back to that time when I myself felt so frustrated knowing that I had thoughts within me and saying hey, I'm here, I have opinions, I have thoughts...
SHAPIRO: Yeah.
KIM: ...But not being able to articulate that and then being able to see in other people's eyes that they think less of me because I can't speak in that language.
SHAPIRO: The book includes this community of mothers whose children have autism and have varying degrees of severity. And it's this interesting dynamic where on one level, they're kind of competitive and judgmental and jealous. And on another level, they're sort of the only people who can understand what one another is going through.
KIM: Definitely.
SHAPIRO: Tell me about this community that you built within the framework of the book.
KIM: So I became aware of this community going through all of these, you know, speech therapies and things like that as well as the hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is something that I highlight in the book as well.
SHAPIRO: This is an alternative form of therapy that is thought - in the book at least - to perhaps help with things ranging from impotence to autism.
KIM: Exactly. And one thing that I experienced myself even though I'm not in the autism community per say, but having been in that world of parents with children with chronic illnesses, when the illness takes over your life - and I think that one thing that it does that's very unexpected for me anyway is that it's very isolating because you find that you don't have as much that you want to talk to your old friends about...
SHAPIRO: Right.
KIM: ...When they have a foot in so-called normalcy because, you know, there's both envy at play and also just a feeling of they're not going to understand what's important in my life on a day-to-day basis. So I think this community becomes very important from that perspective.
But, of course, the stakes in this world are very high because it's not just a matter of oh, is your kid going to get into this college or that, it's much more fundamental than that. What is going to happen to my child when I die?
You know, so it's very heightened emotions from that perspective. And that's one of the reasons why I decided to highlight that conflict but also closeness and intimacy.
SHAPIRO: There's one moment that I want to ask you about when a character who is one of these mothers of children with autism says - clearly feeling great shame in saying this - she says I wish my child was dead. And another woman tells her we all have our moments. But they're just moments. And they pass.
So if a tiny part of us has these thoughts a tiny part of the time, thoughts we shut out as soon as they creep in, is that so bad? Isn't that just human? People don't often hear that perspective. Why did you want to include it?
KIM: I wanted to include it because I think there is this myth of a Good Mother. And I say Good Mother, and in my head, I'm seeing Good Mother capitalized, you know.
SHAPIRO: Capital G, capital M.
KIM: Yes, exactly. And I think that when you are in this situation day in and day out, there are thoughts that creep in that are shameful. And I think that because of our society's enormous pressure on mothers to be perfect and to be self-sacrificing, that those thoughts make the mothers feel so much shame.
And one thing that I've been hearing from a lot of early readers is that when they're in this situation, they have had similar thoughts that are fleeting. And they would never say it out loud even to their closest friends or to their family members or to their spouses. But hearing a character - even though it's a fictional character in a book - say that and think that and to be able to witness that made them feel like they weren't monsters themselves.
SHAPIRO: Angie Kim, thanks so much for talking with us. And congratulations on your debut novel.
KIM: Thank you so much, Ari. It was a pleasure.
SHAPIRO: Her book is called ""Miracle Creek.""

Assange's Cat Has Left The Bolivian Embassy : NPR,www.npr.org,Matthew S.

toggle caption Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images Julian Assange's cat wears a striped tie and white collar as it looks out the window of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2016.
Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno seemed annoyed when he announced an end to the seven-year residency of Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London:
""We've ended the asylum of this spoiled brat,"" he said .
But what about the asylum of Assange's cat?
The WikiLeaks founder, who was arrested Thursday, has been charged with conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network. Presumably, Assange's alleged illegal interactions with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning are the main interest of law enforcement.
Then there is the matter of paw enforcement. (Sorry.)
While holed up, Assange famously acquired a cat. The cat, named Michi, is more well known by its social media moniker, Embassy Cat . More than 30,000 Twitter followers, and 6,000 on Instagram, followed the self-described master of ""counter-purrveillance.""
New home! I've arrived! pic.twitter.com/N7PeuSti4I
— Embassy Cat (@EmbassyCat) May 9, 2016 Embassy Cat tweeted regularly beginning with its arrival in May 2016. Cute photos were the norm, with just a bit of political grandstanding thrown in — always with lots of puns. (Embassy Cat was proud to be a "" #whiskerblower ."")
But by the fall of 2016, its tweets had become much less frequent. In 2017 the cat tweeted only three times. In 2018, twice. It has been silent for more than a year. (The Instagram account has been crickets for more than two years.)
The New Yorker reported in 2017 that Assange's interest in the cat was less as an animal lover and more as a master of his own brand. ""Julian stared at the cat for about half an hour, trying to figure out how it could be useful, and then came up with this: Yeah, let's say it's from my children,"" the magazine Quote: d one of Assange's friends as saying. ""For a time, he said it didn't have a name because there was a competition in Ecuador, with schoolchildren, on what to name him. Everything is P.R.— everything .""
Shredding! I love pending WikiLeaks releases! #counterpurrveillance ! 😻😻 pic.twitter.com/vrVyJbHe9Q
— Embassy Cat (@EmbassyCat) May 22, 2016 The cat arguably played a small role in Ecuador's decision to end its asylum agreement. Moreno explained that Assange treated his hosts disrespectfully; late last year the embassy implemented a series of rules for Assange, including a requirement to be responsible for the ""well-being, food, hygiene and proper care of your pet."" If Assange didn't, the embassy threatened to put the cat in a shelter.
In other words, it is likely that Assange didn't effectively clean up after his cat's own wiki-leaks.
After Assange was picked up Thursday, some people wondered what would become of Embassy Cat. ""My sympathy to the cat,"" author Charlie Stross tweeted .

— Brent Davidson (@Brentus88) April 11, 2019 Journalist James Ball said that although he offered to adopt the cat, it was ""reportedly given to a shelter by the Ecuadorian embassy ages ago.""
But according to Hanna Jonasson, whom The Washington Post describes as a member of the Assange legal team, Assange was incensed by the threat to put Embassy Cat in the pound. ""He asked his lawyers to take his cat to safety,"" Jonasson said . ""The cat is with Assange's family. They will be reunited in freedom.""
In the same document in which Ecuador threatened to hand Assange over for arrest, Ecuador also threatened to put Assange's cat in the pound.
Insensed at the threat, he asked his lawyers to take his cat to safety. The cat is with Assange's family. They will be reunited in freedom. pic.twitter.com/W9FvDbvQgw
— Hanna Jonasson (@AssangeLegal) November 27, 2018 Wherever the cat is, it's no longer at the embassy. The Italian paper la Republicca wrote in November that the ""friendly atmosphere"" at the embassy was gone. ""Not even the cat is there anymore. With its funny striped tie and ambushes on the ornaments of the Christmas tree at the embassy's entrance, the cat had helped defuse tension inside the building for years. But Assange has preferred to spare the cat an isolation which has become unbearable and allow it a healthier life.""
The Ecuadorian Embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson told Sputnik that the cat hasn't been with the embassy since the fall. ""It was taken by Mr. Assange's associates,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are not a pet store, so we do not keep pets here.""

In a previous version of this story, we referred to Chelsea Manning as a former Army intelligence officer. Manning was an Army specialist, not an officer, but was an intelligence analyst."

Enlarge this image Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for GLAAD Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for GLAAD Now in its 19th year, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is more than a music festival, or even a lifestyle. It's a capital-M moment that seems to stop the world. (And not entirely because Beyoncé willed it so last year.) Beyond the experience of bearing witness to celebrities of the A- and D-lists as they drench themselves in sweat and dust while gorging on trendy cuisine and novelty cocktails, Coachella's influence extends far beyond the festival grounds of Indio, California.
Even Coachella seems to be aware of this: For the first time ever, it's doubling down on its festival streams by showcasing both weekends of the festival. Emergent K-pop group BLACKPINK is set to broadcast its message of sensory-overload pop music in Times Square this weekend. Childish Gambino and Rihanna premiered a new film, and with the aid of Amazon and YouTube, will premiere it globally this weekend for free.
For those looking to avoid the hefty price tag of a festival pass — or reluctant to experience Coachella anywhere but on a couch — we've got you covered. The only catch: You'll need to watch it live on YouTube , as Coachella does not make its sets available after the fact as on-demand videos.
So, without further ado, here are 10 Coachella 2019 acts worth planning your weekend around, in chronological order. And if you're the adventurous sort, you can scan and skip between a whopping 83 live performances across three channels at youtube.com/user/coachella/coachellalive .

toggle caption Mike Corder/AP Judges at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, have rejected a request by the court's prosecutor to open an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan and alleged crimes by U.S. forces linked to the conflict.
Mike Corder/AP A panel of judges at the International Criminal Court has rejected a request to proceed with investigating possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, including those allegedly involving U.S. armed forces and the CIA.
This is in response to a request from ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in 2017, a prospect that U.S. officials have strongly criticized.
In their unanimous decision released Friday , the judges said that the prosecutor's request is within the court's jurisdiction and the crimes are of sufficient gravity for it to consider the case. But it said that it was ultimately rejecting the request because ""the current circumstances of the situation in Afghanistan are such as to make the prospects for a successful investigation and prosecution extremely limited.""
The Two-Way ICC Prosecutor Calls For Afghanistan War Crimes Investigation The decision noted that the prosecutor hasn't been able to secure cooperation from the parties, making it very unlikely the probe would succeed. A significant amount of time has passed since many of the crimes were allegedly committed, the judges said, and there's a need for the ICC ""to use its resources prioritizing activities that would have a better changes to succeed.""
Some human rights advocates are slamming the decision as a dangerous precedent.
""ICC judges' decision to reject an investigation in Afghanistan is a devastating blow for victims,"" Human Rights Watch's Param-Preet Singh said in a statement . ""It sends a dangerous message to perpetrators that they can put themselves beyond the reach of the law just by being uncooperative.""
U.S. officials have repeatedly denounced the probe. For example, White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said last September that ""the United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by the illegitimate court.""
In a further sign of U.S. rejection of the effort, Bensouda's visa to the U.S. was revoked earlier this month.
Law U.S. Strips Visa From World Criminal Court Prosecutor Pursuing War-Crimes Inquiry ""We welcome this decision and reiterate our position that the United States holds American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards,"" the White House said Friday. ""Since the creation of the ICC, the United States has consistently declined to join the court because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers; the threat it poses to American national sovereignty; and other deficiencies that render it illegitimate.""
Bensouda submitted more than 20,000 pages of information to the court. She said that the groups allegedly responsible for possible crimes are the Taliban and other armed groups, Afghan forces, and U.S. personnel.
As the decision notes, the prosecutor says ""there is reasonable basis to believe that, since May 2003, members of the US armed forces and the CIA have committed the war crimes of torture and cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and other forms of sexual violence pursuant to a policy approved by US authorities.""
She also said that the Taliban and other armed groups have carried out ""a widespread and systemic attack on civilians perceived as supporting the Afghan government and foreign entities,"" and that there is also ""reasonable basis"" to believe that war crimes have been committed against people detained by the Afghan National Security Forces.
Some critics view the court's decision as a sign that it bowed to U.S. pressure. But the reality may be more complicated, as Harvard Law professor Alex Whiting wrote in a commentary on Just Security .
""This decision will likely come to be seen as the beginning of a broader effort by the judges and the Prosecutor to orient the Court's very limited resources toward those investigations where there exists some meaningful prospect of success,"" Whiting wrote. ""What is critical to this decision is that while the U.S. was the most vocal in its opposition to the Court's investigation, none of the potential targets were supportive of the Court's efforts.""
The ICC, which was established when the Rome Statute took effect in 2002, is charged with prosecuting crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression. It has focused on African countries, which has been a source of criticism.
Sima Samar, the chair of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, strongly supported the probe. ""With this decision, people will lose hope of getting justice and they might take revenge, fueling conflict in the country,"" she told The Associated Press."

What Pope Benedict's Letter On The Sex Abuse Scandal Means For Catholics : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862518/what-pope-benedicts-letter-on-the-sex-abuse-scandal-means-for-catholics,"What Pope Benedict's Letter On The Sex Abuse Scandal Means For Catholics What Pope Benedict's Letter On The Sex Abuse Scandal Means For Catholics Embed Embed
NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Natalia Imperatori-Lee, associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College, about Pope Benedict's letter about sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
It has been six years since Pope Benedict XVI became pope emeritus. Having two living men who lay claim to the title Pope, one retired and one active, has not happened in centuries. Nevertheless, that is the current state of play in the Roman Catholic Church, and there have been moments when the retired pope has stepped on the message of the current pope. Just this week, Benedict released a letter weighing in on the church's massive sex abuse scandal.
And to talk more about that letter and what it means for Catholics, we're joined now by Natalia Imperatori-Lee. She is associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College. Welcome.
NATALIA IMPERATORI-LEE: Thank you very much for having me.
CHANG: So Benedict's letter is seen as controversial because of where he places blame for the church's sex abuse scandals. Can you tell us a little more about exactly what Benedict wrote?
IMPERATORI-LEE: So Pope Benedict wrote a letter that reflects kind of his ideas about what caused the scandal and what threatens the church, which is basically the sexual revolution then uprisings of the 1960s, a sort of libertarianism when it comes to morals and the departure of God from the public square.
CHANG: I mean, we should point out that, you know, it's highly unusual that he's even speaking up. He had originally said he would remain, ""hidden to the world"" - that's a direct quote. But that no longer seems to be the case. Do we know why he's jumping into the fray now?
IMPERATORI-LEE: No. I think it's most confusing why he would jump into the fray now, particularly with this intervention which, by referring to the sexual revolution or the 1960s, is really stuff that he had talked about while he was the pope. And so it's unclear why he or the people around him felt the need to weigh in once again with the sort of causes of the crisis that we already knew he believed.
CHANG: Right. I mean, how does Pope Benedict's letter conflict with what Pope Francis has said about the clergy abuse crisis?
IMPERATORI-LEE: Well, I think the main problem is that it doesn't mention victims at all. The hallmark of Francis' approach to the sexual abuse crisis has been that he has centered victims' voices. If you look at Benedict's letter, the victim in his letter is the church. And that's a real slap in the face to people who have survived sexual abuse.
CHANG: So what are the implications of this for Catholics? I mean, having two popes - one who is officially in power, one who is not - who are now saying different things about such a critical issue for the church?
IMPERATORI-LEE: Yeah. I don't want to overstate it. I don't think that anybody thinks that Benedict is still the pope. But I do worry that it flirts with a kind of divisiveness that is unhelpful. We all know that not everybody is supportive of Pope Francis centering the voice of victims or Pope Francis' approach to how he runs the church with openness. And so I worry that it encourages people who criticize Pope Francis into looking backward to the pope emeritus as their pontiff, or their shepherd or something like that, which is really dangerous to the unity of the church.
CHANG: Right. And where does that leave Vatican leadership? I mean, is it possible that this conflict between Benedict and Francis could cause a schism among the highest levels in the Vatican?
IMPERATORI-LEE: I don't think that it will. I think that the resistance to Pope Francis is small, even if sometimes it gets loud. I think that it's not even a conflict, probably, between the two men. I think that Francis holds Benedict in high esteem and values his opinion. It's just when that opinion spills out into the public that you have these competing visions, and then forcing Catholics to maybe choose a side is not exactly where we want the church to be.

Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862511/lobbyists-see-the-indictment-of-powerful-lawyer-gregory-craig-as-a-warning,"Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning Embed Embed
The indictment of lawyer and lobbyist Gregory Craig, a former Obama White House counsel, is sending a shockwave through the ranks of those who represent foreign entities.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
In Washington, lobbyists are reading this week's indictment of a powerful lawyer named Gregory Craig as a warning. Craig did some work for lobbyist Paul Manafort, President Trump's onetime campaign chairman who now faces a long prison sentence. NPR's Peter Overby reports.
PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Gregory Craig was the top lawyer in President Barack Obama's White House. Before that, he was on the defense team for President Bill Clinton's impeachment. Right now Craig is an object lesson for lobbyists who deal with or should deal with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It's commonly called FARA.
KATE BELINSKI: There really has been a sea change in how people are approaching FARA registration and really thinking and taking seriously whether they do need to register.
OVERBY: Kate Belinski is a lawyer who helps lobbyists navigate FARA's requirements. She said that since Craig's case became public a few weeks ago, she's been getting a lot of calls about whether and how to register.
BELINSKI: I wasn't getting those calls on a regular basis before.
OVERBY: FARA enforcement is up to the Justice Department. Before 2017, enforcement was extremely light. Then special counsel Robert Mueller's task force arrested Manafort, and Belinski said Congress now pays much closer attention.
BELINSKI: DOJ is at a point right now where they can't be in a position where they're not enforcing.
OVERBY: Toby Moffett, a longtime FARA registrant and former congressman, said that since Manafort's arrest...
TOBY MOFFETT: You hear a lot more people talk about it and speak with some fear about violating the statute possibly.
OVERBY: Moffett noted the fine already paid by Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps - $4.6 million.
MOFFETT: The Skadden experience has probably, to put it mildly, gotten the attention of other firms, especially law firms which are very reputation-conscious.
OVERBY: Senate Judiciary Chair Charles Grassley wants to change the lobbying laws. He would make lobbyists register under FARA if their clients are the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies. Those subsidiaries currently come under the law for domestic lobbying, where disclosure is far less strict. Paul Miller is president of the Institute for Lobbying and Ethics, a lobbyist organization. He said FARA's stronger disclosure is good. But FARA has filing fees.
PAUL MILLER: But for small firms who do it, you know, it's just over $600 a year for the filing. And then the paperwork is a headache.
OVERBY: That would still leave open some big loopholes. People avoid both lobbying laws by calling themselves strategic advisers.
MILLER: It's not new. I mean, these things seem to be happening, and that's why we keep talking about, you know, the shadow lobbying.
OVERBY: There's also the risk of bad publicity. Tom Susman is a former lobbyist now with the American Bar Association.
TOM SUSMAN: Nobody wants to be part of the NPR story about having violated one of the federal laws when your job depends on your reputation and your credibility.
OVERBY: But those laws have proved tough to change. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Former WikiLeaks Employee Discusses Julian Assange's Arrest,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862504/former-wikileaks-employee-discusses-julian-assanges-arrest,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with James Ball, a former Wikileaks employee, about the recent arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The arrest of Julian Assange has renewed the debate, is the co-founder of WikiLeaks a journalist or a criminal? Yesterday on the program, we heard from one of his critics, former defense secretary and former CIA Director Leon Panetta.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LEON PANETTA: If we care about classified information, if we care about what our intelligence people are doing, then I think it's important that we decide whether or not somebody has the right on his own to not only gather that kind of information but release it.
SHAPIRO: Now we're joined by someone who used to work with Julian Assange. James Ball is a journalist and former WikiLeaks employee speaking with us from a street corner in London. Hi there.
JAMES BALL: Hi there.
SHAPIRO: You argue that Assange is unlikable, that he is a difficult person but that it's still important to defend him. Why?
BALL: I should be specific on this. I think it's important to defend him against the U.S. extradition on the charge that he's currently facing. I think he deliberately breached due process in the U.K., and he is right to be punished for breach of bail there. What I don't think we should do it just because we don't like Julian Assange as a person or we don't like his journalistic ethics or maybe we don't even think he's a journalist - we shouldn't let that blind us to what looks at the moment like a politically motivated and dangerous prosecution.
SHAPIRO: He has described himself as a journalist. You're saying we may disapprove of his journalistic ethics, but we should still evaluate his actions on that basis. His critics will say that as opposed to exercising any kind of editorial judgment, he was just a tool for intelligence agencies, including those of Russia.
BALL: I think if someone has evidence that Assange was a knowing tool of the Russian state, then that's something that he should face prosecution for. But that is not the charge on the table. The charge on the table relates to material leaked by Chelsea Manning. She was an ideologically motivated whistleblower. The charge around Assange is that he offered some help in cracking a password that might have made it easier for her to hide her actions. There's actually no evidence that was even successful.
And so it doesn't change the fact that we're dealing with a public interest whistleblower. And the material that was published was judged to be in the public interest by The New York Times, by The Guardian, by Le Monde, by Der Spiegel and more.
SHAPIRO: If I as a journalist with NPR helped somebody who works for the Defense Department or the CIA or the NSA hack into a secure server or access classified documents, I would likely be prosecuted for that independent of what I might do as a journalist. Are you saying that shouldn't be the case?
BALL: I think we have to look at the proportionality of the prosecution. The allegation is that Assange sort of offered to help crack a password unsuccessfully that would have helped someone who was already leaking material not be discovered. That's the kind of mistake I could see someone not trained in journalism sort of doing in a close source relationship. I think 10 years after the fact, to try and pursue that for prosecution - you know, you don't have to be a cynic to see it as a backdoor way of trying to punish Assange for the 2010 disclosures while hiving off journalistic support because we can all call it hacking and say it's different to what we do.
SHAPIRO: It's clear that while you believe that prosecutors are making the wrong decision here, that doesn't make you a fan of Assange personally. What made you decide to go work for him and for WikiLeaks at a time when he had basically driven away everybody else who had worked with him prior to that?
BALL: I mean, I was a young guy. I was 24. Assange was quite inspiring to me. And it takes time, especially when you're at that age, to see the reality of someone versus the image or the icon. And I really believed in the mission of what WikiLeaks was trying to do - you know, responsible disclosure, holding power to account. And then of course when I saw the reality, I came to a much more nuanced fear of Julian, to say the least.
SHAPIRO: James Ball is a journalist in London who used to work for WikiLeaks. Thanks so much for speaking with us today.
BALL: Thanks very much - good to speak to you.

Zimbabwean forces have engaged in ""systematic torture"" of protesters, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission has found. The torture, mostly consisting of ""indiscriminate and severe beatings,"" follows several days of looting, fires and street barricades by protesters angry over high fuel prices.
The country has been mired in violent protests after President Emmerson Mnangagwa more than doubled fuel prices earlier this month. At least 12 people have been reported killed, while hundreds have been arrested and jailed. Mnangagwa was initially seen as a more liberal successor to the authoritarian leader Robert Mugabe, who left power after 37 years in office. But as NPR has reported , Zimbabweans fear Mnangagwa may be just as repressive as his predecessor. Likewise, violence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe. Chaos and insubordination will not be tolerated. Misconduct will be investigated. If required, heads will roll 3/4 — President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) January 22, 2019
Witnesses told the ZHRC that security forces from the Zimbabwe National Army and Zimbabwe Republic Police went into houses at night, asked the males to go outside and lie on the ground, and then beat them. Forces ""would also target men and boys who live in houses that are near areas where looting took place or where barricades were set up and just make dragnet arrests without investigating,"" the report said. Boys as young as 11 years old were allegedly beaten.
""Torture was perpetrated through beating the men with baton sticks on their backs while they lay on the ground,"" the ZHRC found. In some cases, troops specifically targeted people sympathetic to the opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, including members of parliament, the commission said.
Responding to the report, a senior official told journalists that ""when things get out of hand, a little firmness is needed,"" the BBC reported .
In a statement, Mnangagwa condemned the violence by the country's security forces. ""Violence or misconduct by our security forces is unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe,"" he said on Twitter . ""Chaos and insubordination will not be tolerated. Misconduct will be investigated. If required, heads will roll."" Enlarge this image

Mnangagwa also defended his effort to stabilize the country's fuel supply by increasing prices, and criticized the violent protests that ensued. ""Everyone has the right to protest, but this was not a peaceful protest,"" he said . ""Wanton violence and cynical destruction; looting police stations, stealing guns and uniforms; incitement and threats of violence. This is not the Zimbabwean way.""
The torture reported by the ZHRC is an escalation of the type of repression the country experienced during the recent election , NPR's East Africa Correspondent Eyder Peralta reports. ""Zimbabwe has a long record of significant human rights abuses,"" he says. ""Security agents have long acted with impunity to silence and sideline dissenters.""
Although the ZHRC is an independent government agency mandated by the constitution, it doesn't have the power to dole out punishment, Peralta says. ""So little action is likely to come out of this report."" Last year, the government put together another independent government commission to look at the killing of six people following the elections last year. That commission found the military used excess force , but no one has been punished, Peralta reports.

Activists associated with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which called for a general strike last week, are facing the most harsh government crackdown following protests, Peralta reports.

Sam Gold/Courtesy of the artist Thutmose is the name of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, but it's also the stage name of Nigerian-born rapper and songwriter Umar Ibrahim. After immigrating with his family to Brooklyn, N.Y. at the age of 8, Thutmose grew up caught between the America he was experiencing and the America he imagined. ""The hip-hop, the R&B, the aggressiveness of New York City, the diversity — it was such a culture shock and I was a rather quiet kid,"" Thutmose says.
But in the midst of all the chaos, the sounds of Kendrick Lamar and Jay-Z helped the young musician make sense of the world and inspired him to make music of his own. Thutmose's debut project, Man on Fire , out now, gives a brief glimpse into the young immigrant's story.
YouTube Introduced to the scene through SoundCloud, Thutmose gained notoriety with a freestyle over Kendrick Lamar's hit record ""HUMBLE.,"" and used that momentum to release his own songs. His early experiences with New York stuck with him and influence much of his music.
""I was merely observing people, observing cultures, making friends, having crushes for the first time,"" Thutmose says. ""So it's just a lot of new experiences for me, good and bad.""
One of his first memories in the United States was when a SWAT team raided his family home and put a gun to his father's head. Young Thutmose had to quickly learn how to remain calm and cope. He has used music as his outlet to experiment and process such events and this ingenuity shows. This is a theme in Man on Fire.
""Hip hop is rooted, was birthed in New York, so there's a history of flipping your story into something positive"" Thutmose says. ""We're still here. Everybody's alive. Everybody's living, doing their own stuff, trying to chase their dreams. Trying to keep the energy positive and optimistic because that's the only way, I feel like, to really live a good life.""

WHO's Fair Pricing Forum Looks To Fix 'Broken' Global Drug Pricing : Goats and Soda : NPR,www.npr.org,Jason Beaubien,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/12/712715387/why-astronomical-drug-prices-are-bad-for-health-and-profits,"Enlarge this image Immunizations are one of the most cost-effective health interventions. Yet some vaccines are too expensive to be distributed in low- and middle-income countries. Jurgen Batz/Getty Image Jurgen Batz/Getty Image Immunizations are one of the most cost-effective health interventions. Yet some vaccines are too expensive to be distributed in low- and middle-income countries.
Jurgen Batz/Getty Image The price of pharmaceuticals around the world can vary dramatically depending on who's paying for the drugs and where those patients happen to live.
Take the pneumonia vaccine. Doctors Without Borders just struck a deal on it for refugee children in Greece. The aid group will pay $9 per immunization for a drug with a list price of $540. In local Greek pharmacies, the vaccine costs $168. France pays $189 for the inoculation while the far less wealthy nation of Lebanon pays $243 for it, according to the group. In India you can get it for roughly $60.
The global drug pricing system is ""broken,"" says Fatima Suleman , a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. ""Affordability used to be an issue primarily for low- and middle-income countries, but it's now a global issue,"" she says.
This weekend, Suleman is participating in the Fair Pricing Forum , a conference sponsored by the World Health Organization. The event brings together pharmaceutical executives, government health officials, academics and advocacy groups to look at ways to make global drug prices more affordable — while also benefiting drug manufacturers.
We called up Suleman, who specializes in pharmaceutical policy, to ask her how the global health community could help patients get access to medicines they need and allow drug companies to reach much larger markets. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Why not just let the free market sort out the price?
Well, because we are looking at a free market that's failing. Otherwise, why would something like insulin — that's almost a century old — still be priced so high that people are going into poverty not just in the U.S. but in countries like Tanzania and elsewhere to get access to their medicines? If this market was working, something like insulin would now be at an affordable price. But it's not.
There's something in the system of medicine pricing that's broken and it's something that we need to really look at and figure out how we can fix.
Part of what you are arguing is that changes in global pricing could potentially benefit pharmaceutical companies by giving them increased access to billions of new customers in low- and middle-income countries. Have you seen an example of this?
Absolutely. We saw this with hepatitis C, where at first, the treatment was priced so high in the U.S. and in Europe it was unaffordable in most of the world. [The hepatitis C treatment released by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead in 2014 cost more than $1,000 per pill, and a single course of treatment was approximately $80,000.]
Other manufacturers in certain regions of the world [were allowed] to produce the medicines and supply them to certain areas at a much lower price. [Gilead granted licenses to two companies to produce generic versions of the drug to sell only in low-income countries. These were markets where few customers could afford the original list price.] And we saw the price of the hepatitis C medicines fall dramatically.
How do you address the fact that some medicines, no matter what you do, are going to be incredibly expensive to produce?
We want transparency from the industry. Tell us what your research and development costs are, whether it's an expensive way of production that you can't get away from or whether it's a failed production line or a failed [clinical trial].
As long as everybody is aware about that, people will be much more inclined to say OK, I'm ready to pay a little bit extra for this medicine because I know that it will help fund something that's going to help me further down the line.
But at the moment there's all this murkiness. Part of the concern is the kickbacks, discounts, rebates, the perverse incentives in the system that are also unclear. So all we're saying is: Can we get transparency?
Any final thoughts on the push for fair pricing globally for drugs?
We need more dialogue [for example, at the current forum]. At the end of the day, we have patients saying, ""I want access to these high-cost medicines. Why am I not getting it?"" And I think people need to understand that changing systems is slow. [That] it doesn't happen overnight, but that there is a global attention on this issue and we are hearing their voices and we do want change. And that's why these forums take place."

NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with David Chen and Vanity Fair's Joanna Robinson, co-hosts of the podcast A Cast of Kings, about how to talk about Game of Thrones even if you've never watched an episode.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
All right. Bad news for those stragglers out there - if you have not started watching ""Game Of Thrones"" yet, there are literally not enough hours left to catch up between now and the final season premiere on Sunday. But not to worry - we are here to help you pretend you know what's going on. We'll catch you up faster than you can say, ""Game Of Thrones"" is a show about a bunch of noble families on a fictional medieval continent battling for control while hordes of ice zombies march towards civilization. So here you go - a TV cheat sheet. Spoilers, of course, lie ahead. And here to help are David Chen and Joanna Robinson. They co-host the podcast A Cast of Kings. Hey, guys.
JOANNA ROBINSON: Hi.
DAVID CHEN: Hello.
CHANG: All right. So what is the state of play as we head into Season 8?
CHEN: So there's many players. And they all want a chance at sitting on the Iron Throne, which is the literal seat of power. It's where, like...
ROBINSON: Wait, Dave. Are you trying to tell me that this is a literal game of thrones? Is that what you're saying?
CHEN: It is a literal - it's literally a game of thrones, which is the name of the show.
CHANG: How clever.
ROBINSON: OK. The way that I like to explain it is to break it down into teams. So first of all, you've got Team Army of the Dead - literal zombies. They are invading from way up north. There's Team Targaryen. They're the ones with the dragons and led by a very cute and scary blonde lady. They're headed north to try to stop the army of the dead and to join up with our third team, Team Stark. They're the ones with the magical wolves. And they're led by a very cute and broody guy with curly, dark hair. And the last team is Team Lannister - mostly just one queen left on this team. She has no magical pets, unless you count her zombie bodyguard. She's sending her troops up north but not to help the army of the living. She's out for herself.
CHANG: So I think for some people, like for me at first, ""Game Of Thrones"" was kind of a turnoff because of all the fantasy, weird, fictional, medieval stuff. What ideas do you think this show gets at that might be interesting to people who are just not into dragons?
ROBINSON: I think if you go into ""Game Of Thrones"" thinking that you understand who's going to win, what a hero is, the beautiful thing that this story does is it just blows all of that out of the water. You're rooting for someone. And all of a sudden, they vanish off the game board. Or you write someone off as evil. And then they have this great moral growth.
CHANG: Yeah.
ROBINSON: So the fact that it's morally murky and complex in a way that - I think people dismiss fantasy as being too simplistic.
CHANG: So we've covered some of the basics. But now I want to get to some next-level stuff because if I want to sound smart and, like, fake my way through caring about what's going to happen to the bazillion characters on this show, I need some good questions to just kind of throw around. Give me some.
CHEN: Well, I think the one that everyone has been talking about is who is going to be the person who ends up sitting on the iron throne? You've got to kind of choose a side. And asking other people which side they're on is a good way to get a conversation started at a party.
ROBINSON: Yeah, that's my favorite question. I think if you want to sound, like, really smart and hipster at a party, when someone says, who do you think is going to sit on the Iron Throne? - you roll up and say, like, does the Iron Throne even matter anymore, really, in the grand scheme of things?
CHANG: (Laughter) All right. I'll use that one.
ROBINSON: I think that's a (laughter) good answer.
CHEN: I would say another question that a lot of people have is, who is going to survive until the end of the show. There's people who have, like, death pools going on or brackets of who's going to, like, make it to the end of the show.
CHANG: That's sunny.
CHEN: The show is so adept at killing off characters. People say between 2,000 and 150,000 deaths.
CHANG: That's quite a discrepancy you've just cited.
ROBINSON: That's what happens when you have a battle episode every single season.
CHANG: Oh, good point.
ROBINSON: You get a lot of bodies, you know?
CHANG: So this show launched, like, a thousand memes, right. What are some catchphrases I should know?
ROBINSON: What's been actually really helpful for spreading the popularity of ""Game Of Thrones"" is the fact that in this show, each of the houses, each of the families have their own, like, personal mottos and house words. So winter is coming is sort of the most famous one. And that's the House Stark house words, you could say.
CHANG: So, like, use winter is coming in context.
ROBINSON: I would say winter is coming if, like, prepare for the worst. Something bad is coming. You know what I mean? So if someone is moving in next door and it's not who you want, you just go, winter is coming next door.
(LAUGHTER)
CHANG: All right. So if I'm trying to decide, is it even worth bingeing at this point, how would you sell me on going for it?
ROBINSON: Maybe wait until it's all over.
CHANG: (Laughter).
ROBINSON: Well, you might want to find out if the ending feels worth it. I think when ""Lost"" ended and so many people were burned out on that ending, they were like, well, I'm just never going to catch up with this show.
CHANG: Such a great example.
ROBINSON: Thanks for saving me that time, you know? So...
CHEN: I have a pitch to make you, Ailsa.
CHANG: Uh-huh.
CHEN: There is no equal to this show in terms of popular culture right now. It's a show that everyone is talking about the day after it airs. There's something invigorating and fun about participating in a work of popular culture with millions of other people at the same time. And this show is one of the only ones that gives you that. And it might be one of the last ones that give you that.
CHANG: David Chen and Joanna Robinson are co-hosts of the podcast A Cast of Kings. Joanna also has two other ""Game Of Thrones"" podcasts - wow - and writes for Vanity Fair. Thank you to both of you.
ROBINSON: Thanks so much for having us.
CHEN: Thank you so much.

Bomb Cyclone Hits Central U.S. For 2nd Time In A Month,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862532/bomb-cyclone-hits-central-u-s-for-2nd-time-in-a-month,"Bomb Cyclone Hits Central U.S. For 2nd Time In A Month Bomb Cyclone Hits Central U.S. For 2nd Time In A Month Embed Embed
The central part of the country had heavy snow and strong winds Thursday. That storm system is now moving to the Great Lakes area. Power has been knocked out for tens of thousands of people.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
If you live in the central part of this country, you don't need us to tell you about the weather you're having. Starting in the Southwest and then spreading to the Great Lakes, wind and snow have been your daily companions, and many of you have lost power.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
This is the second bomb cyclone to hit the region in a month. In weather speak, the low strengthened as the system moved east.
DAVID ROTH: Which actually was the cause of a lot of the mischief.
SHAPIRO: David Roth is with the National Weather Service. He says although the system was not as bad as the March storm, the sudden drop in air pressure was severe.
ROTH: They recorded wind gusts across West Texas as high as 78 miles an hour. Last I heard, there were over 20 wildfires that have been caused by the system.
CHANG: KLBK photojournalist Larry Rodriguez in Lubbock, Texas, was driving around the city on assignment Wednesday when he pulled over to take a video of the dust storm.
LARRY RODRIGUEZ: Before the dust started kicking up, it was a very sunny day here. And then all of a sudden, this red-orange dust gets blown up into the sky. And you can still see the sun, but it's just orange. I've never been to Mars, but I would imagine that's what it would be like.
CHANG: Maybe some of that dirt showed up in a tweeted photo posted by Jennifer Everly in Minnesota. It shows the words Texas Dust written in dirty snow on the hood of a car.
SHAPIRO: In another part of Minnesota, the state patrol took a video of one of their troopers fighting the wind on an ice-covered road in the town of Lakefield. He slides sideways and finally succumbs falling to the ground.
CHANG: To the east, snowfall topped previous records in parts of Wisconsin.
HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE: April always feels a little late for snow.
SHAPIRO: Hope Kerwan is a public radio reporter in southwestern Wisconsin. She pulled her car over in the town of Westby to talk to us. She says it wasn't just snow.
KIRWAN: On my commute in yesterday, there was thunder snow, where it's snowing but there's thunder and lightning. There were a lot of power outages because of the winds knocking over poles. I know a lot of communities around the La Crosse area were affected by that.
CHANG: All told, it was bad enough. But the second bomb cyclone could have been worse. For those folks along the Missouri River who got flooded after the last bomb cyclone, there's good news. The Weather Service says this storm is not expected to cause further flooding because the ground isn't frozen anymore. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

PBS' 6-Episode 'Les Misérables' Miniseries Focuses On The Story Instead Of Music,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862525/pbs-6-episode-les-mis-rables-miniseries-focuses-on-the-story-instead-of-music,"PBS' 6-Episode 'Les Misérables' Miniseries Focuses On The Story Instead Of Music PBS' 6-Episode 'Les Misérables' Miniseries Focuses On The Story Instead Of Music Embed Embed
PBS premieres a new version of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, starring Dominic West of The Wire and The Affair. This version has no music and tries to be closer to the source material.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Many people were introduced to the classic ""Les Miserables"" through the Tony Award-winning musical version.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, ""LES MISERABLES"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Look down. Look down. Don't look them in the eye.
CHANG: Well, a new six-episode miniseries of ""Les Mis"" debuts Sunday. And there's no music. PBS's ""Masterpiece"" instead focuses on the story. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says he was surprised at how little he missed the music.
ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: This could sound like heresy to fans of the classic musical, but I love ""Les Miserables"" without the songs. At least, I love writer Andrew Davies and director Tom Shankland's music-less version of this story, which recreates the broad sweep of Victor Hugo's classic 1862 French novel with an epic, emotional treatment.
The show's power comes courtesy of its two leads - Dominic West, who plays convict-turned-hero Jean Valjean and David Oyelowo, who is Javert, the policeman who relentlessly hunts him down. Their first scenes together are electric, as Javert assures Valjean he's a convict because it's in his nature.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LES MISERABLES"")
DAVID OYELOWO: (As Javert) I was born in prison. My parents were criminals. Men like us have only two choices - to prey on society or to guard it. You chose the former. I chose the latter.
DOMINIC WEST: (As Jean Valjean) Nineteen years for a loaf of bread.
OYELOWO: (As Javert) You've got 12 months left to serve. My guess, you'll be back in here before another year has gone by.
DEGGANS: It's interesting to see a black man play the ultimate cop given today's debates about over-policing people of color. But the central issue in ""Les Miserables"" centers on character. Are people inherently bad or do they simply make bad choices in desperate circumstances?
The story also suggests that love is the best response to tough times. West and the always excellent Derek Jacobi bring this point home while recreating a classic scene from the novel. A fresh out of prison Valjean is given a place to sleep by a Bishop played by Jacobi. The bishop challenges Valjean to love his fellow man despite his hard life.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LES MISERABLES"")
WEST: (As Jean Valjean) How can I love my fellow man when he treats me worse than a dog? It's easy for you. You can afford to be kind and gentle.
DEREK JACOBI: (As Bishop Myriel) Absolutely right. It is easy for me. But consider this - even if the world has done you a great injustice, does it really serve you to have a heart full of bitterness and hatred?
DEGGANS: West is the lynchpin of this miniseries. As Valjean progresses from hardened ex-convict to an upstanding businessman with a fake identity, the actor remains compelling and believable. With a glance, West can reveal Valjean as a flawed man reaching towards redemption but often undone by impulsive decisions and the guilt of his past misdeeds.
Lily Collins is another delight as Fantine, a poor woman whose life is ruined by trusting the wrong people. When she falls in love with a wealthy young aristocrat who is romancing her, a friend warns her of that folly.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LES MISERABLES"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) You have to remember, they're not serious, these types. They're just amusing themselves. The ground we walk on is not solid ground, Fantine. We could fall through any time. We could be down in the gutter and no one would care. Plenty more where we come from.
LILY COLLINS: (As Fantine Thibault) But why should it always be like that?
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Because it is.
DEGGANS: Fantine learns the hard way how right her friend is. That she pays such a heavy price when Valjean arguably makes worse mistakes and survives feels like a nod to the persistent inequality between the sexes. A co-production with the BBC, PBS's miniseries vividly recreates the crushing poverty and immense gaps between the lives of the wealthy and the poor in post-Napoleonic France.
This is why a new version of ""Les Miserables"" makes sense right now, as America and the world is already wrestling with tough questions centered on poverty, policing, wealth gaps and social justice.

State Abortion Foes Split Over How Best To Test Roe v. Wade : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Blake Farmer,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/12/712501336/republican-state-lawmakers-split-over-their-anti-abortion-strategies,"Enlarge this image In the Tennessee Capitol, state Rep. Matthew Hill took heat from abortion-rights proponents last month who had gathered to protest a bill he favored that would ban abortions after about six weeks' pregnancy. That legislation was eventually thwarted in the Tennessee Senate, however, when some of his fellow Republicans voted it down, fearing the high cost of court challenges. Sergio Martinez-Beltran/WPLN Sergio Martinez-Beltran/WPLN In the Tennessee Capitol, state Rep. Matthew Hill took heat from abortion-rights proponents last month who had gathered to protest a bill he favored that would ban abortions after about six weeks' pregnancy. That legislation was eventually thwarted in the Tennessee Senate, however, when some of his fellow Republicans voted it down, fearing the high cost of court challenges.
Sergio Martinez-Beltran/WPLN The new anti-abortion tilt of the U.S. Supreme Court has inspired some states to further restrict the procedure during the first trimester of pregnancy and move to outlaw abortion entirely if Roe v. Wade ever falls. But the rush to regulate has exposed division among groups and lawmakers who consider themselves staunch abortion opponents.
On Thursday, Ohio became the latest state to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected . For a long time, Ohio Right to Life supported a more gradual approach to restrict the procedure and deemed what's come to be called a ""heartbeat bill"" too radical — until this year. Restricting abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected basically bans the procedure after six weeks' gestation — before many women know they're pregnant.
""We see the Court as being much more favorable to pro-life legislation than it has been in a generation,"" spokeswoman Jamieson Gordon says. ""So we figured this would be a good time to pursue the heartbeat bill as the next step in our incremental approach to end abortion-on-demand.""
The Ohio law contains no exception for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest; it does have an exception for the life of the mother.
National A Bill Banning Most Abortions Becomes Law In Ohio National Activists Brace For 2019 Abortion-Rights Battles In The States Some say the rush to pass these bills is about lawmakers competing to get their particular state's law before the Supreme Court. The state that helped overturn Roe v. Wade would go down in history.
More than 250 bills restricting abortions have been filed in 41 states this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and advocacy group.
""After the appointment of Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh, there really is just an environment in state legislatures to roll back abortion rights. And so we're seeing these bans just fly through,"" says Elizabeth Nash , who monitors state laws at Guttmacher.
But the speed of passage of some of these laws masks divisions about strategy and commitment to the cause within the anti-abortion movement.
Tennessee infighting over heartbeat bill
In Tennessee, for instance, there's a philosophical split between pragmatists and idealists.
A heartbeat bill in the state has had high-profile support, including from Tennessee's new governor. But the Republican attorney general warned that such a law would be difficult to defend in court. And several Republicans, swayed by that logic, voted no on the bill.
""This is an issue that is extremely important to me. It's the reason I got into politics many years ago,"" Republican state Rep. Bill Dunn said as the House approved the measure over his objection earlier this year. Dunn says he wants to stop abortion, but that will require strategy. He points out that no heartbeat bill has ever been enforced. And recent laws in Iowa and Kentucky have been immediately blocked in court. The same is expected for Ohio .
""No. 1, it'll probably never save a life if we go by what's happened in the past,"" Dunn argued on the Tennessee House floor.
But it's money that ultimately stopped the heartbeat bill this year in Tennessee (it stalled in committee this week, though the state's Senate Judiciary Committee agreed to review the bill this summer).
Law Federal Judge Blocks North Carolina Ban On Abortions Later Than 20 Weeks Senate Speaker Randy McNally is anti-abortion but says he has no interest in wasting tax dollars to make a point.
Even worse, in the view of Republicans who voted against the heartbeat bill, the state could end up paying the legal fees for groups that defend abortion.
""That is a big concern,"" McNally says. ""We don't want to put money in their pockets.""
The last time Tennessee had a case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, it cost roughly $1.9 million. The experience was enough to give a few anti-abortion crusaders some pause. They voted this week with Democrats for a one-year delay on a heartbeat bill, vowing to study the issue over the summer.
Name-calling in Oklahoma
Even if it doesn't result in a case that upends abortion law, heavily Republican legislatures like Oklahoma's want to be ready.
The Two-Way Oklahoma Lawmakers Pass Bill That Makes Performing An Abortion A Felony ""If Roe v. Wade ever gets overturned, we won't be prepared,"" Republican Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Treat said while explaining his ""trigger bill"" at a committee hearing in February.
Treat's legislation, modeled after existing laws in a handful of states , would ""trigger"" a state ban on abortion and make it a felony if Roe were overturned. A handful of states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota, already have trigger laws on the books.
Oklahoma has some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, such as mandatory counseling and a 72-hour waiting period. But the most conservative anti-abortion activists in the state want more immediate action. So they targeted Treat and other self-described ""pro-life"" Republicans with protests, billboards and fliers, accusing them of not being anti-abortion enough.
""I've been called every name in the book these past few weeks,"" Treat says. ""I've had my Christianity questioned. I've had a member of my own caucus hold a press conference and call me a hypocrite.""
In response, Treat abandoned the trigger bill.
Now he is trying something else — an amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution that would reinforce that nothing in state law ""secures or protects"" the right to abortion. But that's still not anti-abortion enough for some.
""It's going to add on to that legacy that we have of death and just status quo pro-life policy that does nothing,"" says Republican state Sen. Joseph Silk.
Not far enough in Georgia
National Georgia's 'Uneasy Truce' On Abortion Ends In Georgia, a heartbeat bill passed the Legislature but is paused at Gov. Brian Kemp's desk. Supporters of abortion rights don't want him to sign it , of course, but some anti-abortion activists aren't happy either.
""It really just does not go far enough in the protection of innocent human life,"" says Zemmie Fleck, the executive director of Georgia Right to Life. Fleck argues that certain exceptions in his state's bill — for abortions after rape or incest if the woman makes a police report — make it weak.
Kemp has until May 12 to sign or veto the measure.
Cost as no object in Kentucky
The American Civil Liberties Union in Kentucky sued the day after a heartbeat bill was signed into law by Gov. Matt Bevin. But even during his annual speech to the Kentucky Legislature in February, Bevin acknowledged his intent to challenge Roe v. Wade.
""Some of these will go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But at the end of the day, we will prevail because we stand on the side of right and we stand on the side of life,"" Bevin said.
Kentucky has become accustomed to defending abortion restrictions in court. Currently, one law that makes it a felony for a doctor to perform a common abortion in the second trimester has been suspended indefinitely.
It is unclear how much it costs Kentucky to defend abortion laws that are immediately challenged. In an emailed statement, Bevin administration spokesman Woody Maglinger writes that the state is using in-house lawyers and hasn't hired outside counsel. He declines to provide a cost estimate on hours spent on these cases.
""It is impossible to place a price tag on human lives,"" Maglinger writes."

FAA Officials To Meet With Airlines And Pilots To Discuss Boeing 737 Max,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712631724/faa-officials-to-meet-with-airlines-and-pilots-to-discuss-boeing-737-max?station=KXJZ_FM,"Boeing says it's close to finishing a software update for its troubled 737 Max aircraft. This comes as the company is trying to win back public and government support of the grounded fleet.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Here in Washington today the Federal Aviation Administration is going to meet with airlines and pilots to talk about the troubled Boeing 737 Max airplanes. The planes are still grounded worldwide after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed almost 350 people. As NPR's Russell Lewis reports, these talks come as Boeing says it's close to finishing a software update that may allow the jets to start flying again.
RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: When the 737 Max entered service in 2017, it had a new safety feature. The plane would sense if it was close to entering an aerodynamic stall and force the jet's nose down. But it would do it without any commands from the pilots. That software, called MCAS, played a part in the two accidents. Dennis Tajer flies the 737 for American Airlines and is a spokesman of the Allied Pilots Association.
DENNIS TAJER: We believed it was manageable, but you had to know what was going on. But we're learning more, since the Ethiopian crash, about just how aggressive this system was.
LEWIS: Pilots of both doomed airplanes struggled to pull up before crashing. In a simulated flight of a different version of the 737, a crew demonstrates how difficult it is to control an aircraft when it wants to fly pitched down.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We're at 300 knots now, fighting. And I am struggling to keep this aircraft flying.
LEWIS: The pilots in this simulation wrestled the plane for several minutes before they eventually gained control. Boeing says it has reprogrammed software on the 737 Max to prevent it from using erroneous data to trigger the MCAS anti-stall system. Here's CEO Dennis Muilenberg speaking yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DENNIS MUILENBURG: We're taking a comprehensive, disciplined approach and taking the time to make sure that we get it right.
LEWIS: Muilenberg says the company's test pilots have flown 96 flights with this updated software, and more are scheduled in the next few weeks.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MUILENBURG: Yet we know we can always be better. And these recent accidents have intensified our commitment to continuous improvement as we design, build and support the safest airplanes in the sky.
LEWIS: That may be a long process. Neera Jain teaches mechanical engineering at Purdue University. She's not involved with the software redesign. But says Boeing's challenge is it needs to re-engineer its systems so pilots can have confidence and trust in the plane's automation.
NEERA JAIN: We have to do a better and better job of then figuring out how to design those systems in a new way so that they don't just technically do the correct things but that they are also, for lack of a better word, then being transparent to the human. And that's a piece that I think - this is certainly a strong signal that there's a lot more that we have to do.
LEWIS: The FAA's meeting today is with executives and pilots of the three U.S. airlines that fly the 737 Max - Southwest, United and American. The agency says it wants to hear their concerns before it decides when to return the Max to service.

David Greene talks to Harold Koh, the then-legal adviser to the State Department who urged the organization not to publish them.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. And let's go back in that timeline now to November 2010. The publication of 200,000 secret U.S. government documents was imminent. The then-legal adviser at the State Department sent a letter to Julian Assange and his attorney. It said, this release would harm lives, and it asked Assange to stop the publication. The author of that letter is Harold Koh. And he joins us on the phone this morning.
Mr. Koh, thanks for taking the time.
HAROLD KOH: Good to be here.
GREENE: So it sounds like the State Department was scrambling as WikiLeaks was ready to release all of these cables. Can you take me inside? What was happening?
KOH: Well, the cables - many of the cables indicate information that's threatening to human rights activists. You often have cables that say that an embassy official met with somebody in hiding - who is hiding from authorities, and this is what happened.
The request was made to Assange to redact this material so these lives could be protected. He and his colleagues were pretty much contemptuous of this and said, well, you know, let the chips fall where they may.
And so in the couple of days before the release, there was a mad scramble to try to get to all these people and move them. It was an extraordinary performance by dozens or maybe hundreds of State Department officials around the world.
Anyway, we know of nobody who got hurt as a result of the release. But when the release occurred, Assange said, see, no problem. In fact, he was the one who put them in jeopardy, and the State Department people were the ones who saved them.
GREENE: But as I understand it, didn't Assange actually reach out to you saying, give me the names of people who could really be hurt here? Why didn't you take him up on his offer to give him some names of people who were truly at risk?
KOH: I don't think that's actually what happened. The main point here was we quickly realized we were not negotiating with The New York Times or people who had high journalistic standards. And so as a result, we - there were some negotiations back and forth. And they were pretty high-handed about it, which is - we have no notion that there is any valid confidentiality interest in any of these documents. We're just going to dump them out there.
GREENE: But did Assange reach out? I mean, did you feel like there was an opening to talk to him about certain names and protect them?
KOH: There was pretty limited discussion. I think it was through his lawyers largely.
GREENE: I guess I just wonder, wasn't that an opportunity to find a balance? I mean, to protect lives but also protect press freedom, which is something that, you know, the State Department promotes so passionately in other countries.
KOH: I mean, we requested that. It was he who rejected it.
GREENE: And you didn't see an opening to explore it further - I mean, you had become convinced that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks - I mean, in your mind, was not legitimate as a media organization.
KOH: They weren't interested in negotiating. They were interested in revealing. And they were just going to say, we'll do it in the next hour, you know. We'll do it tomorrow if you don't - they weren't actually negotiating with us. And, you know, they'd received documents through some method of cyber intrusion, which we later learned more about.
So as soon as this release occurred, everybody had to go through every single cable that had been sent to see if there was anything there that we would have to then discuss with our foreign government allies so as to try to smooth over relations.
I mean, just imagine if all of your emails of the last year were suddenly put out onto the Web. You'd have to - at a time in which you have other work to do, you have to go back and look at all your old emails to see whether you've inadvertently insulted someone by saying something...
GREENE: Although to be fair, I mean, I don't work in government. Isn't it the point that people who are working on taxpayer money in government - I mean, that all the work you're doing on work emails is stuff that could at some point be made public and available?
KOH: Well, not classified emails. I mean, the classified emails are classified for a reason. And you generate information based on notions of confidentiality. I mean, if you're doing something under what you believe to be is a journalistic privilege, you tell somebody the name of sources that you wouldn't tell otherwise. And your hope and assumption was that it would be protected.
You know, like, I'm all for transparency. I favor transparency. But there are legitimate confidentiality interests that every organization has to respect or they can't do their job. And, you know, if you have somebody like The New York Times or The Washington Post who understands that idea and is ready to figure out a solution and discuss it, that's one thing. But Assange was in a very, very different place.
GREENE: Harold Koh was legal adviser to the State Department. He is now a professor at Yale University.
Thank you so much.
KOH: Thank you.

WikiLeaks Disclosures Affected U.S. Diplomacy And National Security,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712630821/wikileaks-disclosures-affected-u-s-diplomacy-and-national-security?station=KXJZ_FM,"WikiLeaks was already established for posting secret documents from anonymous leakers before its disclosure of U.S. government and military information in 2010. We have a timeline of key disclosures.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is in British custody and facing charges in the United States. And we're going to look this morning at the timeline that brought us here and also at some of the impact Assange has had on U.S. diplomacy and national security. I want to begin with NPR national security correspondent David Welna. Good morning, David.
DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So look back for me. When did the U.S. government actually begin to take notice of WikiLeaks?
WELNA: Well, I'm sure it noticed WikiLeaks 12 years ago, when WikiLeaks posted a U.S. Army manual of standard operating procedures for soldiers who were guarding hundreds of al-Qaida suspects in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But it was 2010 when WikiLeaks really got a lot of attention. That's when it posted a leaked U.S. military video that was shot from an Apache helicopter gunship, and it showed an air attack on more than a dozen people on the ground in Iraq who were clearly not fighting back. And among those killed were two men who worked for the Reuters News Agency.
And that same year, the military court-martialed an Army private - known then as Bradley Manning, who is now known as Chelsea Manning - who was charged with downloading to a personal computer that video and hundreds of thousands more military and diplomatic documents.
GREENE: Well, wasn't that also around the same time that Assange himself was accused of sexual assault and rape in Sweden? And did those accusations slow down the operations at WikiLeaks at all?
WELNA: Yeah, Assange was questioned by police in Stockholm about these sexual assault allegations, which he denied. But that's when the somewhat shining image of Assange in the eyes of some really started to tarnish. And yet, while all that was unfolding, WikiLeaks continued posting hundreds of thousands of previously secret military documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
GREENE: And then, of course, we come to 2016 and WikiLeaks, you know, being part of the story of the 2016 presidential election.
WELNA: Right. It was, and WikiLeaks posted some 20,000 emails from leaders of the Democratic National Committee in July of 2016, right around the time of the conventions. And that was a development that Donald Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, cheered.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DONALD TRUMP: WikiLeaks - I love WikiLeaks.
WELNA: And Assange, shortly after that, denied to you, on our air, that Russia was the source of those leaked emails. And then WikiLeaks, a few months later, dumped more documents right before the election from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. And that's something that she thinks may have contributed to her loss to Trump.
GREENE: All right, a reminder of the timeline here and WikiLeaks and some of the impact. That's NPR national security correspondent David Welna.
David, thank you so much.
WELNA: You're quite welcome, David.

How The Insurance Industry Helps Police Departments Tackle Bad Behavior,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606977/how-the-insurance-industry-is-helping-police-departments-tackle-bad-behavior?station=KXJZ_FM,"Bad policing can get expensive when it leads to lawsuits and settlements. For smaller cities, that can lead to serious pressure to change things from the people who help foot the bill: insurers.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
As conversations continue around the country about how police engage with the communities they serve, we've got a story this morning about an often-overlooked industry helping some police departments tackle bad behavior. Karen Duffin from our Planet Money podcast has the story.
KAREN DUFFIN, BYLINE: It was about five years ago. Tony Miranda was brought in as the new police chief in Irwindale, Calif. Fourteen hundred residents, it's a really nice little town - with one caveat.
TONY MIRANDA: The city was known for the police department because it garnered the most news. News at 6, news at 5, news at 11 - all negative.
DUFFIN: Police officers there had been accused of, or removed for, sexual assault, embezzlement and sex with a minor. So Miranda needs to make a lot of changes. He sees that there's tons of infighting. Lots of things have been neglected - training, basic technology. Like the program they use to send cops on 911 calls - theirs is broken. And when Miranda asks them, like, how do you guys even figure out where to go then?
MIRANDA: And one of the patrolmen holds up his palm and he says - like this, Chief. He's writing the calls on his palm of his hand with his ink pen.
DUFFIN: So Miranda tells his officers, I'm bringing in new blood. I'm going to hire a new No. 2.
MIRANDA: And one sergeant stands up and says, you know what, Chief? They're going to call for a vote of no confidence.
DUFFIN: Right off the bat, they tried to get him fired. And this may have been where the story ended, but Miranda had a powerful ally on his side - insurance. All those scandals had cost millions of dollars in legal fees, and insurance had been picking up most of the bill. But then their insurer told them - if you don't shape up, we're going to cancel your policy.
MIRANDA: An exterior threat that could close the Irwindale Police Department down.
DUFFIN: Without insurance, one big lawsuit could be enough to bankrupt a small town. So some towns have even shut down their police departments after they lost their insurance. John Rappaport at the University of Chicago studies police reform.
JOHN RAPPAPORT: There's a whole big, powerful, well-financed industry that is trying to influence police behavior.
DUFFIN: Big cities tend to self-insure, but smaller cities, like Irwindale, they buy either private insurance or join what's called a municipal risk pool - a sort of government insurance. In the mix of what can be a heated debate over police reform, insurers approach it as a business decision. Does this police behavior create risk? If yes, let's reduce it.
RAPPAPORT: We're not telling you you're bad. We're just telling you that your numbers are worse than they were last year, and we want to bring them back down to where they were.
DUFFIN: In Irwindale, their insurance authority gave them eight things to fix and 18 months to fix them. Miranda again.
MIRANDA: So they needed to either get a handle on things or cancel their policy. That was it.
DUFFIN: Which was motivating. There were trainings, new policies. They fixed their broken equipment. Tony Miranda got to hire that No. 2. And insurance isn't a cure-all for all bad police behavior. Insurers care mostly about expensive problems that might generate large payouts like excessive force. But pressure from the insurance authority worked for Irwindale. Eighteen months later, their insurance declared them new and improved - let them keep their insurance.
MIRANDA: I have to say, without that, I'm not sure if Irwindale would be here today. I'm really not sure.
DUFFIN: Karen Duffin for NPR News.

Americans Are Divided Over Whether Transgender People Should Be In The Military,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712607012/americans-are-divided-over-whether-transgender-people-should-be-in-the-military?station=KXJZ_FM,"The Pentagon is set to enforce a policy Friday banning transgender people from serving in the military. David Greene talks to Delton Daigle of the Schar School of Policy and Government about his poll.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The Pentagon, today, will begin enforcing a new policy that effectively bans transgender people from joining the military. Transgender people already serving will not be affected, like Army Captain Alivia Stehlik. She told us the new restrictions don't reflect what's happening on the ground.
ALIVIA STEHLIK: You know, I just got back from Afghanistan. There is already no question about whether we can serve with distinction in all areas of the world, in all austere environments. But in the meantime, it's going to be a struggle for us to continue. We're going to continue to fight this fight to allow everyone to be able to serve openly.
GREENE: Now, polls show Americans are divided on this issue. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in February shows nearly 60 percent of Americans support transgender people serving. Another poll of current and former military members shows more than 60 percent are opposed. Political scientist Delton Daigle of George Mason University took that survey, along with Smithsonian Magazine and the military newspaper Stars and Stripes.
DELTON DAIGLE: The one that we took, you know, clearly was very focused on the military community. And even while we have a number of civilians - that might be contractors or family members of service members - generally, we would still find them less supportive than as was found in the Ipsos poll.
However, there are differences even within our own poll if we just separate it into those who had served in the military and those who had not. About 53 percent of our non-military respondents were supportive of transgender in the military, compared to about 39 percent of those who had or are currently serving in the military.
GREENE: What was the average age of your polling? I mean, are we talking about a lot of veterans or are there a lot of younger people who might be in the military now?
DAIGLE: The average age in our survey was 62 years old.
GREENE: Oh, I see. So it's an older group.
DAIGLE: It is absolutely an older group.
GREENE: The White House cites concerns, saying that allowing more transgender people in the military would negatively affect unit cohesion. I just wonder, you know, given some of the facts you're telling me about your polling sample - I mean, that there are a lot of older people, a lot of veterans. I mean, can we draw any conclusions about something like that from your data?
DAIGLE: So when you look at the data and you look at support for transgender in the military, it increases the younger people get. In fact, for every 10 years younger, you could think of support increasing by about 3 percent. So the difference between a 70-year-old and a 20-year-old within our sample is about a 15-point difference in their support for transgender in the military.
So the perception of cohesion - or the perception of the risk to cohesion decreases with younger people. So people who are actively serving in the military today, I would infer, you know, are less likely to see it as a problem.
GREENE: And your poll actually asked respondents to write some explanations for their answers. What kinds of things did they write down?
DAIGLE: There are a number of responses that kind of pick up on the buzzwords that the media are using, particularly, you know, the right-wing media, who've been using words like social experiment or social engineering. But there are a number of tangential ones that also kind of might not directly refer to LGBTQ communities or, you know, this particular issue. But you could probably infer that they might be kind of getting at that.
For example, a retired military member said standards drop in order to ensure political correctness, you know, or becoming too soft and overly concerned about hurt feelings and political correctness. So there are a number of responses where you can kind of guess that, you know, today's military and its shifting culture might be having an impact. And, you know, this is probably captured within this broader shift in culture.
GREENE: Delton Daigle is a political scientist at George Mason University Schar School of Public Policy and Government. Thanks so much for joining us.
DAIGLE: Oh, thank you for having me.

Buttigieg Says Success As South Bend's Mayor Prepared Him To Be President,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712607029/buttigieg-says-success-as-south-bends-mayor-prepared-him-to-be-president?station=KXJZ_FM,"As the mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg says he can bridge the divide between progressives and ""red state"" voters. He is expected to announce he's running for president this weekend.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Pete Buttigieg is expected to officially announce that he is running for president on Sunday. On the campaign trail, Mayor Pete often makes the case that his time as mayor of South Bend, Ind., has prepared him to be president. He said so on this program back in January.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
PETE BUTTIGIEG: We transformed the trajectory of our city. This is a community that was written off as dying at the beginning of this decade. Now it's growing again.
GREENE: Jennifer Weingart from member station WVPE takes a look at just how true that is.
JENNIFER WEINGART, BYLINE: The reality of Pete Buttigieg's South Bend depends on who you are.
JAKE MITCHELL: There is a definite difference in how it used to be versus how it is now.
WEINGART: That's Buttigieg's high school classmate Jake Mitchell.
MITCHELL: It's kind of an intangible feeling. You know, everything seems nicer, cleaner.
WEINGART: Buttigieg was 29 when he was first elected mayor. He was easily re-elected in 2015, but his policies have made some in this once-industrial city feel left out. Lisa DeBerry is a community activist.
LISA DEBERRY: So you've done a lot for downtown, and you're building hotels and apartments that people who are native to this town can't even afford, even the people with college degrees. So it's like, who are you developing that for?
WEINGART: Early in his first term, Buttigieg set a goal to knock down a thousand blighted houses in a thousand days, which the city met. Jack Colwell is a longtime columnist for the South Bend Tribune.
JACK COLWELL: And that certainly helped neighborhoods where there had been these vacant houses. They were drug houses, and gangs use them. There were eyesores.
WEINGART: Most of those neighborhoods are historically minority and lower income. And when the houses started coming down, people like Regina Williams-Preston became politically engaged.
REGINA WILLIAMS-PRESTON: Well, the people rose up and said, hey, we need help out here. Don't knock down our communities. Give us assistance. Give us help. It's our tax dollars. Invest in us.
WEINGART: She's a teacher and a city council member who's running to replace Buttigieg as the mayor of South Bend. She says Buttigieg listened.
WILLIAMS-PRESTON: And that's when we got $2 million worth of investment in home repair and 2 million more dollars invested in new construction for affordable homes.
WEINGART: Another candidate for mayor is Jason Critchlow. He used to be the county Democratic Party chair. He says Buttigieg deserves some credit for turning the city around, but...
JASON CRITCHLOW: I think there is a feeling here that it's disingenuous to pretend that one person had solely to do with any of the progress made here in South Bend. I think there's been literally decades of public servants that have gotten us to where we are today.
WEINGART: Many locals here have always had a sense that South Bend was going to be a stepping stone for Buttigieg's career. But not everyone in South Bend supports his presidential ambitions, says Lisa DeBerry, especially those who were left behind by the city's growth.
DEBERRY: That's like a mother having her own children and not taking care of - and then wants foster children. It's like, no, we're not going to give you more.
WEINGART: Regina Williams-Preston hopes that if he becomes president, Buttigieg would take the lessons he learned in South Bend forward.
WILLIAMS-PRESTON: You could really be, like, the president of the United States one day. And it's up to us - like, the people of South Bend - to make sure you're ready for that task.
WEINGART: Buttigieg was an improbable mayor, and he's hoping that experience will land him in another improbable place - the White House. For NPR News, I'm Jennifer Weingart in South Bend.

Sanders' Presidential Campaign To Visit States That Helped Trump In 2016,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606998/sanders-presidential-campaign-to-visit-states-that-helped-trump-in-2016?station=KXJZ_FM,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders kicks off a tour of key states that helped send Trump to the White House. Sanders is trying to convince Democratic voters that he's the best candidate to defeat Trump.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. Today, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is beginning a four-day tour of the key states that helped put President Trump in the White House in 2016. Sanders is campaigning in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, among other states. As NPR's Scott Detrow reports, this is the latest step Sanders is taking to try and convince Democratic voters that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump in 2020.
SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Bernie Sanders' campaign manager thinks the increasingly crowded Democratic presidential primary will revolve around two key questions. The first, says Faiz Shakir, is which candidate can best deliver all the changes Democratic voters want? He thinks Sanders is in good shape on that front.
FAIZ SHAKIR: However, I think we have some convincing to do about the case that we are the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump as well.
DETROW: That's despite the fact that Sanders is near the top of the 18-candidate pack when it comes to both fundraising and early poll numbers. A big reason why Shakir thinks Sanders needs to make his case on electability - the perception that Sanders may just be too liberal, too extreme for many voters. That's especially true going into an election where Trump and Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will paint Democrats as socialists.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MITCH MCCONNELL: I never thought in my lifetime we'd have a serious debate about the virtues of capitalism, and we're having that in this country right now. You add up things like - packing the Supreme Court, getting rid of the Electoral College, the Green New Deal and Medicare for none, and you have a prescription for turning America into something it never has been and never should be.
DETROW: Shakir says, as an actual democratic socialist, Sanders would be happy to have that debate. In fact, Shakir says a big focus of these Midwestern stops will be arguing that Sanders' platform could appeal to the voters in the three states that put Trump in the White House.
SHAKIR: He offered a bunch of rhetoric that I think was stolen right out of Bernie Sanders' language. He talked about draining the swamp, about saving Medicare and Social Security, about cutting fair-trade deals.
DETROW: It's not just Sanders who's focused on electability. A lot more than in past years, Democratic voters are saying that simply winning is more important than any single policy. Electability, of course, is a subjective thing, but the ability to win back Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin would probably fit into most Democrats' definition of it. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke campaigned at Penn State University in the first week of his candidacy.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BETO O'ROURKE: We need to first show up with the humility of acknowledging that I don't know what's important to the Happy Valley - to the students at Penn State until I show up and listen to them.
DETROW: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar made Wisconsin one of her first campaign stops. Democrats in those three states are welcoming the attention.
GWEN MOORE: I think lesson learned - that you really can't take Wisconsin for granted.
DETROW: That's Wisconsin Congresswoman Gwen Moore. But Moore makes the point that winning back Wisconsin and the rest of the crumbled blue wall goes far beyond the rural white voters that often get the most attention.
MOORE: You can't put all your money into trying to make sure that rural folks get your vote. African-Americans are just like any other voters, they need to be dealt into the game. They need to feel like there is something that they can gain from it as well.
DETROW: Courting black voters is something that Sanders struggled with in 2016, according to many primary exit polls. This time, he's making a point of focusing on racial disparities, like he did last week addressing Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BERNIE SANDERS: So when we talk about disparity, we are talking about the need for more black doctors, more black dentists, more black nurses, more black psychologists.
DETROW: In the year since the tense, bitter 2016 primary, Sanders' platform has been embraced by the mainstream of the Democratic Party. The question for many Democratic voters is whether it can be embraced by the middle of the country too. Scott Detrow, NPR News, Washington.

Good morning, I'm Rachel Martin. Time for a little spring cleaning - Switzerland may be taking it a little far. The country announced plans this week to take coffee out of its national pantry.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
OK. Have you ever wondered what happens physically to people when they're in outer space? Like, what actually happens to their bodies? Scientists have shared results from NASA's twin study.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Yeah, for nearly a year, Scott Kelly lived at the International Space Station. Scientists compared samples from him and his earthbound twin brother, Mark.
MARTIN: I talked with Scott Kelly back in 2017, and I asked him about his health.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
SCOTT KELLY: You know, the symptomatic stuff is fine. I don't have any long-term negative feelings, physically, from being in space. Now, there's the things you can't feel. And hopefully, I will never learn that those are a problem.
GREENE: Those things you can't feel - well, it turns out they are as small as the protective structures at the ends of his chromosomes.
MARTIN: Yeah. These are called telomeres, and normally, they get shorter with age. But what about in space?
SUSAN BAILEY: What we wanted to do was evaluate telomere length in both of the twins before and after so that we could see, you know, where they started and then where they ended.
MARTIN: Susan Bailey was one of the scientists who answered this question. She expected the stresses of space to shorten telomeres quicker.
BAILEY: And, in fact, we saw exactly the opposite thing - that during spaceflight, he had many more long telomeres than he did before he went up. So that really couldn't have been more of a surprise to us.
GREENE: All right. Some other findings - Scott Kelly's gene expression changed, and his immune system went into high alert. His flu shot worked despite all the stress of space. Back on Earth, his body returned to normal within months.
MARTIN: Andrew Feinberg, another scientist who led part of this study, said this is a new chapter in tracking the effects of spaceflight.
ANDREW FEINBERG: I think that this study represents the dawn of the era of human genomics in space.
MARTIN: And the human body, or at least Scott Kelly's, seems pretty resilient.

Assange Faces U.S. Extradition After Years Holed Up In Ecuador's Embassy,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606991/assange-faces-u-s-extradition-after-years-holed-up-in-ecuadors-embassy?station=KXJZ_FM,"Rachel Martin talks to ex-prosecutor Renato Mariotti about the U.S. charging WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange with conspiring to commit computer intrusion. An extradition hearing is set for May 2.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Today, for the first time in almost seven years, Julian Assange did not wake up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The co-founder of WikiLeaks is in police custody. A British judge has found him guilty of breaching the terms of his 2012 bail agreement.
Looming even larger, though, an extradition request by the United States, which wants Assange on one charge of conspiracy. So will Julian Assange ever sit in an American courtroom? We're joined now by former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti to work through that question. Renato, thanks for being back on the show.
RENATO MARIOTTI: Thank you.
MARTIN: Let's start with the charge. This is one count of conspiracy connected to the documents that former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning leaked back in 2010, correct?
MARIOTTI: That's right.
MARTIN: And this is not a charge that he actually helped Chelsea Manning derive this information, it's that there was an attempt to do so. What sentence does that charge carry, that he attempted to help her break into sensitive government databases?
MARIOTTI: So the maximum statutory penalty is five years in prison. But ordinarily, ordinarily, I would expect that he would receive a sentence much below that. The X-factor here is that a judge has the obligation to consider all of the history and characteristics of Mr. Assange, as well as his other conduct. And the reality is, of course, that there are a lot of other reasons why Mr. Assange might receive a larger sentence and that could actually be up to the five years in prison.
MARTIN: What are the other reasons?
MARIOTTI: Well, for example, you know, the judge could consider harm that was caused by Mr. Assange is distribution of classified material. He might consider, or she might consider, the, you know, harm that was caused to the 2016 election.
So, you know, it's possible, for example, that, you know, prosecutors could present a wide variety of information about Mr. Assange that they would only have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence - in other words, by 51 percent - that would potentially sway a judge to increase the sentence but would not, itself, be the offense itself.
MARTIN: Which is interesting because this charge of conspiracy, it does not have anything to do with the WikiLeaks' dump of documents that had a negative effect on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. But you're saying it could affect a sentencing?
MARIOTTI: In fact, the judge would have to consider everything that he or she knew about Mr. Assange. And I'm sure the government would bring all of that to his or her attention.
MARTIN: First Amendment activists have been concerned that the United States might charge Assange with espionage because of the damage that was done by the release of those documents on national security grounds back in 2010. What does it tell you that that did not happen, that the charge was not espionage?
MARIOTTI: It tells me that the United States government was sensitive to that issue, either because they wanted to avoid a court challenge in the United States, or because they were concerned about the precedent that would set, or because the UK would not extradite purely for an offence of that type.
MARTIN: President Trump has had mixed messages about WikiLeaks, I think we can say. This is what the president said yesterday in the Oval Office when he was asked about the arrest of Julian Assange.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know nothing about WikiLeaks, it's not my thing. And I know there is something having to do with Julian Assange. I've been seeing what's happened with Assange. And that will be a determination, I would imagine, mostly by the attorney general, who's doing an excellent job.
MARTIN: So saying he doesn't know anything about WikiLeaks. But during the 2016 presidential campaign, he heaped a whole lot of praise on the group.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks. This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable, it tells you the inner heart, you got to read it. It's been amazing what's coming out on WikiLeaks.
MARTIN: So the president, there, referring to what we were talking about - all those emails that were leaked from the DNC and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. So I guess the question to you, Renato, is, legally speaking, how much could an Assange trial here in the U.S. reveal in the larger context of the Mueller investigation?
MARIOTTI: Yeah. I think that there's certainly the possibility that a Assange trial - particularly if the government added more charges - could reveal a lot of detail about Assange's activities. It's also possible that a sentencing of Mr. Assange will reveal a lot. Because, as I mentioned earlier, the government would have, in fact, an obligation - not just the right but an obligation - to inform the court of what they knew about Mr. Assange's activities.
So I think that there's definitely a prospect that all of us are going to learn a lot more about Julian Assange in the years to come, unless Mr. Assange cooperates with the government.
MARTIN: Do you think his extradition to the U.S. is inevitable?
MARIOTTI: I think it would be. It's very hard for me to imagine him not being extradited at this time.
MARTIN: Renato Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor and he joined us on Skype. Renato, thanks so much.
MARIOTTI: Thank you.

Sudan's Military To Oversee 2-Year Transition After President's Ouster,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712607022/sudans-military-to-oversee-2-year-transition-after-presidents-ouster?station=KXJZ_FM,"After nearly 30 years in power, Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested. Rachel Martin talks to Sudanese activist Dalia El Roubi about this moment in the history of her country.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Sudan's dictator has been forcibly removed by his own military. It happened yesterday morning. Sudan's defense minister appeared on state TV in uniform and announced the news.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
AHMED AWAD IBN AUF: (Foreign language spoken).
MARTIN: He said President Omar al-Bashir was under arrest and that the Sudanese military would oversee a two-year transition period before holding elections. It's the end of an almost 30-year reign for al-Bashir. Dalia el Roubi is with us now from Sudan's capital, Khartoum. She is a member of one of Sudan's opposition parties and has been jailed for her activism against al-Bashir's government. Thank you so much for being with us.
DALIA EL ROUBI: Yes. Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: What is the mood in the capital city in particular? Are people clearly tempering their optimism?
EL ROUBI: I think the build-up yesterday to the announcement was filled with so much hope and commitment. And the streets were filled, waiting for the announcement of the defense minister. We were extremely disappointed to hear the announcement because it was, first of all, exemplary of how the regime has no respect for the values of our opinions and our rights, even with the change of Omar al-Bashir because, actually, in essence, we didn't just ask for him to go. We're asking for a whole system to go, and that change has to happen.
For us to be told, after all this time of protest and the best that have occurred - not just in the protest, but in the past 30 years by this regime - and to be told by someone who is actually blacklisted in the U.S. sanctions since 2007 because he was participating in the Darfur war - to be told by this very man that he is here to provide a transitional system or transitional government for the next two years - it's nothing close to what we are demanding.
MARTIN: So al-Bashir is gone, but now the military has stepped in. You say they're just an extension of him. So today, on this day of prayer, on this day of reflection, what is your hope? What happens now?
EL ROUBI: We keep standing, peacefully resisting. We have taken a huge step by getting rid of the head of the regime, but what we are dealing with is an Islamist movement. We have to understand that, as Muslims ourselves, we are fighting against an extreme form of the dictator that claims to be Muslim, and they are not.
We are coming back after 30 years, and the past six days has been a symbol of that. So on - upon reflection, the way forward is that we will continue in the sit-ins until the whole system is gone, the Islamic regime of the government is gone from all of it 'cause these people are a symbol of the brutality which we are against.
MARTIN: A particular woman got a lot of attention and headlines in recent days - became a symbol of the protesters - a young Sudanese woman who was wearing white, standing on a car in front of masses of protesters, reciting poetry. Can you tell us about her and why she became the symbol of the resistance?
EL ROUBI: I think that for us, Alaa Salah was a symbol of, two-thirds of the people in the protests are women. And you can see it. Anyone who's in the sit-ins or sees images - you know, you can see the presence of women of all ages and all backgrounds. What that image did was it kind of summed it up, you know? It was just the right image with the combination of even the woman looking at her and listening to her. The poetry that she has is quoted from a poem by an activist female.
So there was a lot of solidarity in that image. She really was an opportunity for us to really come together and realize that this is a symbol of something that represents all of these memories - you know? - and the symbolism around it.
MARTIN: Dalia El Roubi, a Sudanese opposition activist. She joined us on the line from Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. Dalia, thank you so much for your time.
EL ROUBI: Thank you.

Should We Have Empathy For Those We Hate?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606984/should-we-have-empathy-for-those-we-hate?station=KXJZ_FM,"The latest episode of NPR's Podcast Invisibilia examines the history of empathy in American culture. In this era of political polarization, empathy has fallen out of fashion.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Empathy can seem like just what's needed in an age of deep polarization, right? But psychologists and neurologists are discovering that empathy can actually have a really dark side.
Here's Invisibilia co-host Hanna Rosin.
HANNA ROSIN, BYLINE: In 1977, a young psychology graduate student named Mark Davis was hunting around for a dissertation topic when he landed on a decent idea. At the time, people were very interested in the concept of empathy, but no one knew precisely how to define it yet.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: So Mark wrote up a list of statements to try and parse out its different dimensions. For example, question number two - read by my colleague from Hidden Brain, Parth Shah.
PARTH SHAH, BYLINE: I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me.
ROSIN: Empathic concern - feeling compassion for people in need. And another question...
SHAH: Before criticizing someone, I try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place.
ROSIN: That measures perspective taking - imagining the world from someone else's point of view. A list of 28 questions - agree or disagree. And the list was a huge success - used thousands of times by researchers who were tracking the empathy levels of America's youth.
SHAH: I sometimes find it difficult to see things from the other guy's point of view. I sometimes don't feel very sorry for other people when they're having problems. I believe there are two sides to every question, and I try to look at them both. If I'm sure I'm right about something, I don't waste time listening to other people's arguments.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: Is this Sara?
SARA KONRATH: Mmm hmm.
ROSIN: Sara Konrath, a professor at the University of Indiana.
KONRATH: I study empathy and altruism.
ROSIN: In 2010, Sara had this idea that she would track down as many studies as she could find that used Mark's list and see if she could find any patterns.
KONRATH: But when I saw the picture - to just see this line declining over time, it was surprising.
ROSIN: A straight slide downwards, starting around 2000, in perspective taking and empathic concern.
KONRATH: We found a 40 percent decline in empathy.
ROSIN: 40 percent.
KONRATH: Yep.
ROSIN: Isn't that a lot?
KONRATH: It feels like a lot.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: What happened to empathy? - because in the '70s, when Mark made that list and when I was growing up, being empathic was something you 100 percent aspired to.
FRITZ BREITHAUPT: Absolutely. That's exactly how I grew up.
ROSIN: This is Fritz Breithaupt, a professor at the University of Indiana who wrote a book on empathy. After World War II, social scientists and psychologists started to push this concept of empathy into the culture. The idea was we were either headed for World War III or we were going to have to learn to see the world through each other's eyes.
BREITHAUPT: And that was always the idea - that had the Germans had had more empathy in the 1930s, Hitler would not have happened. The genocide would not have happened. Empathy was kind of seen as the hope against all of these kind of things.
ROSIN: In my elementary school in the '70s, we wrote letters to pretend Russian pen pals in order to teach us to open our hearts to our enemies. Empathy was also big with civil rights activists. The idea was that people with power and privilege were supposed to inhabit the realities of people without power, not from the safe noblesse, oblige distance of pity but from the inside.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: So when did you notice a skepticism about empathy start to creep in?
BREITHAUPT: What I noticed was, indeed - it happened in classrooms. It was students.
ROSIN: Over a decade ago, students just stopped buying the automatic logic of empathy. Like, why should they put themselves in the shoes of someone who was not them, much less someone they thought was harmful?
BREITHAUPT: The good purpose it serves is to empower people who feel victimized by certain other people to say, OK. It's important for me to step up against that - against abuse, about discrimination, about injustice. So...
ROSIN: So it's to refuse to have your strength sapped, essentially.
BREITHAUPT: Yes, exactly, by those other people.
ROSIN: The new rule for empathy is reserve it, not for your, quote, unquote, ""enemies"" but for the people you believe are hurt or you have decided need it the most - for your own team...
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: ...Which is a problem because here's the dirty secret about empathy. Lately, psychologists and neurologists have started to look at how empathy actually works in our brains. And one thing they found, says Fritz...
BREITHAUPT: One of the strongest triggers for human empathy is absolving some kind of conflict between two other parties.
ROSIN: The Super Bowl, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Kavanaugh hearings.
BREITHAUPT: But once they take the side, they're drawn into that perspective. And that leads to strong - very strong empathy and to strong polarization, where, suddenly, you only see this one side and not the other side any longer.
ROSIN: Researchers who study empathy have noticed that it's actually really hard to empathize with people who are different than you are. But set up a conflict, and people get into automatic empathy overdrive with their own team. This is a kind of dynamic that Fritz says might even be motivating terrorists.
BREITHAUPT: Some terrorists - it's not an complete absence of empathy that draws them in. But rather, it's an excess of empathy. They feel the pity. They feel the suffering of their people.
ROSIN: This is why Fritz called his new book ""The Dark Sides Of Empathy"" because there's a point at which empathy starts to look more like tribalism - a way to keep reinforcing your own point of view and blocking out any others. In my generation, we thought of empathy as the big, warm sun, lighting the path to peace for us all. Now it operates like a torch. You shine it on your friends and use it to burn your enemies.
What's the endgame of excluding some people from the possibility of empathy?
BREITHAUPT: Basically, you give up on civil society at that point. You give up on democracy because if you feed into this division more and you let it happen, it will become so strong that it becomes dangerous.
ROSIN: So why aren't you one of these people who say, I'm against empathy? Say the concept is so tainted - like, we've learned so much about it and how it works and how corrupting it can be that it's just not a useful concept.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
BREITHAUPT: I think that empathy still, overall, is the key to all humanity. Without empathy, we would be just alone. I mean, throwing that out would be - well, cutting out 90 percent of what our life is all about.
ROSIN: Empathy in its elemental, basic form - one person looking another in the eye and really seeing them. However we use it - for friends, for enemies - it's the substance that keeps us from spinning out into loneliness - the worst way of being, except for all the others.

Claudia Torrens/AP Claudia Torrens/AP Ana Garcia (left) and her daughter Genesis Amaya of Valley Stream, N.Y., were reunited through the Central American Minors program in 2016 before President Trump terminated the program.
Claudia Torrens/AP The Trump administration has agreed to settle a lawsuit with a dozen Central American families who challenged the government's cancellation of a program that was designed to reunite children in that region with their parents living in the U.S.
As a result, some 2,700 children living in Central America may be allowed to enter the U.S. at a time when the Trump administration is actively trying to dissuade other migrants from attempting to come to this country.
The program, called the Central American Minors program, was initiated during the Obama administration in 2014 in response to a surge of unaccompanied minors who sought to join their parents. Minors in Central America who had parents residing legally in the U.S. were eligible to apply for permanent residence as refugees, or for parole — a designation allowing someone to legally reside in the U.S. Over 1,335 minors arrived in the United States, according to a 2018 court order.
That order followed the Trump administration's termination of the program in August 2017. The government also rescinded parole for about 2,700 minors who already had been conditionally approved, but had not yet traveled to the U.S.
The International Refugee Assistance Project and the law firm Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, filed suit on behalf of the families whose children essentially were in the pipeline when the administration canceled the program. The plaintiffs alleged that there was a "" secret shutdown "" of the program in the early days of the Trump administration, even as the government continued to solicit and accept funds from applicants to pay for medical examinations and travel to the U.S.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler ruled in December 2018 that the administration's mass revocation of the conditional approvals for the minors was illegal. In a March 1 ruling , she ordered the government to resume processing the children. But she did not compel the Department of Homeland Security to ""reach any particular outcome with respect to the processing of any individual beneficiary.""
Under the terms of the settlement, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service ""agrees to process the approximately 2,700 individuals who were conditionally approved for parole prior to the CAM Parole program's termination and then issued rescission notices, as well as any later born children who are classified as add-ons.""
According to a statement announcing the settlement, the International Refugee Assistance Project said, ""The government anticipates most applicants will be approved for parole and allowed to travel to the U.S.""
One plaintiff, identified in court documents only as ""S.A.,"" had applied on behalf of her daughter and grandchild.
""My heart jumps and cries for joy because there are so many who need to escape danger. I have faith that I will be together with my daughter and grandson soon,"" she said in the IRAP statement.
""We are so pleased that after many years apart our clients will finally have the opportunity to reunite with each other in safety,"" said IRAP Litigation Staff Attorney Linda Evarts.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to an email request for comment."
DEP to begin statewide sampling for six PFAS chemicals,stateimpact.npr.org,Jon Hurdle,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2019/04/12/dep-to-begin-statewide-sampling-for-six-pfas-chemicals/,"Energy. Environment. Economy. A reporting project of NPR member stations
The Horsham Air Guard Station in Bucks County, Pa. where the use of PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam has been linked with contamination of local water supplies. Jon Hurdle / StateImpact Pennsylvania April 12, 2019 | 05:02 PM Updated: April 12, 2019 | 7:42 pm DEP to begin statewide sampling for six PFAS chemicals Year-long program to focus on sources of likely contamination including military bases and airports Jon Hurdle Recent Stories Jon is an experienced journalist who has covered a wide range of general and business-news stories for national and local media in the U.S. and his native U.K. As a former Reuters reporter, he spent several years covering the early stages of Pennsylvania’s natural gas fracking boom and was one of the first national reporters to write about the effects of gas development on rural communities. Jon trained as a general news reporter with a British newspaper chain and later worked for several business-news organizations including Bloomberg News and Market News International, covering topics including economics, bonds, currencies and monetary policy. Since 2011, he has been a freelance writer, contributing Philadelphia-area news to The New York Times; covering economics for Market News, and writing stories on the environment and other subjects for a number of local outlets including StateImpact. He has written two travel guidebooks to the European Alps; lived in Australia, Switzerland, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, and visited many countries including Ethiopia, Peru, Taiwan, and New Zealand. Outside of work hours, Jon can be found running, birding, cooking, and, when weather permits, gardening in the back yard of a Philadelphia row home where he lives with his partner, Kate.
Pennsylvania environmental officials said on Friday they will soon begin testing for toxic PFAS chemicals in public water systems near likely sources of contamination including military bases, landfills and factories.
The Department of Environmental Protection said it will sample more than 300 water systems starting in May in a program that is due to last a year.
In a 66-page description of its sampling plan , the DEP’s Bureau of Safe Drinking Water said it aimed to identify known location and potential source of PFAS contamination across the state, assess the risk to drinking water sources, and select public water systems as a control group.
The bureau said it will test for six PFAS chemicals including PFOA and PFOS. It did not name specific locations for sampling but published state maps showing potential water sources for testing, and other places including industrial sites and airports. The map of potential water sources shows a concentration of sites in southeastern Pennsylvania including Lancaster, Berks, Lehigh, Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, Philadelphia and Delaware counties.
A full list of the sampling locations will be published when monitoring is complete, said DEP spokesman Neil Shader. He said the program will not be a comprehensive survey of all public water systems but a “representative sample” to determine the prevalence of PFAS chemicals.
Any system that exceeds the EPA’s health advisory limit will have to confirm its tests and to notify the public, Shader said.
PFAS chemicals have been found in the blood serum of 97 percent of the U.S. population, the plan description said, and in 38 U.S. states including Pennsylvania, although there is “limited occurrence data” in Pennsylvania.
The $250,000 initiative follows Pennsylvania’s announcement in February that it will begin to set its own health limits for PFOA and PFOS. The state announced its plan the day after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not commit to setting national limits as part of a long-awaited “Action Plan” to curb the chemicals.
“DEP will not hesitate to step up when the federal government fails to,” DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell said in a statement.
In the absence of federal regulation, and amid rising public concern about the chemicals’ risk to public health, some states have set their own strict limits on the most commonly found PFAS chemicals. New Jersey last September became the first state to regulate PFNA, and has recently adopted tough standards on PFOA and PFOS.
Pennsylvania does not set its own limits for the chemicals — which are linked to health conditions including cancer, low birth weights, and elevated cholesterol – but relies on an EPA lifetime health advisory of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and PFOA combined, a level that advocates say is much too lax to protect public health.
On April 15, the Wolf Administration is due to hold the latest public meeting of its PFAS Action Team, a panel of state officials who are charged with investigating the contamination and recommending cleanup strategies.
Some PFAS chemicals were used in consumer products like nonstick cookware and flame-retardant fabrics, starting in the 1940s. Although they are no longer made by U.S. manufacturers, they persist in many public and private water sources because they don’t break down in the environment.
The chemicals have also been used for decades in firefighting foam on military bases such as those near the eastern Pennsylvania town of Horsham, where water systems have been contaminated by PFAS chemicals. Local authorities there have taken their own measures to remove PFAS from water supplies, but local people are still concerned that the bases remain a source of contamination for groundwater.
Delaware Riverkeeper Network, an environmental group that has long campaigned for strict limits on the chemicals, welcomed DEP’s plans to investigate contamination but said the process is already later than it should have been and the plan means it will be two years or more before any maximum contaminant limits on the chemicals are in place.
“We need the sampling data as soon as it can be gathered and compiled so that we will not have to wait another year before DEP proposes maximum contaminant levels for PFAS compounds,” said DRN’s deputy director, Tracy Carluccio. “We needed action yesterday, not years from now.”
In January, the Navy canceled a plan to ship 4,500 tons of PFAS-contaminated soil from the former air station at Willow Grove near Horsham to a landfill in southern New Jersey. The landfill dropped its agreement to take the soil following media reports on the plan.
In 2013-15, the EPA tested for six PFAS chemicals in Pennsylvania as part of a national monitoring program. That sampling included Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, both of which were found to contain PFOA and PFOS below the EPA’s 70 ppt level. Explainers"
How Social Media Is Putting Z At An Advantage When It Comes To Jobs Gen : NPR,www.npr.org,Hafsa Quraishi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/702555175/under-employers-gaze-gen-z-is-biting-its-tongue-on-social-media,"Keeping It Civil: How To Talk Politics Without Letting Things Turn Ugly
""Hiring is always kind of a judgment call,"" says Michelle Armer, the chief people officer at CareerBuilder. ""Employers are eager to find more information that will support the decision that they're making.""
Silmi realized the only way to beat those employers was not to leave social media completely, but to join their game.
From the ashes of her old account that detailed her youth, a new one arose: This account was public, too, but it depicted a professional persona that was lacking in the other account. She uses this new account to share credible news articles and the latest updates on her journalism career — with a few sports tweets scattered in between. Super excited to announce that I’ll be a part of this year’s class with the @nyt_institute ! #NYTSJI — Malak Silmi (@MalakSilmi) April 6, 2019
Silmi's generation grew up with social media. Generation Z, nicknamed ""iGen,"" is the post-millennial generation responsible for 'killing' Facebook and for the rise of TikTok .
Twitter went live in 2006, and Snapchat in 2011, when the older members of Gen Z were only 14. A lifetime of exposure, some experts say, actually makes them the most prepared generation for this kind of social media surveillance.
""In a sense, [Gen Zers] are actually in better positions than millennials who embrace a much more rigid social network, like Facebook,"" said Taylor Lorenz, an Internet culture reporter at The Atlantic . ""Because [Gen Z] has grown up with a lot of these platforms, they are cognizant of their image from the time that they're getting on social media.""
In fact, Lorenz notes, some children start thinking of their online presence in the third grade . Because of this awareness, they're very careful of curating their online branding. According to Colby Zintl, the vice president of external affairs for Common Sense Media, this opens up a need to teach youth about social media.
""We teach people to drive, how to have safe sex, and how to eat well: the Internet is just another one of those things that need to come with some instructions,"" said Zintl. Curricula like Common Sense Education's digital citizenship program are working to educate the younger generation on how to use social media, something the older generations were never taught.
Because of this extra education and hands-on learning, teenagers are often more savvy of these social platforms than the employers that are searching through them — it's just a matter of making social media work for them, rather than against them.
Some users are regularly cleaning up — ""re-curating"" — their online profiles. That can mean changing the people they follow and the things they post, or deleting old posts that no longer reflect a personal brand. Cleanup apps, like TweetDelete , exist to help during this process.
""There's an expectation right now that you have control over your own feed, because you do,"" said Lorenz. ""So you need to be constantly re-curating them.""
Gen Zers also use social media in more ephemeral ways than older generations — Snapchat stories that disappear after 24 hours, or Instagram posts that they archive a couple of months later.
Where Facebook is usually tied directly to a user's real name and identity, the personas on the platforms Gen Zers use, like Twitter and Instagram, can be altered and controlled. Gen Zers already use a multitude of strategies to make sure their online presence is visible only to who they want: They set their account to private, change their profile name or handle, even make completely separate ""fake"" accounts .
Armer of CareerBuilder still urges young people to post with caution at the outset, rather than relying on ways to clean up those feeds.
""I would be hesitant to put anything online that you wouldn't want a hiring manager to see,"" said Armer. ""If it's been on the Internet, it's never really gone."""

toggle caption Meg Anderson/NPR Patti Saylor says that after her son Ethan's death in 2013, she realized that police officers need more training in working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Meg Anderson/NPR Working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, like Down syndrome or autism, can be complex and challenging even for those with years of training. But one group — law enforcement — often encounters people with these conditions in high-stress situations, with little or no training at all.
Patti Saylor knows all too well what the consequences of that can be.
Her son Ethan, who had Down syndrome, died after an encounter with law enforcement when he was 26. It's a tragedy she believes could have been prevented.
In January 2013, Ethan went to see the movie Zero Dark Thirty at a mall in Frederick County, Md. Afterward, when his support aide went to get the car, Ethan went back inside to try to see the movie a second time, but he didn't buy a new ticket.
Three off-duty sheriff's deputies, who were working as security guards, confronted him.
""He didn't cooperate, of course,"" Patti Saylor says. ""He didn't want to leave. At that point, I believe, he wouldn't know what was going on.""
According to a civil lawsuit filed by Ethan's parents, the deputies ""tried to drag him from the theater,"" and Ethan ""ended up on the floor with at least one deputy on top of him."" The deputies said Ethan was asked to leave before they took him by the arms. They denied any wrongdoing in the case, which reached a settlement last year .
There on the floor of the movie theater, Ethan stopped breathing. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. His death, from asphyxia, was ruled a homicide . A Frederick County grand jury cleared the deputies of criminal charges.
Ever since, Patti Saylor has been fighting to change the way law enforcement personnel are trained when encountering people like Ethan. She says families like hers — with firsthand knowledge — have a unique perspective.
""We know something the police don't know,"" Patti Saylor says. ""I felt like we needed to teach them, and then hold them accountable.""

Meg Anderson/NPR ""It's not always resistance""
Ethan Saylor's death highlighted the lack of training many law enforcement officers have when it comes to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.
Instead, much of their training revolves around how to gain and maintain control of a situation. Police training programs nationwide spend, on average, 168 hours teaching officers about use of force, weapons and defensive tactics, according to the most recent statistics from the Justice Department. That compares with only 10 hours spent on mental illness, for example. For that report, the government did not track the training time devoted to intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Police training often creates the mindset: ""I am the boss. You do what I tell you to do,"" says Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and now a University of South Carolina law professor who studies police regulation. ""And if someone doesn't do what I tell them to do, it is indicative of a potential threat.""
StoryCorps A Mother Of A Son With Autism Thanks A Stranger Who Helped: 'Nobody Does What You Do' Experts say people with intellectual disabilities may have trouble processing those orders. They may struggle to follow directions or manage emotions.
""It's not always noncompliance. It's not always resistance. Sometimes it's inability,"" Stoughton explains. ""The officer very often will perceive that inability as a refusal.""
Some police training addresses intellectual and developmental disabilities within what is known as crisis intervention training, which largely focuses on mental illness and substance abuse. At least 27 states and the District of Columbia require officers to be taught how to respond to someone with mental health or substance abuse issues, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Stoughton says the skills taught in those types of training — good communication skills, practicing patience, and earning a person's cooperation — may apply when responding to a person with an intellectual or developmental disability.
But, he says, the signs of a mental health crisis don't always apply to someone with this type of disability. Without specific training on these disabilities, he says, an officer might not recognize that they should adjust their behavior.
""Different tools to use on the street""
Six years after Ethan Saylor's death, Maryland has become a leader among states in requiring police training on how to respond to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions adopted the new requirements statewide in 2014. The next year, the state established the Ethan Saylor Alliance , which helps ensure that people with these types of disabilities play a central role in the training.
Two professors at Loyola University Maryland, Lisa Schoenbrodt and Leah Saal, developed one such training. With a state grant , they hired 10 adults with a range of disabilities to role-play common scenarios with police. Last fall, they piloted the class at Prince George's Community College.

Meg Anderson/NPR ""If we can provide a different perspective and give them different tools to use on the street, I just think that's great,"" says Percy Alston, the director of the college's Public Safety and Security Institute.
Alston is responsible for training new and experienced police officers on how responding to people with these disabilities might be different than what officers are used to. He cites one very basic example: A lot of police officers don't like to be touched.
""Once I put my uniform on, I'm like Superman; you can't touch my cape. But there are people with certain disabilities that do like to touch,"" Alston explains. ""So them touching you is not going to be an assault.""
On a Friday morning at the police academy, Alston leads about a dozen officers through the first half of the class, and then the Loyola trainers role-play with some of the officers. In one scenario, trainer Elaina Camacho, who has autism, played a daughter who threatens her mom. Officer Joseph Powell, who works with the Prince George's County public schools, calmed Camacho down by doing something unusual: He asked to play her video game while they talked.
Alston says that moment gets at the heart of what the class is all about. He knows that officers have to think fast and respond quickly, and they must protect their own safety. But when they encounter someone who has an intellectual or developmental disability, they may need to slow down and approach things in a different way.
Patti Saylor believes that could have made the difference for Ethan.
""So many police officers have asked me, what should they have done? And I said, 'Well, you've got to use your bag of tricks,' "" she says. In Ethan's case, ""if you really wanted him to leave, you may have said, 'let's go on out here and get a snack while we wait for your mother.' ""
""There's no magic pixie dust,"" she adds. ""It is relationship."""
State Abortion Foes Split Over How Best To Test Roe v.

Matthew Hill took heat from abortion-rights proponents last month who had gathered to protest a bill he favored that would ban abortions after about six weeks' pregnancy. That legislation was eventually thwarted in the Tennessee Senate, however, when some of his fellow Republicans voted it down, fearing the high cost of court challenges.
Sergio Martinez-Beltran/WPLN The new anti-abortion tilt of the U.S. Supreme Court has inspired some states to further restrict the procedure during the first trimester of pregnancy and move to outlaw abortion entirely if Roe v. Wade ever falls. But the rush to regulate has exposed division among groups and lawmakers who consider themselves staunch abortion opponents.
On Thursday, Ohio became the latest state to ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected . For a long time, Ohio Right to Life supported a more gradual approach to restrict the procedure and deemed what's come to be called a ""heartbeat bill"" too radical — until this year. Restricting abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected basically bans the procedure after six weeks' gestation — before many women know they're pregnant.
""We see the Court as being much more favorable to pro-life legislation than it has been in a generation,"" spokeswoman Jamieson Gordon says. ""So we figured this would be a good time to pursue the heartbeat bill as the next step in our incremental approach to end abortion-on-demand.""
The Ohio law contains no exception for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest; it does have an exception for the life of the mother.
National A Bill Banning Most Abortions Becomes Law In Ohio National Activists Brace For 2019 Abortion-Rights Battles In The States Some say the rush to pass these bills is about lawmakers competing to get their particular state's law before the Supreme Court. The state that helps overturn Roe v. Wade would go down in history.
More than 250 bills restricting abortions have been filed in 41 states this year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and advocacy group.
""After the appointment of Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh, there really is just an environment in state legislatures to roll back abortion rights. And so we're seeing these bans just fly through,"" says Elizabeth Nash , who monitors state laws at Guttmacher.
But the speed of passage of some of these laws masks divisions about strategy and commitment to the cause within the anti-abortion movement.
Tennessee infighting over ""heartbeat bill""
In Tennessee, for instance, there's a philosophical split between pragmatists and idealists.
A heartbeat bill in the state has had high-profile support, including from the Tennessee's new governor. But the Republican attorney general warned such a law would be difficult to defend in court. And several Republicans, swayed by that logic, voted no for the heartbeat bill.
""This is an issue that is extremely important to me. It's the reason I got into politics many years ago,"" Republican state Rep. Bill Dunn said as the House approved the measure over his objection earlier this year. Dunn says he wants to stop abortion, but that will require strategy. He points out that no heartbeat bill has ever been enforced. And recent laws in Iowa and Kentucky have been immediately blocked in court. The same is expected for Ohio .
""Number one, it'll probably never save a life if we go by what's happened in the past,"" Dunn argued on the Tennessee House floor.
But it's money that ultimately stopped the heartbeat bill this year in Tennessee (It stalled in committee this week, though the state's Senate Judiciary Committee agreed to review the bill this summer.)
Law Federal Judge Blocks North Carolina Ban On Abortions Later Than 20 Weeks Senate Speaker Randy McNally says he's pro-life too, but has no interest in wasting tax dollars to make a point.
Even worse, in the view of Republicans who voted against the heartbeat bill, the state could end up paying the legal fees for groups that defend abortion.
""That is a big concern,"" McNally says. ""We don't want to put money in their pockets.
The last time Tennessee had a case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, it cost roughly $1.9 million. The experience was enough to give a few anti-abortion crusaders some pause. They voted this week with Democrats for a one-year delay on a heartbeat bill, vowing to study the issue over the summer.
Name-calling in Oklahoma
Even if it doesn't result in a case that upends abortion law, heavily Republican legislatures like Oklahoma's want to be ready.
The Two-Way Oklahoma Lawmakers Pass Bill That Makes Performing An Abortion A Felony ""If Roe v. Wade ever gets overturned, we won't be prepared,"" Republican Senate Pro Tempore Greg Treat said while explaining his so-called ""trigger bill"" at a committee hearing in February.
Treat's legislation, modeled after existing laws in a handful of states , would ""trigger"" a state ban on abortion and make it a felony if Roe were overturned. A handful of states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota, already have trigger laws on the books.
Oklahoma has some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, such as mandatory counseling and a 72-hour waiting period. But the most conservative anti-abortion activists in the state want more immediate action. So they targeted Treat and other self-described pro-life Republicans with protests, billboards and fliers, accusing them of not being anti-abortion enough.
""I've been called every name in the book these past few weeks,"" Treat says. ""I've had my Christianity questioned. I've had a member of my own caucus hold a press conference and call me a hypocrite.""
In response, Treat abandoned the trigger bill.
Now he's trying something else — an amendment to the state constitution that would reinforce that nothing in Oklahoma law ""secures or protects"" the right to abortion. But that's still not anti-abortion enough for some.
""It's going to add on to that legacy that we have of death and just status quo pro-life policy that does nothing,"" says Republican state Sen. Justin Silk.
Not far enough in Georgia
National Georgia's 'Uneasy Truce' On Abortion Ends In Georgia, a heartbeat bill passed the legislature, but has paused at Gov. Brian Kemp's desk. Supporters of abortion rights don't want him to sign it , of course, but some anti-abortion activists aren't happy either.
""It really just does not go far enough in the protection of innocent human life,"" says Georgia Right to Life executive director Zemmie Fleck. Fleck argues that certain exceptions in his state's bill — for abortions after rape or incest if the woman makes a police report — make it weak.
Gov. Kemp has until May 12 to sign or veto the measure.
Cost as no object in Kentucky
The American Civil Liberties Union in Kentucky sued the day after a heartbeat bill was signed into law by Gov. Matt Bevin. But even during his annual speech to the Kentucky legislature in February, Bevin acknowledged his intent to challenge Roe v. Wade.
""Some of these will go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But at the end of the day, we will prevail because we stand on the side of right and we stand on the side of life,"" Bevin said.
Kentucky has become accustomed to defending abortion restrictions in court. Currently, one law that makes it a felony for a doctor to perform a common abortion in the second trimester has been suspended indefinitely.
It is unclear how much it costs Kentucky to defend abortion laws that are immediately challenged. In an emailed statement, Bevin administration spokesman Woody Maglinger writes that the state is using in-house lawyers, and hasn't hired outside counsel. He declines to provide a cost estimate on hours spent on these cases.
""It is impossible to place a price tag on human lives,"" Maglinger writes.

A Guide To Talk About 'Game Of Thrones' Even If You've Never Seen An Episode,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862539/a-guide-to-talk-about-game-of-thrones-even-if-you-ve-never-seen-an-episode?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with David Chen and Vanity Fair's Joanna Robinson, co-hosts of the podcast A Cast of Kings, about how to talk about Game of Thrones even if you've never watched an episode.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
All right. Bad news for those stragglers out there - if you have not started watching ""Game Of Thrones"" yet, there are literally not enough hours left to catch up between now and the final season premiere on Sunday. But not to worry - we are here to help you pretend you know what's going on. We'll catch you up faster than you can say, ""Game Of Thrones"" is a show about a bunch of noble families on a fictional medieval continent battling for control while hordes of ice zombies march towards civilization. So here you go - a TV cheat sheet. Spoilers, of course, lie ahead. And here to help are David Chen and Joanna Robinson. They co-host the podcast A Cast of Kings. Hey, guys.
JOANNA ROBINSON: Hi.
DAVID CHEN: Hello.
CHANG: All right. So what is the state of play as we head into Season 8?
CHEN: So there's many players. And they all want a chance at sitting on the Iron Throne, which is the literal seat of power. It's where, like...
ROBINSON: Wait, Dave. Are you trying to tell me that this is a literal game of thrones? Is that what you're saying?
CHEN: It is a literal - it's literally a game of thrones, which is the name of the show.
CHANG: How clever.
ROBINSON: OK. The way that I like to explain it is to break it down into teams. So first of all, you've got Team Army of the Dead - literal zombies. They are invading from way up north. There's Team Targaryen. They're the ones with the dragons and led by a very cute and scary blonde lady. They're headed north to try to stop the army of the dead and to join up with our third team, Team Stark. They're the ones with the magical wolves. And they're led by a very cute and broody guy with curly, dark hair. And the last team is Team Lannister - mostly just one queen left on this team. She has no magical pets, unless you count her zombie bodyguard. She's sending her troops up north but not to help the army of the living. She's out for herself.
CHANG: So I think for some people, like for me at first, ""Game Of Thrones"" was kind of a turnoff because of all the fantasy, weird, fictional, medieval stuff. What ideas do you think this show gets at that might be interesting to people who are just not into dragons?
ROBINSON: I think if you go into ""Game Of Thrones"" thinking that you understand who's going to win, what a hero is, the beautiful thing that this story does is it just blows all of that out of the water. You're rooting for someone. And all of a sudden, they vanish off the game board. Or you write someone off as evil. And then they have this great moral growth.
CHANG: Yeah.
ROBINSON: So the fact that it's morally murky and complex in a way that - I think people dismiss fantasy as being too simplistic.
CHANG: So we've covered some of the basics. But now I want to get to some next-level stuff because if I want to sound smart and, like, fake my way through caring about what's going to happen to the bazillion characters on this show, I need some good questions to just kind of throw around. Give me some.
CHEN: Well, I think the one that everyone has been talking about is who is going to be the person who ends up sitting on the iron throne? You've got to kind of choose a side. And asking other people which side they're on is a good way to get a conversation started at a party.
ROBINSON: Yeah, that's my favorite question. I think if you want to sound, like, really smart and hipster at a party, when someone says, who do you think is going to sit on the Iron Throne? - you roll up and say, like, does the Iron Throne even matter anymore, really, in the grand scheme of things?
CHANG: (Laughter) All right. I'll use that one.
ROBINSON: I think that's a (laughter) good answer.
CHEN: I would say another question that a lot of people have is, who is going to survive until the end of the show. There's people who have, like, death pools going on or brackets of who's going to, like, make it to the end of the show.
CHANG: That's sunny.
CHEN: The show is so adept at killing off characters. People say between 2,000 and 150,000 deaths.
CHANG: That's quite a discrepancy you've just cited.
ROBINSON: That's what happens when you have a battle episode every single season.
CHANG: Oh, good point.
ROBINSON: You get a lot of bodies, you know?
CHANG: So this show launched, like, a thousand memes, right. What are some catchphrases I should know?
ROBINSON: What's been actually really helpful for spreading the popularity of ""Game Of Thrones"" is the fact that in this show, each of the houses, each of the families have their own, like, personal mottos and house words. So winter is coming is sort of the most famous one. And that's the House Stark house words, you could say.
CHANG: So, like, use winter is coming in context.
ROBINSON: I would say winter is coming if, like, prepare for the worst. Something bad is coming. You know what I mean? So if someone is moving in next door and it's not who you want, you just go, winter is coming next door.
(LAUGHTER)
CHANG: All right. So if I'm trying to decide, is it even worth bingeing at this point, how would you sell me on going for it?
ROBINSON: Maybe wait until it's all over.
CHANG: (Laughter).
ROBINSON: Well, you might want to find out if the ending feels worth it. I think when ""Lost"" ended and so many people were burned out on that ending, they were like, well, I'm just never going to catch up with this show.
CHANG: Such a great example.
ROBINSON: Thanks for saving me that time, you know? So...
CHEN: I have a pitch to make you, Ailsa.
CHANG: Uh-huh.
CHEN: There is no equal to this show in terms of popular culture right now. It's a show that everyone is talking about the day after it airs. There's something invigorating and fun about participating in a work of popular culture with millions of other people at the same time. And this show is one of the only ones that gives you that. And it might be one of the last ones that give you that.
CHANG: David Chen and Joanna Robinson are co-hosts of the podcast A Cast of Kings. Joanna also has two other ""Game Of Thrones"" podcasts - wow - and writes for Vanity Fair. Thank you to both of you.
ROBINSON: Thanks so much for having us.
CHEN: Thank you so much.

Bomb Cyclone Hits Central U.S. For 2nd Time In A Month,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862532/bomb-cyclone-hits-central-u-s-for-2nd-time-in-a-month?station=KXJZ_FM,"The central part of the country had heavy snow and strong winds Thursday. That storm system is now moving to the Great Lakes area. Power has been knocked out for tens of thousands of people.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
If you live in the central part of this country, you don't need us to tell you about the weather you're having. Starting in the Southwest and then spreading to the Great Lakes, wind and snow have been your daily companions, and many of you have lost power.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
This is the second bomb cyclone to hit the region in a month. In weather speak, the low strengthened as the system moved east.
DAVID ROTH: Which actually was the cause of a lot of the mischief.
SHAPIRO: David Roth is with the National Weather Service. He says although the system was not as bad as the March storm, the sudden drop in air pressure was severe.
ROTH: They recorded wind gusts across West Texas as high as 78 miles an hour. Last I heard, there were over 20 wildfires that have been caused by the system.
CHANG: KLBK photojournalist Larry Rodriguez in Lubbock, Texas, was driving around the city on assignment Wednesday when he pulled over to take a video of the dust storm.
LARRY RODRIGUEZ: Before the dust started kicking up, it was a very sunny day here. And then all of a sudden, this red-orange dust gets blown up into the sky. And you can still see the sun, but it's just orange. I've never been to Mars, but I would imagine that's what it would be like.
CHANG: Maybe some of that dirt showed up in a tweeted photo posted by Jennifer Everly in Minnesota. It shows the words Texas Dust written in dirty snow on the hood of a car.
SHAPIRO: In another part of Minnesota, the state patrol took a video of one of their troopers fighting the wind on an ice-covered road in the town of Lakefield. He slides sideways and finally succumbs falling to the ground.
CHANG: To the east, snowfall topped previous records in parts of Wisconsin.
HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE: April always feels a little late for snow.
SHAPIRO: Hope Kerwan is a public radio reporter in southwestern Wisconsin. She pulled her car over in the town of Westby to talk to us. She says it wasn't just snow.
KIRWAN: On my commute in yesterday, there was thunder snow, where it's snowing but there's thunder and lightning. There were a lot of power outages because of the winds knocking over poles. I know a lot of communities around the La Crosse area were affected by that.
CHANG: All told, it was bad enough. But the second bomb cyclone could have been worse. For those folks along the Missouri River who got flooded after the last bomb cyclone, there's good news. The Weather Service says this storm is not expected to cause further flooding because the ground isn't frozen anymore.

PBS' 6-Episode 'Les Misérables' Miniseries Focuses On The Story Instead Of Music,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862525/pbs-6-episode-les-mis-rables-miniseries-focuses-on-the-story-instead-of-music?station=KXJZ_FM,"PBS premieres a new version of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, starring Dominic West of The Wire and The Affair. This version has no music and tries to be closer to the source material.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Many people were introduced to the classic ""Les Miserables"" through the Tony Award-winning musical version.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, ""LES MISERABLES"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, singing) Look down. Look down. Don't look them in the eye.
CHANG: Well, a new six-episode miniseries of ""Les Mis"" debuts Sunday. And there's no music. PBS's ""Masterpiece"" instead focuses on the story. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says he was surprised at how little he missed the music.
ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: This could sound like heresy to fans of the classic musical, but I love ""Les Miserables"" without the songs. At least, I love writer Andrew Davies and director Tom Shankland's music-less version of this story, which recreates the broad sweep of Victor Hugo's classic 1862 French novel with an epic, emotional treatment.
The show's power comes courtesy of its two leads - Dominic West, who plays convict-turned-hero Jean Valjean and David Oyelowo, who is Javert, the policeman who relentlessly hunts him down. Their first scenes together are electric, as Javert assures Valjean he's a convict because it's in his nature.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LES MISERABLES"")
DAVID OYELOWO: (As Javert) I was born in prison. My parents were criminals. Men like us have only two choices - to prey on society or to guard it. You chose the former. I chose the latter.
DOMINIC WEST: (As Jean Valjean) Nineteen years for a loaf of bread.
OYELOWO: (As Javert) You've got 12 months left to serve. My guess, you'll be back in here before another year has gone by.
DEGGANS: It's interesting to see a black man play the ultimate cop given today's debates about over-policing people of color. But the central issue in ""Les Miserables"" centers on character. Are people inherently bad or do they simply make bad choices in desperate circumstances?
The story also suggests that love is the best response to tough times. West and the always excellent Derek Jacobi bring this point home while recreating a classic scene from the novel. A fresh out of prison Valjean is given a place to sleep by a Bishop played by Jacobi. The bishop challenges Valjean to love his fellow man despite his hard life.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LES MISERABLES"")
WEST: (As Jean Valjean) How can I love my fellow man when he treats me worse than a dog? It's easy for you. You can afford to be kind and gentle.
DEREK JACOBI: (As Bishop Myriel) Absolutely right. It is easy for me. But consider this - even if the world has done you a great injustice, does it really serve you to have a heart full of bitterness and hatred?
DEGGANS: West is the lynchpin of this miniseries. As Valjean progresses from hardened ex-convict to an upstanding businessman with a fake identity, the actor remains compelling and believable. With a glance, West can reveal Valjean as a flawed man reaching towards redemption but often undone by impulsive decisions and the guilt of his past misdeeds.
Lily Collins is another delight as Fantine, a poor woman whose life is ruined by trusting the wrong people. When she falls in love with a wealthy young aristocrat who is romancing her, a friend warns her of that folly.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""LES MISERABLES"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) You have to remember, they're not serious, these types. They're just amusing themselves. The ground we walk on is not solid ground, Fantine. We could fall through any time. We could be down in the gutter and no one would care. Plenty more where we come from.
LILY COLLINS: (As Fantine Thibault) But why should it always be like that?
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Because it is.
DEGGANS: Fantine learns the hard way how right her friend is. That she pays such a heavy price when Valjean arguably makes worse mistakes and survives feels like a nod to the persistent inequality between the sexes. A co-production with the BBC, PBS's miniseries vividly recreates the crushing poverty and immense gaps between the lives of the wealthy and the poor in post-Napoleonic France.
This is why a new version of ""Les Miserables"" makes sense right now, as America and the world is already wrestling with tough questions centered on poverty, policing, wealth gaps and social justice. I'm Eric Deggans.

What Pope Benedict's Letter On The Sex Abuse Scandal Means For Catholics,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862518/what-pope-benedicts-letter-on-the-sex-abuse-scandal-means-for-catholics?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Natalia Imperatori-Lee, associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College, about Pope Benedict's letter about sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
It has been six years since Pope Benedict XVI became pope emeritus. Having two living men who lay claim to the title Pope, one retired and one active, has not happened in centuries. Nevertheless, that is the current state of play in the Roman Catholic Church, and there have been moments when the retired pope has stepped on the message of the current pope. Just this week, Benedict released a letter weighing in on the church's massive sex abuse scandal.
And to talk more about that letter and what it means for Catholics, we're joined now by Natalia Imperatori-Lee. She is associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College. Welcome.
NATALIA IMPERATORI-LEE: Thank you very much for having me.
CHANG: So Benedict's letter is seen as controversial because of where he places blame for the church's sex abuse scandals. Can you tell us a little more about exactly what Benedict wrote?
IMPERATORI-LEE: So Pope Benedict wrote a letter that reflects kind of his ideas about what caused the scandal and what threatens the church, which is basically the sexual revolution then uprisings of the 1960s, a sort of libertarianism when it comes to morals and the departure of God from the public square.
CHANG: I mean, we should point out that, you know, it's highly unusual that he's even speaking up. He had originally said he would remain, ""hidden to the world"" - that's a direct quote. But that no longer seems to be the case. Do we know why he's jumping into the fray now?
IMPERATORI-LEE: No. I think it's most confusing why he would jump into the fray now, particularly with this intervention which, by referring to the sexual revolution or the 1960s, is really stuff that he had talked about while he was the pope. And so it's unclear why he or the people around him felt the need to weigh in once again with the sort of causes of the crisis that we already knew he believed.
CHANG: Right. I mean, how does Pope Benedict's letter conflict with what Pope Francis has said about the clergy abuse crisis?
IMPERATORI-LEE: Well, I think the main problem is that it doesn't mention victims at all. The hallmark of Francis' approach to the sexual abuse crisis has been that he has centered victims' voices. If you look at Benedict's letter, the victim in his letter is the church. And that's a real slap in the face to people who have survived sexual abuse.
CHANG: So what are the implications of this for Catholics? I mean, having two popes - one who is officially in power, one who is not - who are now saying different things about such a critical issue for the church?
IMPERATORI-LEE: Yeah. I don't want to overstate it. I don't think that anybody thinks that Benedict is still the pope. But I do worry that it flirts with a kind of divisiveness that is unhelpful. We all know that not everybody is supportive of Pope Francis centering the voice of victims or Pope Francis' approach to how he runs the church with openness. And so I worry that it encourages people who criticize Pope Francis into looking backward to the pope emeritus as their pontiff, or their shepherd or something like that, which is really dangerous to the unity of the church.
CHANG: Right. And where does that leave Vatican leadership? I mean, is it possible that this conflict between Benedict and Francis could cause a schism among the highest levels in the Vatican?
IMPERATORI-LEE: I don't think that it will. I think that the resistance to Pope Francis is small, even if sometimes it gets loud. I think that it's not even a conflict, probably, between the two men. I think that Francis holds Benedict in high esteem and values his opinion. It's just when that opinion spills out into the public that you have these competing visions, and then forcing Catholics to maybe choose a side is not exactly where we want the church to be.
CHANG: Natalia Imperatori-Lee. She's an associate professor of religious studies at Manhattan College. Thank you very much for joining us today.
IMPERATORI-LEE: Thank you so much.

Lobbyists See The Indictment Of Powerful Lawyer Gregory Craig As A Warning,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862511/lobbyists-see-the-indictment-of-powerful-lawyer-gregory-craig-as-a-warning?station=KXJZ_FM,"The indictment of lawyer and lobbyist Gregory Craig, a former Obama White House counsel, is sending a shockwave through the ranks of those who represent foreign entities.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
In Washington, lobbyists are reading this week's indictment of a powerful lawyer named Gregory Craig as a warning. Craig did some work for lobbyist Paul Manafort, President Trump's onetime campaign chairman who now faces a long prison sentence. NPR's Peter Overby reports.
PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Gregory Craig was the top lawyer in President Barack Obama's White House. Before that, he was on the defense team for President Bill Clinton's impeachment. Right now Craig is an object lesson for lobbyists who deal with or should deal with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It's commonly called FARA.
KATE BELINSKI: There really has been a sea change in how people are approaching FARA registration and really thinking and taking seriously whether they do need to register.
OVERBY: Kate Belinski is a lawyer who helps lobbyists navigate FARA's requirements. She said that since Craig's case became public a few weeks ago, she's been getting a lot of calls about whether and how to register.
BELINSKI: I wasn't getting those calls on a regular basis before.
OVERBY: FARA enforcement is up to the Justice Department. Before 2017, enforcement was extremely light. Then special counsel Robert Mueller's task force arrested Manafort, and Belinski said Congress now pays much closer attention.
BELINSKI: DOJ is at a point right now where they can't be in a position where they're not enforcing.
OVERBY: Toby Moffett, a longtime FARA registrant and former congressman, said that since Manafort's arrest...
TOBY MOFFETT: You hear a lot more people talk about it and speak with some fear about violating the statute possibly.
OVERBY: Moffett noted the fine already paid by Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps - $4.6 million.
MOFFETT: The Skadden experience has probably, to put it mildly, gotten the attention of other firms, especially law firms which are very reputation-conscious.
OVERBY: Senate Judiciary Chair Charles Grassley wants to change the lobbying laws. He would make lobbyists register under FARA if their clients are the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies. Those subsidiaries currently come under the law for domestic lobbying, where disclosure is far less strict. Paul Miller is president of the Institute for Lobbying and Ethics, a lobbyist organization. He said FARA's stronger disclosure is good. But FARA has filing fees.
PAUL MILLER: But for small firms who do it, you know, it's just over $600 a year for the filing. And then the paperwork is a headache.
OVERBY: That would still leave open some big loopholes. People avoid both lobbying laws by calling themselves strategic advisers.
MILLER: It's not new. I mean, these things seem to be happening, and that's why we keep talking about, you know, the shadow lobbying.
OVERBY: There's also the risk of bad publicity. Tom Susman is a former lobbyist now with the American Bar Association.
TOM SUSMAN: Nobody wants to be part of the NPR story about having violated one of the federal laws when your job depends on your reputation and your credibility.
OVERBY: But those laws have proved tough to change. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington.

Former WikiLeaks Employee Discusses Julian Assange's Arrest,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862504/former-wikileaks-employee-discusses-julian-assanges-arrest?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with James Ball, a former Wikileaks employee, about the recent arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The arrest of Julian Assange has renewed the debate, is the co-founder of WikiLeaks a journalist or a criminal? Yesterday on the program, we heard from one of his critics, former defense secretary and former CIA Director Leon Panetta.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LEON PANETTA: If we care about classified information, if we care about what our intelligence people are doing, then I think it's important that we decide whether or not somebody has the right on his own to not only gather that kind of information but release it.
SHAPIRO: Now we're joined by someone who used to work with Julian Assange. James Ball is a journalist and former WikiLeaks employee speaking with us from a street corner in London. Hi there.
JAMES BALL: Hi there.
SHAPIRO: You argue that Assange is unlikable, that he is a difficult person but that it's still important to defend him. Why?
BALL: I should be specific on this. I think it's important to defend him against the U.S. extradition on the charge that he's currently facing. I think he deliberately breached due process in the U.K., and he is right to be punished for breach of bail there. What I don't think we should do it just because we don't like Julian Assange as a person or we don't like his journalistic ethics or maybe we don't even think he's a journalist - we shouldn't let that blind us to what looks at the moment like a politically motivated and dangerous prosecution.
SHAPIRO: He has described himself as a journalist. You're saying we may disapprove of his journalistic ethics, but we should still evaluate his actions on that basis. His critics will say that as opposed to exercising any kind of editorial judgment, he was just a tool for intelligence agencies, including those of Russia.
BALL: I think if someone has evidence that Assange was a knowing tool of the Russian state, then that's something that he should face prosecution for. But that is not the charge on the table. The charge on the table relates to material leaked by Chelsea Manning. She was an ideologically motivated whistleblower. The charge around Assange is that he offered some help in cracking a password that might have made it easier for her to hide her actions. There's actually no evidence that was even successful.
And so it doesn't change the fact that we're dealing with a public interest whistleblower. And the material that was published was judged to be in the public interest by The New York Times, by The Guardian, by Le Monde, by Der Spiegel and more.
SHAPIRO: If I as a journalist with NPR helped somebody who works for the Defense Department or the CIA or the NSA hack into a secure server or access classified documents, I would likely be prosecuted for that independent of what I might do as a journalist. Are you saying that shouldn't be the case?
BALL: I think we have to look at the proportionality of the prosecution. The allegation is that Assange sort of offered to help crack a password unsuccessfully that would have helped someone who was already leaking material not be discovered. That's the kind of mistake I could see someone not trained in journalism sort of doing in a close source relationship. I think 10 years after the fact, to try and pursue that for prosecution - you know, you don't have to be a cynic to see it as a backdoor way of trying to punish Assange for the 2010 disclosures while hiving off journalistic support because we can all call it hacking and say it's different to what we do.
SHAPIRO: It's clear that while you believe that prosecutors are making the wrong decision here, that doesn't make you a fan of Assange personally. What made you decide to go work for him and for WikiLeaks at a time when he had basically driven away everybody else who had worked with him prior to that?
BALL: I mean, I was a young guy. I was 24. Assange was quite inspiring to me. And it takes time, especially when you're at that age, to see the reality of someone versus the image or the icon. And I really believed in the mission of what WikiLeaks was trying to do - you know, responsible disclosure, holding power to account. And then of course when I saw the reality, I came to a much more nuanced fear of Julian, to say the least.
SHAPIRO: James Ball is a journalist in London who used to work for WikiLeaks. Thanks so much for speaking with us today.
BALL: Thanks very much - good to speak to you.

"In Her Debut Novel 'Miracle Creek,' Angie Kim Taps Into Themes She Knows Well",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862497/in-her-debut-novel-miracle-creek-angie-kim-taps-into-themes-she-knows-well?station=KXJZ_FM,"Angie Kim's debut novel, Miracle Creek, is a courtroom thriller that tackles heavy themes like immigration, parenting and autism.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The new novel ""Miracle Creek"" is a courtroom thriller. It's a world that author Angie Kim knows well. She worked as a trial lawyer at a big firm. And this book taps into other themes she's familiar with, too. Angie Kim's family came to the U.S. from South Korea when she was a child, just like the central characters in the book. And the story also centers on a group of mothers whose kids have autism. Kim has three children who've each dealt with medical issues and the batteries of tests and treatments that go along with them.
ANGIE KIM: Between all of that, I felt like these are the things that I think were in me that needed to get out because I felt the need when I was in those situations to feel like other people understood.
SHAPIRO: This is Angie Kim's first novel, And it begins with a tragedy. She writes, misfortune doesn't get sprinkled out in fair proportions. Bad things get hurled at you in clumps and batches - unmanageable and messy. ""Miracle Creek"" creates a frame for some of those messy threads in Angie Kim's own life, including a childhood where her parents worked from 6 a.m. to midnight every day.
KIM: I came from this environment in Korea where we were very poor. We had no running water. We had no indoor plumbing. And the three of us - my parents and me - we lived in one room. So we were very poor. And yet, at the same time, I had them with me always.
So to go from that environment to an environment where we were in this luxurious house with multiple indoor bathrooms, which was, like, magical to me - and color TVs, but at the same time losing my parents in the process for several years, it was really painful. And I think throughout my life, I felt this sort of rollercoaster between feeling so lucky to have the chance to come to America from...
SHAPIRO: And attend Harvard Law School and have high-paying jobs, right. You are the...
KIM: Exactly.
SHAPIRO: ...American dream success story.
KIM: Exactly. And how sometimes objectively, your life can look good or bad, so my - objectively, my life in Korea was, you know, poverty ridden and things like that. But then in the nooks and crannies, there can be moments of pure joy even when you are in that, you know, poverty stricken home.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. There is a passage where you write about one painful aspect of the immigrant experience. Will you read this? This is from page 163, about halfway through the book.
KIM: (Read) He'd expected this to happen eventually, had seen how children and parents switch places as the parents age - their minds and bodies reverting to childhood, then infancy, then non-being. But not for many years, and certainly not yet, when Mary still had a foot in childhood. In Korea, he had been the teacher. But after his move when he visited Mary's school, her principal had said welcome. Tell me; how are you liking Baltimore? Pak (ph) smiled, nodded and was deciding how to answer. Perhaps the smile-nod had been enough. When Mary said, he loves it here, running the store right by Inner Harbor, right, Dad? The rest of the meeting, Mary continued speaking for him, answering questions directed his way like a mother with her 2-year-old son.
SHAPIRO: That feels very real and very painful.
KIM: It really, really was. We all intellectually understand it's not their first language. So we understand that it doesn't mean that they're not smart for not speaking it or understanding it. And yet, somehow, language is so important in our society that it's become that way.
And I think that's the other reason why I was so drawn to autism as well because I think especially for the children on the autism spectrum who are non-verbal, it makes me think back to that time when I myself felt so frustrated knowing that I had thoughts within me and saying hey, I'm here, I have opinions, I have thoughts...
SHAPIRO: Yeah.
KIM: ...But not being able to articulate that and then being able to see in other people's eyes that they think less of me because I can't speak in that language.
SHAPIRO: The book includes this community of mothers whose children have autism and have varying degrees of severity. And it's this interesting dynamic where on one level, they're kind of competitive and judgmental and jealous. And on another level, they're sort of the only people who can understand what one another is going through.
KIM: Definitely.
SHAPIRO: Tell me about this community that you built within the framework of the book.
KIM: So I became aware of this community going through all of these, you know, speech therapies and things like that as well as the hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is something that I highlight in the book as well.
SHAPIRO: This is an alternative form of therapy that is thought - in the book at least - to perhaps help with things ranging from impotence to autism.
KIM: Exactly. And one thing that I experienced myself even though I'm not in the autism community per say, but having been in that world of parents with children with chronic illnesses, when the illness takes over your life - and I think that one thing that it does that's very unexpected for me anyway is that it's very isolating because you find that you don't have as much that you want to talk to your old friends about...
SHAPIRO: Right.
KIM: ...When they have a foot in so-called normalcy because, you know, there's both envy at play and also just a feeling of they're not going to understand what's important in my life on a day-to-day basis. So I think this community becomes very important from that perspective.
But, of course, the stakes in this world are very high because it's not just a matter of oh, is your kid going to get into this college or that, it's much more fundamental than that. What is going to happen to my child when I die?
You know, so it's very heightened emotions from that perspective. And that's one of the reasons why I decided to highlight that conflict but also closeness and intimacy.
SHAPIRO: There's one moment that I want to ask you about when a character who is one of these mothers of children with autism says - clearly feeling great shame in saying this - she says I wish my child was dead. And another woman tells her we all have our moments. But they're just moments. And they pass.
So if a tiny part of us has these thoughts a tiny part of the time, thoughts we shut out as soon as they creep in, is that so bad? Isn't that just human? People don't often hear that perspective. Why did you want to include it?
KIM: I wanted to include it because I think there is this myth of a Good Mother. And I say Good Mother, and in my head, I'm seeing Good Mother capitalized, you know.
SHAPIRO: Capital G, capital M.
KIM: Yes, exactly. And I think that when you are in this situation day in and day out, there are thoughts that creep in that are shameful. And I think that because of our society's enormous pressure on mothers to be perfect and to be self-sacrificing, that those thoughts make the mothers feel so much shame.
And one thing that I've been hearing from a lot of early readers is that when they're in this situation, they have had similar thoughts that are fleeting. And they would never say it out loud even to their closest friends or to their family members or to their spouses. But hearing a character - even though it's a fictional character in a book - say that and think that and to be able to witness that made them feel like they weren't monsters themselves.
SHAPIRO: Angie Kim, thanks so much for talking with us. And congratulations on your debut novel.
KIM: Thank you so much, Ari. It was a pleasure.
SHAPIRO: Her book is called ""Miracle Creek.""

Former Diplomats Reflect On Impact Of WikiLeaks Release Of Diplomatic Cables In 2010,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862490/former-diplomats-reflect-on-impact-of-wikileaks-release-of-diplomatic-cables-in-?station=KXJZ_FM,"Nearly a decade after WikiLeaks published thousands of diplomatic cables, one former ambassador describes it as ""the toxic gift that keeps on giving."" Diplomats spent years rebuilding trust with other governments.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The State Department was forced into damage control when WikiLeaks published thousands of diplomatic cables back in 2010. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it an attack on U.S. foreign policy and international alliances. Now that Julian Assange is facing charges related to that leak, we wondered whether it left a lasting impact on U.S. diplomacy. Here's NPR's Michele Kelemen.
MICHELE KELEMEN, HOST:
Retired diplomat Barbara Leaf was in Rome reading The New York Times on an unclassified computer on the day in 2010 when the WikiLeaks cables hit the news. She was shocked to see what's called a NODIS, or no distribution cable, which are normally very restrictive.
BARBARA LEAF: Then I was like, oh, my God. You know? I got to turn this thing off, you know? It was - but beyond the comic moment which, literally, I thought, did I just give myself a security violation by looking at a NODIS cable on an un-class terminal, it wreaked havoc. These cables wreaked havoc.
KELEMEN: That was especially true at her next assignment, in Iraq, where some embassy contacts had been harassed and threatened because they were named in diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks. She says she and her colleagues became far more judicious in what they wrote in those official reports.
LEAF: Some people, I would not name. Yes. Absolutely. I would not put names in cables because of that. Government officials are generally different. But when you're talking to some, you know, average citizen, or somebody who is willing to talk candidly about policies or activities of their government that they know, you know, it's - you know, it's a third-rail topic, or what have you, I didn't put their names in cables forever after.
KELEMEN: Diplomats write these cables to give Washington policymakers a sense of what's happening in the country where they serve. They used to be accessible even to military officers in the field until Chelsea Manning helped WikiLeaks gain access to them. Now access is even more limited. And that's a problem, says Mary Thompson-Jones, another former career diplomat who teaches at the U.S. Naval War College.
MARY THOMPSON-JONES: Not enough people read the cables. That was true then and that's true now. The only person that you're guaranteed is going to read your cable is the poor desk officer who's handling everything that has to do with the country to which you've been assigned.
KELEMEN: She downplays the lasting impact of WikiLeaks on the State Department, saying Julian Assange's moment has come and gone.
THOMPSON-JONES: Technology has moved at lightning speed since then. Every embassy has Facebook, it has social media. Ambassadors get out, and they're tweeting about things. So we're in a different era already than we were nine years ago.
KELEMEN: Looking back, some diplomats joke that there was an upside to the scandal. The world got to see what diplomats do and find out that some are pretty colorful writers. The downside was that government officials who didn't like how they were described gave U.S. diplomats the cold shoulder and didn't let them take notes in meetings. That lasted for a while, says Barbara Leaf, who was the ambassador to the United Arab Emirates until she retired last year.
LEAF: There was an exquisite agony that these governments, friendly governments, felt in talking to us for a very long time. I got out to UAE four years after this, and they were still gun shy about all of this. So, you know, it is the toxic gift that keeps on giving.
KELEMEN: The State Department says it stands by previous assessments that the WikiLeaks disclosures were harmful and put lives and careers at risk. A former spokesman says the impact was serious but admittedly hard to quantify. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, the State Department.

Some Experts Remain Skeptical As Boeing And FAA Work To Assure 737 Max Jet Is Safe,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862466/some-experts-remain-skeptical-as-boeing-and-faa-work-to-assure-737-max-jet-is-sa?station=KXJZ_FM,"As Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration work to certify critical updates to the 737 Max jet following two deadly crashes, the FAA is under renewed criticism for saying the aircraft was safe.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Officials with the Federal Aviation Administration spent hours today speaking with pilots and executives at Southwest, United and American Airlines. They are the three U.S. airlines that fly the Boeing 737 Max. Questions about the FAA's role in certifying the plane have grown in the weeks since the second fatal crash of a 737 Max. The jet is still grounded. And now, the FAA has to reassure airlines and regulators in other countries that whenever it says the 737 Max is safe to fly again, that is, in fact, accurate. NPR's Russell Lewis reports.
RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: This week on Capitol Hill, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao continued her defense of the FAA amid questions about why it approved the Boeing 737 Max.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ELAINE CHAO: The department's goal is to ensure public trust in aviation safety and preserve the preeminence of the United States as the gold standard in aviation safety.
LEWIS: The U.S. is enjoying its safest period of air travel ever - one single fatality on a major U.S. commercial airline in the past decade. But following the crashes of 737 Max's in Indonesia and Ethiopia, questions are swirling whether the FAA has taken a hit as the world's premier aviation regulator.
SHEM MALMQUIST: So the answer is yes, the FAA has lost some of that credibility.
LEWIS: Shem Malmquist has been involved in aviation and aviation safety since the 1970s. He teaches advanced aircraft operations at Florida Institute of Technology and also currently flies the Boeing 777. He says people in the industry had assumed the FAA was doing everything it could to ensure safety. So was John Strickland, a longtime aviation consultant based in England.
JOHN STRICKLAND: Of course, at the end of the day, what matters is safety. There can only be one objective - that it delivers a safe aircraft which airlines can be confident in and that we, the traveling public, can be confident in.
LEWIS: That's one reason why aviation regulators in Canada, Europe and elsewhere say they plan to double-check the 737 Max software fixes once they're approved by the FAA. Strickland says that's surprising, and before these accidents, almost unheard of.
For decades, the FAA relied on manufacturers like Boeing to help in the review and certification of new jets. These planes are increasingly complex, with millions of lines of computer code understood best by the people who designed them. When the 737 Max was approved, it was one of the first jets signed off under new rules that gave Boeing even more authority in the approval process.
The FAA has told Congress for the agency to take over all certifications, it would need an additional 10,000 employees at $1.8 billion. Jim Higgins chairs the aviation department at the University of North Dakota. He says it's not as easy as just throwing more money at the problem.
JIM HIGGINS: Because it takes many years to train people to become aircraft design engineers for these types of aircraft and then many more to - for them to get the experience to be kind of in an oversight role.
LEWIS: The extra attention being shined on Boeing and the FAA is important, says Shem Malmquist, the Florida Tech professor and pilot. He says now that regulators in other countries are planning to scrutinize the 737 Max fixes, there's value in having men and women from varying backgrounds studying the updates.
MALMQUIST: I think there's something to be said by having different cultures from around the world looking at these things a lot closer. They may capture something just based on their cultural perspective that we didn't consider.
LEWIS: The FAA, for its part, says it welcomes the added scrutiny. Here's acting administrator Daniel Elwell.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DANIEL ELWELL: As recent events have reminded us, aviation safety has no borders or boundaries.
LEWIS: But don't expect a potential fix anytime soon. The updates to the Boeing 737 Max aren't expected for weeks and possibly months. Russell Lewis, NPR News.

Children's Book Author Beverly Cleary Celebrates 103rd Birthday,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862459/childrens-book-author-beverly-cleary-celebrates-103rd-birthday?station=KXJZ_FM,"On children's book author Beverly Cleary's 103rd birthday, the story of how she became a writer.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
We want to take a moment now to wish happy birthday to a woman many of us grew up on. Children's book author Beverly Cleary turns 103 today, which gives us an excuse to celebrate her.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Yes. Ramona Quimby, Beezus, ""The Mouse And The Motorcycle"" - vroom-vroom.
SHAPIRO: Cleary's books have sold more than 90 million copies. As she told Oregon Public Broadcasting, she wasn't always a big reader.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
BEVERLY CLEARY: Oh, I remember a moment of terror in the first grade when we were in a reading circle. And I'd figured ahead what word I was going to have to read. And it was city. And I knew it wasn't pronounced kitty, but I couldn't remember.
CHANG: About two years later, she was browsing through a book when something happened.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
CLEARY: I was really just looking at the pictures and discovered I was reading it and enjoying what I read. It was quite a revelation.
CHANG: She started reading more and writing stories, too. The school librarian suggested she become an author.
SHAPIRO: She grew up, went to college and became a children's librarian in Yakima, Wash. She learned to write for children there, standing up in front of big groups and telling them stories.
CHANG: A few years later, she was ready to write books of her own.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""DISCOVERING BEVERLY CLEARY"")
CLEARY: And I waited and waited, and no ideas came. And I thought about the little boy in the Yakima Public Library who (laughter) faced me rather ferociously once and said, where are the books about kids like us? And it changed my whole attitude.
CHANG: And the rest is history.
SHAPIRO: Thanks to Oregon Public Broadcasting and their documentary ""Discovering Beverly Cleary.""
CHANG: In honor of Cleary, April 12 is Drop Everything and Read day. So if you want to celebrate Beverly Cleary's 103 years, find some time on this Friday and read a book.

Power In The White House Is Growing With Acting Agency And Cabinet Department Heads,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862452/power-in-the-white-house-is-growing-with-acting-agency-and-cabinet-department-he?station=KXJZ_FM,"With so many acting cabinet secretaries who do not need Senate confirmation many Republican Senators are concerned the Trump administration is weakening their advice and consent Constitutional role.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The Senate's vote this week to confirm former oil lobbyist David Bernhardt for interior secretary means there's one less temp in President Trump's cabinet. It brings the number of acting heads of agencies and Cabinet departments from 13 to 12. More than any other president, Trump has used short-term appointments to keep the government running. NPR's Kelsey Snell reports that all that churn means the power in the White House is growing as the checks and balances of the Senate start to vanish.
KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: The Constitution is pretty clear about how the top jobs in federal government are supposed to be filled. It's right there in Article II, Section 2. The president shall nominate, and the Senate shall give advice and consent. Senator Lamar Alexander says it's a critical job with real consequences.
LAMAR ALEXANDER: But when it breaks down, we actually give the president more power because he can appoint all these acting people and ignore the United States Senate, which is just the reverse of what the founders intended.
SNELL: But the Tennessee Republican says that's not what's happening right now. Acting heads are running departments like Homeland Security and Defense and agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. And President Trump told CBS earlier this year that all that instability is by design.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I like acting because I can move so quickly. It gives me more flexibility.
SNELL: Trump may like it, but that's not what the Constitution intended.
ALEXANDER: Because our founders didn't want a king - so they said, we're not going to let the president have all the power.
SNELL: Unease over the instability within the Trump administration has spread in recent months as the number of vacancies and acting heads expanded. There's almost universal agreement among senators that there is a real risk in letting the standards slip too far, but there's not a lot of agreement about who's to blame or how to stop it. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy points to Democrats.
JOHN KENNEDY: I believe that at least part of the White House's thinking is that we could send over Alexander Hamilton, and the Democrats would object.
SNELL: He says Trump was forced to get creative. In many cases, the law gives presidents some latitude to use temps to fill in while a permanent replacement is confirmed. And Kennedy says it's only logical for the White House to use that wiggle room to get around some political roadblocks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says it's not just that. The Senate is doing its best to keep up with other nominees, including his pledge to fill a sea of federal court vacancies with Trump's conservative appointees.
MITCH MCCONNELL: I've got my hands full just trying to clean up the executive calendar we already have.
SNELL: McConnell downplayed the loss of power that happens when the Senate no longer has a responsibility to publicly vet and approve a nominee. He says when Trump finds a permanent agency head, the Senate will do its job.
MCCONNELL: I don't have any advice to give to the president about nominations, but I got - we got plenty of them to work on already. And if he sends up a nominee for an important position, like Cabinet post, it'll go to the front of the line. And we'll process it as early as we can.
SNELL: Florida Republican Marco Rubio has a different view. He has watched the agencies change in recent years. He says the partisan fights over nominees have been damaging to the entire process, but the lack of permanent bosses is causing serious problems.
MARCO RUBIO: I didn't used to believe that, but I've seen that when you're in an acting role, it's very different than when you're confirmed by the Senate, just in terms of the respect you command and even your control over the agency and the individuals underneath you.
SNELL: Texas Senator John Cornyn agrees with Rubio. Agency heads should be publicly vetted. They should have to be approved, and they should be there permanently.
JOHN CORNYN: It's not ideal, but it is certainly within the law.
SNELL: For all of their frustration, there's not much senators can do to exercise their constitutional power until Trump gives them permanent nominees to vote on. Kelsey Snell, NPR News, the Capitol.

"Week In Politics: Trump's Border Strategy, AG Barr's Testimony And Netanyahu's Win",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712862445/week-in-politics-trumps-border-strategy-ag-barr-s-testimony-and-netanyahu-s-win?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times, about the Trump administration's border strategy, Attorney General Barr's testimony and Benjamin Netanyahu's victory in Israel.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
President Trump has promised a tougher approach to immigration. And sure enough, in a tweet today, he said he's giving strong consideration to, quote, ""placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only."" Here's what the president said at the White House today.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They want more people in their sanctuary cities, well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply, and let's see if they're so happy. They say, we have open arms. They're always saying they have open arms. Let's see if they have open arms.
CHANG: The administration has so far offered no details on what this would look like in practice, so lots of questions. And we're going to talk through them and more now with our Friday regulars E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times. Nice to see you guys.
E J DIONNE, BYLINE: Great to be with you.
DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE: Great to see you.
CHANG: All right. So President Trump is threatening to release migrants who've been detained into these so-called sanctuary cities. These are cities where local law enforcement has decided to limit cooperation with federal immigration officials like LA, Chicago, Denver. And in this tweet I read, the president said he's doing this because, quote, ""Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws.""
David, do you think this tweet is actually spelling out policy or does it feel more just like a political provocation?
BROOKS: Well, first, it's morally illiterate. These are human beings. We don't treat them as a sort of a subtweet of a prank. But it's of a piece with the Trump policy, which is not really a policy but just a posture of toughness. It's just showbiz. It's sort of performance art to make his base feel good.
And any mayor running this system would create a system. He would expand the detention centers. He'd get more judges to speed the back flow. We'd have a system where you could vet kids in their home countries so they don't have to walk all the way up here. You do a number of concrete things that any normal administration could do. But we don't do that because we just have a posture. We don't have a system. And as a result, we have chaos at the border.
CHANG: E.J., do you agree?
DIONNE: Yeah. Well, first of all, nothing should surprise us anymore about Trump. But the notion that he would use human beings, as David said, purely as political pawns, as what he sees as political punishment for those who disagree with him - I mean, what comes next, he audits - he urges audits of all income taxes of the people who want him to make his taxes public? I mean, there's just something deeply outrageous about this. And we've lost our capacity for outrage.
I think what you are seeing is the difficulty of reaching any agreement on immigration, which is always hard, even when people have goodwill. They - Bush - President Bush, the second one, tried to get immigration reform through. His party foiled him. There was a bill that went through the Senate under Obama. It was foiled. Now you have no goodwill at all coming from the White House, using it only as a political issue for Trump's re-election.
CHANG: Now, on solutions to immigration, E.J., your paper, The Washington Post, is reporting that when the White House first raised this idea months ago about putting migrants in sanctuary cities, ICE leadership said it was not a good idea. But are President Trump's threats to get tougher on immigration putting pressure on Democrats to come up with more viable solutions for the situation at the border?
DIONNE: Well, the one person who has put out a detailed immigration plan among the candidates for president is Julian Castro. And whether you agree with it or not, I think he set out sort of a position that would be compromised a lot if he ever tried to negotiate it. But at least he's come out there and says, here's what I will do. I think the party, like on a lot of issues, has - let's put it charitably - multiple minds where they should go.
And I think a lot of people say, what's the point of putting out a position when we know that we can't negotiate with Trump? Nonetheless, I think over time, they simply have to take a stand, say, here's what we'll do, and let that be their political position - i.e. we're going to try to solve the problem.
BROOKS: Shockingly, I'd be a lot harder on the Democrats. You know, Castro, I think it's - one of the things he does is he repeals a 1929 law making illegal entry a federal crime, which takes immigration very far. I think a lot of the candidates don't know where the left is on this. They don't know how far that we've gone toward open borders, and they don't want to make a mistake. And therefore they don't have policies. But it's making - I think it's politically and morally extremely foolish not to have a policy on what to do with the big central question on our southern border.
CHANG: All right.
DIONNE: I just want to say, on Castro, I think the fact that he came out there is going to put pressure on other Democrats to put out plans. It's still a long time before between now and the caucuses. But on the point that I think they have to say something and be reasonably clear, I agree with that.
CHANG: All right. I want to turn to Attorney General William Barr now. We're expecting a redacted version of the Mueller report to come any day now. And Barr was on the Hill this week testifying about that report. But he also mentioned something else that took a lot of people by surprise. He said that the Obama administration had spied on the Trump campaign.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I think there was - spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur.
CHANG: All right. So President Trump has repeatedly accused the Obama White House of spying on his campaign. Barr chimes in this week, seems to agree with him, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to say that Barr is doing President Trump's political bidding. David, do you agree with Pelosi on that?
BROOKS: I don't know. The guy does seem to be one for dropping tidbits and then not elaborating. And so I don't think he should have said the spying thing without explaining exactly what it was he was talking about because it was bound to be a bombshell. But in general, I'm willing to wait on this. A lot of people are leaping to conclusions and postures and attitudes without knowing what's in the report or how he's really doing. It'll be out in a few days. Let's just wait.
CHANG: All right.
DIONNE: Four strikes and you're out. I mean, he put out that summary which was - didn't even have a full quote from the Mueller report. He absolved Trump of obstruction by fiat. Now he does the spying thing. And he has been totally muddled. I think for Democrats, he has shown himself to be a partisan figure and not the attorney general of everybody.
CHANG: All right. In our last minute, I want to talk briefly about the Israeli elections. We saw Benjamin Netanyahu win a fifth term as prime minister. And I want to ask you, what does this outcome tell us? Because he won this pretty close election despite the fact he's fighting a lot of corruption allegations. David, you want to begin?
BROOKS: Well, first, if you're a Democrat, don't get overconfident because these kind of campaigns can win. Second, we're in a different situation. Israel tried to be a pluralistic ethnic country with the Oslo peace process and all that. It failed. Netanyahu is the kind of leader you elect when you fail to become a pluralistic democracy. We're still trying to do that. We want to be that kind of country.
CHANG: All right. E.J., in the last 30 seconds.
DIONNE: I think that Israelis, for now, have given up on the peace process. And they see Netanyahu as a tough guy who can hold things together. But boy, there are lessons for us in this. He ran a really scurrilous campaign against Arabs. He tried to decrease the Arab vote, and he succeeded. He is Trump's friend, and Trump helped him.
CHANG: That's E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution, and David Brooks of The New York Times. Thanks to both of you.
BROOKS: Thank you.
DIONNE: Good to be with you.

Conservatives And Liberals Alike Value 30 Year Old Whistleblower Protection Law : NPR,www.npr.org,Tim Mak,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712006370/whistleblower-protections-key-tool-to-investigators-probing-waste-and-abuse-of-p,"Enlarge this image

A White House official turned whistleblower says dozens of people in President Donald Trump's administration were granted access to classified information despite ""disqualifying issues"" in their backgrounds including concerns about foreign influence, drug use and criminal conduct. Cliff Owen/AP
Civil servant Tricia Newbold recently became a whistleblower, approaching a federal government watchdog and Congress to report senior officials overturning security clearance denials for White House staff.
She is protected from retaliation under the Whistleblower Protection Act, which marks its 30th anniversary this week. Since the law was enacted the number of people exposing government wrongdoing has gone up — and so has bipartisan support for protecting those who speak out. Whistleblower Says White House Overturned 25 Denied Security Clearances
But it's not without its risks. Robert MacLean was a federal air marshal in 2003 when he told the public that the Transportation Security Agency cancelled air marshal coverage on long-haul flights to cover budget shortfalls.
""Everybody in my neighborhood and my family thought I was insane, and I was fighting a futile fight,"" he told NPR. ""It's infuriating because you know what the truth is. And the officials know what the truth is. But they're going to ignore you.""
The TSA reversed its position, but it also fired him for releasing information about the threats to U.S. aviation. MacLean fought it, winning a Supreme Court battle for reinstatement in 2015. Then he was fired again this year.
If a whistleblower reports waste, fraud, abuse, illegality, or threats to public health or safety, they have legal rights.
The last three decades have seen a number of notable and sometimes controversial whistleblowers, such as Dr. David Graham, a researcher at the Food and Drug Administration who said his agency had ignored warnings that the painkiller Vioxx had lethal side effects; and Franz Gayl, a Marine corps whistleblower who raised the alarm about troops lacking properly armored vehicles that would protect them from IEDs. In both cases the government was forced to change their policies.
As the legal director of the Government Accountability Project, a nonpartisan law firm that aids whistleblowers, Tom Devine has worked with about 7,000 of them over the last 40 years.
He helps these individuals tell their stories by providing them a legal defense — and says he sees one similar trait in their motivations for going public.
""The common characteristic is that they have to act on their knowledge in order to be true to themselves,"" Devine said. ""If they don't, what they concealed is something that will be haunting them like a cancer in their soul for the rest of their lives, particularly if there's some consequences from them not speaking out.""
And more are choosing to speak out. The number of reports against waste, fraud and abuses at federal agencies has increased dramatically over the last thirty years. Duke Whistleblower Gets More Than $33 Million In Research Fraud Settlement
The Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency unrelated to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, is tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers from retaliation.
In 1988, the office received just 120 whistleblower disclosures . Last year, the OSC received 1,559 new cases — the fifth year they have received more than 1,500.
""When I first came to the Government Accountability Project whistleblowers were generally considered nutty or traitors betraying their colleagues,"" Devine said. ""Now whistleblowers are lionized as the public's eyes and ears.""
And as the cultural view towards whistleblowers have changed, so have the legal protections, which have been updated over the past 30 years and most recently in 2012 .
Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., who chairs the Oversight subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the law, says it's essential for keeping government honest.
""I'm glad we have it. I think it is an important tool in accountability,"" he told NPR.
At a time when the left and right can't seem to agree on legislative priorities or even which topics are worth congressional investigation, they both agree on whistleblower protection — but for different reasons.
Pete Sepp, from the conservative National Taxpayers Union, explains that, ""as a fiscal conservative whistleblower protection means taxpayer protection."" But Shanna DeVine, from the progressive advocacy group Public Citizen, told NPR that ""whistleblowers are the public's eyes and ears to abuses of power that betray the public trust.""
It's this broad consensus, formed by different ideological justifications, that is the strongest assurance of keeping or even strengthening these safeguards in years to come. "
"Book Review: 'Optic Nerve,' By María Gainza : NPR",www.npr.org,Lily Meyer,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/710414549/optic-nerve-tells-a-life-story-through-visions-of-art,"Optic Nerve by Maria Gainza
Hardcover, 193 pages |
purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Title Optic Nerve Author Maria Gainza Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?
Amazon Independent Booksellers Optic Nerve , the Argentine writer María Gainza's first novel, tells the reader very little about its protagonist. Her name is María, like her creator; she's an art critic from a fallen-aristocracy background; she lives in Buenos Aires; and at some point in her life, she becomes scared of flying. That's about it. But Gainza, in a gorgeous translation by Thomas Bunstead, mines María's elusiveness — and allusiveness; she's great with a well-placed quotation — to create a highly compelling life story told almost entirely through art.
Each chapter of Optic Nerve works the same way. María combines an art experience with a biographical one, using the former to understand or illuminate the latter. This is never a guessing game. The parallels are always clear, beginning in the first chapter, in which an Albert de Dreux painting of a deer triggers María's memory of a friend who died in a freak hunting accident. ""I cannot tell what I should do with a death as ridiculous as hers,"" she admits, ""as pointless and hypnotic, nor do I know why I mention it now, though I suppose it's always probably the way: you write one thing in order to talk about something else.""
This self-awareness runs throughout the novel. María constantly catches her own rhetorical strategies. She exposes them, then continues to use them, exhibiting her critical tricks alongside a steady stream of criticism. Gainza's strategy here is bold, and effective. Plenty of novelists invent writers and artists in whose talent the reader is expected to believe. J.D. Salinger assumes no one will question the Glass family's genius; Elena Ferrante feels no need to give samples of the fictional Elena's writing. Optic Nerve does the reverse. It's a book about an art critic, and it's full of extremely good art criticism. We know María's the real deal.
Book Reviews The Stories In 'Guestbook' Linger Like Ghosts Book Reviews In 'Saturn's Return,' Astrology Is A Framework, But Not A Fix María's descriptions of art are one of Optic Nerve 's great pleasures. Without fail, they are lyric but unpretentious, imaginative and compelling. A red Rothko painting ""seeps into you bodily, not so much through your eyes as like a fire at stomach level. At points it even seems to me that Rothko creates not so much works of art as smoldering, endless blocks of fire, akin to the burning bush from Exodus."" Or, for those who prefer the Renaissance, there's El Greco's painting of Christ in the olive grove, in which ""gravity functions in reverse: something draws the figures skyward, sucking them in the direction of the clouds, like the bubbles in the lava lamps of my adolescence.""
All this might seem a bit over-intellectualized, but thanks to Gainza's dry wit and realism, it's the reverse. María might like citing the morose Italian poet Cesare Pavese, but she's also prone to invoking the ""reality-TV rule: as long as no children are harmed, anything goes."" She seems immune to snobbery and grounded in her own body and experiences. Most importantly, she's very skeptical of her own intelligence. She doesn't doubt how smart she is; nor does she set much store by it. Early in her career, she decides, ""To ever feel that you understand anything only means that your mind has turned rigid."" By the time she becomes a fully professional writer, she has learned to respect her physical responses to art, ""to pay attention to [them], because my body always works things out before I do. Only afterward does my intellect draw its conclusions.""
María's descriptions of art are one of 'Optic Nerve's great pleasures. Without fail, they are lyric but unpretentious, imaginative and compelling.
María may not care much about her intellect, but she's still got a massive amount to teach the reader. She begins the novel as a tour guide, and functions as one throughout, leading the reader through both Argentina's National Museum of Fine Art and through her own life. Optic Nerve would be worth reading as an art history lesson alone; its descriptions of great paintings are phenomenal, as are its lives-of-the-artists anecdotes. The best and most heartbreaking is a party Picasso threw in Rousseau's honor. At the end, ""all the guests stood to applaud the brilliance of [Rousseau], and tears were flowing freely as they led him out to his car — only for Picasso, with the cruelty of all true cowards, to confess that the whole thing had been a joke."" That joke echoes María's own rejection of the art world's glamorous side. There's no condemnation or moralizing, only a quiet turning away from money and parties, toward brilliance wherever she can find it.
Optic Nerve is intentionally quiet throughout. Looking at an early Monet, María comments that in her view, ""any artist too dependent on either seeking or presenting new and astonishing experiences will cease to be effective once he or she succeeds in ... apportioning that sense of discovery."" Gainza's own artistic tactic, it seems, is to keep her narrator's sense of discovery alive throughout the novel.

Hindustan Times/Getty Images Hindustan Times/Getty Images Siddharth Dube, a longtime public health advocate, has written a memoir: An Indefinite Sentence: A Personal History of Outlawed Love and Sex.
Hindustan Times/Getty Images He says he knows what it's like to live the life of an outcast.
Siddharth Dube came of age as a gay man in India in the 1990s — a time when a law dating back to 1864, Section 377, criminalized homosexuality, calling it an ""unnatural offense."" (The law was struck down by India's Supreme Court in September 2018.)
Now a specialist in poverty and public health policy, Dube has written a memoir, An Indefinite Sentence: A Personal History of Outlawed Love and Sex.
The book is not just about his own quest to find love and societal acceptance. It's also an account of the activism of India's marginalized sex workers and LGBT community as they battled violations of their human rights in the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic — having blood drawn without consent, for example.
A graduate of Tufts University, the University of Minnesota's School of Journalism and the Harvard School of Public Health, Dube has worked and consulted for the World Bank, UNICEF and the World Health Organization and was senior adviser in 2005-2006 to the executive director of UNAIDS, a special United Nations effort to tackle AIDS.
You write about how you were constantly taunted during your school years for acting like a ""sissy boy."" How did you cope during this difficult time?
I coped by trying to my utmost to behave just like other boys, including my brothers, to exactly copy their mannerisms and their interests. I also desperately excised any aspects of my mannerisms that I thought were feminine and hence forbidden to males, including gentleness. Unfortunately, my efforts didn't succeed. All through my school years, and then into my undergraduate college years in Delhi, I was mocked and ostracized for being ""sissy"" and ""girly.""
How did your family treat you?
I was enormously lucky as my parents were not only fiercely protective of us children but they also had a remarkably independent-thinking streak. So I didn't face any censure from them about my femininity — not once! In contrast, I did begin to feel a sense of distance and inferiority to my brothers as a result of being teased by them about my feminine looks and mannerisms.
Do you think it's any different for boys growing up today in India – or around the world? Do we still hold the same rigid and potentially damaging views about gender?
Boys and men in many parts of India are raised to be far more gentle and ""feminine"" — and comfortable with physical and emotional intimacy — than is the norm for Western/American males. This was true then [in the '70s], and remains true until today.
Yet despite those attitudes, you lived as a gay man in India in the 1980s and '90s at a time when homosexuality was outlawed by Section 377. What was that like?
Arguably, the worst impact was the deadening sense of fear we all lived in. I remember the utter terror I felt when I was arrested with my long-term partner in Delhi one night in 1988, merely because we lived openly together. The only reason we weren't persecuted further was because of my family's privileged position. Few other Indians had that kind of protection, and so the wiser course in those dangerous times for most gay Indian men and women was to be invisible, to deny themselves normal, fulfilled lives.
How damaging was this silence for the LGBT community?
The silence had to do with a very real fear of persecution, exposure and shame. The consequences were tragic. For instance, there is no doubt that countless gay men and trans individuals in India contracted HIV as a result of the fears engendered by Section 377. By now, because of the AIDS pandemic, it is well understood how criminalization and marginalization multiply the risks of disease, for instance by keeping people from openly learning about safe-sex methods or by forestalling healthy romantic relationships.
And now that the law is gone ...?
There is an enormous sense of relief, the feeling that we can hope to lead full lives with the expectation of happiness and fulfillment just like everyone else.
Another huge impact is in restoring a sense of self-respect and dignity. And we are now filled with hope and determination that these changes will be speedily reflected in vital legal and policy changes in India — such as in terms of equalizing marriage, inheritance and adoption rights irrespective of sexual or gender orientation.
In your book, you tell us how the AIDS pandemic affected the lives of women sex workers in India.
The first few cases of HIV in India were identified in women sex workers in 1986. Consequently, [these women sex workers] came to be associated with AIDS, just as the United States epidemic came to be associated with gay men.
And just as in the U.S. with gay men, women sex workers in India were the victims of persecution and abuse by the government as well as from other quarters. They were arrested in mass drives, their blood was drawn without consent and they were cruelly incarcerated for months and even years, separated from their children and families without being told why. It is because of those experiences that countless sex workers in India have long demanded decriminalization of their work.
And you support that position?
Decriminalizing sex work frees the many women, trans individuals and men who sell sex from the fear of prosecution by the police and other arms of the state. It is the necessary starting point for enabling them to tackle the other hardships they face, ranging from societal stigma and imbued notions of shame to feelings of powerlessness.

Amazon Independent Booksellers How did sex workers and people from the LGBT community push back against the societal stigma of AIDS? Tell us about the pioneers of the movement who helped bring about societal acceptance.
Change came through the efforts of pioneering individuals and grassroots groups. For instance, in my book I document the life of Selvi, one of the very first sex workers to be identified with HIV, back in 1986. She suffered [an] abusive marriage, years of selling sex to support herself and her young son, her HIV diagnosis and then long years of imprisonment because she was an HIV-infected sex worker.
Right until her death in 1998, Selvi was a tireless crusader, not only to keep other sex workers from contracting HIV but importantly also for far-reaching legal reform, beginning with decriminalization, in other words with getting the exploitative police out of their lives.
In 1993, you joined the health policy division of the World Bank as a policy analyst. You are very critical of the experience in your book.
Actually, I'm critical of much of what is called international development. Its failures are chronic and multitudinous. The blame for these failures spans all the way from both donor- and developing-country governments to Westerners who continue to think of poorer countries in damagingly sensationalistic terms, for instance as hotbeds of ""modern-day"" slavery.
But regarding the Bank, yes, I felt that in small ways and big, the institution's entitlements and power crippled its ability to promote well-being in the countries it worked in. It became clear to me on a firsthand basis from the public health projects that I worked on. Our reports were written from the best hotels.
Despite several visits to such countries as Kenya and Uganda, I knew next to nothing about them, feeling much like a rich first-world tourist gazing uncomprehendingly at ""third world"" sights from a cocoon of luxury.
What are the lessons that the global development community should never forget in the past four decades of battling HIV/AIDS?
One critical lesson is to pay heed to data and other forms of empirical knowledge.
In the case of India's sex workers, for instance, a wealth of data shows that today only 1 in 10 ever work in a brothel. Instead, the overwhelming majority operates from their homes or small lodges, often using mobile phones. Yet, in the popular Western imagination, all of India's sex workers work in the heinous conditions of Mumbai's brothels of the 1980s.
And there is a pointed lesson about humility. The West simply does not hold all the answers and have all the knowledge. It speaks volumes that U.S. government policies on AIDS, sexual rights and reproductive rights have more often than not put destructive moralizing before humanitarian and social justice imperatives [for example, groups worldwide receiving U.S. funding were barred from discussing condom use with young people and many adults, with the exception of ""those who practice high-risk behaviors].
The title of your book refers to an ""indefinite sentence."" But now that Section 377 has been abolished, what does the title mean to you?
The indefinite sentence is indeed lifting now for gay and trans individuals in India. But it continues for sex workers — and my motivation in writing this book was to draw attention to the terrible injustice done to them.
How did writing this book change you?
It changed me in more ways than I can count. There's a special kind of liberation that has come from being able to make clear sense of my life, to make sense of the needless harm that was done to me. I needed to be in my 50s to be able to see my life in this larger perspective.
Of course, only a portion of this book is about me — more than half is about the scores of women sex workers, gay men and trans women whom I've met over the decades. And getting to write a history of their remarkable lives and efforts, which have led to all kinds of progress in India, was equally transformative for me.

Fabiola Ferrero When Venezuelan photographer Fabiola Ferrero first traveled to the city of Florencia in Colombia, she took two instant cameras with her. Her goal: to portray a country in limbo between war and peace.
In 2016, the Colombian government and rebels from the country's largest guerrilla group signed an agreement to end half a century of war. Though a clear path to sustainable peace is still to come.

Fabiola Ferrero Ferrero traveled to Florencia, in southwestern Colombia's Caquetá department, in April 2017. Caquetá has been a key location for producing coca, the crop used for making cocaine, and has been hit hard by conflict. She stayed with a coca-growing family for a week.

Fabiola Ferrero Ferrero established a connection with the head of the family, a raspachín or coca farmer, and with his family. She asked them to visually convey — with paper and markers — what life is like and their idea of peace.

Fabiola Ferrero What resulted was a collaborative mixed-media project exploring the daily life of families that depend solely on income from growing coca. The project also touches on issues related to climate change and mental health in times of conflict.
Ferrero used two Fujifilm Instax cameras, an instant photography format that provides a sense of immediacy and the direct involvement of her subjects. They could interact, talk about their experiences, informally be photographed and keep the Polaroids for themselves. For a community that struggles with issues of justice, seeing and keeping the results of the interaction with Ferrero was meaningful.
The work that we see is a juxtaposition of the drawings made by the local families and a digitized version of her instant imagery, creating a mixed narrative and a visceral approach to visual storytelling. The work is not only aesthetically on point, but it also provides a direct connection with the characters in her story. They are the co-narrators of the story, and their point of view is as important as Ferrero's.

Fabiola Ferrero NPR caught up with Ferrero recently for a conversation about her work. The following are edited excerpts from the interview.
Instant photography is such a different approach to documentary storytelling. Why did you choose it for this work?
My idea was to photograph a short period of time, the days between a nation in conflict and a nation in peace. So the instant cameras contribute to the concept of a moment that will only exist briefly. I visited these areas right after the peace agreement was signed. The incomes of the Zabaleta community are based on coca plants. Almost all the families depend on this, and they were being asked to replace their crops but didn't have any reliable option to sustain their children. So, mixing the instant images taken by me and the drawings about their hopes and fears made by them was a way to portray a mental state of uncertainty, of limbo.

Fabiola Ferrero How was your approach and collaboration with the families and people you worked with in Colombia?
I lived with the family of one raspachín [coca harvester] for a week. I brought the instant cameras and a notebook for them to draw. Then I just talked to a lot of members of the community, and based on those interviews, I asked them if they wanted to visually explain something related either to the conflict they lived through or the peace they hoped for.

Fabiola Ferrero I also made portraits with the instant cameras for them to keep, and I would love to come back someday, when peace is finally a reality, and see those portraits in their houses.
This was made less than a year after the peace agreement was signed, and the amount of coca crops was at its highest point in decades. So, the mood was of both celebration and skepticism. I wanted to pay attention to coca farmers because the increase of coca crops was seen as the biggest threat to peace: Where there are drugs, there is usually violence. The farmers I met chose this path because it is paid better than other plantations. [Coca] is not as heavy as potatoes or corn, for instance, which would cost them money to transport, and they don't even need to transport anything, because secret buyers come to them personally and pick up the crop. They were also promised financial help to substitute their crops, but at that moment hadn't received it. These campesinos are not growing rich, quite the opposite: They barely have water access, for instance. It doesn't seem like it is a problem with a sustainable short-term solution. It involves deep structural reasons behind it.

Fabiola Ferrero How was their reaction? Was this a sort of reflective exercise whereby people could talk and narrate their experiences before, during and after the peace process?
Drawings were made individually; it wasn't a group exercise. They were very open to share their experiences, and my role was journalistic. I also visited a zona veredal of former FARC members [a normalization zone for ex-members of the rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia].
But the issue is more complex and a deeper insight was necessary, so I wrote quite an extensive article for a Colombian magazine. I actually studied investigative journalism (not photography), and I write a lot on my projects.

Fabiola Ferrero Did your notions of war and war in Colombia in particular change after this project? How did it affect you as a visual storyteller and photographer?
I always have the feeling that, no matter what I do, the work seems incomplete, because I am not the one experiencing their story, but I am the one who is telling it. This is not the conflict I grew up in, although now my family is based in Colombia and I travel back and forth between Venezuela and Colombia. So, in order to have the story narrated by the people, I asked them to draw.

Fabiola Ferrero For instance: Anyelis asked me if she could draw a land mine as soon as she saw the colors. She's a 7-year-old girl, and the daughter of the man who was hosting me. The conflict in Colombia has left more than 220,000 victims dead, but it involves more than those reached by a bullet, because it relates to how people change their perception of reality and their behaviors. It is the human adapting to horror in order to survive. Anyelis knows how to draw a land mine and what to do if she sees one, because they teach them that at school: It is tragedy becoming normal. The land mine on the paper was bigger than the man she drew next to it, and I don't think I can explain better than her that she knows this at 7 and I don't.
This was the first time I asked people to be part of the creative process, and since then I try to find ways to do it. I am currently working on a project with Magnum Foundation related to Venezuela's collapse and its diaspora, and it is based on collaborations.
How did it affect you as a Latin American?
Not so much affect, but teach. As a Venezuelan, I was coming to Colombia right after the protests started in [Venezuela's capital] Caracas in 2017. So I came with violent images in my head to a country that was very hopeful. Caracas was tear gas and people expressing anger, [the Colombian department of] Caquetá was dreaming of something better, although uncertain. To me, Colombia and Venezuela share something tragic, which is the experience of violence for long periods of time. In Venezuela we have one of the highest crime rates in the world, but the country next to us has had over five decades of armed conflict. And, by the way, our country has also been affected by it: A recent report says that ELN, the National Liberation Army, a leftist rebel group, is currently acting inside a large proportion of Venezuelan territory. So, this conflict, although reduced, should still matter, because violence is very much present in the rural areas, where 230 social leaders have been killed this year. There are still so many things changing in Colombia, and so many things to be told.

That people care more about Latin America.

This all affects people beyond our borders, it is important and we should follow up on these stories.

"As Quidditch Grows, So Do Concerns Over Quidditch Injuries : NPR",www.npr.org,Amanda Morris,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/708111436/for-some-quidditch-players-the-magic-wears-off-as-injury-risks-grow-clearer,"Enlarge this image Quidditch is a fast-paced, co-ed, full-contact combination of dodgeball, rugby and basketball.

Above, John Sheridan tries to score points by throwing a quaffle ball through the other team's hoop.
Noah Fortson/NPR It happened in a split second, and Vanessa Barker doesn't remember any of it. She doesn't remember dropping to the field, nor does she remember how she got hit.
When she came to, she was sitting on the sidelines with an EMT, being evaluated for what turned out to be her first concussion. Over the next two years, she'd suffer another two more while out on the field — hardly what she expected when she decided to start playing quidditch.
Before 2005, quidditch existed only as a creation from the fictional world of Harry Potter — a pastime for witches and wizards on flying broomsticks. But charmed by the game's allure, students at Middlebury College in Vermont held the first real-life quidditch match, a fast-paced, co-ed, full-contact combination of dodgeball, rugby and basketball.
Enlarge this image Vanessa Barker of the University of Maryland has suffered three concussions while playing quidditch. Noah Fortson/NPR Noah Fortson/NPR Vanessa Barker of the University of Maryland has suffered three concussions while playing quidditch.
Noah Fortson/NPR Nearly a decade-and-a-half later, participation has grown dramatically, with teams sprouting up in communities and college campuses across the country. The sport has its own governing body, U.S. Quidditch, with 134 teams already registered this season and another five to 10 more added each year.
But as teams gather in Texas this weekend for U.S. Quidditch Cup championship, players, coaches and officials are increasingly grappling with how to minimize risk in a game where the potential for injury has become more and more apparent. Many have come to realize it's not just scrapes and bruises — it's also broken bones, and for players like Vanessa Barker, repeat concussions.
""If I ever have any others, I'll have to stop playing,"" she said.
The rules of quidditch Sports There May Not Be Flying, But Quidditch Still Creates Magic The real life game of quidditch is similar to the fictional sport, sans the flying broomsticks. To make up for that, players run with a piece of PVC pipe between their legs, sprinting up and down the field with as many as five balls in play at a time.
There are seven players to a team. Three ""chasers"" try to score a volleyball through hoops on both sides of the field, each set defended by the opposing team's ""keeper.""
Enlarge this image Just as with the rules of quidditch from the Harry Potter series, in real-life quidditch, once a seeker catches the snitch, the match is over. Noah Fortson/NPR Noah Fortson/NPR Just as with the rules of quidditch from the Harry Potter series, in real-life quidditch, once a seeker catches the snitch, the match is over.
Noah Fortson/NPR While the chasers focus on scoring, two ""beaters"" try to stop them by either tackling them or throwing dodgeballs at them. Meanwhile, a seventh player, the ""seeker,"" goes after the ultimate prize: the snitch. Once a seeker catches the snitch, the match is over.
Matches can be intense. Players run at full-speed without any required protective equipment other than a mouthguard. And because the game is co-ed, players of all gender are tackling each other.
Barker is a beater on the University of Maryland quidditch team. This means she often competes against other beaters to get the dodgeballs, or ""bludgers,"" that they use to heave at chasers. At 5 feet, 2 inches tall, she's the shortest person on her team. Male players sometimes tower a foot over her.
""I've gotten egregiously tackled many times, where they tackle me too hard for no reason,"" she said.
Barker said her second concussion happened when she was tackled by a 200-pound male during tryouts. She got another when a male beater hit her in the head with the bludger, but without letting the ball go, essentially punching her in the head.
On the field, Barker has seen a range of other injuries. During her freshman year, she said the president of her team broke his collarbone twice.
""I've seen broken thumbs, broken noses, broken collarbones,"" Barker said.
Studying injuries Amelia Gurley, a former quidditch player, has seen these types of injuries too — particularly as the sport has grown more competitive. A medical student at Brown University, Gurley is now trying to answer a fundamental question: how dangerous is quidditch really? In February, she began work on what she hopes to be the first international quidditch injury survey.

Noah Fortson/NPR ""I worry,"" she said. ""We're a new sport. No one's really even looking into this.""
To date, the most comprehensive data comes from a 2017 study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh who surveyed roughly 50 percent of all quidditch players in the United Kingdom.
The study revealed a mixed picture. While overall injury rates were no higher than in other recreational sports, concussions accounted for more than 20 percent of all injuries. That made concussions the second most common injury overall, according to Ashley Cooper, one of the study's authors. Sprains were the most common injury, at roughly 26 percent. Lacerations, at about 18 percent, were the third most common injury type.
The authors called the study's concussion numbers ""relatively high when compared to other full contact sports."" For comparison, the study noted that the concussion rate in professional rugby was between 3 percent and 10 percent of all injuries.

Above, players stretch during a quidditch practice at the University of Maryland.
Noah Fortson/NPR Men and women are injured at roughly the same rate, according to the study, but women experienced concussions at nearly double the rate as men.
There are still no studies of injuries in U.S. Quidditch, making it difficult to tell how safety compares in the U.S., where thousands play the game, and the U.K., where the number of players is estimated in the hundreds.
USQ declined to provide specific injury data, but Sarah Woolsey, its executive director, said the league was aware of the concussion risk and noted that medical personnel are required to be present at every official USQ game.
""Every single certified coach in our league is required to complete a concussion training webinar,"" Woolsey said. ""If any player is suspected of having a concussion ... they're immediately removed from play and cannot return to play unless they are cleared by a medical professional.""
Rethinking the rules For newcomers to quidditch, the physical nature of the game can be eye-opening.
""I thought it'd be a load of super fans with scars on their heads running around the field,"" said Cooper, referring to Harry Potter's trademark scar.
A quidditch player himself, Cooper said he got ""absolutely battered"" playing the game. ""I thought if it was contact it'd be these asthmatic nerds running around and it wasn't.""
Now, many players are starting to think more seriously about whether the rules of quidditch need to be reevaluated
One of the biggest debates in the sport is about tackling technique. USQ rules only allow one-armed tackles, but some players have begun to wonder whether two-arms would be safer.
""When you have the broom in one hand and you're trying to make a tackle, it makes it awkward, you have to twist or fall backwards and throw them over you,"" said Mack Morgan, a co-captain of the University of Maryland quidditch team. ""With a two hand tackle there's never really going to be that twisting motion.""
Morgan said that many of the injuries he sees on the field — like torn knee ligaments, broken collarbones and concussions — come from that twisting motion.
Woolsey declined to say whether USQ was considering two-armed tackles, but pointed out that USQ players are required to sign a waiver that states that quidditch is a full contact sport.
Another topic of debate is the co-ed nature of the game and whether it's safe for differently gendered people to be tackling one another — not only because players don't wear protective padding, but also because of the size differences between players.
""One of the parts of the rules deals with reckless or excessive force,"" Woolsey said. ""Our athletes understand it might take a different amount of force to tackle somebody who is smaller versus somebody who is bigger.""
Many players say they'd be reluctant to eliminate co-ed play. Many say they were drawn to the sport because of how inclusive it is for people of all genders, including those who identify as nonbinary.
""It's nice being able to play sports with people of all genders and all backgrounds,"" Gurley said.

Noah Fortson/NPR Rules are typically updated every year, Woolsey said, based on feedback from players and internal data about injuries gathered at every official USQ game.
She said she thinks quidditch is approaching a point where the rules are more permanent, but will still probably change a bit.
""Even sports that have been around for over a hundred years make changes,"" she said.

Noah Fortson/NPR But as Gurley from Brown University pointed out, there are still many quidditch teams across the country that are not affiliated with USQ. So even if USQ were to make changes, those would not necessarily have any impact for players on non-USQ teams.
Gurley's former team, the Providence Ashwinders, is not an official USQ team, so it doesn't need to abide by USQ regulations. Once, she remembers a game that her team played where an EMT was not present until halfway through the tournament.
""Different people in different places are playing quidditch differently, which can be great,"" Gurley said. ""But it can also be dangerous when it comes to things like safety ... We're not wizards. We can't fix that kind of stuff with a wave of our wands."""
How Shrinking Newsrooms Impact Local Politics,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997066/how-shrinking-newsrooms-impact-local-politics,"How Shrinking Newsrooms Impact Local Politics How Shrinking Newsrooms Impact Local Politics Embed Embed
A study in Urban Affairs Review found shrinking newsrooms can potentially impact the number of candidates who run for mayor. NPR's Scott Simon talks to professor Meghan Rubado, co-author of the study.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
When local newspapers shrink, local communities pay the price. Research has shown that smaller newsrooms result in the scrutiny of government, lower voter turnout - and now, according to a new study, potentially fewer people who run for mayor. What are the implications of that? Meghan Rubado, a professor at Cleveland State University and a former journalist, co-authored the new study in Urban Affairs Review. She joins us from the studios of WCPN in Cleveland. Professor, thanks so much for being with us.
MEGHAN RUBADO: Thanks for having me.
SIMON: I gather you saw this firsthand in Syracuse when you were a city hall reporter.
RUBADO: That's right. So I was a reporter at the Syracuse Post-Standard from about 2004 to 2010, and that was really during the worst, the most precipitous decline in newsroom staffing levels. So I witnessed a lot of that decline.
SIMON: And how did that translate to fewer people running for mayor, though?
RUBADO: Our theory is that when people know less about what their public officials are up to, quality challengers are less likely to emerge. So people have to know that a mayor or a councilor or a school board member is not doing a good job in order to sort of get up the nerve or the interest to challenge them in the next election.
SIMON: This study looked at, I gather, 11 newspapers in California, right?
RUBADO: That's right.
SIMON: And what did you find?
RUBADO: So we connected these newspapers to all the municipalities that they serve and examined their mayoral elections over a period of 20 years. And so what we see is that as that decline happened, newspapers that more dramatically cut their staff suffered sort of objectively negative political outcomes - fewer candidates running for mayor, largery (ph) victory margins for the winners and more incumbent-only races. Additionally, we saw some suggestive evidence that voter turnout declined under these conditions of more loss of news staff.
SIMON: And how do you react to the argument, well, more candidates don't necessarily mean better candidates?
RUBADO: Well, of course they don't always mean better candidates. But I think when voters don't have a choice - right? - and that's sort of what we're seeing. We're seeing that this decline tends to result in the difference between having an option and not having an option. I think it challenges the incumbent mayor, even if the candidate who's running against them is unlikely to win. If they feel any kind of threat to their job, they're more likely to feel that electoral connection to the voters and serve them better, represent them better.
SIMON: We do note there was a mayoral election there in Cleveland in 2017. The town has just one newspaper, which is cutting staff.
RUBADO: Yes, indeed.
SIMON: Mayor Frank Jackson was re-elected to a fourth term, but there were 11 candidates on the ballot. So how does that conform with your findings?
RUBADO: Right. So we looked at not just central cities, but the cities that surround the central city, as well. So while we might see these large numbers of candidates continuing to run in the central cities, still, we would expect that number to be higher and to be higher with quality challengers if the newspaper is doing a really good job of covering local politics. In the outlying cities in the first-ring suburbs and the outer suburbs, we expect this is more likely to be the difference between having a challenger and not having a challenger - having two people running versus one or maybe three versus one or two.
SIMON: And this has to do with the quality of democracy, doesn't it?
RUBADO: It definitely does. So the things that we observe - this reduced political competition, reduced voter engagement - when these conditions exist, it means that our elected officials are less tied to the voters. They're held less accountable. And if that's the case, there's lots of concern about what happens under those conditions - more corruption, less representation of voters, less effective governance.
SIMON: Meghan Rubado, professor at Cleveland State University. Thanks so much for being with us.

President Trump said he is considering sending detained immigrants in the country illegally to ""sanctuary cities."" Scott Simon gets reaction from Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, a ""sanctuary city.""
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Could detained migrants be moved into places that call themselves sanctuary cities? President Trump says he's strongly considering the idea, placing apprehended migrants in cities that have declared themselves sanctuaries. That is cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. President Trump said in a tweet, the radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy, so this should make them very happy. Libby Schaaf is the mayor of Oakland, Calif., a sanctuary city. Mayor Schaaf, thanks so much for being with us.
LIBBY SCHAAF: Oh, thanks for having me.
SIMON: Do you welcome this chance for Oakland to welcome migrants?
SCHAAF: Listen. Oakland is a city that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. We are proud of the immigrant community that we have right now. And it's our job to not build walls but build bridges and welcome all people and celebrate the richness that diverse cultures bring to our city. We also know that immigrants actually make a safer city, despite the lies and the divisive rhetoric that this president continues to drive to separate the American people. We know that data proves that undocumented or documented immigrants commit far fewer crimes. So not only is our community richer and more loving. But it also is safer because we are a sanctuary city and a diverse city.
SIMON: But let me hone this down to the point that's at issue now. If sometime, let's say, in the middle of next week, a number of buses arrive in Oakland with 5,000 migrants, do you say, welcome to Oakland?
SCHAAF: I always say, welcome to Oakland. But this is much less about immigration or sanctuary. This is about an outrageous abuse of power. The idea that you could use human beings, families as instruments of political payback to use public resources to exact retribution on your political enemies. This is not America. It is not democratic. And this is what should outrage all Americans, regardless of their stance on immigration or sanctuary cities.
SIMON: I've gotten two very complete answers from you to essentially the question, would you welcome more migrants? I haven't heard a yes.
SCHAAF: I said yes. Oakland welcomes all people.
SIMON: So specifically in this case, if more migrants show up, that's fine with you?
SCHAAF: My job as a mayor is to welcome people. I don't build walls. It's our job to welcome everyone into our city, ensure their safety, ensure that their families can thrive. And that is my job no matter where those people came from or how they got there.
SIMON: Do you think the president is testing the sincerity of liberal Democrats?
SCHAAF: I think the president is trying to whip up his base. He's trying to continue to drive lies, racist lies about immigrants. And he's trying to distract from the fact that his cutting of aid to countries that now have conditions that force families to flee and seek political asylum in our country - the fact that he's not addressing some of the pressing problems that are within America and tries to distract the public with this hate-mongering - that is the biggest problem.
SIMON: Would, let's say, a thousand more immigrants greatly tax the resources of Oakland?
SCHAAF: Oakland is growing very quickly. And we welcome families. We welcome people that seek to make better lives for their families, that are willing to work hard and become wonderful members of our community.
SIMON: Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, thanks so much for being with us.

SIMON: I love that. Yes, exactly.
BRYANT: We also want to know if the Boston Celtics can turn their disastrous season on - I mean, I know winning 49 games is not really disastrous, but still. They were supposed to be in Milwaukee, in the Warriors' class, but they weren't. I think it's going to be interesting, also, to see what the Philadelphia 76ers do and also those Toronto Raptors, who were flustered by LeBron all those years. But now they've got Kawhi Leonard, and LeBron's not here. So I think that the postseason's going to be really interesting.
SIMON: Two great players and classy guys - Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat, Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks - have played their last game. How should we remember their careers?
BRYANT: Great, great players, and I think that this is - I'm an '80s guy, of course. And I think when you look at the number of Hall of Famers that came out of that decade, I think that the numbers still show it was a pretty amazing decade. But this is a golden age, as well. I think that looking at Dirk and Dwyane Wade - met for a championship twice - in 2006, with the Heat winning that one, although I think Dallas should've won that one; and then, of course, in 2011 when - LeBron's first year in Miami - Dallas winning that one when, of course, people thought Miami should've won that one.
So two phenomenal players - lovely that Dirk played 21 years with one team, which you don't really see anymore. And I think that both of these guys are going to be remembered as the icons for their cities that they were - and also, Dirk, especially, in terms of growing the international game - coming in from Germany; changing the perception, in a lot of ways, of what European players could be; and also, really immersing himself in the culture in Dallas. He's the greatest player they've had.
SIMON: Come into the studio this morning - Stu Rushfield, our technical director, has a scrap of west - wastepaper on our...
BRYANT: (Laughter).
SIMON: ...On my reading stand showing the New York - and can't - Mets - thought they played basketball - in first place. The Cubs - well, not doing well, although they beat the Angels last night. What's going on? The standings seem upside-down.
BRYANT: Yeah, what's up with your ball club, Scott Simon? The Cubs are a really interesting team because I think when they won it in 2016, I think people were expecting a long run of success. And now Joe Maddon didn't get his extension, so you're starting to wonder what is - what his future's going to be.
I think when you're looking at the Mets, obviously, they're 9-4. They're in first place and ahead of the Phillies by a game. I think the Red Sox, the defending world champions in the crazy American League East - there's only one team in that division that has a winning record, and it is the Tampa Bay Rays. The Yankees don't have any players right now.
I think it's fascinating. It's - and it's good. This is one of the things that makes baseball different. It's a sprint up - it's not a sprint. It's a marathon. It's going to take a long time. You're starting to wonder, do these teams have what it takes to just be there? Even at the All-Star break, what are they built for? But when you start the season, it is kind of interesting that the San Diego Padres are in first place. It's not what we're used to.

Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News, describes the latest Medicare-for-all bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders and the options for single-payer coverage proposed by lawmakers.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Bernie Sanders has introduced a new version of his ""Medicare for All"" bill that was a cornerstone of his 2016 presidential campaign. He's one of several Democratic candidates for president who support some form of national single-payer coverage. But is that easier said than done? Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News joins us. Julie, thanks for being with us.
JULIE ROVNER: Thanks for having me.
SIMON: And what's Senator Sanders proposing this year?
ROVNER: Well, he's proposing similar to what he's been proposing since the 1990s, which is basically to make Medicare, the program that now serves 50-some million elderly and disabled Americans, available to everyone and basically get rid of private health insurance at the same time. So everyone would be on Medicare - might not be the same Medicare that we know now, but they would be on a federal government-run program called Medicare that would provide much more robust benefits than most people have now either on Medicare or on their private insurance.
SIMON: More robust benefits, but would that also mean more robust taxes?
ROVNER: Yes, it almost certainly would because there would be no more private health insurance premiums, according to the - at least the proposal that we have. People wouldn't have to pay copays or coinsurance or deductibles or, you know, the money that now gets paid out of pocket. So taxes would presumably go up to make up for that.
SIMON: A lot of Democratic candidates are running on a policy of Medicare for All. What are some of the features of the plans that we might find worth knowing about?
ROVNER: Well, the Medicare for All plans would basically get rid of private insurance, and this is of some concern for those who are worried about the political prospects. There's 150 million people who get their insurance from a family member's employer. That would basically go away. The entire private insurance industry would go away.
There are some other proposals that would either maintain a role for private insurance - maybe they could cover some things. That's how some countries do it. And then there are others that make the whole thing optional. The people who wanted to go into a public plan could go into a public plan, but those who wanted to keep their private coverage could do that. That's one of the big debates that's going to have to happen before anybody settles on any particular plan.
SIMON: And everybody seems to want to bring down health care costs, but there's a big but, isn't there?
ROVNER: There is a big but. You know, we are still a free country. If they bring them down too much, you might have providers who wouldn't want to participate, or you might have hospitals closing their doors.
I mean, at some point, yes, health care is expensive. It doesn't have to be as expensive as it is in the United States. We pay way more for things than other countries do, but there is going to be some kind of a limit on how low you can push those prices. But remember, however much you pay for the health care, that's how much is going to have to be then raised in federal taxes to pay for this.
SIMON: Any chance of Republican support for any of these plans?
ROVNER: It seems highly unlikely, at least at this point. This is mostly a Democratic debate about, what do Democrats think the nation's health care should look like in the coming years and probably decades? Republicans are still kind of figuring out exactly what they would like to propose. Everybody seems to support more coverage, and they know that the status quo isn't working. People are paying too much, and even middle-class people often can't afford their health care. But Republicans are - seem, at the moment, happy to call this socialism and leave it at that.
SIMON: If there is an overhaul of health care, but it's not bipartisan, does that just mean that American health care is going to go back and forth, depending on which party's in power?
ROVNER: Well, that is the big concern. And there are a lot of Republicans who are saying, you know, we really should work together. And there is some bipartisanship going on now on issues like prescription drug prices and surprise medical bills - that people get unexpected out-of-network bills. But even those are proving difficult to find bipartisan consensus on - at least enough consensus to pass a law. So I think both sides know it would be better if they got together. They just haven't figured out how yet.
SIMON: Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News. Thanks so much.

Young Israeli voters turned out for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in elections this week, highlighting the right-wing trends among those who were raised in a time without much hope for peace.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won his fourth consecutive term this week. Many of his supporters are newcomers to Israel's politics. They're young voters who, surveys show, identify with Israel's right wing. NPR's Daniel Estrin met some of them on Election Day.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: I walk into a polling station and find a 19-year-old and two 20-year-olds sitting at a table, assisting voters and cracking open sunflower seeds between their teeth. They're soldiers, like most of their peers. It was the first time they were old enough to vote. All three voted for Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu.
MAOR: Only Bibi 'cause he's the best.
ESTRIN: 20-year-old paratrooper Maor. He and the other soldiers I spoke to withheld their last names because the army doesn't let them give interviews without permission.
MAOR: He keep my family safe, of course.
ESTRIN: Nineteen-year-old infantry soldier Avi.
AVI: (Through interpreter) I voted for Bibi because he's given me a good sense of security and out of the fear that another prime minister could lead us to a worse situation or a better situation. You don't know who you're going to fall upon.
ESTRIN: Twenty-year-old Roni serves in a civilian protection unit in the army.
RONI: His relationships with the world, the way that he got Trump to get on board with Israel, Russia, China, everybody is amazing. Like, nobody has ever done this before.
ESTRIN: Israel's attorney general is preparing criminal charges against Netanyahu for his alleged bribes and backroom dealings with businessmen. It doesn't bother these young soldiers.
RONI: I don't care if he's getting presents, if he's helping his friends. He's a good prime minister.
ESTRIN: They don't remember much of anyone else. Netanyahu has been prime minister for a decade - since these soldiers were 9 and 10 years old. In a recent survey, the majority of 18 to 24-year-olds supported Netanyahu over his centrist rival. About 75 percent of them defined themselves as right or moderately right-wing. Those who call themselves left or moderate left-wing - only 9 percent. The soldiers I met don't think there will ever be peace with the Palestinians.
RONI: I think that it's very simple. We both want the same thing. They want Jerusalem. We want Jerusalem. They want to have a country, but they want it on our land. Just like two babies wanting the same candy, one will get it. One won't. We got it. There's never going to be peace. We want the same thing. They're never going to back down, and we're never going to back down.
ESTRIN: How about sharing it?
RONI: Sharing it - I think that they'll be a disgrace for the soldiers that died protecting this country.
ESTRIN: Palestinians say they feel the same way about the blood they've spilled, and they want a state like Israel has. These young Israelis mostly remember periods of violence.
YOHANAN PLESNER: Young Israelis grew into this reality, so they do not even have - cannot imagine another option.
ESTRIN: Yohanan Plesner is with the Israel Democracy Institute, which conducted the surveys of Israeli youth. He says when he was their age in the 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians negotiated the Oslo Peace Accords, and there was optimism about creating a Palestinian state next to Israel.
PLESNER: Older Israelis - while many of them are still skeptical, they still hold on to the view that separation between Israelis and the Palestinians is a desired strategy. The youngsters do not know any other reality. This is one of the reasons that it causes them to identify as right-wing.
ESTRIN: He says Israeli history shows that views do change when reality changes, like when Israelis rallied around the 1979 peace deal with Egypt. He thinks if there were a real possibility of peace with the Palestinians, these young soldiers' minds might change. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

More Possible Graves Found At Florida School,www.npr.org,Greg Allen,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997030/more-possible-graves-found-at-florida-school,"More Possible Graves Found At Florida School More Possible Graves Found At Florida School Embed Embed
Workers doing cleanup at a now-closed reform school in Florida have found 27 sites that may be unmarked graves. Researchers previously found more than 50 graves of boys who died at the school.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Workers have made a grisly discovery at a defunct reform school in Florida - 27 sites that may hold graves. The find isn't totally unexpected. Several years ago, researchers unearthed more than 50 unmarked graves that contained the remains of boys who died at the notorious Dozier School. NPR's Greg Allen has more.
GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Over the decades, until it closed in 2011, a series of investigations at the Dozier School found that boys - some as young as 6 and 7 - were subjected to harsh treatment that sometimes included severe beatings.
JERRY COOPER: These people were not right in the mind. I'm sorry.
ALLEN: Jerry Cooper is one of a group of men who, as boys, were held at the Dozier School. They've been outspoken about the abuse they received in a small white building on the school campus. The White House Boys, as they became known, believed that some children died from the abuse and were buried in unmarked graves at the school. Their accounts led a team of researchers from the University of South Florida to begin a search that eventually recovered the remains of 51 individuals.
That closed the book on the search for graves at the Dozier School until recently, when a company began working near the spot where the graves were found, an area known as Boot Hill. Using ground-penetrating radar, workers found 27 anomalies - sites, they concluded, that could be graves. Jerry Cooper, one of the White House Boys, says it confirms what his members have long been saying.
COOPER: We have, on a list, a total of 183 boys that cannot be accounted for, sir. I'm not surprised at all.
ALLEN: The survey of the area was conducted last year, and the report of the additional possible gravesites was filed in January. The information became public this week when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sent a letter to officials in Jackson County, which now owns the site. DeSantis is asking the county to work with state agencies to handle the site, quote, ""with the utmost sensitivity and care."" Cooper has looked at the consultant's report on the anomalies. He says to him, they look like graves.
COOPER: Some of them are very shallow, which tells me this is a repeat of Boot Hill because we had a lot of shallow graves at Boot Hill - what we call hasty burials.
ALLEN: The work at the old Dozier School is going on as part of Jackson County's plan to redevelop the site. Deciding what to do about these and any additional graves found on the site may slow that down. County officials say they'll work with the governor to address all concerns. Cooper believes the state, as a former owner of the school, should take charge of determining how many boys died there and where they're buried. Greg Allen, NPR News.

President Omar al-Bashir was ousted from power. A transitional government will now run the country for two years. NPR's Scott Simon speaks with Ahmed Soliman of Chatham House about what's next.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
The head of Sudan's transitional government said today he was canceling a night curfew. He also ordered the release of all prisoners who'd been jailed under emergency laws by ousted President Omar al-Bashir. Al-Bashir was overthrown this week by the military after months of protests across the country. We spoke with Ahmed Soliman, a Horn of Africa research fellow at Chatham House in London, who says the fast-moving situation has taken everyone by surprise.
AHMED SOLIMAN: The protesters remain on the streets. They remain camped outside the army headquarters in Khartoum in large numbers - in the thousands.
There are rapid developments. I mean, even since yesterday, the new head of the military council that was announced, Awad Ibn Auf, former defense minister and vice president of Sudan who had ousted President Bashir, has himself been replaced, largely because of the demands on the street, but also due to internal rifts within the military and the armed forces. He has been replaced by the commander of the ground forces, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is seen as somebody who is not as politicized as Ibn Auf was.
And ultimately, the protesters in the street are calling for a civilian-led administration and want to keep the pressure on for the military to hand over and provide a short-term timeline to moving towards a popular-led administration.
SIMON: Al-Bashir was in power for three decades. What was there, you believe, about this particular moment that led the generals to get rid of him?
SOLIMAN: Well, we've had a full month of sustained attritional protest in Sudan, which has ebbed and flowed. There was a large anniversary last week where thousands more protesters came out onto the streets to celebrate the downfall of the Nimeiri regime in '85. And they got the military headquarters as a focal point for their protests. And this has really ramped up the pressure. This is a stone's throw away from the presidential palace. And, really, the demands were being heard in real time.
The focal point of the military headquarters made a real difference in changing the generals and the top of the army's mindsets, particularly as it was dividing the ranks of the army with the middle-ranked officers supporting the protesters and defending them from being removed.
SIMON: Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court. He's accused of organizing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region. Is it possible he'll be extradited and have to stand trial?
SOLIMAN: Well, the current military government of yesterday - the transition came out with an explicit statement under Ibn Auf that he would be tried domestically. He would not be extradited. This would be a process for the judicial courts in Sudan. He was clear on that.
Since then, we have a new general of the transitional military council, General Burhan. And we're awaiting his statement as to whether or not there'll be any changes in the approach taken by the military council. Otherwise, I'm sure there'll be some leverage placed by the international community to try and change that decision. Of course, many Sudanese will be unhappy if Bashir and some of his allies are given a soft landing.
SIMON: Do you see protests continuing?
SOLIMAN: Protests are likely to continue. And actually, the Sudanese Professional Association (ph) are calling for reinforcements for people to move to the military headquarters to prevent the national intelligence and Rapid Support Force militias removing them forcibly.

NPR's Scott Simon asks Erin Lee Carr about her father, journalist David Carr, and her memoir, All That You Leave Behind.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
David Carr was an extraordinary reporter, but his best story may have been his own. He battled back from cocaine and crack addiction and a life on the street to become a celebrated columnist at The New York Times and, more crucially, a devoted father. David Carr collapsed in the newsroom one night in 2015 and died at the height of his fame and creative powers at the age of 58, leaving readers and his family in mourning.
Erin Lee Carr, documentary filmmaker, has put together a memoir of the father she cherished and her own struggles with some of the same demons he had wrestled. She's called her memoir ""All That You Leave Behind."" Erin Lee Carr joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us.
ERIN LEE CARR: Hi. So great to be here.
SIMON: If I could, I'd like to begin with that moment in your childhood. I believe you were 8 years old. Your father was going to take you and your friend Alex (ph) to McDonald's. What happened?
CARR: So I write about in the book that I was not an especially cool kid. I don't know if that's irregular for NPR listeners, but (laughter)...
SIMON: This is not the way to begin a healthful relationship, Ms. Carr, but go ahead.
CARR: Just teasing. But - so did not have a lot of friends, was super excited that I finally made a friend. And she was even - you know, she was ready to come over to the house. And so upstairs in my room, the one that I shared with my twin sister, I explained that, you know, my parents were drug addicts and that I didn't live with my mom, but I live with my dad. And so when my dad offered to take us to McDonald's, she said, you know, I'm not getting in the car with you because she was taught by her family that drug addicts are bad.
SIMON: Well, and tell us what he said to you and your sister Meagan, because it's, to say the least, a family conversation that's unique.
CARR: He talked about his former life as a drug addict, specifically crack. And I didn't really understand what that meant, but, you know, one of the things that I took away from the conversation - what I remember, you know, thinking about was you have to be careful about who you tell your story to. It's not something to be traded for affection. It's not private, but it's not public. He had yet to write his book, ""The Night Of The Gun.""
SIMON: I have thought in my mind if there's a nice way to phrase this, and I'm afraid I can't, so let me try anyway, OK? Addiction damn near killed your mother and your father, and it damn near ruined the lives of you and your sister. Wasn't that enough to warn you away from drinking?
CARR: I think it's a good question. I think that there's, one, a genetic component to this. But the first time I tried cocaine, it really felt like a part of my DNA had been completed. And later, I realized because that's how my life started. That would make complete sense.
So what I can offer you is what I learned about my dad through what he told me, through ""The Night Of The Gun"" - it did stop me at certain moments from really developing the addiction into something that was like his. Like, I was really lucky that not only was there this really intense example of what addiction looked like, there was what sobriety looked like. You know, for me, I need to be very clear that for the majority of my life, my father was a sober man.
SIMON: You talk in the book - you did find sobriety hard.
CARR: Yes. I mean, the first year was - I mean, I only - basically, I only got to nine months my first bout of sobriety. And so then I drank again. And within a couple of months, something terrible happened.
SIMON: Yeah.
CARR: And I remember that my sister was like, this is - you have to tell dad now. And as is our way, I sent him an email saying that I had drank again. And he said, I am in your corner. And then he died.
SIMON: You sent your father text messages after he died. Do you remember what you said?
CARR: It's a little strange. It's like I just wanted to - I wanted to talk to him even though I knew he wouldn't talk back. And, like, I used to send him emails. And just the other day, the book was coming out, and I cc'd him because I don't - that seemed like a...
SIMON: Wow.
CARR: ...Not a crazy thing to do. And the email bounced back. I was like, this is upsetting.
SIMON: Oh, my gosh. I think we all know what that's like, though.
CARR: Yeah. I just wanted - I wanted to - him feel like he's a part of it. And I think that there's a lot of people that don't believe in an afterlife. But, like, we are, you know, a religious crew. You know, to think that he is around in whatever presence exists is comforting.
SIMON: The book winds up with, things I learned from David Carr, a list. Could I ask you to read five or six that I noticed from there?
CARR: Of course. So these are things I learned from David Carr, a list. (Reading) Be grateful for the things you have in this life. You are lucky. Practice patience, even though it's one of the hardest things to master. Failure is a part of the process, maybe the most important part. Alcohol is not a necessary component of life. Street hot dogs are not your friend. Remind yourself that nobody said this would be easy.
SIMON: Erin Lee Carr - her memoir, ""All That You Leave Behind"" - thanks so much for being with us.
CARR: Thank you so much. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Dervish Finds New Ways To Celebrate Tradition With 'The Great Irish Songbook',www.npr.org,Scott Simon,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712813481/dervish-finds-new-ways-to-celebrate-tradition-with-the-great-irish-songbook,"Enlarge this image Dervish's latest album Irish Songbook is out now. Colin Gillen/Courtesy of the artist Colin Gillen/Courtesy of the artist Dervish's latest album Irish Songbook is out now.
Colin Gillen/Courtesy of the artist For the past three decades, Dervish has been at the forefront of reinventing traditional Irish folk songs. The Sligo-based band is ""breathing new life"" into the beloved music of its homeland with The Great Irish Songbook , an album pulling from an eclectic range of genres and the voices of over a dozen featured artists.
Collaborators on the album include Steve Earle , David Gray and Rhiannon Giddens and this project encompasses everything from traditional dance music to love ballads, including a W.B. Yeats-penned serenade ""Down by the Sally Gardens"" and the classic ""The Rocky Road to Dublin.""
The Great Irish Songbook is out now. Founding Dervish member Shane Mitchell and longtime vocalist Cathy Jordan spoke with NPR's Scott Simon about the band's unlikely beginnings, the soul of Irish music and the making of The Great Irish Songbook . Hear the radio version of their conversation in the audio link and read on for interview highlights.
Interview Highlights On the origin of Dervish
Mitchell : We basically were a group of friends that were growing up together. We were asked to make a recording of local music one time and we had to come up with a title for the album pretty quickly. And we were just called The Boys of Sligo.
Jordan : I wrecked it. [ Laughs ] They couldn't be The Boys of Sligo anymore!
It was about '91 when when I joined. I was, at that time, making cakes and making pastries in County Longford and singing on the weekends. I had known the guys for quite some time and they decided that it was time to get a singer and I decided that I was fed up making cakes. I hitchhiked down to Sligo with my rucksack on my back and never came back.
The Thistle & Shamrock The Thistle & Shamrock: Cathy Jordan at Swannanoa On why the Irish excel at songs about heartbreak
Jordan : The heartbreak, I guess, comes in many forms. It can come in immigration, leaving loved ones behind, of course, the affairs of the heart. We have far more songs about love unrequited than songs with happy endings, which I found [out] one time when I was asked to sing as somebody's wedding. They wanted a lovely traditional Irish ballad with a happy ending and I couldn't find one. There's usually somebody dead by the third verse and betrayed by the fourth or whatever. So, I'm not quite sure, there could be many reasons for it, but we have a few happy endings songs, you'll be delighted to know on The Great Irish Songbook.
On how beloved Irish music is around the globe
Mitchell : We continue to be surprised by how loved Irish music is. I suppose when we started this project nearly two years ago, the idea was to try and find people who had a love for Irish music from different genres of music. We found a lot of closet Irish folk music fans. In fact, we have enough to make three albums, somebody said at one stage.
I am so proud of our music, that there's so much love and people get emotionally attached to us. It's a very positive genre of music and this was one of the reasons why we looked at this project. These are iconic songs that we all grew up with. You know, Irish pub music, people come together and it was a great sense of camaraderie when people would sing together. We just think that this was a great way to approach an album — breathe new life into these wonderful old songs."
The Wimpy Kid's Best Friend Gets A Diary Of His Own ...

Jeff Kinney/Amulet Books When Jeff Kinney started working on Diary of a Wimpy Kid, he thought he was writing a comic for adults. ""I always thought of comics as being for grown-ups, or maybe just for everyone,"" he says. After eight years of work, he finally showed it to an editor and learned: ""I had actually written a children's series which was an absolute surprise to me.""
That ""surprise"" has now sold 180 million copies. There are 13 installments of Greg Heffley's diary and now, Greg's best friend Rowley Jefferson, is getting his own book — Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid.
NPR's Backseat Book Club Gross-Out Gags AND Life Lessons In 'Wimpy Kid' Best friends get on each other's nerves and Greg can be pretty mean to Rowley. (Greg, after all, is a ""comically exaggerated version"" of the author — ""He's sort of based on the worst parts of myself,"" Kinney explains.)
But Rowley remains loyal to his best friend — his superpower is kindness, Kinney says, ""and that is a great superpower for today's day and age.""
Greg doesn't necessarily deserve a friend like Rowley, Kinney says, ""but he got one, so he's very lucky.""
Kinney also counts himself as being quite lucky, having landed his dream job.
""I always felt like I was burning to be a cartoonist — that's what I felt like I was born to do,"" he says. ""I pursued it for a long time, and I finally cracked it.""
Interview Highlights On Rowley and Greg experiencing childhood differently
[Greg is a] kid who's in a rush to grow up. ... He's a kid who wants to get to that next level. He wants his bedtime to be a later. He wants a cell phone. He wants to be able to see that PG-13 movie instead of PG and he doesn't realize what a good thing childhood is — what a good gig it is.
Rowley is really quite the opposite. He loves being a kid. He's not in a rush to grow up and ... he's very pure.
Book Reviews 'Wimpy Kid': A Hilarious Take On Middle School Life On people always rooting for Rowley
The thing that I've learned from the four [ Diary of a Wimpy Kid ] movies and from the musical that we put together is that the audience is always rooting for Rowley to win. And you know — as a person who Greg is based upon — I'm always like, why are they rooting for this guy? So I decided to embrace that. He's a really positive kid. He's really incorruptible in a way.
On writing for Rowley vs. Greg
It's sort of easy for me to write for Greg, and I wasn't so sure that I could write for this other character who was more naïve, and innocent, and positive. But I found it to be really refreshing.
Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid Rowley Jefferson's Journal
by Jeff Kinney
Hardcover, 217 Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid Subtitle Rowley Jefferson's Journal Author Jeff Kinney On what he's trying to teach kids through Greg's character
I'm really not trying to moralize to kids at all. I think Greg is sort of like a stand-up comedian who gets up on stage and talks about his own experiences but it's through the prism of weakness and human failing. He wouldn't be that interesting of a character if he was always heroic. ... Greg is always frowning on the covers of the books. I think he's more interesting because bad things happen to him. ... I know lots and lots of Gregs. I think we've all got a little bit of Greg in us.
On Diary of a Wimpy Kid starting out as a comic strip
I wanted to be a newspaper cartoonist. That was my goal: To be on the pages with ... [""Peanuts"" creator] Charles Schulz and [""Calvin and Hobbes"" creator] Bill Watterson and [""The Far Side"" creator] Gary Larson. That was my goal and I tried at it for a few years — for about three years tried hard, got nothing but rejections. And then I had the idea to get my comics into books which was really kind of different. Back then, there weren't a lot of books with comic strip DNA in them. So I wanted to invent something new. I worked on it for a long time. I worked on it for eight years before I showed it to anyone.
On running a bookstore
I have a bookstore called An Unlikely Story in Plainville, Massachusetts — and it's great. ... It's so fun to invite lots of different authors to the bookstore. We must have two or three nationally famous authors in our bookstore each week and I love to sit in the audience and learn from them.

Can This Breakfast Cereal Help Save The Planet?,www.npr.org,Dan Charles,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/13/711144729/can-this-breakfast-cereal-help-save-the-planet,"Enlarge this image A bowl of Honey Toasted Kernza.

Olivia Sun/NPR This past week in San Francisco, food writers and environmentalists gathered to taste some breakfast cereal.
This particular cereal had an ingredient — the milled seeds of a little-known plant called Kernza — that's the result of a radical campaign to reinvent agriculture and reverse an environmentally disastrous choice made by our distant ancestors.
The campaign began 40-some years ago with a scientist-environmentalist named Wes Jackson . He argued that humanity took a wrong turn, thousands of years ago, when it came to rely on crops like wheat and rice for basic sustenance. These ""annual"" crops need replanting each year, ""which means that if you're going to get your seed to germinate, you've got to destroy the vegetation at the surface,"" clearing away anything that might compete with the fragile seedlings, Jackson said .
As farmers use tillage tools or herbicides to get rid of competing vegetation, they inevitably wipe away habitat for birds and insects. Bare soil washes away and pollutes streams and rivers. Tilling the soil releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Jackson imagined a totally different style of farming. And he founded a small organization called The Land Institute , in Salina, Kan., to pursue the dream.
Tim Crews , the institute's director of research, takes me on a little tour of the grounds at The Land Institute, and our first stop is a patch of native prairie. Crews gesture toward the carpet of grass, wildflowers and clover. ""This is the vegetation that actually builds soil. It's what created the rich soils that feed us, across the breadbasket of the Midwest,"" he says.
These plants don't require reseeding. Their roots go deep into the earth, live right through the winter, and send up fresh green stems every spring.
The Land Institute believes that we should be getting our staple foods from perennial plants like this. And they're feeling pretty excited at the Land Institute these days. They actually have some examples of grain from perennial plants to show off.

toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR The first is Kernza. The plant's real name is intermediate wheatgrass, but that struck people as kind of clunky, so they renamed it. It's a distant relative of regular wheat. It's never been grown as a grain crop because it doesn't produce nearly as much seed as wheat. But it is a perennial.
For the past 15 years, plant breeder Lee DeHaan has been cross-pollinating individual Kernza plants. He grows them in greenhouses and in open fields and selects the best offspring, paying particular attention to the size of the seeds they make. Bigger seeds means a bigger harvest to mill into flour.
He opens a paper bag to show me some recent results. ""As you can see, the seed is pretty small. It's about one-fifth the size of wheat,"" he says.
But he has been making progress. These seeds are twice as large as when the project started. The Land Institute has recruited farmers to grow Kernza in small fields (small for the Midwest, at least) of 40 acres or so. They're harvesting it with standard farm machinery.
The Salt After A Long Day Of Fighting Climate Change, This Grain Is Ready For A Beer DeHaan recalls the day, years ago, when he realized that Kernza might be more than a long-term scientific experiment. He was visiting a farmer who'd grown a field of Kernza. The farmer had just finished his wheat harvest, and DeHaan asked if he'd be willing to try to harvest the Kernza field with his combine. ""He was kind of skeptical, but he was willing to give it a shot,"" DeHaan recalls. ""I'm riding with him in the combine, and it's starting to fill up his bin in the back. He was almost giddy; he was starting to giggle about it. He couldn't believe it was working."" They ended up with almost a full semitrailer load of Kernza grain.
Even more remarkable: General Mills, the company that makes Cheerios and Wheaties, now says it wants to make cereal out of it.

Dan Charles/NPR ""I think the R&D team saw this lovely grain and thought, 'There is something we can do with it,' "" says Maria Carolina Comings, marketing director for General Mills' organic brand, Cascadian Farm.
In recent months, General Mills gathered up all the Kernza grain that it could find, milled it, and made 6,000 small boxes of cereal to hand out as samples — and at events like the one this week in San Francisco.
There's actually more regular wheat in this cereal than Kernza, and it looks and tastes kind of like Wheaties. It's pretty sweet.
But General Mills wants to market Kernza — eventually, when there's more of it available — as the first grain that grows like grass on the prairie, protecting the soil, taking carbon from the air and storing it in the earth.
""We want to scale this and be able to find it on any grocery store, sitting on the same shelves"" alongside every other cereal put out by General Mills' Cascadian Farm brand, Comings says. ""You can start to be part of the solution to climate change by eating a cereal, which is just so lovely.""
The Land Institute is recruiting farmers to grow larger quantities of Kernza, but they're telling people not to expect too much, too soon. ""Commercial production of Kernza in 2019 is akin to taking a car for a test drive when it's halfway down the assembly line,"" says Fred Iutzi , the institute's president. For one thing, Kernza produces small harvests right now — perhaps 500 pounds per acre. By comparison, the average U.S. field of wheat yields about 4,000 pounds per acre.
But long-term, the Land Institute also has grand ambitions. ""Our goal is not for it to be a small-scale, niche thing,"" says Lee DeHaan. ""We have landscape-scale problems,"" and to make a real impact, perennial grains need to cover the landscape."

We have a recap of the week in politics as President Trump talked immigration this week.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
President Trump turned up the heat on the immigration debate to scalding this week. Official after official in Department of Homeland Securities (ph) was shown the door. And the president said he is, quote, ""giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only,"" unquote, and said bluntly it was political retribution directed at Democrats. NPR's Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.
RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.
SIMON: Sanctuary cities - cities where local law enforcements decided that they'll limit cooperation with federal immigration officials. Is this threatened mass migration into sanctuary cities even legally or technically possible?
ELVING: Hard to imagine it could be, Scott. And, you know, Homeland Security officials had been denying this idea was really under consideration right up until the president said he was still thinking about it. So it was much like the way he threatened to close the border earlier this month, then said he'd wait a year, then said he was still thinking about doing that, too. So look. In all likelihood, the president does know that these are just rhetorical devices. But he sees how they dominate the discussion. And they reassure anyone who might have doubted this president will go on trying to win his border crisis with ever more extreme measures to punish the migrants and their defenders.
SIMON: What do you think the shake-up in leadership at the depart - by the Department of Homeland Security indicates? I mean, there are more acting - there's more acting - people with the title acting in it than at the, you know, actors studio in New York.
ELVING: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned under pressure. The undersecretary for management resigned. Trump also removed the Secret Service director. Acting is, as you suggest, now the first word in the title for much of the cabinet, too. And that's far from ideal for those officials or for the government. But they also do not have to go before the Senate for confirmation hearings or to answer questions. And that's a trade-off that the president apparently likes.
SIMON: We didn't get the Mueller report this week, redacted or otherwise, but Attorney General Barr still managed to keep his name in the news.
ELVING: An extraordinary performance in front of the House Judiciary Committee one day, followed by a truly stunning one in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee the next. The attorney general said spying occurred on the Trump campaign in 2016, but offered no indication of why he thought so or who might have done it and then said it was possible there was reason for surveillance, but he hadn't gotten all the information yet. So Barr is supposed to be the steady hand here. He's a veteran. He's been attorney general before. So it was amazing to hear him make such statements without having that information.
SIMON: We'll note Treasury Department now says that, for the moment, it won't comply with congressional requests to hand over President Trump's tax returns. And Julian Assange, arrested after Ecuador turned him out of their embassy in London. For those who worried, and I was among them, his cat was apparently resettled last year in a more conventional home. President Trump was once a big fan of Julian Assange's, wasn't he?
ELVING: Said he was. Trump repeatedly said, I love WikiLeaks at his rallies during the campaign. That was when Assange was involved in hacking the Democrats' national committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign and so on. Now the immediate charge Assange is facing has to do with the hacking of a Pentagon computer nearly a decade ago - totally different matter - exposing half a million U.S. documents. But since that time, Assange has also been busy, even from his refuge in the embassy, as we know. And there could be more charges. And there could be more revelations about Mr. Assange coming. All we know is, at this point, it capped a wild week at the White House.
SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much.
ELVING: Thank you, Scott.
SIMON: And we will note that Julian Assange has been acclaimed by some as a champion of free speech but also assailed as a stooge for Vladimir Putin and an indiscriminate and unscrupulous hacker. He now faces extradition to the United States, where he's been charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Legal Battle Over Philadelphia's Proposed Safe Injection Site Heats Up : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/13/710253334/supporters-sue-to-open-safe-injection-site-in-philadelphia-citing-religious-free,"Enlarge this image Safehouse is considering locating in this block of Hilton Street in the Kensington section of Philadelphia.

Natalie Piserchio for NPR Natalie Piserchio for NPR Safehouse is considering locating in this block of Hilton Street in the Kensington section of Philadelphia. The proposed facility would allow drug users to inject under medical supervision. The neighborhood is known for its drug use.
Natalie Piserchio for NPR A nonprofit group in Philadelphia is fighting in court to be allowed to open the first facility in the country for people to use illegal opioids under medical supervision. The group, called Safehouse, has the backing of local government, yet faces a legal challenge from federal prosecutors.
The idea of supervised injection sites is to offer people a space where they can use drugs under the supervision of trained medical staff, who are prepared with the overdose-reversal drug naloxone. Such sites supply clean needles and other supplies, but users bring their own drugs.
After people are finished taking drugs, staff can talk to them about accessing treatment, legal counseling, housing and other social services.
""If you find a place that accepts the fact that you're going to be consuming drugs and still offers you services in a non-judgmental way, you're going to start to trust them,"" says Ronda Goldfein, the vice president and co-founder of Safehouse. ""And once there's a trust relationship, you're more inclined to accept the range of treatment they're offering, which includes recovery.""

Natalie Piserchio for NPR Natalie Piserchio for NPR Ronda Goldfein, Vice President of Safehouse and Executive Director of AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania, in her Philadelphia home.
Natalie Piserchio for NPR Supervised injection sites operate in Canada, Europe and Australia, but one has never officially opened its doors in the United States. The group that runs Safehouse is hoping to launch its site sometime this year.
Opioid overdoses — especially from highly potent fentanyl — continue to rise around the country, and health officials in several other cities, including Seattle, New York and Denver and elected officials in Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Jersey have discussed similar injection site proposals.
But U.S. Attorney for the Philadelphia area William McSwain is trying to stop them
""These are folks who have good intentions,"" says McSwain. ""These are folks who are trying their best to combat the epidemic, but we think this step of opening an injection site is a step that crosses the line.""
McSwain and the Trump administration sued Safehouse in February. The prosecutors cited so-called ""crack house"" laws that make it a crime to own a property where drugs are being used.
Safehouse, in response, assembled a team of a dozen pro bono lawyers and earlier this month counter-sued the government in federal court in Philadelphia, setting up a dispute that legal experts say has the potential to test the limits of the law.
The Safehouse legal team maintains that drug laws from the 1980s were never meant to apply to a medical facility in the midst of a modern public health crisis.
""Safehouse is nothing like a 'crack house' or drug-fueled 'rave.' Nor is Safehouse established 'for the purpose' of unlawful drug use,"" Safehouse lawyer Ilana Eisenstein asserted in the filing, writing that the federal law cited by prosecutors, the Controlled Substances Act ""does not regulate medical treatment or the practice of medicine.""
The nonprofit's lawyers also argue in court documents that shutting down its proposed injection sites would violate the group's Judeo-Christian convictions about ""preserving life,"" thus violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal law that protects people from being prevented from exercising their faith.
""[This] service is an exercise of the religious beliefs of its Board of Directors, who hold as core tenets preserving life, providing shelter to neighbors, and ministering to those most in need of physical and spiritual care,"" Eisenstein wrote to the court.

Shots - Health News U.S. Prosecutors Sue To Stop Nation's First Supervised Injection Site For Opioids Shots - Health News 'Church Of Safe Injection' Offers Needles, Naloxone To Prevent Opioid Overdoses Advocates compare a supervised injection site's life-saving potential to how syringe exchanges helped reduce deaths during the AIDs epidemic.
""If we feel like this is in our power to make this happen, or go down trying, we owe it to all those we've lost,"" Goldfein says.
Because of the legal uncertainty surrounding supervised injection, most efforts to open such sites around the country have stalled.
The legal confrontation with the federal government came as no surprise. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told NPR last year that if any effort to open a supervised injection sites moves forward, the response would be swift and aggressive.
""If local governments get in the business of facilitating drug use ... they're actually inviting people to bring these illegal drugs into their places of business,"" Rosenstein said in August. ""If you start down that road, you're really going to undermine the deterrent message that I think is so important in order to prevent people from becoming addicted in the future.""
In Philadelphia, top public officials including the mayor and district attorney endorse the injection site proposal.
""I'm a public health official whose job it is to prevent needless deaths,"" says Philadelphia Health Commissioner Tom Farley. ""The evidence is clear that these facilities save lives, while serving as an entryway to drug treatment.""
Yet city leaders say no public money would be devoted to opening the facility. Instead, Safehouse is on its own to raise private money, something the nonprofit's members say they are continuing to do despite the legal tussle.
Both parties in the lawsuits agree on one thing: Much is riding on the outcome.
Whatever the court decides in this case could reverberate around the country, either paving the way for injection sites, or, perhaps permanently blocking them.
""You know, this is something that I think people will be looking at as, in a sense, a test case that will have implications in other districts,"" McSwain says.
The court fight is not the only hurdle Safehouse faces as it aims to open this year.

In Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood, one of the nation's largest open-air drug markets, an opioid user named Joe is also awaiting the decision.
Joe is only being identified by his first name since he uses illegal drugs. He's 35, from New Jersey and he used to sell mortgage loans for a living. He's been in treatment before, but recently relapsed. And he says, dangerous synthetic opioids are cheap and easy to acquire in Kensington.
""It's sad to see the people that are dying, man. I've had so many friends die and so many people that are on this ... they're not the same person. And I'm not the same person,"" he says.
Joe stands among discarded needles right across the street from a building Safehouse is considering moving into. Over the din of a noisy train track platform nearby, other users talk quietly with him before injecting drugs into their arms, just feet away from city police officers patrolling the neighborhood.
Joe says he has almost died from an opioid overdose. If the injection site opens, he says he would quickly become one of its clients.
Right now, he and his friends use drugs in abandoned buildings, alleyways and fast food bathrooms where fatal overdoses can happen quickly, without anyone there to help. It would be so much better, he says, to have medical staff standing by.
""I think it going to save lives and not take lives,"" he says."

Courtesy of Frontera Studio An art show opens in El Paso today. It's what they call a ""multi-sensory exhibit"" that includes works like a chapel, cut from cardboard, surrounded by trees and hedges spun from yarn, with Popsicle stick church pews and crosses. There are many images of bright birds, cooing in trees; and a looming volcano, smoking over a bright, cheery town.
The art was created by teenagers from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries when they were held in the Tornillo Children's Detention center in El Paso County between June 2018 and January 2019. More than 6,000 youngsters, called ""unaccompanied alien"" children, or UACs, in the argot of bureaucracy, passed through there.
The teenagers lived in tents for weeks, which often turned into months, with no idea when they might get out. A group of local teachers assigned to the shelter invited youngsters to create works of art: drawings, paintings, knitting, embroidery, and clay figures.
Many drew smiling parrots. Many sketched or painted scenes from a town church, with kindly countenances of the Madonna. Some cut and sewed traditional dresses. Many made clay figures of children, who played soccer, or rode and walked along with mules, alongside roads dotted with knit green hedges and trees.
One painting shows birds flocking over a forest that is thick with fuchsia trees, against a sky of orange and red.

""What came through in the art was the strong spirit of these young men and women,"" he told us, ""who, even under those conditions, were still inspired to do something beautiful.""
The art they made will be displayed at the Centennial Museum at the University of Texas at El Paso, and at the Museo Urbano in the Duranguito neighborhood until October.

'Little Woods' And The Rising Talent Of Nia DaCosta,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997002/little-woods-and-the-rising-talent-of-nia-dacosta,"The film Little Woods stars Tessa Thompson as a former drug runner whose sister gets pregnant and has no health insurance or money. It was written and directed by first-timer Nia DaCosta.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
""Little Woods"" is a new movie about a woman named Ollie, played by Tessa Thompson, who got busted smuggling drugs across the Canadian border and is now on parole, about to get off.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LITTLE WOODS"")
TESSA THOMPSON: (As Ollie) I've been applying for something normal, you know, so I can stop all the odd jobs and whatnot - all legal, of course.
LANCE REDDICK: (As character) And the illegal stuff - getting better at saying no?
THOMPSON: (As Ollie) Yes.
SIMON: ""Little Woods"" was directed and written by Nia DaCosta. It's her first film, and it captures the challenges facing women in rural America. NPR's Andrew Limbong reports.
ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: One of the many little tragedies that drives the plot in ""Little Woods"" is that having a baby is expensive...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LITTLE WOODS"")
LILY JAMES: (As Deb) Being pregnant costs $8,000?
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) I'm afraid so, honey.
LIMBONG: ...As Ollie's sister, Deb, played by Lily James, finds out.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LITTLE WOODS"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Have you considered going home and having the baby with family?
JAMES: (As Deb) I'm from here. I don't really have - what about other options?
LIMBONG: The movie is set in the fictional town of Little Woods, modeled after the very real oil boomtown Williston, N.D.
SARA SOLBERG: For everything, you're probably talking anywhere from $8,000 to $20,000 - maybe even more, depending on what's all going on.
LIMBONG: That's Dr. Sara Solberg, a practicing OB-GYN in Williston, N.D. She says the big issue of rural health care is distance. It's not rare for her to see patients coming in from 60 to 100 miles away. You also can't get an elective abortion in Williston, says Dr. Solberg. So patients looking for one...
SOLBERG: Typically, they look at going to Billings, Mont., which is about a little over 300 miles, or Fargo, N.D., to the east.
LIMBONG: Nearly 400 miles away.
Writer-director Nia DaCosta started writing ""Little Woods"" in 2014. Debate was raging over the Affordable Care Act - women's health care in particular.
NIA DACOSTA: And I was really struck by how there was no connection to actual people's lived experiences. And so I wanted to tell a story about that but filtered through the lens of women who lived in a rural part of America, and in particular, those who are struggling with poverty.
LIMBONG: Living in a rural area wasn't part of DaCosta's lived experience, but she wanted to make a movie about women she hadn't seen much of on-screen, which can be tricky - writing about a world that isn't wholly yours. Hit a few wrong notes and you risk coming off as insincere at best.
DACOSTA: Something that you learn in film school is write what you know. I used to take that really literally. Like, I'd be like, OK, I'm a black woman from New York. I like brunch. Like, this is my write-what-you-know sort of - you know?
But then I realized the better way of looking at that is write what you know emotionally. And emotionally, you connect with people who are completely unlike you and live in different places. And if you connect on that level with the story you're telling, with the people whose stories you're trying to tell, then you have a better shot at not condescending or lying, basically.
LIMBONG: So she whittled her movie down to two sisters, one of whom goes back to her criminal ways to help out the other.
MICHELLE SATTER: She always talked about it as a Western.
LIMBONG: That's Michelle Satter, a director at the Sundance Institute, which helped develop and train DaCosta as a writer and a director.
SATTER: You know, the idea of the so-called lone gunslinger who puts down the guns and then is called to action by the one person that they cannot refuse.
LIMBONG: There's gold in the hills of ""Little Woods."" It's not a navel-gazey rumination on the personal costs of societal forces. DaCosta's more interested in the dramatic techniques from films she grew up watching.
DACOSTA: And I have to bring up Scorsese because I'm pretty sure when I found out he went to Tisch, I was, like, got to go there, like, as a 15-year-old. I think, like, '70s filmmaking in general was really huge for me because I was like, these men are insane. They're making these crazy movies, and anything is possible.
LIMBONG: It's telling what's up next for DaCosta. She's directing the new ""Candyman"" movie, written by Jordan Peele, as well as writing and directing a new version of ""Sleeping With The Enemy."" Saying something new with these forgotten '90s properties might seem like a wild idea unless you truly believe that anything is possible. Andrew Limbong, NPR News.

Remembering World War II Pilot Dick Cole,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996995/remembering-world-war-ii-pilot-dick-cole,"NPR's Scott Simon talks to author Laura Hillenbrand about the life of World War II pilot Dick Cole, the last surviving member of the Doolittle Raid. He died this week at age 103.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
A remembrance now of the last of Doolittle's Raiders (ph). Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole died this week. He was 103 years old. He was Jimmy Doolittle's co-pilot April of 1942 at the controls of one of the 16 B-25 bombers that took off from the aircraft carrier Hornet on what many regarded as a suicide mission - the first counterattack against the Japanese mainland after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.
Laura Hillenbrand, the author of ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Unbroken,"" knew Dick Cole. She wanted to write a book about him. Welcome back to our program, Laura.
LAURA HILLENBRAND: Thank you so much for having me.
SIMON: I guess we need to remind ourselves in this day and age, why was this mission particularly dangerous?
HILLENBRAND: The United States was really knocked back by Pearl Harbor. And after that, the Japanese were just on a winning streak. And the United States could do nothing about it because they had no land base from which to launch bombers and go after Japan.
And they had what I think is kind of an insane idea, which is they were going to take 16 B-25s, which are medium-sized bombers. They were going to hoist them onto the carrier Hornet, sail it out off the Japanese coast and launch them. And these planes normally took several thousand feet of runway to take off. There's only about 500 feet on the Hornet. And they modified the planes and launched these planes.
SIMON: And they had to launch - what? - 200 miles prematurely?
HILLENBRAND: They did. They had a plan that was going to take the planes over Japan, bomb Japan and then head on to friendly bases in China. And Japanese boats spotted their task force way early. They had to launch right at that moment. And they did. And the men knew they did not have enough fuel to make it. They knew they were very likely to die, very likely to ditch. And everyone had the opportunity to back out. Not a single man did. They all went.
SIMON: So what did happen to Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole and his aircraft?
HILLENBRAND: They flew over Japan, and they looked down. Cole remembered seeing people waving up and smiling at them as they flew over. They thought they were friendly planes. The Japanese thought there was no way enemy planes could reach them, especially big bombers like that. They had some flak, but they were not hit badly.
They headed out over the China Sea, and they started to run out of fuel. And a tail wind caught them and carried them over the Chinese coast. And then their fuel ran out in the darkness in a wild thunderstorm over the mountains of China. And Cole had to jump out of the plane. He had never even practiced parachuting. He'd had no training at all. And he just dove out of the plane headfirst.
He walked for a day, and he found a building with a nationalist Chinese flag hanging over it. And a soldier was there - a Chinese soldier - and invited him in. And the man took him to a dark room, and there was Jimmy Doolittle.
SIMON: Oh, my gosh.
HILLENBRAND: Yeah - amazing moment. And from then, it was a race to get out of where they were because the Japanese were hunting them.
SIMON: Now, we must note the actual damage inflicted on Japan was limited. Why was the mission considered such a success?
HILLENBRAND: The Japanese were so confident that they were spreading out over the globe and not concentrating their forces. And when this raid happened, that terrified them. And they contracted their forces. And they decided to take aim for Midway Atoll, which, if they could claim it, would give them a land base, making America more vulnerable and making themselves safer.
And essentially, the raid lured them into that. We had the Battle of Midway. The United States won it triumphantly. And it turned the course of the war. So these guys - these 80 men on 16 planes - turned the course of history with that little raid.
SIMON: Did Dick Cole have a happy life after the war?
HILLENBRAND: He did. He was a - kind of an institution at the Doolittle Raider reunions that were held every year. And they had a tradition there. The city of Tucson had made up 80 silver goblets inscribed with the names of the 80 men from the raid. And the names were written on one side right-side up and another side upside down.
And each year, the men would privately gather and drink brandy in a toast to whoever had passed away the previous year. And then that man's goblet would be turned upside down. And there was one goblet that was still upright. And it actually still is now. But there's going to be a ceremony to turn over the very last one because they're all gone now.
SIMON: Laura Hillenbrand talking about Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole. Thanks so much, Laura.
HILLENBRAND: Thank you so much.

Georgetown Students Vote To Fund Reparations For School's Slavery Connections,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996988/georgetown-students-vote-to-fund-reparations-for-schools-slavery-connections,"Georgetown University students voted to set up a fund to pay reparations to the descendants of slaves sold by the school. NPR's Scott Simon talks with Hannah Michael, who helped organize the effort.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
In 1838, Georgetown University sold 272 enslaved people to pay off a debt. Over the last several years, there has been a reckoning on campus as the school wrestles with its ties to slavery. It renamed several buildings that had honored people involved in the slave trade. Some descendants of that original group of enslaved people are now enrolled at the university.
This week, Georgetown undergraduate students voted to set up a fund that would pay reparations to descendants of slaves the school owned. Hannah Michael helped write that resolution. She is a sophomore, who joins us now from campus. Ms. Michael, thanks so much for being with us.
HANNAH MICHAEL: Thank you for having me.
SIMON: And how would the money in this fund be used?
MICHAEL: So the referendum proposes a $27.20 fee added to the cost of attendance semesterly at Georgetown University. It's designated by five students and five descendants, who would be democratically elected. And they would utilize the funds to work on projects or initiatives meant to empower and support descendant communities - things like eyeglass exams, things like Internet access, paving roads.
So we included things like that as recommendations so that they're nonbinding in order to allow the descendants and students on the board to really sit down and to analyze the needs of descendant communities and to collaboratively come up with the best way to address those needs.
SIMON: You're a student at Georgetown in 2019. Why was this important to you?
MICHAEL: It's important to me because this university's modern existence is possible because of that 1838 sale. It's important to me because as an American citizen, I know that this country was founded upon the labor of enslaved African-American people. So to me, this is really my way of using the resources that I have to empower others - resources that I have because of the ancestors of descendants.
SIMON: Let me ask you a question I gather some of your fellow students have asked. Why should today's students, including African-American students, whose families already have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition, have to pay to support a fund to try to compensate for sins that were committed 180 years ago?
MICHAEL: I think that what's been helpful is recognizing that while the university committed moral sins and should go through the process of morally rectifying that history, that slaveholding legacy, Georgetown students, as beneficiaries and members of the Georgetown University community, also have a similar obligation.
SIMON: This week's vote, as I don't have to tell you, was nonbinding. The board of trustees would have to implement it. I wonder if you've spoken with anyone on that board, have any idea how they're inclined.
MICHAEL: I think that there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen next. I think that this is a really great opportunity for the board of trustees to move from dialogue to action because all they have to do is empower and validate the work that has already been done by students by allowing for this resource, this board, to exist.
SIMON: About a third of the students voted the other way. What would you say to them?
MICHAEL: I would encourage them to develop a personal connection with Georgetown University's slaveholding legacy. This isn't about punishment. This is not a punitive measure. This is about using resources, giving back resources. I think that once students really make that connection, it's actually really beautiful to see how empathetic and to see how compassionate a lot of Georgetown students are on this issue.
SIMON: Hannah Michael, who is a sophomore and activist at Georgetown University, thanks so much for being with us.
MICHAEL: Thank you so much.

Army Reservist On Transgender Military Ban,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996981/army-reservist-on-transgender-military-ban,"Army Reservist On Transgender Military Ban Army Reservist On Transgender Military Ban Embed Embed
NPR's Scott Simon talks to Elliot Sommer, a graduate student in the Army Reserves, about the Trump administration's policy barring transgender personnel from serving in the military.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
The Trump administration's policy barring transgender people from serving openly in the military went into effect yesterday. The policy has forced transgender soldiers and other personnel to either try to conceal their identity and keep quiet or file paperwork to get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before Friday. If a service member did not get that diagnosis and is openly transgender, they will be discharged. Elliot Sommer is a graduate student in the U.S. Army Reserves and has been waiting for that diagnosis for months, yesterday finally discovered what's next for him. And he joins us now.
Mr. Sommer, thanks for being with us.
ELLIOT SOMMER: Well, thank you for having me.
SIMON: And will you still be able to serve?
SOMMER: Yes, the Army Reserve surgeon had signed my paperwork, and I will be able to continue serving.
SIMON: What's it been like for you waiting?
SOMMER: Incredibly stressful. We are coming down to a pretty tight timeline to try to get everything done. But it's been tough, especially with everything being out of my hands.
SIMON: When you say getting everything done, help us understand what that entails.
SOMMER: So as a reservist, I had to submit a packet of paperwork that included a plan for my transition and a diagnosis from a civilian medical provider of gender dysphoria through my chain of command. And it had to travel up through different levels of command to the reserve surgeon. And she had to approve that diagnosis that was made by a civilian provider.
SIMON: Now, the administration has said that this policy does not ban transgender people from serving because they can still serve, just in the sex in which they were born. I wonder how you answer that.
SOMMER: Transition is a medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria. And not every transgender person experiences dysphoria. But barring those from medically necessary treatment based on a medical condition - that's where the ban is.
SIMON: You're transitioning from woman to man. And I understand treatment doesn't begin until December. Is that correct?
SOMMER: So my transition has already begun. Hormone replacement therapy has begun by civilian provider. And the military is aware. However, the treatment plan that I had submitted includes other things, such as potential surgeries - and this is for every service member. They have to submit a treatment plan. Once that treatment plan is completed, there's a timeline in that treatment plan of when your gender marker will change in the eyes of the Department of Defense. So the plan that I had submitted would result in a gender marker change of female to male in December of this year.
SIMON: Forgive me for not knowing, but how will you mark it? How will you present yourself differently?
SOMMER: So currently, to the military, I am female, which means that I have to follow all regulations - physical presentation and housing and bathroom and every female regulation that is on the books. And then in December, once that changes from female to male, I will then be required to fall under all of the appearance, physical fitness, bathroom, housing, all of the male regulations for that.
SIMON: Are these going to be tough months ahead for you, feeling and identifying as one way but having to live as a woman?
SOMMER: I think that I have it better than some others that have to live as someone that they're not full time. Being a reservist on the civilian side, I live as male full time. And everybody at my unit that I have come out to has been absolutely wonderful. So I'm hoping that in these next few months, as things progress and paperwork gets approved further and we get closer to that December change, I'm hoping that it becomes easier and easier.
SIMON: Why did you enlist, Mr. Sommer?
SOMMER: My grandfather was an infantryman in World War II. And growing up hearing his stories made me want to be a part of something bigger than myself. My other grandfather was a Marine during Korea. And I want to be involved in researching PTSD to help people that have been affected by PTSD from a variety of traumatic incidences, especially combat.
SIMON: So even after all these trials, you want to serve your country in the military.
SOMMER: Absolutely.
SIMON: Elliot Sommer, a graduate student in the U.S. Army Reserves, thank you so much.

Assange's Arrest And Free Speech,www.npr.org,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712996929/assanges-arrest-and-free-speech,"Assange's Arrest And Free Speech Assange's Arrest And Free Speech Embed Embed
NPR's Scott Simon talks with the ACLU's Ben Wizner about what the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could mean for press freedoms.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Ben Wizner joins us now. He's director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. He's also been a legal adviser to Edward Snowden. Thanks so much for being with us.
BEN WIZNER: It's a pleasure, Scott.
SIMON: The U.S. charges against Julian Assange - I guess I should say so far - seem to pointedly be for hacking, not publishing any information. Do you believe it represents any kind of threat to a free press?
WIZNER: Well, you're right. This was not the indictment that free-speech activists were the most worried about. We were worried this would be the first time in the history of the country that the Justice Department brought charges against a publisher for the publication of truthful information. This indictment doesn't represent that. Nevertheless, there is some cause for concern. The indictment itself describes a criminal conspiracy that includes the kinds of activities that investigative journalists do routinely - encouraging a source to provide more information, helping a source conceal her identity, using secure means of communication. The government sees all of those as elements of a criminal conspiracy. And that doesn't bode well, I think, for press freedom.
SIMON: In the time that Julian Assange has been in the embassy, haven't people grown a lot more concerned about the invasion of privacy that's involved in hacking and their right to privacy?
WIZNER: Well, let's be clear - he's actually not charged with having hacked anything...
SIMON: But trying to, right?
WIZNER: Well, I mean, the indictment makes clear that Chelsea Manning had already provided the hundreds of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks before they even had this agreement. But, again, I think that no one will dispute that information from this archive that was published was in the public interest, that some of it revealed evidence of war crimes, others - very important information that was published by The New York Times, by The Guardian, by Der Spiegel. Certainly, most journalists follow a publication model that's not the same as WikiLeaks and are more careful about redacting information that's not in the public interest and only publishing that which is. I think the difficulty for the government here is, how do you describe a set of conduct that WikiLeaks engages in that's criminal without also threatening the ordinary investigative journalism of more mainstream publications?
SIMON: How do you believe that the ordinary investigative journalism might be threatened?
WIZNER: There's a way in which investigative journalism looks like a criminal conspiracy. If an investigative journalist is talking to a national security source and says, tell me about X, Y or Z, the answer to that question is going to be a felony under U.S. law. But that happens on a very, very routine basis. That's what these reporters do. This indictment, which essentially describes those kinds of activities as being elements of a criminal conspiracy, is something we should worry about.
SIMON: Has Julian Assange really been a publisher? Or if I might put it this way, has he been doing Russia's laundry?
WIZNER: The law doesn't necessarily look at what somebody's intent is in publishing. Remember, if you're talking about Russia's laundry from the 2016 election, The New York Times did it, as well. So did most news entities in the United States. They all published from those hacks because they considered it to be in the public interest. And, again, this is why I think the Obama administration ultimately concluded not to bring these charges, even though all of these facts were known. They just didn't think that they could thread the needle and find a way to criminalize Assange, despite their profound dislike of him and his activities, without putting journalism itself in the crosshairs.
SIMON: And may I ask, is Julian Assange an appealing advertisement for free speech?
WIZNER: No one would choose Julian Assange to be the poster child for freedom of the press. What worries me is that these kinds of bad facts make bad law. If Assange is prosecuted here, he'll have no champions on the left or the right. Everyone here will, in some sense, applaud what happens to him personally. But those are the cases that can create precedents that will be used against people who are much more personally appealing.

Courtesy of Frontera Studio An art show opens in El Paso today. It's what they call a ""multi-sensory exhibit"" that includes works like a chapel, cut from cardboard, surrounded by trees and hedges spun from yarn, with Popsicle stick church pews and crosses. There are many images of bright birds, cooing in trees; and a looming volcano, smoking over a bright, cheery town.
The art was created by teenagers from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries when they were held in the Tornillo Children's Detention center in El Paso County between June 2018 and January 2019. More than 6,000 youngsters, called ""unaccompanied alien"" children, or UACs, in the argot of bureaucracy, passed through there.
The teenagers lived in tents for weeks, which often turned into months, with no idea when they might get out. A group of local teachers assigned to the shelter invited youngsters to create works of art: drawings, paintings, knitting, embroidery, and clay figures.
Many drew smiling parrots. Many sketched or painted scenes from a town church, with kindly countenances of the Madonna. Some cut and sewed traditional dresses. Many made clay figures of children, who played soccer, or rode and walked along with mules, alongside roads dotted with knit green hedges and trees.
One painting shows birds flocking over a forest that is thick with fuchsia trees, against a sky of orange and red.
National Coyotes' Boomtown: Picking Up The Migrant Trail On The Way To The U.S.-Mexico Border National Almost 15,000 Migrant Children Now Held At Nearly Full Shelters When Tornillo began to be dismantled in January, workers started to get rid of the artwork. But Father Rafael Garcia from El Paso's Sacred Heart Parish, who had said mass at the camp, didn't want the art of the children to be thrown away and forgotten.
""What came through in the art was the strong spirit of these young men and women,"" he told us, ""who, even under those conditions, were still inspired to do something beautiful.""
The art they made will be displayed at the Centennial Museum at the University of Texas at El Paso, and at the Museo Urbano in the Duranguito neighborhood until October.

How Shrinking Newsrooms Impact Local Politics,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997066/how-shrinking-newsrooms-impact-local-politics?station=KXJZ_FM,"A study in Urban Affairs Review found shrinking newsrooms can potentially impact the number of candidates who run for mayor. NPR's Scott Simon talks to professor Meghan Rubado, co-author of the study.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
When local newspapers shrink, local communities pay the price. Research has shown that smaller newsrooms result in the scrutiny of government, lower voter turnout - and now, according to a new study, potentially fewer people who run for mayor. What are the implications of that? Meghan Rubado, a professor at Cleveland State University and a former journalist, co-authored the new study in Urban Affairs Review. She joins us from the studios of WCPN in Cleveland. Professor, thanks so much for being with us.
MEGHAN RUBADO: Thanks for having me.
SIMON: I gather you saw this firsthand in Syracuse when you were a city hall reporter.
RUBADO: That's right. So I was a reporter at the Syracuse Post-Standard from about 2004 to 2010, and that was really during the worst, the most precipitous decline in newsroom staffing levels. So I witnessed a lot of that decline.
SIMON: And how did that translate to fewer people running for mayor, though?
RUBADO: Our theory is that when people know less about what their public officials are up to, quality challengers are less likely to emerge. So people have to know that a mayor or a councilor or a school board member is not doing a good job in order to sort of get up the nerve or the interest to challenge them in the next election.
SIMON: This study looked at, I gather, 11 newspapers in California, right?
RUBADO: That's right.
SIMON: And what did you find?
RUBADO: So we connected these newspapers to all the municipalities that they serve and examined their mayoral elections over a period of 20 years. And so what we see is that as that decline happened, newspapers that more dramatically cut their staff suffered sort of objectively negative political outcomes - fewer candidates running for mayor, largery (ph) victory margins for the winners and more incumbent-only races. Additionally, we saw some suggestive evidence that voter turnout declined under these conditions of more loss of news staff.
SIMON: And how do you react to the argument, well, more candidates don't necessarily mean better candidates?
RUBADO: Well, of course they don't always mean better candidates. But I think when voters don't have a choice - right? - and that's sort of what we're seeing. We're seeing that this decline tends to result in the difference between having an option and not having an option. I think it challenges the incumbent mayor, even if the candidate who's running against them is unlikely to win. If they feel any kind of threat to their job, they're more likely to feel that electoral connection to the voters and serve them better, represent them better.
SIMON: We do note there was a mayoral election there in Cleveland in 2017. The town has just one newspaper, which is cutting staff.
RUBADO: Yes, indeed.
SIMON: Mayor Frank Jackson was re-elected to a fourth term, but there were 11 candidates on the ballot. So how does that conform with your findings?
RUBADO: Right. So we looked at not just central cities, but the cities that surround the central city, as well. So while we might see these large numbers of candidates continuing to run in the central cities, still, we would expect that number to be higher and to be higher with quality challengers if the newspaper is doing a really good job of covering local politics. In the outlying cities in the first-ring suburbs and the outer suburbs, we expect this is more likely to be the difference between having a challenger and not having a challenger - having two people running versus one or maybe three versus one or two.
SIMON: And this has to do with the quality of democracy, doesn't it?
RUBADO: It definitely does. So the things that we observe - this reduced political competition, reduced voter engagement - when these conditions exist, it means that our elected officials are less tied to the voters. They're held less accountable. And if that's the case, there's lots of concern about what happens under those conditions - more corruption, less representation of voters, less effective governance.
SIMON: Meghan Rubado, professor at Cleveland State University. Thanks so much for being with us.
RUBADO: Thank you.

More Possible Graves Found At Florida School,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712997030/more-possible-graves-found-at-florida-school?station=KXJZ_FM,"Workers doing cleanup at a now-closed reform school in Florida have found 27 sites that may be unmarked graves. Researchers previously found more than 50 graves of boys who died at the school.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Workers have made a grisly discovery at a defunct reform school in Florida - 27 sites that may hold graves. The find isn't totally unexpected. Several years ago, researchers unearthed more than 50 unmarked graves that contained the remains of boys who died at the notorious Dozier School. NPR's Greg Allen has more.
GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Over the decades, until it closed in 2011, a series of investigations at the Dozier School found that boys - some as young as 6 and 7 - were subjected to harsh treatment that sometimes included severe beatings.
JERRY COOPER: These people were not right in the mind. I'm sorry.
ALLEN: Jerry Cooper is one of a group of men who, as boys, were held at the Dozier School. They've been outspoken about the abuse they received in a small white building on the school campus. The White House Boys, as they became known, believed that some children died from the abuse and were buried in unmarked graves at the school. Their accounts led a team of researchers from the University of South Florida to begin a search that eventually recovered the remains of 51 individuals.
That closed the book on the search for graves at the Dozier School until recently, when a company began working near the spot where the graves were found, an area known as Boot Hill. Using ground-penetrating radar, workers found 27 anomalies - sites, they concluded, that could be graves. Jerry Cooper, one of the White House Boys, says it confirms what his members have long been saying.
COOPER: We have, on a list, a total of 183 boys that cannot be accounted for, sir. I'm not surprised at all.
ALLEN: The survey of the area was conducted last year, and the report of the additional possible gravesites was filed in January. The information became public this week when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sent a letter to officials in Jackson County, which now owns the site. DeSantis is asking the county to work with state agencies to handle the site, quote, ""with the utmost sensitivity and care."" Cooper has looked at the consultant's report on the anomalies. He says to him, they look like graves.
COOPER: Some of them are very shallow, which tells me this is a repeat of Boot Hill because we had a lot of shallow graves at Boot Hill - what we call hasty burials.
ALLEN: The work at the old Dozier School is going on as part of Jackson County's plan to redevelop the site. Deciding what to do about these and any additional graves found on the site may slow that down. County officials say they'll work with the governor to address all concerns. Cooper believes the state, as a former owner of the school, should take charge of determining how many boys died there and where they're buried. Greg Allen, NPR News.
