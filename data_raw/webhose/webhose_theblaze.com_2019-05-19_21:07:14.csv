AG Barr gave Dems a chance to see some redacted portions of Mueller's report. They said no. - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ag-barr-gave-dems-a-chance-to-see-some-redacted-portions-of-muellers-report-they-said-no,"Congressional Democrats, even before the Mueller report was released, have expressed outrage that portions of the report would be redacted by special counsel Robert Mueller and Attorney General William Barr. When the report was released, however, they turned down a chance to see more of the report than the general public, according to The Hill .
Barr offered certain congressional leaders the chance to view some of the redacted portions of the report pertaining to ongoing investigations and national security issues. Democrats rejected his offer.
Here's what they said, in a letter authored by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and Democratic leaders in the congressional judiciary and intelligence committees:
""Unfortunately, your proposed accommodation -- which among other things would prohibit discussion of the full report, even with other Committee Members -- is not acceptable,"" the letter to Barr read. ""Given the comprehensive factual findings presented by the Special Counsel's Report, some of which will only be fully understood with access to the redacted material, we cannot agree to the conditions you are placing on our access to the full report. Nor can we agree to an arrangement that does not include a mechanism for ensuring access to grand jury material."" The Democrats reportedly rejected Barr's offer because they wanted more people to be allowed to view the sensitive material, and they wanted access to everything, including grand jury material.
House Republicans criticized the Democrats for their rejection of Barr's terms.
""Democrats demand answers but put their hands over their eyes every time those answers appear,"" read a House Judiciary Committee Republicans statement. ""Attorney General Barr has given unprecedented accommodations to Chairman Nadler, and it's unconscionable the chairman refuses receipt of information he's claimed for weeks Democrats are 'entitled to.' Who subpoenas a report and publicly refuses to read it in the same day?"""
Mike Huckabee accuses CNN contributor April Ryan of 'incitement to murder' for her comment about his daughter - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mike-huckabee-accuses-cnn-contributor-april-ryan-of-incitement-to-murder-for-her-comment-about-his-daughter,"Fox News' Mike Huckabee called for CNN to ""deal with"" contributor April Ryan after she made a comment about his daughter, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, that he interpreted as inciting violence, according to Mediaite .
Ryan was discussing a portion of the Mueller report which indicated that Sanders had made false statements to the media, and called for her to be fired. Here's what Ryan said:
""Not only does she not have credibility, she lied. She out and out lied. And the people––the American people can't trust her. They can't trust what's said from the president's mouthpiece, spokesperson from the people's house.""
""Therefore, she should be let go. She should be fired, end of story. When there is a lack of credibility there, you have to start and start lopping the heads off. It's Fire-Me Thursday or Fire-Me Good Friday. She needs to go."" Huckabee, apparently either missing or not having read/heard the full context of Ryan's remarks responded as if Ryan was actually calling for Sanders to be decapitated.
""So liberals—is this okay?"" Huckabee wrote on Twitter. ""Does CNN have the integrity to deal w/ this incitement to murder?""
He also suggested that the White House Correspondents' Association should revoke Ryan's credentials over what she said.
""Will the ⁦@whca⁩ revoke April Ryan's credentials? If not, they are gutless tools,"" Huckabee wrote.
A father's instinct to protect his daughter is quite understandable. Still, it's very clear from Ryan's comments that she was not calling for acts of violence against Sanders. Her ""lopping heads off"" remark was preceded and followed by references to firing.
Ryan defended herself on Twitter.
""You sir need to sit down,"" Ryan wrote. ""You gave me a veiled threat not long ago. You call yourself a man of God? Boy bye! As your people come for me! My people see you and will do the same for you!"""
MSNBC's Joy Reid badgers Democratic Rep for not wanting to impeach Donald Trump,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-reid-wants-trump-impeached,"MSNBC's Joy Reid attempted to badger Democratic Rep. Sean Maloney of New York in an angry exchange about his reticence to support impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.
""First of all, do you believe that Donald Trump has committed impeachable offenses?"" Reid asked.
Maloney tried to answer but she interrupted, whereupon he said that he believed Trump deserved impeachment.
""The Constitution doesn't anticipate that Congress shall discharge its duty to impeach a president who has committed high crimes and misdemeanors only if it's electorally convenient,"" Reid pressed, ""it says that that is your duty!""
""So if you believe he deserves it,"" she continued, ""if you don't do it for this president, what president would be eligible for impeachment? What would he have to do?""
""Joy,"" Maloney responded, ""ask yourself this question, why are the Republicans so eager for us to impeach the president?
""And it doesn't say I have a duty to impeach the president..."" he said.
""If you believe that he committed high crimes and misdemeanors,"" she interrupted.
""Excuse me, I don't believe the word 'duty' is in the Constitution,"" Maloney interjected, ""I think that I am elected to use my brain and to be smart about this, to represent my district, to hold the president accountable, I think that's the right thing to do.""
""And to do that in a way that is effective for goodness' sake,"" he added, ""and that gets this country going in a real direction.""
Maloney chided Reid by adding that impeachment ""might feel pretty good"" but that it may not work out in the end.
The Democratic party appears to be divided on the issue, with some like Rep. and presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) affirming that Trump should be impeached.
Democratic leader Rep. Steny Hoyer (N.Y.) on the other hand, said impeachment was not worth the trouble after the release of the Mueller report, which echoed a similar sentiment from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-N.Y.).
Here's the video of the debate on MSNBC:"
Pete Hegseth calls out Ocasio-Cortez after Fox News is barred from her town hall event,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-vs-pete-hegseth,"Fox News host Pete Hegseth called out Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) over a town hall event that barred him from attending, as well as other reporters from the cable news network.
He recounted on ""Fox and Friends"" how he was told that there was no room for him in the event when he tried to attend.
""I tried!"" said Hegseth. ""Listen when we saw this town hall was happening right in our own back yard we applied for media credentials and access to go to the event.""
""Now the organizers,"" he continued, ""this is what they had to say, I think we got the email, they said unfortunately, we are at a capacity and unable to credential any more media for this event, thanks for your request.""
""They denied all access"" to anyone from Fox News, he claimed.
Hegseth pointed out that he's a veteran, unlike many journalists, and would have a vested personal interest and stake in the topic she was speaking on, which was the privatization of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
""I like to call her comrade Cortez,"" he joked.
As evidence that there was plenty of room for him and Fox News reporters, Hegseth played video from the Instagram account of Ocasio-Cortez that showed a mostly empty room at the event.
""You could land a chopper there!"" joked Ed Henry.
Hegseth argued against Ocasio-Cortez on the issue of whether veterans should be forced to seek health care only at the Veterans Affairs, or if they should be allowed to seek private care if they need it.
""They are trying to fix the VA for pharmaceutical companies,"" said Ocasio-Cortez about the issue, ""they are trying to fix the VA for insurance corporations and, ultimately, they are trying to fix the VA for a for-profit health-care industry that does not put people or veterans first.""
""She doesn't know what she's talking about,"" said Hegseth.

Eric Swalwell accused of sexism over this alarming response to challenge from Dana Loesch,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/eric-swalwell-dana-loesch-sexist-response,"Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on a gun control platform, was widely denounced Friday after attacking conservative commentator Dana Loesch with what was characterized as an incredibly sexist message.
What happened? The incident began after Loesch on Tuesday noted that Swalwell has dodged questions regarding previous statements he made about gun control in which he advocated for firearm confiscation and jail time for legal gun owners who refuse to give up their firearms.
In response, Swalwell said he does not ""aim down,"" and therefore, would not debate Loesch or answer her questions. Instead, the California Democrat said he would only discuss gun-related issues with National Rifle Association president Oliver North.
How did Loesch respond? Loesch highlighted the sexist undertones of Swalwell's message — then said she is Swalwell's ""Huckleberry."" The implication, of course, is that Swalwell is afraid to debate Loesch because he will lose.
Swalwell did not respond to Loesch's last message.
What was the general reaction to Swalwell's message? It was not just Loesch who found Swalwell's message — that he will not debate Loesch, but will debate North — demeaning and sexist. In fact, Swalwell was widely denounced and rebuked for his sexist implication.
A coward AND a sexist
You won't debate because she would destroy you!
I am willing to offer my services to mediate the debate between both of you for FREE!
I want a front row seat to watch you get embarrassed!
What do you say @DLoesch ?
— Graham Allen (@GrahamAllen_1) April 19, 2019 A mouthpiece?! @DLoesch is a CITIZEN. You refuse to talk to a citizen about the policies you want to force on us... just because you don't like what she does for a living? Wow that's creepy. Nothing says “let me represent you"" like ignoring citizens' concerns about our self-govt.
— Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) April 19, 2019 Way to be sexist, Eric. @DLoesch would have a field day with you, and you know it.
— Sara Gonzales (@SaraGonzalesTX) April 20, 2019 Sexism isn't a good look @ericswalwell . Seems more likely that you don't want to debate @DLoesch because you know she'll make you look as foolish as you are. By the way more people know who she is than know who you are so the ""aiming down"" comment is transparent sexism.

Here's what happened to President Trump's approval rating after the Mueller report - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-approval-rating-mueller-report,"President Donald Trump's approval rating sank to a new yearly low following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the investigation into Trump's campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
What are the details? According to the latest Reuters/Ipsos , Trump's approval rating dropped to 37 percent after the Justice Department released a redacted version of the Mueller report. Meanwhile, Trump's disapproval rating swelled to 56 percent.
The survey showed Mueller's report significantly impacted Trump's public perception as his approval sank three points in the span of just five days.

Still, Trump's perception is highly partisan. The poll found that only 10 percent of Democrats approve of the president, while a whopping 86 percent do not approve of him. On the other hand, 75 percent of Republicans approve of Trump, while just 20 percent disapprove of his job performance.
Shockingly, the poll found that Americans are almost evenly split on whether Trump should be impeached. Of those polled, 42 percent said Trump should not be impeached, while 40 percent said he should. Just 18 percent were not certain.
However, a majority of respondents — 47 percent — said Trump should resign, while 37 percent said he should not resign and 17 percent of respondents said they were unsure.
As far as the Mueller report itself, 68 percent of respondents told Reuters the report's release makes them ""more likely to believe that President Trump or someone close to him broke the law,"" while just 28 percent of respondents said the report makes them less likely to believe Trump or a close associate broke the law.
The poll of 1,005 adults was conducted between April 18-19. The sample of respondents included 353 Democrats, 344 Republicans, and 210 Independents."
"Armed Mexican soldiers detain, disarm US soldiers on Texas side of the border",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mexican-soldiers-detain-us-soldiers,"In a shocking incident that happened earlier this month, United States military commanders say a small group of armed Mexican soldiers briefly detained a pair of U.S. soldiers who were conducting a routine surveillance mission.
What's worse: The U.S. soldiers were sitting on the Texas-side of the border when the incident occurred.
What are the details? United States Northern Command told CNN the incident happened in the afternoon on April 13.
""On April 13, 2019, at approximately 2 p.m. CDT, five to six Mexican military personnel questioned two U.S. Army soldiers who were conducting border support operations in an unmarked [Customs and Border Protection] vehicle near the southwest border in the vicinity of Clint, Texas,"" the military command said.
During the incident, the Mexican soldiers, who were armed with high-powered assault rifles, ordered the U.S. soldiers — one sergeant and a private — out of the unmarked vehicle, pointed their firearms at the U.S. personnel, and briefly detained them.
The Army sergeant, who was armed with his service pistol, was even disarmed, an incident report said.
""After a brief discussion between the soldiers from the two nations, the Mexican military members departed the area. The U.S. soldiers immediately contacted CBP, who responded quickly. Throughout the incident, the U.S. soldiers followed all established procedures and protocols,"" John Cornelio, deputy director of public affairs for NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, told Newsweek .
The Mexican military personnel moved ""tactically fast,"" preventing the U.S. soldiers from radioing for backup. To make matters worse, both the uniforms of the Mexican soldiers and their truck were not marked with ""identifiable seals or symbols.""
The incident took place south of the border fence, but north of the Rio Grande, the official border demarcation at that section of the border.
After the incident, Customs and Border Protection agents arrived at the scene, along with members from the soldiers' regiment.
What sparked the incident? According to U.S. Northern Command: ""An inquiry by CBP and DOD revealed that the Mexican military members believed that the US Army soldiers were south of the border.""
""Though they were south of the border fence, U.S. soldiers remained in U.S. territory, north of the actual border,"" the statement explained."
Mike Huckabee tells Romney it 'makes him sick' Mitt could have been president,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/huckabee-romney-makes-him-sick,"Former Gov. and presidential nominee and current Senator Mitt Romney is undergoing both retcon and renaissance in politics this week (again) following remarks he made about President Trump after the Mueller report dropped. And one of the people seriously not happy with him is also-former governor and former Presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee, father to press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and newly re-signed Fox News Channel contributor.
Romney's moment began when he tweeted a statement after reviewing the Mueller report. In it, Romney said that while it is ""good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President, and that government can ""move on,"" that he is nevertheless ""sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President.""
""Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders,"" wrote Romney.
That prompted a newfound admiration among some in the media for the object of their 2012 attacks, and even a mea culpa pile-on.
Maggie Haberman of the New York Times tweeted that she and others shouldn't have been so cavalier in mocking Romney for naming Russia our greatest geopolitical foe. Ronan Farrow, formerly of MSNBC, likewise expressed his sudden regret and even described Romney's 2012 warning as ""prescient.""
For those who don't recall, the mockery of Romney for that comment, among others, was near-total in that media which still claims to be non-partisan. Despite this strange new respect and regretful hindsight on Russia and Romney, they do not show any signs of admitting bias or past collusion with Democrats.
On the other side of the reaction was Huckabee, who unleashed on Romney via social media. ""Know what makes me sick, Mitt?"" asked Huckabee rhetorically in his Twitter tirade, retweeting Romney so that the comments were directed right to him.
Huckabee said it was not that Romney has been for and against Trump depending on circumstance, but that what makes him ""sick is ""that you got GOP nomination and could have been"" President.
Romney lost that election to Barack Obama. It was under President Obama that the investigations into Trump began. It's not clear if Huckabee thinks that is preferable to what a Romney administration may have undertaken. What is clear is that the poles are reversing on Romney, who Huckabee was for before he was against."
"Judge Napolitano says Americans should be troubled by 'amoral, deceptive' Trump exposed in Mueller report",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-napolitano-americans-troubled-trump-mueller-report,"Judge Andrew Napolitano is the senior judicial analyst at Fox News Channel, and has been the leading source for legal breakdown of the many aspects of the Mueller investigation on the network since day one. His analysis of what the report says about President Trump this week was... not flattering.
On his show ""Judge Napolitano's Chambers"", he laid into the President, calling him amoral, and describing him as a liar who demanded lies from others.
""The report lists 11 instances in which the President attempted, or attempted to have others attempt to interfere with the investigation of his own campaign. Depending on how you look at them, it might be enough to prosecute,"" says Napolitano in the brief promo clip. ""But it did show a venal, amoral, deceptive Donald Trump instructing his aides to lie, and willing to help them do so.""
""That's not good in the President of the United States,"" he said. ""There's a lot in there that should be troubling to Americans about the President of the United States.""
The video went viral even among the apostate right, with Trump-foil and Kellyanne Conway husband George Conway retweeting leading Trump critic on the right Bill Kristol, who shared a trimmed version on Twitter, which included the branding for his PAC.
Napolitano has said there may or may not be enough to prosecute Trump for something, but that Attorney General Barr has made it clear the government's position is that there is not enough, and therefore they won't.
Your browser does not support the video tag. The Judge also appeared on several Fox News Channel and Fox Business shows throughout the week, including a Thursday appearance with Stuart Varney, during which he said that despite those instances, he thinks that any ""serious legal jeopardy"" for Trump is now over, obviously in large part due to the AG's statement that there is not enough to prosecute.
Napolitano told Varney that the Democrats could still overplay their hand, and that they probably will because Mueller's summary of Trump is ""fuel for them to continue digging more deeply. He said it's ""a mistake to do it,"" but the Dem base will probably push for it.
""Barr told us that there were 10 instances of alleged obstruction of justice. Whatever the bottom line is, they decided there's not enough to prove the case,"" he said. ""The Democrats are going to take those 10 instances, and parade some lawyers out there, ex-prosecutors who'll say there is enough to prove the case.""
""The serious legal jeopardy for the president is gone. The political jeopardy, he knows how to deal with,"" said Napolitano."
WATCH: Angry voter confronts Beto O’Rourke over apparent lie — then she gets the mic,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/beto-busted-voter-lobbyist-money,"Beto O'Rourke was on the campaign trail in New Hampshire this week, and during a town hall at a stop in Somersworth was confronted by an angry voter concerned about climate change and special interest money.
O'Rourke has made a major campaign issue of his promise not to accept money from PACs, lobbyists, or special interests. So it was a rather awkward moment when the voter shouted that in fact he has taken that money, and the candidate had to concede the fact.
""As you also know, I take no money from any lobbyist for any organization,"" O'Rourke was telling the crowd, when from out in the crowd a woman's voice shouted back.
""Two-hundred and fifty dollars from a Chevron lobbyist on March 29th,"" the voter yelled.
O'Rourke passed the microphone to her through the crowd, saying ""so you don't have to shout.""
When she had the mic, the voter continued. ""Beto, I was really inspired to see that you said you would not take money from fossil fuel executives. But I looked it up and you did,"" she said. ""You took the max contribution from eight different fossil fuel industry CEOs and executives, and a lobbyist from Chevron on March 29. And that just makes it hard for us to believe that you're going to keep your promises to address the climate crisis.""
She asked whether O'Rourke ""stands with the millions of people affected by the climate crisis"" or not, and that if he does, would he prove it. ""Will you prove it today by returning that dirty money,"" she asked, referring to the multiple donations she'd just mentioned.
When O'Rourke got the mic back, he admitted she was correct. The whole thing was caught on camera .
""So, you're right, I was just told as we drove in that we accepted on one of the last days of the FEC filing period a check from a lobbyist, we are returning that check from the lobbyist,"" he said. But not the rest of the donations.
Watch:
After basking in the applause for returning the lobbyist's $250 bucks, O'Rourke declined the remainder of her challenge, including her appeal for him to sign a pledge disavowing all money from people in the fossil fuel industry.
""I'm not going to write off an entire industry and group of people,"" he said.

"Cory Booker beats fast retreat from impeachment talk, despite 'resistance' mobbing Hoyer",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cory-booker-backs-out-of-his-impeachment-talk,"Sen. Cory Booker is famous for (or wants to be famous for) his crusades, but following the release of the Mueller report on Thursday, the would-be Spartacus is retreating from his party's long flirtation with impeaching Trump.
On Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren became the first 2020 Dem to call for immediate impeachment post-Mueller report. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also come out for impeachment following the report. But Booker's take was different and more in line with the establishment in the party.
In a response to a reporter from The Hill, Booker said outright there should be no talk of impeachment right now.
""Do you think there should be a conversation about impeachment right now?"" the reporter asked.
""No,"" replied Booker. It's important to note he was not asked if impeachment should begin, but whether they should even be considering it. He answered no, then offered non-specific assurances about extending the investigation.
""I think right now we should continue this investigation, I think Mueller should come before and testify. I don't think we should be having that conversation,"" said Booker. ""I think we should still pursue the facts.""
He said the same thing to reporters in Nevada on Friday, as the AP reported.
""There's a lot more investigation that should go on before Congress comes to any conclusions like that,"" he said. It was a bit of line-walking designed presumably to placate both the base and the leadership.
That waffling is in stark contrast to Warren, who demanded on Friday that ""elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty.""
""That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States,"" she said in tweetstorm .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Thursday voiced the establishment Democrat line on impeachment, saying what Speaker Pelosi has said several times since taking the gavel. ""Impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,"" he said, to the near-total meltdown of the ""resistance"" wing, complete with published rebukes and even a pitch to primary him.
Booker's position was less firm in opposing impeachment than Hoyer's, but the fact that it wasn't full-throated endorsement might still mean fallout from the Democratic base."
Noam Chomsky says Democrat focus on Russia a 'huge gift' to Trump that may hand him 2020,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/noam-chomsky-democrat-russia-gift-trump,"In an interview with Democracy Now!, left-wing author and progressive philosopher Noam Chomsky criticized the Democrats and their base for ""investing everything"" in Russiagate, and theorized it might cost them the 2020 election.
In the interview from last week, published on Thursday, Chomsky doesn't just say the focus on Russia was a ""huge gift"" to Trump, but bashes Democrats for ever thinking otherwise.
""It was pretty obvious at the beginning that you're not going to find anything very serious about Russian interference in elections,"" he said. ""I mean for one thing it's undetectable.""
He called into question the very premise. ""In the 2016 election the Senate and the House went the same way as the executive, but nobody claims that was Russian interference there,"" he said. ""In fact, Russian interference in the election, if it existed, was very slight.""He suggested that Israel's Prime Minister Bejamin Netanyahu speaking to Congress was a bigger impact on elections than ""whatever the Russians tried,"" and added that ""anything the Russians might have done is going to be peanuts"" in comparison to campaign funding.
While even some on the left might be willing to accept those assessments of the magnitude of Russian threat, such arguments are usually met with the objection that Trump colluded anyway. But Chomsky attacked that precious tenet of the party as well. Watch below. (More after the clip.)
Your browser does not support the video tag. ""As far as Trump collusion with the Russians, that was never going to amount to anything more than minor corruption,"" he said. ""Nothing of any significance.""
And that's when he turned on the Democrats.
""The Democrats invested everything in this issue,"" he said. ""Well turned out there was nothing much there.""
""They gave Trump a huge gift. In fact they may have handed him the next election,"" said Chomsky.
Ouch. That's gotta hurt.

Newly resurfaced video highlights Nancy Pelosi's glaring hypocrisy on the Mueller report,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-hypocrisy-mueller-report,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday blasted Attorney General William Barr for allowing President Donald Trump's personal legal team the opportunity to review special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation report before its public release.
But Pelosi's pearl clutching was marred with hypocrisy after video surfaced showing that Pelosi once advocated for the exact opposite position — when it would have benefited a Democrat.
What did Pelosi say? After Barr confirmed during his press conference on Thursday that Trump's personal attorneys reviewed a redacted version of the report prior to its public release, Pelosi alleged Barr had ""confirmed the staggering partisan effort by the Trump Admin to spin public's view of the #MuellerReport .""
What did Pelosi say before? As NTK pointed out , Pelosi said in 1998 that then-President Bill Clinton had the right to review the Ken Starr report, which detailed Clinton's sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky.
During debate over a bill that called for the immediate public release of the report, Pelosi told then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich that Clinton had a right to read the report before Congress — let alone the public.
Pelosi said:
Mr. Speaker, for seven of the eleven years that I have served in Congress, I have served on the Ethics Committee or the ethics task force. It is from that perspective that I have several questions to ask.
If indeed what we are talking about here today is the process under which the Starr report will be released, why then have the airwaves been filled with details of the Starr report for the last 36 hours? It has supposedly been under lock and key here. One can only assume the leaks are coming from the independent counsel's office.
My second question is to you, Mr. Speaker: Why would you not afford the President of the United States the same opportunity you were given by the Ethics Committee of having almost a week's advance notice to review the charges against you, and so that you could have your response be part of the report? As NTK noted, the ethics investigation in which Pelosi referred resulted in Gingrich being formally reprimanded for ""claiming tax-exempt status for a college course that was run for political purposes.""
Pelosi ultimately voted against the resolution. However, the bill overwhelmingly passed Congress and the Starr report was released to the public two days after Starr's office delivered it to Congress."

Mitt Romney, part of the ongoing fallout and reaction to Romney stating he was ""sickened"" by the 'dishonesty"" of the President.
Former governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee jumped on Romney on Friday afternoon, saying that what made him sick was the thought that Romney might have become president in 2016.
Trump built of the theme of dodging the Romney bullet (for Obama?) in 2012, tweeting a video showing Mitt's devastating loss, and Trump's devastating win in their respective runs.
If Romney ""spent the same energy fighting Barack Obama as he does fighting Donald Trump,"" wrote Donald Trump, ""he could have won the rade (maybe)!""
The video, attached to the tweet, is a painful look back for Romney and any Republican, followed by a painful look back for any Democrat tempted to gloat.
Ouch!
All around a solid roast, as the back-and-forth Tweet-slinging continues apace.

But for Christians, today is the most joyous of days, one in which genuine celebration is the only appropriate response: After days of mourning and mounting uncertainty, Jesus, the embodiment of the One True God, is alive.
Hallelujah.
What Easter is truly about It should not be missed that Jesus inexplicably tied his death — the events of Easter and the Passion week — with the events preceding Jewish Passover. After all, Jesus himself was a Jew, as were his disciples, so the Jewish context was the best category available to communicate his teachings.
But there was a deeper meaning at hand. Indeed, the events of the Passion week should be examined in light of the narrative storyline of the Bible.
After the downward spiral of humanity descended the created world into utter chaos (Genesis 3-11), God chose to reconcile his relationship and partnership with humanity through one family, Abraham's (Genesis 15). Abraham's family later grew into the nation of Israel, whom God delivered from oppression in Egypt. God later made a covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19) that Israel would become a holy nation — unique and set apart — that would serve as a ""kingdom of priests"" to the nations of the world.
However, as the story goes — over and over and over again — the Israelites utterly fail at upholding their end of the covenant. Still, despite Israel's continual rebellion and idolatry, God remains faithful to his people, even through multiple exiles. The narratives point to one day when a ""New Moses,"" ""New Adam,"" and ""New David"" figure would appear.
As history goes, that person was Jesus, the incarnation of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Unfortunately, most of Jesus' disciples only realized the entire story of the Hebrew Bible was about their great rabbi after Jesus' death and resurrection. But it's not that Jesus did not warn them.
In fact, the night before Jesus' death, the night of his arrest, Jesus fundamentally reshaped the most important story in Israel's history.
From Luke 22 :
When the time came, Jesus and the apostles sat down together at the table. Jesus said, ""I have been very eager to eat this Passover meal with you before my suffering begins. For I tell you now that I won't eat this meal again until its meaning is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God."" Then he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. Then he said, ""Take this and share it among yourselves. For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come."" He took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, ""This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me."" After supper he took another cup of wine and said, ""This cup is the new covenant between God and his people—an agreement confirmed with my blood, which is poured out as a sacrifice for you. On that night, Jesus took some of the most important symbols of the ""old covenant"" and initiated a new one.
And that is the fundamental reality about Easter: The Kingdom of God is here — and there is a new order of life possible to all those who take the bread and the cup and believe in their hearts that Jesus is Lord (Romans 10:9).
Three days after Jesus' execution, the stone that sealed his tomb was rolled away — not to let Jesus out, but to let us in.
Jesus defeating death on the cross and through the empty tomb is an invitation to new life — to New Humanity — that we can finally be the true humans, living in harmonious union with God, that we were meant to be all along.
But the gift is not just a seat in eternity, although faithful Christians eagerly await being reunited with God forever. Indeed, the invitation to new life, to begin the journey of sanctification toward New Humanity, is an invitation to renew our partnership with God in bringing heaven back to earth.
""Jesus' resurrection is the beginning of God's new project not to snatch people away from earth to heaven but to colonize earth with life of heaven. That, after all, is what the Lord's Prayer is all about,"" the great New Testament scholar N.T. Wright wrote in his book ""Surprised by Hope.""
Happy Easter, everyone."

It's been 20 years since two students entered the Colorado school and committed unimaginable acts of violence, killing 12 students and one teacher before turning their guns on themselves.
Sadly, Columbine was hardly the end of our nation's school shooting epidemic, with atrocities unfolding again and again over the past two decades. Americans have desperately sought answers and have endlessly debated the root causes of such unrestrained evil.
Survivors of these events are often left to forge on and find healing, grappling with the effects of what they've seen and experienced. As a journalist, I've often wondered how people recover, what role forgiveness plays and how hope can be found amid the ashes."

The shocking attacks have left the country, an island-nation just off the southeastern coast of India, in a state of complete lock-down, according to CNN .
Here's everything we know so far: As of 10:00 a.m. EST, 207 people were confirmed dead while more than 450 others were reported injured The first wave of attacks targeted Sri Lanka's minority Christian community with bombings at three churches in the cities of Colombo, Negombo, and Batticaloa Additional blasts hit three luxury hotels in Sri Lanka's capital city of Colombo A seventh and eighth blast occurred Sunday afternoon outside the Dehiwala Zoo and near house in Mahawila Gardens, authorities said Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena described the coordinated attacks as a terrorist incident, Fox News reported No terrorist group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks Sri Lankan officials have arrested seven individuals they claim are responsible for the attacks Officials believe suicide bombers carried out the attacks Chamila Karunarathne/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
""It was a river of blood,"" one witness told the New York Times . ""Ash was falling like snow. I saw limbs and heads. There were children too.""
The attacks earned global condemnation Sunday morning, including from Pope Francis. It is estimated that more than 80 percent of Sri Lankan Christians are Roman Catholics.
President Donald Trump said on social media the U.S. stands prepared to help Sri Lankan authorities following the tragedy.

John Kasich makes wild claim about President Trump after Mueller report - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-kasich-response-mueller-report,"Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) over the weekend reacted sharply to the public release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the investigation into Russian interference and the Trump campaign, slamming President Donald Trump for ""unacceptable"" behavior.
What did Kasich say? Trump's actions outlined in Mueller's report, which included outright lies and attempted investigative manipulation, are the worst Kasich has ever witnessed in his political career, he said.
"". @realDonaldTrump 's behavior described in the #MuellerReport is more than disappointing. It's unacceptable & not behavior we should expect from our president. It's worse than I've seen in my career observing & working with presidents or public officials. America deserves better,"" Kasich wrote on Twitter.
Kasich has been actively involved in national politics for more than three decades, spanning the scandals of Bill Clinton's administration and the scandals of Barack Obama's administration, which included Hillary Clinton's private email server debacle.
Presumably, Kasich believes Trump's actions are worse than the scandals that marred previous Democratic presidential administrations.
Later, Kasich posted comments he made on CNN in which he explained the Mueller report puts on public display the exact reasons why he never supported Trump.
""I'm not only disappointed and angry — I'm sickened by all this,"" Kasich said.
Kasich's comments came one day after another prominent Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), blasted Trump for his actions as outlined in Mueller's report. Trump later responded to Romney's comments with a viral video online.
Kasich finished second to Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary."

What happened? NBC correspondent Mike Viqueira confronted Mueller as he attempted to get into his vehicle. Mueller was with his wife and had just left his Easter church service.
""Sir, can I ask you a couple questions? Will you testify before Congress, sir?"" Viqueria asked, sticking his microphone in Mueller's face.
""Uh, no comment,"" Mueller responded.
""Are you sure about that sir?"" Viqueria shot back. ""If he were anybody but the president, would Mr. Trump be indicted, sir?""
Mueller continued to ignore Viqueria, but that didn't stop the reporter from peppering the former FBI director with questions about Trump.
""Sir, why didn't you make a recommendation to Congress one way or the other?"" Viqueria asked. ""Did the attorney general accurately characterize your positions on conspiracy and obstruction, sir?""
Mueller finally got in his car and left. He did not answer any of Viqueria's questions.
Viqueira later recapped the ambush on MSNBC, laughing at what he did and characterized Mueller as being ""tight-lipped."""
WATCH: California woman caught on camera dumping bag of newborn puppies at dumpster - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-caught-dumping-puppies,"A California woman was caught on camera cruelly discarding a plastic bag full of healthy, 3-day-old puppies at a dumpster, like so much trash. Riverside County officials are not taking it lightly, and are currently looking for the woman in the video, or any information that might lead to her.
In a Facebook post , they explain that the security camera footage shows the woman dumping the puppies next to a dumpster behind a NAPA Auto Parts store in Coachella. An employee of the store contacted animal services after a passerby discovered the 7 terrier-mix pups, trapped and overheating in the plastic garbage bag.
The responding officer, Jose Cisneros, asked to see the store's security tapes and that was how they discovered the evidence, which includes not just the woman but footage of her vehicle.
It's terrible to watch. She literally throws them at the dumpster.
Your browser does not support the video tag. ""Animal Services' veterinary team members cared for the puppies and lined up a rescue group partner organization to take over bottle feeding duties,"" the Facebook post explains. ""MeoowzResQ, a Southern California-based organization specializing in kitten and cat rescue and fostering, agreed to accept the pups.""
The man, identified as John, who found the puppies probably saved the puppies from dying from the heat, suffocation, starvation, or other possible outcomes. ""The Good Samaritan played a major role in saving theses puppies' lives,"" said animal services Commander Chris Mayer. ""His actions were humane and heroic.""
Riverside County Sheriff's office and the District Attorney are putting together a case for animal cruelty against the woman, who Mayer described as ""despicable.""
""There is no excuse for dumping puppies,"" said the officer. ""Especially in today's age when we or other shelters would be willing to get these animals to foster parents or rescue partners. This was a shameful act.""

Dallas DA says he won't prosecute 'low-level' crimes like theft and felony drug possession,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dallas-da-wont-prosecute-crimes,"Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot has stolen some of the political oxygen in the city, and the state in general, with his new reform measures, even with all the national news going on. But that small theft wouldn't be prosecuted by his office these days: They don't do that anymore.
Creuzot, a Democrat, has angered local and state officials, and importantly police unions, with his decree that his office will no longer be prosecuting what he has non-technically referred to as ""low-level"" crimes. As a recent Dallas Morning News op-ed put it, ""shook"" the people tasked with law enforcement and government. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say he has them ""shook.""
The new agenda for the new district attorney is, he says, aimed at ending ""mass incarceration"" and jail time for ""technical"" violations which aren't a threat to public safety. That includes a lot drug offenses, and although his letter informing the county residents of his overall plan was only published a week ago, he's already dismissed more than 1,000 drug possession cases since taking office this year.
""The changes that I promised will be a step forward in ending mass incarceration in Dallas County, and will make our community safer by ensuring that our limited resources are spent where they can do the most good,"" said Creuzot in the letter. He also specifically covered the drug offenses he has already dismissed.
First-Offense Marijuana Although African Americans and people of other races use marijuana at similar rates, in Dallas County African Americans are three times more likely to be prosecuted for misdemeanor marijuana possession than are people of other races. After arrest, African Americans are assessed money bond at a higher rate for marijuana possession, and are assessed higher bond amounts than other races. African Americans are more likely to be convicted of marijuana possession once charged and are more likely to serve a jail sentence.1
The District Attorney must take action to end that disparity. To that end, I have declined prosecution on misdemeanor possession of marijuana cases for first-time offenders whose offenses do not occur in a drug-free zone, involve the use or exhibition of a deadly weapon, or involve evidence of delivery. After the first offense, people will be offered a program that, if successfully completed, will keep their record clear. I am also in the process of dismissing all pending misdemeanor marijuana cases filed before I took office, according to the new policy stated above. To date, I have dismissed over a thousand misdemeanor marijuana cases. They will likewise decline prosecution on ""State Jail Felony and 3rd Degree Felony Possession of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)"" in first-offender cases matching the above listed criteria.
Also on the no-prosecution docket are some petty theft cases of less than $750, except in cases where the object was financial gain.
Theft of Necessary Items Study after study shows that when we arrest, jail, and convict people for non-violent crimes committed out of necessity, we only prevent that person from gaining the stability necessary to lead a law-abiding life. Criminalizing poverty is counter-productive for our community's health and safety. For that reason, this office will not prosecute theft of personal items less than $750 unless the evidence shows that the alleged theft was for economic gain. Other items include not prosecuting criminal trespass or driving with a suspended license, and no jail time for ""technical"" violations of probation.
His new regime has a lot fans on the Dallas Morning News editorial page, but many fewer in office. Not to mention law enforcement officers. The Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas union has issued a formal statement demanding Creuzot's resignation or removal. (included in full below.)
In it, the union calls Creuzot's plan ""unacceptable,"" and say he ""should be removed"" as the DA. ""When he was campaigning for the office we don't remember not prosecuting crime as part of his platform,"" it reads.
In addition to the letter from the union, six Dallas County police agencies held a joint press conference condemning the DA's policy. The current and former officers said the policy will harm small businesses suffering from small dollar theft, will put families in danger, and will encourage an escalation of crime in the county.
In that persser, Irving police officer and vice-president of the Texas Municipal Police Association Travis Hammond said that Creuzot is ""singlehandedly creating his own version of social engineering.""
Also at the joint press conference, Richardson Police Association Past President Jimmy Holley said Creuzot "" should not be in the position of creating his own Penal Code that he is going to enforce.""
Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings called the policy ""problematic, and said that he told Creuzot he ""probably should've taken this on a case-by-case basis rather than issue some broad policy that really impacts only a very small number of people."" Amid the growing pushback on the plan, Rawlings assured his constiuents that police will continue to enforce the law regardless of the DA's preferences.
City of Dallas police officer and president of the Greater Dallas chapter of the National Latino Law Enforcement Organization Sgt. George Aranda says the policy ""has opened up many windows to allow the common criminal to feast on the business retail community.""
Gov. Greg Abbott, too, has joined in the condemnation, telling Dallas NBC affiliate KXAS that the plan is ""reckless and irresponsible.""
""That is legalizing stealing for property less than $750. What kind of message does that send for one, but for another, listen if your district attorney wants to change the law he is in the wrong job. He needs to run for the legislature and come here to try and change the law,"" said the governor. ""His job, his oath, is to enforce the law that exists and he should prosecute anybody for stealing anything.""
In response to Abbot, Creuzot told WXAS that ""it doesn't make sense to clog up our jails with people who are not a danger to society. We need to focus on criminals who are a threat to our communities and individuals who commit thefts for economic gain.""
Not prosecuting crime may seem an odd plan for a District Attorney, but it is not without its fans . From a Dallas Morning News op-ed:
At last, Texas has an elected official with a comprehensive plan to bring more sensible, humane practices to our justice system. It is no secret that the determinative factor of a person's outcome in the criminal justice system is often the money in his or her pocket. Coupled with the fact that communities of color, which studies show bear the highest burden of poverty, are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement, our justice system has become rife with inequities, from arrest to sentencing to supervision. You can watch the press conference with police representatives condemning the plan, and Creuzot's own announcement outlining his polices, below.

The Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas demand for Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot to be removed:
For Immediate Release
April, 17, 2019
Contact:
George Aranda, President, Dallas NLLEO-CLEAT;
Todd Harrison, President, Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, CLEAT
DALLAS -The Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, CLEAT is calling for the removal of Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot from his newly elected position after he announced he will not prosecute certain crimes.
""While he has announced the retrial of a police officer because he didn't like the result of a jury trial verdict DA John Creuzot has declared he will not follow the law and prosecute certain crimes,"" said Sgt Todd Harrison, President of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, or CLEAT, ""That's unacceptable and he should be removed from office.""
""When he was campaigning for the office we don't remember not prosecuting crime as part of his platform,"" said Harrison.
""I don't think he understands that Dallas Police Officers are sworn to uphold the law. Officers are lawfully bound to answer the calls of citizens and business owners who have suffered a loss. The officers have no choice. Under this scenario we'd have officers risking their lives, enforcing the law, making arrests and protecting Dallas families and businesses only to have a giant double standard applied to their actions,"" said Harrison, an Austin Police Sergeant and 31 year law enforcement veteran.
""Will the Dallas Chief of Police issue a directive that her officers will no longer answer the calls of citizens who are reporting a theft of under $750? Will the officers no longer be responsible for writing these reports? Can a Dallas Police Officer be investigated because of an Internal Affairs complaint for refusal to take a statement of a theft of a certain dollar amount? Will the Chief refuse to discipline or terminate an officer who doesn't make the arrest on one of these cases?""
""It is with great disappointment that DA Creuzot has opened up many windows to allow the common criminal to feast on the business retail community not to mention your everyday stakeholder who will become victims of property theft. LEOs in Dallas County have taken an oath to uphold the law which includes to protect the property of those said citizens. This decision removes a basic crime fighting tool and handcuffs your everyday patrol officer,"" said Sgt. George Aranda, President of the local union Dallas NLLEO-CLEAT, a 27 year veteran of the Dallas Police Department.

What are the details? According to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office , 26-year-old Matthew Erris used his 2007 Chevrolet TrailBlazer — complete with flashing red and blue light bars on the grill and roof — to attempt a traffic stop Tuesday night. But the driver he flagged down was an HCSO undercover detective who refused to pull over.
Instead, while keeping Erris' ""patrol vehicle"" in sight, the detective called 911 to alert actual deputies, who were able to apprehend the suspect a short time later. Officers discovered a ""realistic looking airsoft pistol in a holster beneath the front passenger seat"" when they searched the TrailBlazer.
WFLA-TV reported Erris admitted to installing the lights on his vehicle, saying he used them to get through heavy traffic.
Anything else? Officials are looking into whether Erris has attempted similar stunts before. Anyone who recognizes the vehicle or believes they might have been a victim of the suspect is encouraged to contact the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office at 813-247-8200."
Vermont officially replaces Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/vermont-officially-replaces-columbus-day-with-indigenous-peoples-day,"Vermont has passed a law that officially scraps Columbus Day in favor of an Indigenous Peoples Day on the same date. Maine passed a similar bill in March .
Here's what we know Columbus Day has long been a target of activists due to its namesake's poor treatment of Native American people, particularly during his later exploratory voyages. These activists typically want to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, rather than put that new holiday on a separate day of its own.
Even before this bill was passed, Vermont had been unofficially celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day on the second Monday of October instead of Columbus Day.
""Vermont was founded and built upon lands whose original inhabitants were the Abenaki people and honors them and their ancestors,"" the bill reads . ""The establishment of this holiday will aid in the cultural development of Vermont's recognized tribes, while enabling all indigenous peoples in Vermont and elsewhere to move forward and formulate positive outcomes, from the history of colonization.""
New Mexico, Alaska, Minnesota, and Oregon already have similar laws in place, as do Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle, and several other cities. The first ever celebration of Indigenous Peoples Day occurred in 1992 in Berkeley, California.
Why do we even have a Columbus Day? Italian-American groups, including the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF), have staunchly opposed getting rid of the holiday which initially was founded to celebrate Italian immigrants in America in a similar way to how St. Patrick's Day (in addition to being a day to honor St. Patrick himself) celebrates the Irish.
According to a news release from NIAF "" [w]hen Columbus Day was founded in 1937, the federal holiday provided a sense of dignity and self worth in light of the hostility and discrimination many Italian immigrants, Italians Americans, and Catholics (more broadly) faced.""
One of the early backers of the holiday, Italian immigrant Siro Mangini , pushed the idea of Columbus as the face of the holiday in part because he believed that the explorer would be the ""one Italian [that] Americans would not throw rocks at ."""
Philadelphia Flyers remove Kate Smith statue over racially insensitive songs she sang in early 1930s,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/philadelphia-flyers-scrap-kate-smith-statue,"On the heels of the New York Yankees pulling late singer Kate Smith's rendition of ""God Bless America"" after the team learned she sang racially insensitive songs in the early 1930s, the Philadelphia Flyers on Sunday removed a statue of Smith outside the team's arena for the same reason.
And members of Smith's family — who didn't find out about the move until KYW-TV told them — are outraged at the Flyers. The team also said Smith's ""God Bless America"" no longer would be played at games and has been erased from its library.
Image source: KYW-TV video screenshot
""I'm appalled,"" Suzy Andron, Smith's niece, told the station Sunday evening with her husband Bob Andron at her side.

""Aunt Katherine was probably one of the kindest people I've ever met,"" Suzy Andron added to KYW. ""She was certainly anything but a prejudice[d] person. She loved everybody.""
All that's left now is the base upon which Smith's statue stood. Check out the news report:
Kate Smith's Family Disgusted With Flyers After Removal Of Statue youtu.be
What's the background? Smith's iconic version of ""God Bless America"" — penned by Irving Berlin and introduced during a 1938 radio program — became a second national anthem in the face of Adolf Hitler's rise to power and Nazi Germany's global threat.
Kate Smith paints message 'To Hitler from Kate' on side torpedo at a U.S. Navy submarine base in New London, Connecticut, circa 1943. Photo by FPG/Archive Photos/Getty Images
""At the height of her career, during World War II, she repeatedly was named one of the three or four most popular women in America,"" Smith's 1986 New York Times obituary reads. ""No single show-business figure even approached her as a seller of War Bonds during World War II. In one 18-hour stint on the CBS radio network, Miss Smith sold $107 million worth of war bonds, which were issued by the United States Government to finance the war effort. Her total for a series of marathon broadcasts was over $600 million.""
Smith and Berlin both waived royalties for ""God Bless America,"" which go to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations, her obit noted. President Ronald Reagan awarded Smith the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1982.
The Flyers and Smith share a long history, as the team used her recorded version of ""God Bless America"" before regular season and playoff games during the early 1970s. The Flyers also had Smith come to Philadelphia to sing ""God Bless America"" in person. The Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975, and Smith had been the team's good luck charm ever since.
Image source: KYW-TV video screenshot
But other lyrics Smith sang led the team to cut ties with her.
She sang ""Pickaninny Heaven,"" dedicating it in a 1933 video to ""colored children"" in a New York City orphanage. The song is about a place with ""great big watermelons,"" ""pork chop bushes,"" and where ""old Black Joe is their Santa Claus."" She also sang 1931's ""That's Why Darkies Were Born,"" which noted that ""someone had to pick the cotton / someone had to pick the corn / someone had to slave and be able to sing / that's why darkies were born."" The latter tune was considered satire at the time, the New York Daily News said , adding the black civil rights figure Paul Robeson also sang it.
In response, the Flyers on Friday covered Smith's statue in black material.
Image source: KYW-TV video screenshot
The team followed that move by removing the statue altogether, saying in a ratioed Twitter statement — in which responses outnumber likes — that ""we cannot stand idle while material from another era gets in the way of who we are today.""
What else did Smith's family have to say? Suzy Andron added to KYW that the Flyers ""need to go back and look back at your own history ... and what Aunt Katherine gave to that team freely. Freely! She was so proud that she was their mascot.""
Bob Andron also told the station that ""we need the words and the song of 'God Bless America' singing loud again.""
What did a notable sportswriter have to say about the Smith flap? Longtime sportswriter and commentator Jason Whitlock said those who ""blackmailed"" the Yankees into ending Smith's ""God Bless America"" are ""trying to sow seeds of division and undermining American pride under the bogus pretense that they're promoting racial harmony.""

Karimah Guion-Pledgure, who is black, filed a lawsuit in January that accused the county of fostering a racially insensitive environment, The Oregonian reported. The lawsuit alleged that the Blue Lives Matter flag ""demeans"" and ""denigrates"" the Black Lives Matter movement. The complainant had worked as a corrections technician with the Department of Community Justice since 2011, according to The Oregonian.
Guion-Pledgure and other black coworkers allegedly complained to supervisors after a probation officer had hung the flag above their desk in September 2017. The lawsuit claimed that the woman's supervisors refused to force her fellow employee to take it down.
On Thursday, the Multnomah County commissioners approved the settlement on the condition that Guion-Pledgure drops the lawsuit against the county and that she resigns from her position, according to her attorneys. Her resignation took effect Friday. However, she is eligible to apply for future positions at the county.
What's the story? Guion-Pledgure claimed that six months after she initially complained, the Blue Lives Matter flag was still up, according to the Portland Mercury .
At that point, she created an ""equity wall"" featuring photos of minorities who were killed by law enforcement officers.
When asked by management to remove the photo collage, she refused, citing that the Blue Lives Matter flag was still in place.
""The Black Lives Matter movement was started to call attention to the disproportionate policing and killing of Black people by law enforcement,"" the lawsuit purported, according to the Mercury. ""The 'Blue Lives Matter' sign co-opts that racial justice movement's slogan, repurposes it to shift focus to law enforcement — a chosen profession, not a racial identity — and thus denigrates, dilutes, and demeans the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement.""
About a week later, management imposed a new rule that personal photos could be no larger than 5-by-7 inches.
On the same day, Guion-Pledgure claimed that she found two post-it notes on her display wall, one said, ""Thanks a lot,"" and the other read, ""Bitch,"" according to the lawsuit.
""By that time, several other coworkers began hanging additional 'Blue Lives Matter' flags around the office,"" the lawsuit stated.
After the new rule, many resized their flags and kept them on display.
The county ""continued to expose Guion-Pledgure to a racially offensive and combative work environment,"" the lawsuit claimed.
Guion-Pledgure missed a lot of work because of the stress she endured, according to her attorney Ashlee Albies.
""She's disappointed that she has to leave there and that they couldn't make it a safe and welcoming work environment,"" Albies told the Oregonian.
What did the county say? County spokeswoman Jessica Morkert-Shibley told the Oregonian that Blue Lives Matter flags, photos, or other displays, such as the collage featuring black people killed by law enforcement, would no longer be permitted under the Department of Community Justice's new policy.
""We are currently working on a countywide policy addressing this issue,"" Morkert-Shibley said.
Personal family photos are still permitted, at this point, she added.
What else? The lawsuit originally sought $420,000.
The settlement agreement is a sign that the ""DCJ needs to get itself in order,"" Albies told the Mercury.
""Both [Guion-Pledgure] and I hope this is the beginning of ... addressing these issues that have been plaguing the county for years now,"" she added."
Churchgoers disarm gun-toting woman carrying a baby after she threatened to blow them up,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/churchgoers-tackle-armed-woman-with-baby,"A woman holding a baby and brandishing a gun was subdued by parishioners at a church in San Diego after she threatened to blow up their church.
Here's what we know Church Tsidkenu is a nondenominational church that rents out space in San Diego's Mt. Everest Academy. During its Easter Sunday service, a woman in her early 30s walked to the front of the church carrying a 10-month-old baby and a gun, and ""made threats that she was going to blow up the church while waving the handgun,"" according to local police.
Church parishioners were able to disarm the woman and hold her until police arrived. Her gun was not loaded.
""She was saying stuff that was kind of delusional. I was more worried about getting my family out of there,"" churchgoer Ronald Farmer told CNN .
Police searched the building with a bomb detection dog, but did not find anything.
According to the police report, ""In addition to the 10 month old baby at the scene, the suspect's 5 year old daughter was located during a follow-up and was found to be healthy and unhurt. Both children have been taken into protective custody and will be evaluated by Child Welfare Services.""
What else? The church's name comes from one of the Hebrew names for God in the Old Testament: Jehovah Tsidkenu, which is often translated as the Lord Who is our Righteousness. It is used twice in the book of Jeremiah.
In a tweet from late Saturday night, San Diego Chief of Police David Nisleit said that his department was increasing ""patrols at houses of worship"" in light of the attacks against Christians in Sri Lanka.
The woman is being charged with making criminal threats and ""displaying a handgun in a threatening manner."""
President Trump sends special gift to student whose teacher allegedly banned her from choosing Trump as 'hero' for school project,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-letter-student-hero-project,"The Long Island sixth-grader, who made national headlines earlier this month after her middle school teacher reportedly prevented her from selecting President Donald Trump as a ""hero"" for a school project, just received a very special gift from the president himself.
What's the background? When selecting a ""hero"" on which to conduct a class research project, Bella Moscato's sixth-grade teacher reportedly shut down her plan of picking Trump. The teacher rationalized her decision by telling young Bella that Trump ""spreads negativity and says bad stuff about women.""
Instead, the teacher suggested Bella select a different president like former President Barack Obama. Bella said the suggestion made her angry.
The teacher's alleged actions, which Bella's school district denied having occurred, outraged Bella's parents.
""My daughter has every right to do and pick a hero of her choice. It's a First Amendment right, freedom of speech, freedom of expression,"" Bella's mom, Valerie Moscato, told a local news station. ""So it was really upsetting to me that [the teacher] was trying to shut her down.""
Meanwhile, Bella's dad, Arthur Moscato, said at a local school board meeting the teacher's alleged actions ""incensed"" him.
What did Trump send? On Friday, Valerie Moscato revealed Trump sent Bella a personal letter thanking the 11-year-old for her support.
The letter, written on official White House letterhead and included Trump's personal signature, read:
Dear Bella,
I was honored to learn that you selected me as your hero for a school project. Your heartfelt and longstanding support means a great deal to me.
I am proud of you for standing up for yourself. Everyone deserves to receive the same care and respect we give ourselves. I encourage you to always be yourself and keep making your voice heard. There is no one else like you, and our country's bright future relies upon your leadership!
The First Lady and I send our best wishes to you and your family. God Bless you.
Sincerely,
Donald J. Trump.
Included in the package were other White House memorabilia."
Trump-supporting BBQ food truck sells anti-PC shirts redefining 'LGBTQ' — and the liberal outrage mob pounces,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kentucky-bbq-truck-lgbtq-shirts,"A Kentucky barbecue food joint is facing the wrath of the liberal outrage mob online after the business began selling T-shirts redefining the meaning of ""LGBTQ.""
What happened? Traditionally, the ""LGBTQ"" acronym is an ode to marginalized sexual identities. But Belle's Smoking BBQ, which operates out of a food truck, recently began selling T-shirts that radically redefine what LGBTQ means.
Instead of ""lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer,"" the shirts say: ""I support LGBTQ: Liberty, Guns, Bible, Trump, BBQ.""
Image source: WXIX-TV screenshot
Restaurant owner Jamie Smith told the Courier Journal that he and his workers have worn the shirts for more than a year and a half now, but only received backlash after he advertised the merchandise on social media, which triggered an avalanche of progressive indignation.
Smith said that within just hours of posting the shirt online, social media ""went berserk."" Then came the threatening calls, of which Smith said he fielded ""about 30.""
The attention forced Smith to delete the Facebook post advertising the shirts, where he later posted an apology.
""Belle's Smoking BBQ apologizes if we have offended any groups, organizations or individuals with our shirts. We respect all beliefs and lifestyles and want no ill will towards anyone,"" the statement said. ""We know each person has their own thoughts and beliefs but we are hurt that the people who are saying, 'stop the hate' are the ones coming at us with the harassing messages and threatening phone calls. Again we apologize for any hurt feelings and thank our supporters who truly know us.""
Smith told WXIX-TV he did not intend to offend anyone, but said he felt the need to take a ""stand"" for his values.
""At the end of the day, we have to stand for what we believe in. And like I said, if this has offended anyone, that wasn't our intention,"" Smith said. ""But, it's just a good play on words.""
How well did the T-shirts sell? According to WXIX, Smith has sold his entire inventory of shirts and already has a back order for more.
And while one customer — a local church — cancelled their food order over the controversy, Smith said the attention has already earned him four new customers."
"Warren touts $1.25 trillion plan to forgive student loan debt, provide universal 'free' college",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/warren-touts-1-25-trillion-plan-to-forgive-student-loan-debt-provide-universal-free-college,"Far-left tub-thumper and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has rolled out another progressive policy initiative: A plan for cancelling most student loan debt while providing universal ""free"" college to Americans at the cost of $1.25 trillion over 10 years.
What are the details? Warren spelled out the details of her proposal in a post on Medium , where she argued that student loan debt is ""crushing millions of families and acting as an anchor on our economy.""
To fix the problem, Warren wants to forgive 95 percent of the student loan debt carried in the U.S, with ""a one-time cost to the government of $640 billion."" According to the Democrat, ""experts also conclude that my plan will likely provide a boost to the economy through 'consumer-driven economic stimulus,'"" and ""help close the racial wealth gap.""
But Warren doesn't stop there. The Massachusetts senator wants to implement a Universal Free College program, bringing ""the total cost of the program to roughly $1.25 trillion over ten years.""
To those who might experience sticker shock glancing at the numbers, Warrens assures her readers, ""The actual costs of these new ideas are likely to be even less than that.""
Warren adds, ""Some people will say we can't afford this plan. That's nonsense. The entire cost of my broad debt cancellation plan and universal free college is more than covered by my Ultra-Millionaire Tax — a 2 percent annual tax on the 75,000 families with $50 million or more in wealth.""
Warren's plan would also establish a $50 billion (minimum) fund for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions, ""ban for-profit colleges from receiving any federal dollars,"" and ""prohibit public colleges from considering citizenship status or criminal history in admissions decisions.""
Anything else? According to Politico , Warren's student debt forgiveness plan is the latest attempt by the candidate to position herself further left than Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who ""continues to easily lead Warren in the polls and fundraising.""
Sanders introduced the College for All Act in 2017, which called for student loan refinancing, ""but,"" Politico notes, ""Warren's proposal on existing student loan debt goes beyond that of Sanders."""
WATCH: Video shows unborn twins throwing punches in the womb,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-unborn-twins-fight-in-womb,"Siblings roughhousing with each other is a universal tale as old as time. And a video shows that it can even start before those siblings ever see the light of day.
According to iHeart Radio , the video from a hospital in China shows a pair of unborn twin sisters who started throwing punches in their mother's womb in December. The two are face to face before one throws the first punch and, well, the rest is fairly easy to predict.
The girls' father, Tao, said that he laughed when the nurse caught the rare moment on the ultrasound, according to the U.K Mirror : ""When we saw this video, it was a big surprise to us.""
Twin sisters seen 'fighting' in their mother's womb in ultrasound #NewsTrends www.youtube.com
While the video and the prenatal altercation may be cute to watch, the condition that allowed for them to happen can also be dangerous, the director of the hospital's prenatal center, told the British outlet: ""It can be dangerous because it is like the twins are growing in the same 'room' when normally twins develop in two 'rooms.'""
""Monoamniotic twins,"" or twins who share the same amniotic sac, is a rare phenomenon affecting only a small percentage of twin pregnancies and can be very dangerous. For example, a 2013 news release from Stanford University explained, the children's umbilical cords can become entangled and cut off blood flow.
""Having a set of monoamniotic twins can be dangerous and unpredictable,"" Dr. Susan Crowe said in the news release. ""With no membrane dividing them, the obstetrician has to balance the risk of prematurity with the risk of a cord event.""
Despite the risks, the Mirror reported, the twins in this video were born happy and healthy earlier this month, and their parents have nicknamed them ""Cherry"" and ""Strawberry."""
'Absolutely pathetic': Teacher allegedly blasts second-grader's 'sad' math drill — and a petition is calling for her firing,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-allegedly-blasts-childs-math-drill,"A Pennsylvania teacher allegedly wrote on a second-grade student's quiz that it was ""absolutely pathetic"" and ""sad"" that the student finished only 13 subtraction problems in three minutes, Fox News reported — and now a petition sporting nearly 17,000 signatures as of Monday afternoon is calling for the teacher's firing.
Chris R. Piland noted the issue on his Facebook page , saying his son's teacher ""has been so rude to him and myself all year"" and that he's ""beyond frustrated that someone would write this on a child's work.""
What does the school district have to say? Superintendent Rose Minniti of the Valley View School District in Archibald — which is just north of Scranton — became aware of the issue last week, the Associated Press said , adding that officials met with the teacher, Alyssa Rupp Bohenek, and are investigating the incident.
""It's a personnel issue, and the results of that are not going to be dictated by social media,"" Minniti told the AP. ""It's going to be dictated by the facts and evidence."" The outlet said attempts to reach Bohenek were unsuccessful.
The school board and solicitor are aware of the situation but cannot discuss personnel issues, the AP said, adding that a school board member noted that Valley View ""takes any kind of a situation like this very seriously.""
Bohenek was hired as an elementary school teacher in 2013 and earned $50,544 in the 2016-17 school year, the outlet said.
""As always with everything, we're going to try to do what's best for the students and what we need to do for the employee under investigation,"" Minniti added to the AP.
What else does the petition say? The petition says Bohenek ""thinks it's OK to bully and talk down to her students, and needs to be removed."" Petition signers were quite clear about where they stand:
""My daughter attends Valley View school[;] if a teacher were talk to or write something like this on her paper I would be out for blood. I don't speak to my kids like that[;] over my dead body with someone else."" ""I'm so ashamed[;] I'm an alumni. She needs to be FIRED! The is unacceptable to write on a child's paper. Period."" ""I don't even have a child and this is sickening to me. This is so beyond unprofessional and just wrong."" A counter-petition is out there, too A counter-petition wants Bohenek to stay on the job and has attracted more than 800 signatures. Some of the comments include:
""The parents should be ASHAMED of themselves. Do they think they have no part in helping to elevate their child's education[?]"" ""I'm sick and tired of these kids being coddled these days. She didn't call him stupid, dumb, etc., she called it what it was — pathetic! We need more teachers like her!"" ""She was just doing her job. That snowflake parent couldn't handle the truth. What a melt. It would be unjust for the teacher to lose her job. She deserves her job. Suspend the kid instead."""
Social Security costs to outweigh income by next year; benefits may be cut by 2035,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/social-security-costs-to-outweigh-income-by-next-year-by-2035-if-nothing-changes-benefits-will-have-to-be-cut,"According to a report from the Social Security Administration, the program's cost will exceed its income in 2020 . If nothing changes by 2035, Social Security will be unable to continue to pay full benefits.
What does the report say? According a new report released Monday by the board of trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds, which oversees Social Security, ""Social Security's total cost is projected to be less than its total income in 2019 and higher than its total income in 2020 and all later years.""
This report also said that beginning in 2020, ""the dollar amount of the hypothetical combined trust fund reserves declines until reserves become depleted in 2035."" The Disability Insurance Trust Fund reserves would run out completely by 2052.
Of course, these projections only apply if the system itself continues unchanged, with income and expenditures going exactly as predicted. Part of the purpose of this report was for Congress to work to ""address the projected trust fund shortfalls in a timely way in order to phase in necessary changes gradually and give workers and beneficiaries time to adjust to them.""
The amount of revenue that the Social Security Administration raises in taxes compared to the amount it pays out in benefits continues to shrink as the baby boomer generation retires.
The funds raised by the program go into a Treasury Department Trust Fund. The Treasury then issues bonds to the Social Security Administration, which the Social Security Administration assures taxpayers are ""backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government"" and ""just as safe as U.S. Savings Bonds or other financial instruments of the Federal government.""
However, since the money in these trust funds is also being spent on other government projects, critics have accused the whole system of being built on IOUs ."
"Impeachment is the 'best thing that could happen' to Pres. Trump, Giuliani says",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/impeachment-is-the-best-thing-that-could-happen-to-pres-trump-giuliani-says,"President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Democrats can impeach the president at their own risk, because it would work out great politically, according to the New York Daily News .
What does he mean? Giuliani believes that whether Democrats choose to impeach or not impeach, President Trump still wins. If they don't, he proceeds as normal toward his 2020 reelection effort. If they do, they'll just boost the incumbent in the election.
""They can do it if they want to,"" Giuliani said. ""Would it politically be the best thing that could happen to the president? Absolutely.""
""[Pelosi] is worried about it because it's going to make the president look like a victim,"" Giuliani also said. ""If they start an impeachment, the American people will quickly see it's a political witch hunt and it would make the president a victim.""
Russian collusion 'not a crime?' Giuliani said even if the Trump campaign had accepted help from Russians leading up to the 2016 election, referencing the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, that isn't a crime or an impeachable offense. Is it morally right? That's for someone else to decide, said Giuliani.
""Would I have counseled as a lawyer, 'don't do it,' because someone can make it look bad — yes, absolutely,"" Giuliani said. ""But is it illegal? No. Is it wrong? I don't know, let someone else figure that out. You don't impeach someone for doing something wrong...Every president has done something wrong.""
Pelosi presents other options: Pelosi wrote a letter to her Democratic colleagues Monday reminding them that impeachment was not the only potential response to the Mueller report.
""It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the President accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings,"" Pelosi wrote. ""As we proceed to uncover the truth and present additional needed reforms to protect our democracy, we must show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice, strictly on the presentation of fact."""
Students want Yale to disarm campus police and donate to Black Lives Matter in response to shooting,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/students-want-yale-to-disarm-campus-police-and-donate-to-black-lives-matter-in-response-to-shooting,"Students at Yale University are petitioning for the disarmament of campus police after officers shot and injured a woman who was a passenger in a vehicle police believed to have been connected to an attempted armed robbery, according to Campus Reform .
The shooting, which occurred near the campus, has sparked days of protests in the streets by some who believe the woman and the driver of the vehicle were unfairly targeted due to their race.
What does the petition say? ""Armed campus police are a risk to the students they are sworn to protect and to the communities in which schools reside. There is an epidemic of police violence and police brutality in this country, and this shooting all too tragically shows that Yale is not immune to this issue. We will not allow the Yale Police Department to contribute to this epidemic by acting violently against members of the community that we have chosen from all over this country and the world.""
Petitioners want campus police disarmed and for the university to donate to Black Lives Matter.
How did the shooting happen? On April 16 , police got a report about an armed robbery attempt on a news delivery man at a gas station. A Hamden Police Officer and a Yale Police Officer stopped what they believed was the suspect's vehicle.
Police opened fire on the vehicle, reportedly in response to the driver, Paul Witherspoon, exiting abruptly. The passenger, Stephanie Washington, was hit and sustained injuries. The two involved officers have been placed on administrative leave.
See footage of the incident in the video below:

Multiple protests: Protesters have posted outside Yale University President Paul Salovey's house, and Black Lives Matter members have protested outside the Hartford Police Department hoping to speak with the chief or another high-ranking officer about their concerns.
Yale's statement: The University issued the following statement about this situation:
""Yale police officers are trained to interact with community members in a respectful and professional manner. Many of our officers are from the New Haven community, and all of them take great pride in how they engage with the community, both on and off duty….Yale is fully cooperating in the investigation [conducted by the Connecticut State Police and Attorney's Office], and we will share publicly whatever information we can as quickly as we can."""

The announcement is a swift reversal from last week , when Cain insisted he would stay the course through the White House vetting process in hopes of becoming an eventual member of the Board of Governors.
 President Trump tweeted Monday, ""My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board. I will respect his wishes. Herman is a great American who truly loves our Country!""
Last week, Cain told the Wall Street Journal he was ""very committed"" to remaining in the running despite rumors to the contrary, and reiterated to the Fox Business Network that backing out was ""not in [his] nature,"" The Hill reported.
Anything else? Analysts have speculated for weeks that Cain would bow out after four Republican senators publicly announced they would not support his nomination, and an alleged former mistress threatened to ""identify certain parts of Mr. Cain's body"" to the Senate Banking Committee if he didn't withdraw his name from the running. Cain was also still dogged by old allegations of sexual harassment by multiple women, which were — at least in part — responsible for the downfall of his 2011 presidential bid.
Critics, including Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), claimed Cain was too political for the Fed role and not experienced enough in economics. According to the Washington Post , Cain ""has supported controversial ideas such as a return to the gold standard system the United States abandoned nearly a half-century ago,"" noting, ""the system would have made it almost impossible for the central bank to undertake many of the rescue measures it did during and after the 2008-2009 financial crisis.""
But supporters touted the former Godfather's Pizza CEO's tenure of serving on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's board of directors, and several Republicans have called for a diversity in perspectives on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors."

On Friday, authorities took Larry Hopkins into custody on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm, according to a news release . The FBI said it found firearms during a visit to his home in 2017 while investigating allegations of ""militia extremist activity,"" Reuters reported.
Hopkins, who's also known as Johnny Horton Jr., appeared Monday in a Las Cruces courtroom. His attorney, Kelly O'Connell, told Reuters that Hopkins would plead not guilty to the charges.
O'Connell pointed out that the charges were unrelated to the UCP's border patrol efforts, which have made recent headlines .
""This is not even dealing with what's going on right here,"" O'Connell said.
What's the story from 2017? Witnesses accused Hopkins' group of planning to assassinate former president Barack Obama, 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and George Soros, according to the complaint, Reuters reported.
The federal agency said it had information at the time that that 20-member group was armed with weapons, including AK-47 rifles.
During its 2017 investigation of the claims, FBI agents recovered nine firearms from Hopkins' Flora Vista, New Mexico, home.
Hopkins had at least one prior felony conviction, which prevents him from possessing firearms or ammunition, according to the FBI. In 2006, he was convicted for impersonating a peace officer and felony possession of a firearm. Ten years earlier, he was convicted on a firearms charge.
Hopkins claimed that the weapons were owned by his common-law wife, according to the complaint.
What else? UCP claims it has stopped thousands of migrants trying to enter the U.S. before turning them over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. Its members are armed and wear camouflage uniforms while on patrol along the border.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said during a town hall in New York City that she thought people needed to stop talking about fixing the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA, she argued, ""provides some of the highest quality care to our veterans"" and ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""
What did she say? According to video footage from the event,
There are some things that you're hearing today. There are some themes that we've got coming out, especially when it comes to the VA. All I can think of is that classic refrain that my parents always taught me growing up, is that: ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Exactly. Don't fix it.
...That is the opening and approach that we have seen when it comes to privatization, is the idea that this thing that isn't broken. This thing that provides some of the highest quality care to our veterans, somehow needs to be fixed, optimized, tinkered with, until we don't even recognize it anymore. She then accused lawmakers of only trying to fix the VA to benefit pharmaceutical and insurance companies, and the for-profit health care industry.
What about the VA problems?
In March 2014 , former Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned after the department's own inspector general determined that VA officials had falsified records to mask the fact that veterans were being made to wait on average 115 days for an initial appointment at a Phoenix medical center. At least 35 of the veterans seeking care at this facility died while on waiting lists. And while Phoenix was particularly plagued with problems, similar issues were happening at VA facilities across the nation.
A week before Shinseki was fired, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told CBS News that ""someone has to be accountable"" for what was going on in the VA, although he said he did not think Shinseki should be that person.
A report by The Associated Press in May 2015 found that even after Shinseki stepped down and promises were made to reform the department, one in 36 veterans (roughly 894,000) had to wait at least a month for an appointment at VA facilities across the country, and almost 232,000 had to wait more than 60 days.
A report by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel from January 2017 found that the Phoenix location ""continues to struggle with significant patient wait times."""

 Last month, Cummings issued a letter to New York accounting firm Mazars USA asking for all financial statements, reports, communications, and other items ""with respect to Donald J. Trump, Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, the Trump Organization Inc., the Trump Organization LLC, the Trump Corporation, DJT Holdings LLC, the Trump Old Post Office LLC, the Trump Foundation, and any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, joint venture, predecessor, or successor"" dating back to Jan. 1, 2009.
The committee chairman explained the move was prompted by testimony from former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who alleged ""that President Trump changed the estimated value of his assets and liabilities on financial statements prepared by"" Mazars.
Mazars responded that it ""cannot voluntarily turn over the documents."" So, Cummings issued a subpoena to Mazars in an attempt to force the firm to hand over their client's confidential records.
Ranking member Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) condemned the chairman's actions beforehand, calling the move ""an unprecedented abuse of the Committee's subpoena authority to target and expose the private financial information of the President of the United States.""
On Monday, the president, his business entities, and his revocable trust sued Cummings and the chief investigative counsel of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform to stop the order, arguing the subpoena ""lacks any legislative purpose, is an abuse of power, and is just another example of overreach by the president's political opponents."" Mazars was also named as a defendant ""to ensure that Plaintiffs can obtain effective relief.""
Personal Trump attorney Jay Sekulow issued a statement promising, ""We will not allow congressional presidential harassment to go unanswered,"" Fox News reported.
How did Cummings respond? According to NBC News , Cummings responded to the lawsuit Monday afternoon by saying the president ""has a long history of trying to use baseless lawsuits to attack his adversaries, but there is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress."""
"'Simply inexcusable': Mom sentenced after running over son, 9, while trying to shake him loose of car door handle in school parking lot",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-sentenced-after-running-over-son-while-trying-to-shake-him-loose-of-car-door,"A mother heard her sentence in a Michigan courtroom Thursday after an incident last December in which she used her car to shake loose her 9-year-old son's grip on the door handle in a school parking lot and then ran over him, fracturing his skull and breaking multiple bones, WZZM-TV reported .
Tiffany Kosakowski of Belmont was sentenced to 30 days in jail — which she can serve on weekends — and placed her on probation for five years, the station said.
""It is simply inexcusable what you did,"" Kent County Circuit Court Judge Curt Benson told her, WZZM reported.

Kosakowski pleaded guilty in February to reckless driving causing serious injury for the December 2018 incident outside Chandler Woods Charter Academy, the station said.
What happened?
Kosakowski, 36, dropped off her son Julian at the school, MLive said , and told him to go back when he ran to her car. She told investigators that the boy continued to walk alongside her car as she drove, WZZM noted, citing a court document that said she ""admitted to moving the steering wheel from left to right, then accelerating the vehicle knowing [her son] continued to be next to the vehicle.""
MLive said that as she drove off, her son held to the door handle nearly 50 yards before he lost his grip and fell under a back tire. He now requires constant care and physical therapy, WZZM said.
The rear wheel went over his ""full body, full head,"" the judge said, according to MLive, adding that ""your little boy has suffered terribly.""
What did the boy's father have to say?
Benson sentenced Kosakowski after hearing from the boy's father, John Rodriguez, who hadn't seen his son in the 5 years prior to seeing him in a coma at a hospital, the station said.
""His head covered in wires [and] tubes and sensors in his mouth and all over his little body,"" Rodriguez said, according to WZZM.
Image source: WZZM-TV video screenshot
Rodriguez said he tried ""for years"" to intervene regarding Kosakowski's behavior, saying it's been ""so unstable, so irrational, and so reckless.""
He added that his son was found on the pavement in a pool of blood and will never be the same after a traumatic brain injury, MLive said: ""Doctor's words: 'Your son is forever changed.' He must grow into his disability.""
What did the mother have to say? ""I just want to express that I am remorseful,"" she told the court, MLive said. ""I'll have to live with this for the rest of my life.""

She added: ""All I care about is being there for my son as he recovers and supporting him every day as I have been doing,"" WZZM reported.
What else did the judge say?
The judge said he received 30 letters supporting Kosakowski but added a caveat: ""Of the 30 people who wrote the letters, I'll be quite blunt with you: I am not sure all of them would be as supportive, if they, like I, watched the security footage of this incident which is simply inexcusable,"" Benson said. ""It was really hard to watch, and I am not sure you would enjoy as much support as you evidently do, had that been widely distributed.""
Benson said serving her sentence on weekends will enable her to take her son to his doctor's appointments, WZZM reported.
""He's still your little boy, and he still loves his mother,"" Benson added, according to MLive.
Kosakowski's parental rights will be determined in a separate case in front of a different judge, WZZM said, adding that the boy and his sister are in a relative's custody.

The Trump administration might finally let the market decide how many cherries belong in pie,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-fda-frozen-cherry-pies,"How many cherries belong in frozen cherry pies? For the last few decades, the federal government has answered that question instead of the consumers of convenient desserts — but that may change soon.
According to a report published by The Associated Press on Saturday, recent emails show that the Food and Drug Administration plans to join in the Trump administration's sweeping deregulation agenda and start rolling back decades-old rules on frozen cherry pies this week.
Currently, the quality standards for frozen cherry pies say that the desserts must contain at least 25 percent cherries by weight and that no more than 15 percent of the cherries in a particular pie can be blemished.
A recent post from HotAir's Jazz Shaw pointed how the FDA has set standards like these for some foods, but not others: ""There are all sorts of pies out there on the market and they don't have similar regulations. Why should your pumpkin pie be made of less than 25% pumpkin?""
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tweeted his pleasure in response to the news: ""This is good news for business owners burdened by the federal government's excessive and outdated regulations.""
Lee Sanders of the American Bakers Association told the AP that, while she wants to see the old rules rolled back, she doesn't expect deregulation to have that much of an effect on the market.
""I feel confident our members are producing cherry pies with more than enough cherries,"" she told the outlet.
In a free market with the kind of robust competition that can be found in the freezer section, consumers are the ultimate arbiters of how much fruit filling a particular baked good should contain.
If someone wants a pie that contains less than 25 percent cherries by weight, that's their prerogative. If someone wants a value option cherry that costs less because it contains more than 15 percent blemished cherries, that's also up to them. If the quality of a particular frozen pie drops below what its previous buyers will tolerate, they can expect to lose business and will have to change course if they want it back.
The report also notes that it's considering relaxing the rules for French dressing, a plan that is expected to come out in May."
Surprising new poll shows how many Americans believe Mueller report had evidence of obstruction of justice,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-on-obstruction-of-justice,"A new poll shows that a surprising percentage of Americans believe the Mueller report has evidence of obstruction of justice, despite the denials from President Donald Trump.
A narrow majority of 53 percent of Americans who knew about the release of the report believe there is evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, the poll from Harris X/The Hill shows.
Another 47 percent said they didn't believe special counsel Mueller reported evidence of obstruction of justice.
The report has been at the center of a fiery debate since it was released in a redacted form. The president and his allies say it exonerates him completely, while the Democrats and other critics of the president say it leaves the issue of impeachment up to the Congress.
However, when the question is asked of all respondents, not just those who had heard of the release of the Mueller report, they are evenly divided.
Half of all respondents believe there is evidence of obstruction while another half believe there is not evidence of obstruction.
While a few Democrats have called for the president to be impeached, the Democratic establishment and leadership have cautioned against acting too rashly.

Jussie Smollett's brother says actor has suffered from 'night terrors' since the alleged attack,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/jussie-smollett-brother-night-terrors,"The brother of Jussie Smollett said in a lengthy BET essay that he's seen him experience ""night terrors"" in the wake of a racist, homophobic attack the ""Empire"" actor claimed he suffered in January — but for which Chicago police said Smollett actually orchestrated for personal gain.
""Jussie is as strong as iron, but following an attack like this, there is a normal and natural amount of post trauma that mostly anyone should expect to suffer,"" older brother Jojo Smollett wrote in the essay published over the weekend. ""I have literally seen him violently awakening from night terrors, following the assault. Some of my siblings, as well as Jussie's partner and closest friends have seen similar things.""
Here's a portion of Jussie Smollett's interview with ABC News' Robin Roberts prior to his arrest:
Jussie Smollett: 'I'm pissed off' at people who question attack youtu.be
What's the background? Smollett claimed a pair of masked attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" 2016 campaign slogan — put a noose around his neck, and poured a substance that smelled like bleach on him while beating him in a Chicago street around 2 a.m. Jan. 29 in near zero temperatures.
But police arrested Smollett in February, accusing him of staging the entire thing and paying two black men to help him pull it off. In fact, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who also is black, tore into Smollett after the actor's arrest and said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""
CPD Supt. Johnson: Smollett took advantage of pain and anger of racism to promote his career youtu.be
Smollett pleaded not guilty to 16 counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report — and then in a shocking move, prosecutors dropped all charges against Smollett in late March. In addition, a "" judge granted a motion to seal the case ,"" and a Smollett spokesman said the actor's "" record will be fully expunged .""
That didn't stop Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel from angrily blasting the decision to drop Smollett's charges and saying the move was ""not on the level"" and a ""whitewash of justice.""
Chicago Mayor On Smollett: 'This Was A Whitewash Of Justice' | NBC News youtu.be
Emanuel promised to send a bill to Smollett for the investigative work Chicago authorities took on in relation to his case, and when he missed the deadline to pay the $130,000 bill earlier this moth, the city said it was suing the actor .
Meanwhile, it was widely reported that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case after rumblings that she interfered in the investigation — but then it came to light that she never actually recused herself at all .

In the aftermath, associations from every police department in Cook County announced "" no confidence "" in Foxx, and the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association accused her of making ""repeated misleading and deceptive statements to the public"" and having ""failed in her most fundamental ethical obligations to the public.""
Dueling rallies over Jussie Smollett case held near Kim Foxx's Loop office youtu.be
In response Foxx wondered whether racism and sexism was behind criticism she was been receiving.
What else did Smollett's brother say? ""Within less than three months, [Jussie's] life has been turned upside down as my family and I have witnessed him endure unrelenting attacks to his character and reputation,"" Jojo Smollett wrote. ""Like so many others, this entire process quickly devolved from a focus on him as a victim of assault, to him being falsely accused and held responsible for a crime that was perpetrated against him. To define this experience as unjust would be an understatement.""
He added amid his staunch defense of his brother, ""Simply ask yourself this, 'What if Jussie is telling the truth?'""
More from the essay:
I was shocked at how easily everyone accepted the ridiculous motive about Jussie's career that was promulgated. Jussie had actually begun directing episodes of Empire , which brought additional compensation. He worked out a deal with Fox to own 100% of his music masters, released an album, which lead to a sold out world tour and he donated every cent of ticket sales to charity. He even signed the group, June's Diary, to his label. My brother was developing two films with one of the biggest producers in Hollywood, had the lead to a Broadway show on the table and owns the option rights to the authorized autobiography of his idol, Alvin Ailey. All pointing to not only an advancing career but a business savvy mind. To suggest that he staged his own attack to boost a sagging career is ludicrous. Jussie has a team of extremely effective agents, managers, publicists, and attorneys who helped him acquire career advancement. He wouldn't need to roll around on the icy ground of a Chicago street, staging an attack on himself to make this happen. Jojo Smollett also said his brother ""didn't even want to contact the police following his assault. He was weary and didn't care for the unnecessary attention it might garner."" However, Smollett's choreographer ""insisted"" and ""contacted the police himself,"" Jojo Smollett added.
""It should be noted: if he staged the attack for publicity to boost his career, as alleged, why would he not want to make the incident public?"" he also wrote, adding that Jussie ""was concerned that forfeiting the $10,000 bail could look like an admission of guilt. In fact, not paying, and proceeding with a potentially multi-year process that would bankrupt him and his career was not a realistic option. Even now he carries immense financial burdens for his legal defense and security needs."""

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said that if she is elected president, she will give Congress 100 days to act on gun control. If they don't, she'll take matters into her own hands , she said during a CNN town hall Monday.
Harris supports universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, and told the audience she will use her executive power to take action on gun control if Congress doesn't pass the laws she wants.
""Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws,"" Harris said. ""And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.""
Harris said it was a ""false choice"" that leads people to believe there is no middle ground between respecting the Second Amendment and taking away people's guns for no good reason.
""There are people in Washington, D.C., supposed leaders, who have failed to have the courage to reject a false choice which suggests you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away. We need reasonable gun safety laws in this country, starting with universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapon ban, but they have failed to have the courage to act.""
Harris has said she herself is a gun owner .
""I am a gun owner and I own a gun for probably the reason that a lot of people do, for personal safety,"" she told reporters in Iowa earlier this month."
Obama and Hillary avoided using the word 'Christians' after horrific terror attacks — they used this instead,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/obama-hillary-easter,"Several politicians and news outlets used an odd euphemism to describe the hundreds of Christians who were slaughtered in bombings on Easter in the country of Sri Lanka.
Here's what they said instead.
""The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity,"" former President Barack Obama tweeted.
""On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka,"" he added.
He wasn't the only one to use the term ""Easter worshippers"" instead of Christians.
""On this holy weekend for many faiths, we must stand united against hatred and violence,"" tweeted former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
""I'm praying for everyone affected by today's horrific attacks on Easter worshippers and travelers in Sri Lanka,"" she added.
Presidential candidate Julian Castro also jumped on the euphemism train.
""On a day of redemption and hope, the evil of these attacks on Easter worshippers and tourists in Sri Lanka is deeply saddening,"" Castro tweeted. ""My prayers today are with the dead and injured, and their families. May we find grace.""
Many on social media noticed the weird phrase and criticized the Democrats for trying to disguise the targets of the Easter terror by avoiding the term ""Christians.""

Elizabeth Warren ducks student's question about how she's any different from Obama,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/elizabeth-warren-ducks-students-question-about-how-shes-any-different-from-obama,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren avoided answering a college student who asked her during a CNN town hall how she would be different from former President Barack Obama if she were elected.
Warren and Obama have significant history with one another. In 2010, Obama picked Warren to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog agency set up after the financial crisis as a part of Wall Street reform.
The exchange: The student expressed respect for former Pres. Obama, but said he had his shortcomings. So he wanted to know how Warren would philosophically approach the office of the president differently than the last Democrat to occupy the White House.
Warren heard the question, and basically disregarded it, instead going into a monologue about how she was trying to tell people about the coming financial crisis in the early 2000s.
Eventually, she vaguely addressed Obama, but still didn't answer the question.
""I got in the fight,"" Warren said. ""President Obama signed it into law and he was the one who stood there when everyone else said in his administration throw that agency under the bus and he said, 'No, I'm not going to let this crisis pass and not come away with a consumer agency that makes sure that families ever get cheated again.' I'll always be grateful to the President for that.""
Why does it matter? The Democratic Party has changed significantly since Obama was first elected. It has shifted so far left on some issues that Obama looks rather moderate in comparison to some of the candidates running in 2020.
Some, like Obama's former Vice President Joe Biden, embrace the connection to Obama. Others, like Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), seem to bristle some at the idea of being compared to Obama or asked to identify with him.
That tension is evident in Warren's refusal to directly address the question, which is unlikely to go anywhere as the primary continues."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stunned many when he said that he would extend voting rights to the terrorist Boston bomber who murdered 3 people and maimed several hundred in 2013.
He was speaking at a CNN town hall event when he made the comments.
""If somebody commits a serious crime, sexual assault, murder, they're going to be punished,"" Sanders said.
""They may be in jail 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, their whole life. That's what happens when you commit a serious crime,"" he explained helpfully.
""But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy,"" he explained. ""Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away … you're running down a slippery slope … I believe even if they are in jail, they're paying the price to society, that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.""
When CNN's Chris Cuomo told him his comments would likely be used against him by political opponents, he doubled down.
""Do you believe in democracy?"" Sanders asked. ""Do you believe every single American 18 years of age or older who is an American citizen should have the right to vote?""

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was ridiculed on social media over a moment where she had to encourage the audience to applaud for her, which reminded many of Jeb Bush's ""please clap"" debacle.
Klobuchar was speaking about her accomplishments during a CNN town hall when she made the dreaded gaffe. She took a question from a student about the ""discontented middle class in the American heartland"" that President Donald Trump won over.
""How do you plan on winning back both their trust and their vote?"" he asked.
""I guess you look at what I've done,"" Klobuchar smiled back.
""And that is that I am someone that runs in a purple state. It is a state that when I first started running for office, the other senator was republican, the governor is republican, and three of our four constitutional officers were Republican,"" she explained.
""And then I started running,"" she continued.
""And every single time I have run, I have won every single congressional district in my state, including Michele Bachmann's, OK?"" she paused for applause, but only got scattered laughter.
""It's when you guys are supposed to cheer! OK? Alright!"" she said.
The audience laughed but also applauded moderately.
The moment reminded many of a video that went viral during the 2016 primary election of Jeb Bush asking a small audience to ""please clap!"" after he gave an impassioned speech that was met with silence. It was used against him to demonstrate the lack of enthusiasm for his campaign.

WTF MSM!? NY Times admits the dossier may have been a Russian disinformation operation,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/wtf-msm-ny-times-admits-the-dossier-may-have-been-a-russian-disinformation-operation,"Who knew? … On Saturday, the New York Times published a story about how the ""Mueller Report [was] likely to renew scrutiny of the Steele Dossier."" The Times reports that the dossier's contents could even have been a Russian disinformation operation aimed at then-candidate Trump. Which comes as no surprise to conservatives who have been following the story.
Remember, the Steele dossier came about because the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC paid a law firm , which then hired Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Trump. Fusion GPS then paid a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, who leaned on contacts close to the Kremlin to get information that was used in the preparation of the dossier.
Is it any wonder that those Russians, who wanted to sow discord in the United States, would jump at the opportunity to provide misinformation, knowing that the media would eat it up?
Reaction from conservatives , who have been openly skeptical of the dossier and its use as the basis for FISA warrants against the Trump campaign without verification of its contents , was swift.
What the Times finally got around to acknowledging over the weekend is what conservatives have been saying all along.
Media got it very wrong … On Friday, the New York Post published an op-ed from Sohrab Ahmari listing the ""top 10 things the media got wrong about 'collusion' and 'obstruction.'"" From CNN's erroneous reporting about James Comey's testimony to erroneous fact-checks, it's worth a read. Once again, the media got it horribly wrong.
Why? Because the media bought into the Russian narrative. They wanted Trump to be corrupt, so they kept publishing story after story ""confirming"" the narrative.
Is nothing sacred? … As discussed in Friday's newsletter , last week the media fell over themselves to look foolish on matters of faith – during Holy Week. On Sunday, it may have gotten worse. An MSNBC reporter followed Robert Mueller to church and accosted him to get a comment as he left Easter services .
To the media, hell-bent on getting a story at all costs, there are no longer lines that shouldn't be crossed.
Black Hollywood star joins #WalkAway … On Friday, Brandon Straka announced that actor Isaiah Washington has agreed to speak at the next #WalkAway Black Americans Town Hall on Wednesday, May 1. Washington is one of the highest-profile Hollywood stars to join the movement.
Next week's event should be worth watching.

Washington Post puts focus on 'far-right anger' in wake of Sri Lankan church bombings,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/washington-post-puts-focus-on-far-right-anger-in-wake-of-sri-lankan-church-bombings,"On Monday, the Washington Post published an ""analysis"" article questioning if "" Christianity [is] under attack ?"" in the wake of the bombing of multiple churches on Easter in Sri Lanka. The authors also shifted the focus from the close to 300 victims of what the Sri Lankan government believes is Islamic terroris m to Western ""far-right"" anger.
The Post analysis cites statements from French politician Marie Le Pen, Germany's AfD party, Katie Hopkins, and former Reagan administration official Frank Gaffney as proof that the far-right was using the attacks to further a political agenda.
The authors write that the ""theme of Christianity under attack has been a recurring one for many activists in the United States and Europe."" They compared the response to the Sri Lankan tragedy to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire and how some conservatives mentioned the rise in attacks on French churches in recent years.
The rise in those attacks was downplayed by calling them ""vandalism"" and remarking that the ""vast majority of acts were minor."" The Post links to the French newspaper Libération to support its claim. Yet the linked article states that 100 of the acts against Christian churches and burial grounds were "" violen t.""
Also ignored were the recurring attacks by Islamic militants against Christian churches during Holy week in recent years. As PJ Media's Patrick Poole noted on Twitter , there have been five major attacks on Christian houses of worship during Holy Week, including Sunday's horrific coordinated attacks in Sri Lanka.
Nearly 300 people were murdered because of their faith. They were killed on the holiest day of Christianity when billions of Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ whom they believe died for their sins three days earlier.
Rather than focusing on these victims, the media has decided to focus instead on those who call out the violence done against them. It's more important for the media to keep pushing the left's agenda than it is to look at the actual facts surrounding violence against Christians.

WaPo accuses Ben Shapiro of inciting 'war between Islam and the West;' Media Matters joins in with profane tweet,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/lauren-chen/ben-shapiro-washington-post,"Washington Post writer Talia Lavin accused ""many figures on the right,"" including ""fast-talking far-right pundit Ben Shapiro"" of spreading rumors that ""evoked the specter of a war between Islam and the West"" in the wake of last week's Notre Dame Cathedral fire.
When Shapiro called out Lavin for what he called ""the sheerest form of disgusting bulls***"" and challenged the Washington Post to ""fix this nonsense,"" Media Matters jumped on the opportunity to join the attack against Shapiro.
""F*** you and the burro you rode in on,"" the self-proclaimed ""progressive media watchdog"" tweeted .
Media Matters followed up on their profane tweet by defending Lavin, who goes by @chick_in_kiev on Twitter, claiming that the ""great writer"" has been subjected to right-wing harassment ""for the better part of a year.""
Lavin resigned from her position as ""fact-checker"" for the New York Post in June 2018, after falsely accusing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent of having a Nazi tattoo.
In the latest episode of ""Pseudo-Intellectual,"" host Lauren Chen took a closer look at Media Matters for America, David Brock's not-for-profit ""dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.""
""What is this organization [Media Matters] that, in response to Ben Shapiro clarifying fake news written about him, would say 'F*** you'? And not only that, but go on to defend the writer of said fake-news piece, who also as it turns out has a history of wrongfully calling people Nazis?"" Chen asked.

Three scientists ousted from top US cancer research center over concerns they provided confidential information to China,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientists-ousted-from-cancer-research-center-over-espionage,"MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston has ousted three scientists over concerns that the researchers had connections to China's attempts to steal U.S. intellectual property.
The move followed emails from the National Institutes of Health last year that pointed to conflicts of interest or unreported foreign income by five professors, the Houston Chronicle reported. The center was given 30 days to respond to the investigation, which was assisted by the FBI.
""As stewards of taxpayer dollars invested in biomedical research, we have an obligation to follow up,"" Peter Pisters, president of MD Anderson Cancer Center, told the newspaper. ""This is part of a much larger issue the country is facing — trying to balance an open collaborative environment and at the same time protect proprietary information and commercial interests.""
If MD Anderson didn't take action, the NIH could have withheld the center's grant funding. The center received $148 million in NIH grants last year.
MD Anderson is ranked as the No. 1 cancer center in the world.
What's the story? The center began the termination process for three of the five professors suspected of espionage. Two resigned before the proceedings began, and one has just started the process.
Officials found that firing one of the professors wasn't necessary. A fifth professor remains under investigation.
The terminations come amid the federal government's heightened concern around foreign governments' attempts to capitalize on U.S.-funded research to use students and visiting scholars to steal confidential information from grant applications. The intellectual property is used to operate ""shadow laboratories"" in their home countries.
All five professors were of Asian descent, according to the Houston Chronicle, and at least three are Chinese.
Three of the five were believed to be involved with China's Thousand Talents program, which Pisters described as ""predatory."" The U.S. government, including the NIH, believes the program is the main source for handing over U.S. intellectual property to China.
While MD Anderson policy allows participation in the program, it requires disclosure of all foreign sources of research. None of the researchers had disclosed any involvement.
When did the cancer center first learn of a possible breach? The FBI first requested the cancer center's assistance in a ""national security investigation"" in November 2015 that it described as ""pursuant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation.""
It wasn't until August 2018 that the NIH revealed the name of a specific researcher who had violated several NIH policies, according to the report. Among the NIH violations disclosed was confidentiality of peer review, failure to disclose other research resources, and possibly failing to disclose a financial conflict of interest.
Four more letters were sent to MD Anderson requesting further information about ""serious violations"" by professors. Max Weber, MD Anderson's compliance and ethics officer, responded to the NIH's request. He provided detailed information that showed the accused researchers had corresponded with people in China who held positions at institutions there.
Weber showed examples of the professors sharing confidential grant information with unauthorized third parties, along with undisclosed payments from Chinese institutions and the leadership of a shadow laboratory in China.
According to the report, Weber didn't disclose evidence that MD Anderson proprietary data was transferred to China or other countries.
Will the researchers be charged with a crime? It's unknown whether the scientists will face federal charges or deportation.
FBI spokeswoman Christina Garza told the newspaper that the agency ""does not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation.""
What else? In 2017, the FBI reported that theft of intellectual property by China costs the U.S. up to $600 billion each year."
"In case with far-reaching implications, Supreme Court will rule on whether LGBT status is a protected class under the Civil Rights Act",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/supreme-court-to-rule-on-lgbt-rights-case,"The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on whether or not the Civil Rights Act needs further clarification to include LGBT people specifically as a protected class.
What's the background? Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ""prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin."" The question before the Supreme Court now is whether or not this protection for employers against sex-based discrimination already extends to sexual orientation, making it a protected class.
One of the plaintiffs in the cases being brought before the court involves a New York skydiving instructor named Donald Zarda . According to the lawsuit, Zarda told a female skydiving client that he was gay to ease her mind about being strapped to him while skydiving. He claimed he was fired in 2010 for divulging this information after the woman's boyfriend complained to his employer.
Zarda would later die in a BASE-jumping accident in 2014, four years before the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that he had been wrongfully terminated under Title VII.
Along with Zarda's case , the court will hear the case of a Georgia child welfare services coordinator and a transgender funeral home worker from Michigan, who both attest that they were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Lower courts have disagreed about whether or not Title VII protections apply in these cases, with the 6th Circuit Court ruling they do, and the 11th Circuit Court ruling that they do not. The Trump administration has also argued that Title VII only applies to discrimination based on birth gender and not orientation or transgender identity.
What else? In addition to answering more general questions about discrimination, this ruling could also determine whether or not religious organizations or business owners have a right to refuse to employ or do business with gay or transgender people on the basis of their personal convictions.
The Supreme Court had refused to hear a similar case in 2017.
These cases are scheduled to be heard when the Supreme Court reconvenes for its next term in October ."
Sri Lanka updates: President Trump pledges US support; death toll rises,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/sri-lanka-updates-trump-pledges-u-s-support-death-toll-rises,"More developments have come to light about the horrific Easter Sunday bombings at multiple churches and other locations in Sri Lanka.
As Christians around the world celebrated Easter, the Asian island country of Sri Lanka was rocked by a series of nine bombings at churches and other locations in an apparent terror attack.
Here is what we've found out since TheBlaze's earlier report on the attacks:
The most recent casualty numbers place the death toll at 290 , and the wounded total is over 500. The Sri Lankan government has identified 31 foreign nationals among the dead . Two of them, the Sri Lankan Embassy says, hold both U.S. and U.K. nationalities. The plurality of the foreign nationals identified as killed so far are from India.
Sri Lankan officials are blaming the attacks on National Thowheeth Jama'ath , a little-known local jihadist organization, though no group has publicly claimed responsibility yet.
""We do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country,"" Sri Lankan government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said at a news conference . ""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded.""
Additionally, an unnamed U.S. official told CNN that the attack was ""likely"" ISIS-inspired. On that note, a known ISIS figure was believed to have been trying to recruit Sri Lankans as far back as 2017 .
President Donald Trump has spoken with Sri Lanka's prime minister and called the attacks ""unthinkable."" During his call with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Trump pledged American support to help bring the perpetrators of the attacks "" to justice. ""
""It's a terrible, terrible thing,"" the president told reporters at Monday's White House Easter Egg hunt. ""I've been fighting it [presumably jihadist terrorism] for a long, long time. A lot of people have. A lot of people don't want to talk about it.""
""We urge that any evildoers be brought to justice expeditiously and America is prepared to support that,"" reads a statement from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""We stand committed, resolved, to confront terrorism together.""
Wickremesinghe's government has invoked emergency powers in the wake of the devastation and has arrested 24 people in relation to the bombings. The emergency powers ""will be limited to counter terrorism regulations,"" the Sri Lankan government said , adding that these measures are being taken to allow law enforcement to ""to ensure public security."""
"'Truly a miracle': 5-year-old boy thrown from third-floor balcony at Mall of America shows 'zero evidence of brain damage,' pastor says",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/miracle-boy-thrown-from-third-floor-at-mall-of-america-no-brain-damage,"It was fitting that Pastor Mac Hammond of Living Word Christian Center made the astounding announcement during the Minnesota congregation's Easter service.
You see, the family of the 5-year-old boy who earlier this month was thrown from the third-floor balcony at the Mall of America attends Living Word, and Hammond has been ministering to them — and particularly Landen, the victim of the heinous act.
Hammond told the Brooklyn Park congregation Sunday that after a five-hour MRI, an attending physician said what the test found was ""truly a miracle,"" KMSP-TV reported .
What did the MRI find?
""There was zero evidence of brain damage ... there wasn't even any swelling in the brain,"" Hammond told the cheering congregation in a clip that the station said Landen's family authorized. ""No spinal cord injury, no nerve damage, no internal injuries that were life-threatening.""
Image source: KMSP-TV video screenshot
Hammond added that the physician who called the findings miraculous also said it was as if Landen ""fell off a bicycle"" as opposed to the third floor of a mall, KMSP reported.
While the boy suffered some minor internal bleeding and several broken bones, the station noted that even the fractures in his face appear to be healing in the right places.
'He is answering our prayers' The GoFundMe page for Landen has raised $960,000 of its $1 million goal as of Tuesday morning.
""Our faith in God, and our Savior Jesus, is strong, and we are gaining more reason for optimism day by day,"" the GoFundMe page's Good Friday update noted, adding that ""we all feel your overwhelming love, prayers and support. He is answering our prayers, and they ARE working. Please continue to pray for Landen and his family, every single prayer is important. Thank you so much from all of us and have a blessed Easter weekend.""
Anything else? The man accused of throwing the boy off the balcony admitted to police he went to the mall in search of someone to kill — and was upset that his plan did not ""work out."" Emmanuel Aranda, 24, was charged with first-degree attempted premeditated murder.
Here is another video report on Landen's miraculous recovery:

He was a writer for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. But his biggest story is how God saved him from homelessness and abuse.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/douglas-mackinnon-shares-change-from-homelessness-to-victory,"Douglas MacKinnon has had a fascinating life and career. A writer for former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, a onetime Pentagon official, and an author and columnist, MacKinnon's career has been robust and impactful — but it's his faith journey that has perhaps been the most transformative and uplifting.
MacKinnon, who wrote the Easter book "" The Forty Days: A Vision of Christ's Lost Weeks ,"" has a personal story of overcoming the odds that is quite powerful.
""Our parents were severe dysfunctional alcoholics,"" he told ""The Pure Flix Podcast"" of his abusive upbringing. ""They didn't care about the three children they had.""
(Read also: 4 Dangers of Misplacing Our Purpose and Identity — and the Fix )
By the time MacKinnon was 17 years old, he had been evicted from 34 homes, sometimes being booted out of three or four houses per year.
""We ended up homeless many, many times as children,"" he said, noting that his family lived in cars, tents, and parks.
Somehow, though, he overcame, found success and made his way to Washington, D.C. Listen to his phenomenal story below:
MacKinnon said that faith was a sustaining force early on in his life, recalling the importance of a plastic Nativity that he saw in his school when he was just 5 years old.
""I became … enamored with this little plastic Nativity scene,"" he said. ""I saw the little smiling [baby Jesus] face … smiling back at me and I have no explanation for it ... I was instantly struck.""
Years later, MacKinnon's love for his faith only intensified. In recent decades, he felt himself being called to write a story, with mysterious promptings urging him along the way.
""Once or twice a year in the middle of doing something I'd have this literal flash in my head for a second or two and it was always 'The Forty Days — there's a great story there. Tell it,'"" he explained. ""I'd ignore it.""
(Read also: The Powerful Lessons the 'Thief on the Cross' Teaches Us All )
But those promptings kept coming. Eventually, he wrote the words ""The Forty Days"" on a yellow Post-It note in his office and his wife questioned what it was referring to. He told her he didn't know but continued feeling called toward this mysterious story.
Then, about three years ago, something incredible happened.
""I was sitting at my desk in my home office working on an entirely different project [and] out of nowhere … this entire story about 'The Forty Days' just flooded into my head in a few minutes,"" MacKinnon said. ""I sat at that desk for the next 10 hours straight and wrote down the story exactly as it came into my mind that day.""
MacKinnon said he had no idea what was happening, but that he felt compelled to write it all down, with names, storylines, and more. The experience was so surreal that he called ministers and priests the next day to ask for their advice on what he should do with the finished product.
""They said, 'Well, Doug, this is something, no matter how it came to you, we believe it's your obligation to tell that story,"" he said.
So, MacKinnon published "" The Forty Days: A Vision of Christ's Lost Weeks ,"" and the novel has been impacting lives with a stunning retelling of the gospel story of Christ's death . The novel's description offers up a powerful narrative:
Seventy years after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, in a poor, one room home built from stone, mud, and straw located just outside of Jerusalem, a frail old man tells his granddaughter and her husband of an amazing and miraculous secret. A secret that, because of fear, he kept to himself for decades. When he was an orphaned 9-year-old street urchin on a street in Jerusalem, he had an encounter with a ""bloody and beaten"" man who was being forced to drag a heavy timber cross for His own crucifixion. The old man tells of what he witnessed first-hand of the lost 40 days Jesus walked the earth. (Read also: 5 Powerful Bible Verses About Jesus' Resurrection and Easter )
MacKinnon, who donates proceeds from the book to charity, has spent the past two years trying to share the story with as many people as possible.
""Every single person who has read this story has been deeply touched and deeply moved,"" he said, adding that he simply wants to remind people of what Jesus was preaching.

Wisconsin mom pleads guilty to ISIS terror-related charges,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/wisconsin-mom-guilty-supporting-isis,"Waheba Issa Dais, a Wisconsin mother of seven children, pleaded guilty Monday to supporting the terror group ISIS.
What are the details? According to WITI-TV , Milwaukee-area resident Dais attempted to aid the Islamic State by disseminating information on crafting explosives and biological weapons. Reports also revealed that Dais attempted to recruit people to carry out attacks.
In March, Dais pleaded not guilty to two counts of providing material support to terrorists. Prosecutors dropped one of the charges in exchange for Dais' guilty plea, WITI reported.
Reports revealed that Dais purportedly hacked social media accounts to collaborate with purported members of ISIS to plan potential attacks.
""These cases demonstrate the continuing and evolving terrorism threat posed by foreign terrorism organizations,"" said Matthew Krueger, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.
Dais faces up to 20 years in prison in connection to the charges. Her sentencing is set for Sept. 12."
ISIS claims responsibility for the massacre of Christians in Sri Lanka,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/isis-claims-responsibility-for-the-massacre-of-christians-in-sri-lanka,"The terror group ISIS has claimed responsibility for Easter Sunday terror attack in Sri Lanka.
What attack? On Easter morning, 321 people were killed during a series of suicide attacks in Sri Lanka on three hotels and three churches where Christians were worshipping. Of those killed, 45 were children. Hundreds were injured.
Following the attack, 40 people were arrested. The Sri Lankan government declared Tuesday to be a national day of mourning for the victims. The country is also under an official state of emergency. Interpol and the FBI are assisting with the investigation .
ISIS has now claimed responsibility for the attacks. It has so far offered no evidence to back up this claim. The Washington Post noted that ISIS has claimed responsibility in the past for acts that it did not commit, in an apparent attempt to exaggerate its own influence.
What happened now? Sri Lanka's defense minister said the attacks were carried out as retribution for the shooting of 50 Muslims by a white supremacist in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15. However, Sri Lankan prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe hedged a bit more , saying that it was ""possible"" that the attacks were retaliation for Christchurch but ""we cannot say yet."" Wickremesinghe also said that his government would be following up on ISIS' claim of responsibility.
The Sri Lankan government had initially blamed a local terror group called National Thowheeth Jama'ath, but later said that this group had received outside help.
After years of fighting by a U.S. backed coalition, ISIS has lost the land it claimed in Iraq and Syria, the start of what it had hoped would be a caliphate stretching across the entire region. In December , President Donald Trump declared victory over ISIS in Syria and announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region."
Israeli PM Netanyahu pledges to name Golan town after President Trump in a gesture of gratitude,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/netanyahu-name-golan-town-after-trump,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Tuesday to name a new town in Golan Heights after President Donald Trump in a gesture of gratitude for the United States' recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the region.
The announcement came during Netanyahu's visit, alongside his wife and sons, to the nation's northern region, the Jerusalem Post reported.
""I'm here on the beautiful Golan Heights. All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights,"" the prime minister said. ""Therefore, after the Passover holiday, I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J. Trump.""
Last month, Netanyahu traveled to the White House to meet with Trump about the decree to recognize Golan as Israeli territory.
Trump broke from other world powers when he signed the presidential proclamation on March 25.
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the Six-Day War in June 1967. The brief but bloody conflict is also known as the June War or Third Arab-Israeli War. Israel annexed the area in 1981.
Last week, Jason Greenblatt, the top White House Middle East peace negotiator, introduced an updated international map of Golan on Twitter.
What else?
In December 2017, Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, along with plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem.
Israeli Transportation Minister Israel Katz announced that same month that it would one day name a train station near the Western Wall after Trump.

"Multiple GOP candidates look to unseat Ocasio-Cortez — and a megadonor is eager to help, report says",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-campaign-against-aoc,"Despite being in Congress for just under four months, several Republicans are already lining up to challenge Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has become arguably one of the country's most controversial lawmakers, for her seat in Congress in November 2020.
What are the details? Although mounting a successful challenge against Ocasio-Cortez would prove politically difficult because New York's 14th Congressional District is deeply progressive, Republicans clearly spot opportunity on the horizon.
According to the New York Post , at least one Republican has already declared a candidacy while two others are seriously exploring launching their own campaigns. And at least one wealthy political donor has already declared intentions to fuel Ocasio-Cortez's political opponents.
""There's definitely national energy and money on this race,"" Bronx Republican chairman Mike Rendino told The Post. Rendino did not disclose the donor's name, but said the donor is worth several hundred million dollars.
The Republicans looking to challenge Ocasio-Cortez are:
Egyptian-American journalist Ruth Papazian Former NYPD Officer John Cummings, who now teaches high school civics Rich Valdes, a radio producer for Mark Levin Papazian has already entered the 2020 race , The Post reported. She threw her hat into the ring last month in response to Ocasio-Cortez's public push against Amazon, which had announced New York City as a location for its second location, but later withdrew plans after pushback from local leaders.
Papazian is running as a pro-jobs candidate.
""[Ocasio-Cortez] completely ignores the people in this district,"" Papazian told The Post. ""I've lived here my whole life. I know the heart and soul of this community. The people here have scratched and clawed their way into the middle class, and they're not about to be impoverished with the high taxes it will take to make the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.""
While Papazian has yet to formally establish a fundraising arm for her campaign, sources told The Post that Corey Lewandowski, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, has expressed interest in working with Papazian.
Meanwhile, Valdes, who launched a formal exploratory committee in February, told The Post that Ocasio-Cortez has so far mimicked her predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley (D), by playing politics in Washington despite telling voters she would represent their interests.
""They're really, really kind of discouraged at the fact that she was elected on this platform of representing the district because she ran against [former Rep. Joe] Crowley, positing him as being no-show, and she'd turned out to be very much the same way a no-show person,"" Valdes said.
Cummings, who is also only in the exploratory stages of a campaign, echoed Valdes.
""She's only interested in a national platform, and we need local representation,"" he told The Post.
What did AOC say? Corbin Trent, spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, pushed back against claims that his boss has not been present in her district.
""I couldn't disagree more with people who are suggesting that the congresswoman isn't present enough in the district,"" he told The Post. ""She's done town halls, community board meetings, been available for office hours, she's sat with activists and organizers and had a very strong presence in the district."""
"CNN's Brian Stelter: 'Role of the press' is to 'stand up for decency and morality, especially if others won't'",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-brian-stelter-media-morality,"CNN's Brian Stelter on Monday plainly stated what many have long since observed much of the media morphing into — particularly in this age of Facebook journalism, reporters rushing to espouse their views on Twitter, and commentary increasingly becoming part of what was once hard news.
""What's the role of the press in this broken environment?"" Stelter asked , looking straight into the camera. ""In part, our role is to keep collecting facts, all the facts so citizens can make up their own minds. But I think it's also our role to stand up for decency and morality, especially if others won't.""
What else did Stelter say? Stelter's ""Reliable Sources"" clip began with him telling his audience to pay attention to the ""big lies"" from President Donald Trump and his administration, particularly ""no obstruction, no obstruction at all"" in the wake of special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report — which indicated there wasn't enough evidence to say Trump colluded with Russia and that Mueller wouldn't exonerate or accuse Trump of obstructing justice.
But Stelter didn't see it that way: ""The attempts to obstruct are screaming off the page,"" he said before adding that while there was ""no conspiracy found in the Mueller report, but there's no integrity, either.""
With that, Stelter launched into his media-as-moral-agents pronouncement.
'Journalists, after all, work with a code of ethics'
He added, ""Journalists, after all, work with a code of ethics. We have — and we try to enforce — standards, and when we fall down on those standards, we try to learn from those mistakes.""
Stelter then decried Trump attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for telling CNN's Chris Cuomo that ""if we're gonna start making moral judgments about everybody in public office, we'll have nobody in public office.""
""We can do better than that. And journalists can help lead the way by talking about morality and ethics,"" Stelter said before letting out a dramatic sigh and then adding ""if the people in charge aren't.""
What was the reaction to Stelter's statements? Apart from the legion of examples of the mainstream media, particularly CNN, being accused of not covering the news fairly — with the Mueller investigation at the top of the list for the moment — a number of Twitter users took issue with Stelter's declaration that the press should assume the role of ""decency and morality"" watchdogs:
""No. Don't try to be a moral agent. Report facts, then sit down & shut your mouth. Media & politicians have a messiah complex. Neither of you are that important. Just do your work & do it well and then hush your hole."" ""... the media's job is to 'report' the facts, which you fake news networks do not. You are only a propagandist not a journalist."" ""Quick question: what is morality and how it is established?"" ""Unbelievable. You mean it's your job to tell people what to think? The arrogance! This is the problem. That's exactly what the media is NOT supposed to do. They're supposed to be completely impartial."" ""Why do you keep harping on the fact that no [one] trusts you. Get it together and start telling people facts not conjecture, and maybe we'll start to trust you again."" ""The problem with your statement is that the media very rarely reports just the facts. You guys always add your opinions and most of the time make stuff up to fit your narrative. What happened to who what where when and why?"""
"British TV star, journalist sparks fury after he criticizes ‘unscrupulous’ Christians in wake of Sri Lanka terror attacks: ‘Don’t send your prayers’",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/british-tv-star-sparks-fury-after-he-criticizes-unscrupulous-christians-in-wake-of-sri-lanka-terror-attacks-dont-send-your-prayers,"A former BBC journalist and contestant in the United Kingdom's ""Big Brother"" is under fire after saying that people shouldn't be sending their prayers in the wake of the Sri Lanka terror attacks.
More than 300 people were killed in the church and hotel bombings that rocked the area on Easter Sunday, and more than 500 people were injured.
On Tuesday, ISIS took credit for the bombings. At least 40 people were arrested in connection with the attacks following the Sunday massacre.
You can read more about the attacks here .
So what's this 'Big Brother' person saying? 2016 ""Big Brother"" contestant and former BBC journalist Andy West tweeted about the Easter attacks.
In a Sunday tweet, West wrote, ""There is no excuse for terror attacks against innocent people but as a journalist I saw Western Christian missionaries unscrupulpusly [sic] converting Buddhist orphans for food and shelter after the Asian tsunami. Don't send your prayers.""
He later added, ""Most — though not all — of those 'good Christian soldiers' thought they were doing God's good work. Perhaps we should forgive people their delusions but trying to press one religion onto another by brainwashing desperate children is a Western tradition that only leads to misery.""
His initial tweet was not received well, with just 1,000 ""likes,"" but more than 7,000 comments. A vast majority of the comments from other social media users broadly condemned West's remarks.
Facing criticism from social media peers, West later doubled down on his remarks and offered an explanation as to why he stood by them.
He wrote, ""So prayers aren't needed. In fact prayers are proven beyond doubt to have no effect. What might help, however, is ending the Western campaign to convert people of other religions in exchange for charity.""
He also went on to point out the actions of what he called ""Christian cult leaders"" in Sri Lanka.

""Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws,"" Harris said. ""If they fail to do it, I will take executive action and specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that gun dealers [having sold more than five guns in one year] must do background checks when they sell those guns.""
Pat asserted that all of the action items proposed by Harris are currently in effect.
""So you are going to propose things that we already do in virtually every case,"" Pat said. ""They try to push these narratives that just aren't true.""
Pat concluded that Harris' position on gun control is that if members of Congress do not act and meet her demands, then she would become a tyrant by way of executive order.

Texas school district survey tells 3rd- to 11th-grade students that 'gender is how a person feels',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/school-district-tells-kids-gender-is-about-feeling,"One of Texas' largest school districts told third- through 11th-grade students in a recent survey, ""Sex is what a person is born. Gender is how a person feels.""
The statement was part of Austin Independent School District's 2018-2019 Student Climate Survey administered to students this year, the Federalist reported. Following the statement, students were asked to indicate how they felt about their identities.
The answer options included: ""I am a girl/woman,"" ""I am a boy/man,"" and ""I identify in some other way."" Additional space was provided for students to ""describe how they identify,"" but it was optional.
Austin ISD is the fifth largest school district in the state with more than 83,000 children enrolled. The Federalist estimated that 57,000 children took the survey this year, assuming the number of an even division of students across the grade levels.
The district claims that the questionnaire helps it ""examine factors contributing to student success beyond test scores,"" a spokeswoman told the Federalist in an email.
Parents often have no idea what questions are asked on ""school climate surveys"" until after their children take the evaluation. At the beginning of each school year, parents sign multiple forms allowing the district to administer such surveys.
Does this happen in other districts or states? Surveys such as the one used by AISD are part of the Obama administration's 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act , which updated the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002.
The updated act included allowing states to evaluate children on non-academic behaviors and feelings known as ""socioemotional learning."" The surveys are considered to be part of an accountability tool called the ""fifth indicator"" in the ESSA.
In 2017, non-academic questions were added to the National Assessment of Educational Progress or more commonly known as the Nation's Report Card.
Some special interests groups, including the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning organization, have used the ESSA to push districts into expanding this type of questionnaire. CASEL leads multiple initiatives and produces high-quality resources to advance and implement SEL practices and policies, according to its website .
What do critics say? Some critics believe the surveys are a way to impose transgender ideology onto students.
""Both the content and process of CASEL are statist in nature ... think of it as Groupthink 10.0: We're the government and we're here to help. The net effect is to build a collective mindset,"" Stella Morabito, a Federalist senior contributor, said last year at a presentation before the Family Research Council, the Christian Post reported.
Morabito worked in intelligence for about 10 years and is an expert in propaganda.
""Power elites have always utilized propaganda through psychological manipulation to coerce the masses to bend to an agenda, and over time false premises, like the notion that 'sex is assigned at birth,' slowly make their way into law, she explained,"" she said.
Self-reported assessments are also highly unreliable, according to experts.
Pediatrician and education researcher Karen Effrem told the Federalist that research suggests that simply asking children about specific behaviors can create problems.
""Whether it's comprehensive sex education or a survey, if you're bringing stuff like that [sexuality] up you are potentially creating upset or conflict or just planting the idea,"" she said.

Suspect reportedly steals man’s vehicle with man’s child inside. Suspect finds out hard way that he picked the wrong car to jack.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/suspect-purportedly-steals-mans-vehicle-with-mans-child-inside-suspect-finds-out-hard-way-that-he-picked-the-wrong-car-to-jack,"Lamar Thurman, a 29-year-old man suspected of carjacking a man's vehicle with his child still inside, is in critical condition after the vehicle owner caught up to Thurman and shot him several times.
What are the details? The unidentified carjacking victim's vehicle was reportedly parked in front of the victim's home early Saturday morning in West Palm Beach, Florida, when Thurman allegedly entered the running vehicle and took off with it, according to WPLG-TV .
The victim's 6-year-old son was inside the vehicle at the time, according to reports, while his father was inside the home saying goodbye to those inside.
Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Teri Barbera said that Thurman drove away from the residence with the child inside. When the child's father realized that the car had been taken, he and friends phoned 911.
""The victim and friends immediately chased after the vehicle while calling 911,"" Barbera said, according to the Sun-Sentinel .
Thurman crashed the victim's vehicle a short while after taking it, and the young boy's father and friends — who pursued Thurman in another vehicle after calling 911 — attempted to save the child from the car. Thurman only made it about four miles before crashing the car.
Though he'd crashed, Thurman persisted and made a second attempt to drive away with the child in the car. He didn't get very far, as the child's father pulled out a firearm and shot at Thurman several times ""in an attempt to stop him from fleeing further,"" according to Barbera.
Thurman went about 200 yards more before crashing the car a second time. Police arrived on the scene and took Thurman to the hospital in critical condition.
The child was unhurt.
What else? ""The suspect has no association with the victims,"" Barbera said.
According to a Facebook update, the incident is ""still open and active pending further investigation.""
State records reveal that Thurman was arrested in 2016 for carjacking and battery.
No pending charges are available at the time of this writing. "
NYC Mayor de Blasio vows to ban glass and steel skyscrapers as part of city's Green New Deal,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-mayor-de-blasio-ban-skyscrapers,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday that he would be imposing a ban on ""inefficient"" glass and steel skyscrapers in the city, arguing that buildings are the biggest contributor to the Big Apple's carbon footprint.
The progressive Democrat threatened building owners with fines of ""$1 million or more"" for noncompliance, in a scheme that's been referred to as ""pure stupidity.""
What are the details?
De Blasio made the media rounds on Earth Day, touting his city's ""audacious"" Green New Deal modeled off the federal flop pushed by freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).
As part of his initiative, the mayor vowed to crack down on developers and building owners, whom he accused of ""putting up monuments to themselves,"" Spectrum News reported.
""The biggest source of emissions in New York City is buildings,"" de Blasio explained, speaking on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""We're putting clear, strong mandates — the first of any major city on the earth — to say to building owners, 'You gotta clean up your act. You gotta retrofit, you gotta save energy. If you don't do it by 2030, there will be serious fines as high as $1 million or more for the biggest buildings, and this mandate is going to guarantee that we reduce emissions.'
""We're going to ban the classic glass and steel skyscrapers which are incredibly inefficient,"" the mayor continued. ""If someone wants to build one of those things they can take a whole lot of steps to make it energy efficient, but we're not going to allow what we used to see in the past.""
Anything else? De Blasio didn't lay out specifics for how the new building codes would look, but promised his plan as a whole would reduce New York City's carbon emissions by 30 percent and create tens of thousands of jobs over the next decade.
Columnist Steve Cuozzo wrote in the New York Post that ""de Blasio's 'green' skyscraper idea is pure stupidity,"" noting ""the five boroughs already suffer from the most expensive construction costs in the world."""

What are the details? Ousmane Bah from New York said that his interim learner's permit was lost or stolen. In the lawsuit, he claims that a thief used this ID at an Apple store location before he robbed it . The thief then went on to rob a number of Apple stores in at least four different states. The perpetrator's face, which was not Bah's, was caught on surveillance camera, but his name was listed as Bah presumably from the ID, which did not include a picture.
Apple, however, has told the BBC that it does not have facial recognition technology in those stores.
Delaware, Massachusetts, and New York have all since dropped their criminal cases against Bah. In the Massachusetts case, he had been able to prove that at the time an Apple store in Boston had $1,200 in merchandise stolen, he was attending his senior prom in New York City. He said he has never visited Boston in his life. He said that the first time he heard about the robbery in Boston was when he got a court summons in the mail.
In the case of a robbery in Manhattan , the lawsuit claims that Bah was arrested but then later released when police determined that he was not the culprit caught on surveillance video.
New Jersey still has a criminal case open against Bah for a robbery at an Apple store there.
What else? According to the lawsuit, Bah was ""was forced to respond to multiple false allegations which led to severe stress and hardship in his life, and also significant damage to his positive reputation that he had put so much effort into upholding.""
Apple, Bah alleges , ""wrongfully and baselessly damaged"" his reputation. He also said that being forced to travel to multiple states to face charges for a crime he didn't commit has hurt his attendance at college."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) Monday after the Democratic lawmaker said that the Department of Veterans Affairs ""provides the highest quality care to our veterans"" and added that, if the program ""ain't broke, don't fix it.""
Ocasio-Cortez made the remarks during a town hall event in New York City last week.
""The idea that this thing that isn't broken, this thing that provides the highest quality care to our veterans somehow needs to be fixed, optimized, tinkered with until you don't even recognize it anymore,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Here's the thing, they are trying to fix it, but who are they trying to fix it for is the question we've got to ask.
""They're trying to fix the VA for pharmaceutical companies, they're trying to fix the VA for insurance corporations, and ultimately they're trying to fix the VA for a for-profit health care industry that does not put people or veterans first,"" she said.
""We have a responsibility to protect it, because if it is any community that deserves Cadillac first-class health care in the United States of America it is our military service members,"" the congresswoman added.
What did McCain say? McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), took personal exception to the congresswoman's remarks and bashed the notion on Twitter.
On Twitter, McCain wrote, ""Veterans have literally died waiting to get health care treatment from the VA....died!""
Died? Yes, died.
A March 2014 report revealed that former Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned over an ongoing controversy regarding vets' care.
The Department of Veterans Affairs' inspector general conducted an investigation into the department. The report revealed that veterans were being made to wait on average 115 days for a first-time appointment at a Phoenix care center. VA officials purportedly falsified records to conceal the fact that veterans had to wait so long for appointments. As a result, at least 35 vets seeking care at the Phoenix facility died before they could receive care.
Phoenix wasn't the only issue.
A May 2015 report found that even after Shinseki resigned, at least one in 36 vets had to wait 30 days on average for an appointment nationwide. A startling 232,000 veterans were forced to wait more than 60 days to be seen.
A 2018 report found that there were ""critical deficiencies"" at the Washington, D.C., Veterans Affairs Medical Center, including a lack of supplies,""chronic staffing shortages,"" ""excessive vacancies in leadership positions,"" a ""lack of consistently clean storage areas for medical supplies and equipment,"" and more.
The 2018 report also revealed that the medical center's issues also included ""delays or postponements of procedures due to unavailable usable instruments."" The report noted that in some cases, veterans had to ""wait months for needed items."""
Brawling man wearing Easter bunny costume explains what got him so hopping mad in viral video,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-in-bunny-costume-tells-why-he-got-in-a-brawl,"UPDATE 12:01 p.m.: It turns out that Antoine McDonald — the 20-year-old caught on video dressed as an Easter bunny while brawling with man on an Orlando street Sunday — is wanted in New Jersey in connection with a vehicle burglary last fall and possibly fled to Florida under an assumed name, the Tampa Bay Times reported .
In addition, police in Dover, Delaware, told the paper McDonald was arrested in early 2017 after he and two others were accused of committing two armed robberies over a 12-hour span on New Year's Day.
Image source: Dover, Delaware, police
McDonald was charged with two counts of robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, second-degree conspiracy, and tampering with physical evidence, the Times added. Police said he and his accomplices robbed three people by gunpoint — hitting one with the gun and punching another — then robbed two others at gunpoint before fleeing, the paper said.
But wait — there's more
South Brunswick, N.J., police told the Times that in September 2018 McDonald and an accomplice were caught on surveillance cameras breaking into and burglarizing a car. Police charged McDonald and issued a warrant for his arrest but said they believed he fled the state, the paper added. Police said McDonald burglarized two cars claiming the owners owed him money, but cops weren't able to connect him to the owners, the Times noted.
Image source: South Brunswick, New Jersey, police
South Brunswick Deputy Police Chief Jim Ryan told the paper McDonald also was arrested in 2018 for harassing a man through social media and spitting at a 7-Eleven employee — and implicated in a basketball court assault that didn't lead to an arrest.
In January, McDonald was jailed in Pasco County, Florida, after being arrested and charged with fraudulent use of a personal identification, the Times noted, adding that he told police in New Jersey that he lived in Tampa and claims to have recently moved to Orlando.
Image source: Pasco County Sheriff's Office
In February, the Orange County Sheriff's Office charged McDonald with reckless driving, the paper said.
No word as to why he thought it was a good idea to talk to the media after his Easter bunny suit escapade.
Original story below
Antoine McDonald emphasized to WKMG-TV that he's not a violent person.
""I am the type of person to avoid fights by any means necessary,"" he told the station, ""but in that situation I would fight any day.""
McDonald, of course, is the man who was caught on a now-viral video dressed in an Easter bunny costume brawling with another man on an Orlando, Florida, street on the evening of Easter Sunday, WKMG said.
And he came clean to the station about what, er, bugged him that night. But first, here's a video of the bizarre dust-up:
Easter Bunny hops in and throws punches during fight youtu.be
What's the background? McDonald told WKMG he and his friends bought the bunny suit as a joke and then decided to pass it around Sunday as they — fittingly — bar hopped in downtown Orlando.
And McDonald was the lucky costume wearer when he said he witnessed a man and a woman in a confrontation near SAKS Comedy Club, the station said.
""The guy was — I don't know if he was bullying her or what — so then I see him spit on her, and she starts hitting him and everything,"" McDonald recalled to WKMG.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
He noted to the station that he didn't know the man or the woman but that he couldn't stand by and watch disrespect toward women — so he intervened and began throwing a barrage of punches at the man.
You 'just can't spit on African-Americans — especially African-American females' ""I am going to say that I am happy so that people know that they just can't spit on African-Americans — especially African-American females — and think that it's OK,"" McDonald also told WKMG.
A police officer soon appeared at the scene, and while the fight was over at that point, McDonald offered a few air punches and bobs and weaves to underscore who won the battle.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
But while he confessed to the station that he thought getting arrested was a possibility, he knows he was in the right.
""The thought went through my head when the cop came over, but you know I didn't leave. I didn't run,"" McDonald told WKMG. ""I said, 'You know what? This man deserved it.' You know, if I have to be arrested for this to prove a point that this shouldn't be happening, then so be it.""

"NJ mayor defends Kate Smith’s ‘God Bless America,’ says the song will still be played on the boardwalk",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mayor-defends-kate-smith-god-bless-america,"Wildwood, New Jersey, Mayor Ernie Troiano refused to back down when confronted with news that some tri-state neighbors were canning Kate Smith's version of ""God Bless America"" because of Smith's purported ties to racism .
Wait, what? Last week, the New York Yankees announced that Smith's version of the song would no longer be played during the seventh-inning stretch.
The Philadelphia Flyers also removed a statue of Smith from outside of the team's arena for the same reason.
The 1931 song, "" That's Why Darkies Were Born ,"" is one example that many people perceive as racist, boasting lyrics that read, ""Someone had to pick the cotton, someone had to pick the corn, someone had to slave and be able to sing, that's why darkies were born.""
People questioned the song's history in the past, with some critics calling it outright racist, and others saying that the song was a satirical take on racism and white supremacy .
Smith also recorded ""Pickaninny Heaven,"" directed at ""colored children"" who fantasize about frolicking in a place with ""great big watermelons,"" according to the Daily News .
Smith died in 1986.
What is the mayor saying now?
Troiano told "" The Dom Giordano Program "" Monday that Smith's version of ""God Bless America"" will continue to play at Wildwood's boardwalk every morning at 11 a.m. local time during the summer months.
""It's an Irving Berlin patriotic song that has nothing to do with anything other than America,"" Troiano said. ""I can assure you that my conversation with the mayor of North Wildwood, Patrick Rosenello, is, we have no intentions of removing it.""
""I'm just a small-town mayor and I look at what's happening to the world, and it's amazing how everyone wants to rewrite history,"" he added. ""No one wants to allow history to be an educator to help us improve in the future. We're going to change history and what we don't like, we're just going to erase.""
Troiano pointed the finger at the overly politically correct world.
""[T]he world's gotten so politically correct and so afraid that they're going to offend somebody,"" he insisted. ""The song is greater than anything. So you know what? It'll continue to play in Wildwood.""

What else? Some area residents and visitors to the Jersey Shore beach voiced their support for Troiano's decision.
Philadelphia resident Ronald Watt told KYW-TV that he didn't feel Smith ""was racist at all.""
Carlissa Bell told KYW that he who is without sin should cast the first stone.
""If we hold her to the stake for her songs from something that was in the 1930s — and even now; she's dead and gone — then we're going to be held accountable when all is said and done,"" Bell said. ""It's like you're casting judgment on her just because you may sin differently."""
"Pentagon takes action after two US soldiers detained, disarmed by Mexican soldiers in US territory",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/investigation-mexican-soldiers-detain-us-soldiers,"The Pentagon has initiated an investigation after two United States Army soldiers were briefly detained and disarmed by Mexican soldiers earlier this month. The tense situation was complicated by the fact that it occurred in U.S. territory near Clint, Texas.
What is the background? As TheBlaze reported over the weekend , two U.S. soldiers — an Army sergeant and private — were briefly detained by a group of five or six Mexican soldiers on April 13. The U.S. personnel were sitting in an unmarked Customs and Border Protection vehicle conducting a routine surveillance mission at the time of the incident.
To de-escalate the situation, both U.S. soldiers complied with orders from their Mexican counterparts, who tactically approached them with high-powered FX-05 Xiuhcoatl machine guns, which are capable of firing more than 12 rounds per second.
The Army sergeant, who was armed with his service Beretta M9 pistol, was disarmed by the Mexican soldiers.
After a brief search and broken English to Spanish back-and-forth conversation, the Mexican soldiers released the U.S. personnel and departed in an unmarked Mexican military vehicle. CBP agents and U.S. military personnel quickly responded to the scene.
No one was injured during the incident.
What's happening now? According to the Washington Examiner , Pentagon officials are investigating how the two U.S. soldiers responded and reviewing military guidance that left the soldiers essentially defenseless.
Though an official from U.S. Northern Command told the Examiner the incident was the first of its kind, the investigation ""will help us modify any instructions that we're giving the troops"" about how to handle similar situations in the future if they occur.
More from the Examiner:
Troops deployed to the U.S.-Mexico boundary go through joint readiness staging, or training on how to handle dangerous situations in the area. The official said he could not recall anything similar to last Saturday's encounter having taken place during a previous active-duty troop deployment.
No official protocol exists for how to navigate a run-in with a foreign military, but the senior official said the soldiers were trained to ""de-escalate"" the situation. By surrendering at least one gun, they followed existing protocol, though it left them unarmed. Meanwhile, U.S. officials have contacted the Mexican government requesting an explanation and why their solders were seemingly patrolling the border area while in U.S. territory."
Florida Senate approves bill to arm school teachers - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/florida-senate-approves-bill-to-arm-school-teachers,"The Florida state Senate has passed a bill that would allow for school teachers to be armed in classrooms.
Here's what we know This bill, SB 7030 , was put forward after the deadly massacre in February 2018 at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
Teachers would still have to volunteer and be trained in order to carry weapons on school property. This bill would not authorize teachers to carry guns to school without going through the training process.
The bill passed the Senate along roughly party lines by a vote of 22-17, with only one Republican, Sen. Anitere Flores (Miami), breaking ranks to vote against it.
Since the Florida state House is controlled by Republicans and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has spoken in support of it, it is expected to face no further obstacles in becoming law.
Supporters of the bill pointed to how long it took for police to arrive at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, while opponents argued for increased non-teacher security on campus.
""We're telling teachers if you want protection for you and your children, you do it yourself,"" Sen. Bill Montford (D-Tallahassee) said, according to the Herald Tribune .
But for Republican Sen. Ed Hooper (Clearwater), the benefits far outweighed the negatives.
""I wish we had a law enforcement officer on every floor of every school. We do not and we cannot,"" Hooper said . ""I must err on the side of saving a kid.""
What else? Florida already approved school safety ""guardians,"" average citizens trained as security guards, last year in 25 counties.
However, full-time teachers are banned from signing up for this program. Even with this program in place, some districts have failed to have at least one armed ""safe-school officer"" in each school, as required by Florida law."
Feds claim drug crisis win with narcotics indictment of former pharma boss,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dea-indicts-pharmaceutical-company-and-former-ceo,"In what is being touted as a first-ever indictment of its kind in the ongoing drug crisis, a pharmaceutical company and its former CEO are facing federal charges for allegedly diverting opioid medication and defrauding the Drug Enforcement Agency.
Upstate New York-based Rochester Drug Co-operative and two former executives — 75-year-old former CEO Laurence Doud and former chief compliance officer William Pietruszewski — were indicted on criminal charges Tuesday, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.
""This prosecution is the first of its kind: executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and the distributor itself have been charged with drug trafficking, trafficking the same drugs that are fueling the opioid epidemic that is ravaging this country,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a Department of Justice news release . ""Our Office will do everything in its power to combat this epidemic, from street-level dealers to the executives who illegally distribute drugs from their boardrooms.""
According to the indictment, Doud and RDC knowingly sold powerful painkiller medications to pharmacies from 2012 to 2017, knowing they were being distributed illegally.
As a manufacturer and seller of controlled substances, RDC is required by federal law to maintain a system to report suspicious orders to the DEA.
However, even when RDC's own compliance personnel said that pharmacy customers were showing signs of diverting drugs, the company continued to sell opioids to them for the sake of profit, prosecutors said. The company and its former executives are also accused of, among other things, hiding those ""red flags"" from the DEA for fear that they would lose buyers.
""Doud and other members of senior management instructed RDC employees to contravene its policies and DEA regulations so that the Company could continue doing business with customers Doud knew were likely diverting controlled substances, and to increase Doud's compensation,"" the federal indictment states .
RDC has agreed to a deal with prosecutors where it will pay $20 million in penalties for its actions, submit to being independently monitored, and enhance its controlled substance compliance department.
""We made mistakes, and RDC understands that these mistakes, directed by former management, have serious consequences,"" RDC spokesman Jeff Eller said in a statement . ""We accept responsibility for those mistakes. We can do better, we are doing better, and we will do better.""
Federal authorities are heralding the news as a big step forward in addressing America's rampant opioid crisis.
""Today's charges should send shock waves throughout the pharmaceutical industry reminding them of their role as gatekeepers of prescription medication,"" DEA Agent in Charge Ray Donovan said of the charges. ""The distribution of life-saving medication is paramount to public health; similarly, so is identifying rogue members of the pharmaceutical and medical fields whose diversion contributes to the record-breaking drug overdoses in America."""
Acting DHS chief makes President Trump's position on family separation at the border clear: It's 'not on the table',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dhs-chief-trump-opposes-family-separations-at-border,"Separating families at the southern border is not an option, according to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
McAleenan told NBC News' Lester Holt in a recent interview that the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy initiative was never intended to keep families apart. President Donald Trump appointed McAleenan to take over as acting secretary of the agency earlier this month following Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation from the post.
""I think the president has been clear that family separation is not on the table, and again this was a zero-tolerance prosecution initiative that was targeted at adults violating the law,"" McAleenan said during a clip of the interview at the DHS offices in the World Trade Center in New York City.
""They were always intended to be reunited,"" he added. ""And really a better system, as I've said many times, would allow us to detain families together during fair and expeditious immigration proceedings and getting actual immigration results from courts, so that's what's missing from the current situation.""
McAleenan previously served as commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
What's the backstory on the policy? Last year, Nielsen made headlines after implementing a zero-tolerance policy that temporarily separated thousands of minors from their parents who had crossed illegally into the U.S. The courts later blocked the policy.
In June, Trump signed an executive order ending family separations.
U.S. officials reportedly told NBC that Nielsen was forced out of her position ""in part because she'd refused to reinstate the policy of separating children from their families at the border.""
What did McAleenan say about the effectiveness of the zero-tolerance policy? In a portion of the interview not yet aired, Holt reportedly asked whether or not McAleenan believed zero-tolerance was an effective policy.
""So prosecuting violations of the law does have a consequence and it does deter behavior but it did not work if you lose the public trust,"" McAleenan responded, adding that from ""an enforcement perspective, it's not worth it."""
College of Natural Science 'diversity' group at MSU: 'No science is needed to support transgender and non-binary identities',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-of-natural-science-at-major-school-tells-students-no-science-is-needed-to-support-transgender-and-non-binary-identities,"A diversity group within the College of Natural Science at Michigan State University told students that ""no science is needed to support transgender and non-binary identities"" and that such support ""is simply a matter of affirming their experiences,"" Campus Reform reported , citing an email the outlet said it obtained.
The NatSci Council on Diversity and Community penned the email titled, ""Increasing transgender visibility on campus,"" the outlet added. The NatSci Council falls under MSU's College of Natural Science .
The email asked students to ""reflect on how visibility of minoritized groups is essential to changing our campus culture,"" Campus Reform said, and suggested a number of online resources to help in that regard.
More from the outlet:
These included links to LGBT resource centers, how to "" learn about and start using the singular they,"" a resource on hosting queer inclusive workshops, one dedicated to inviting ""transgender and gender-diverse scientists,"" guides on transphobia, and more.
Clicking on the pronoun link brings up a colorful and interactive web page titled ""I [love] the singular they,"" which maps out benefits and tools to using the pronoun to refer to a person. The page argues that the singular ""they"" is ""neutral,"" ""easy,"" ""inclusive,"" and ""classy."" What else does the pronoun site say? ""Writing with non-gender-neutral pronouns is a serious pain,"" the pronoun site says. ""Some prefer the Frankenword 's/he,' while others rack their brain. Some stick with a particular pronoun for one paragraph or chapter, then swap out the one they're using; others alternate 'he' and 'she' by sentence, or use a plural adapter, but that all sounds confusing.""
The site adds that ""'they' doesn't assume a person's gender, and it doesn't assume there are only two"" and that it's ""inclusive of people of all different genders.""
What did natural science students have to say? Ashley Deaton, a food science and microbiology student, told Campus Reform that the email is ""dangerous"" as it reflects ""a single mentality that actually isn't as straightforward as people may believe.""
MSU physiology student Shad Soldano told the outlet he sees things differently, saying he believes the email stands for ""a good cause in bringing awareness and hopefully eliminating remaining prejudices toward the transgender community.""
What did the College of Natural Science have to say? Campus Reform said it didn't immediately hear back from Shelby Gombosi, the MSU administrative assistant who sent the email. MSU on Tuesday didn't immediately reply to TheBlaze's request for comment on the email Campus Reform said it obtained."

Trinitarios gang member Luis Leizado shot an NYPD officer before other cops killed Leizado during Thursday's shootout in an upper Manhattan parking lot , the paper said.
The wounded officer — Justin Vartanian, 34 — was hit in the arm, taken to a hospital, and released the next day, the Post reported, adding that he's expected to make a full recovery.
What did the bystander yell?
But while the gang member was still drawing breath during the Washington Heights shootout, video showed the bystander shouting encouragement to him to kill police.
""Nah, don't give up! Shoot all them n****s!"" the bystander can be heard shouting on video, the paper noted. The bystander also called the officers ""bitches"" and one in particular a ""bald-headed bastard.""
The police were ordering the gang member to give himself up, but the bystander yelled to Leizado to not turn over his gun: ""Don't drop it!""
""F*** 'em! Shoot the cops! Don't give up — just shoot!"" he added, the Post said. ""Shoot n***a, shoot the cops! F*** 'em!""
The bystander also wished death upon the officers — ""I hope all y'all die!"" — and told the gang member, ""Don't cover up!"" and ""don't give up!""
Anything else?
Sources told the Post that police shared video of the bystander on social media ""to let everyone know what a piece of s**t a**hole this guy is.""
""Let's make this outstanding piece of s**t famous,"" one Facebook post said, the paper reported, along with a screenshot of the bystander.

Houston high school implements strict dress code — for parents: ‘We must have high standards’,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/houston-high-school-implements-strict-dress-code-for-parents-we-must-have-high-standards,"A Houston high school has introduced a dress code for its students' parents — and the school is no-nonsense when it comes to enforcing the new rules.
What are the details? James Madison High School's new parent dress code includes a ban on items such as leggings, hair caps or bonnets, pajamas, slippers, hair rollers, torn jeans, revealing tops, sagging bottoms of any kind (including pants, shorts, and jeans), men's undershirts, and short dresses and shorts.
James Madison High School Principal Carlotta Outley Brown made the announcement earlier in April in a letter to the parents.
A portion of Brown's letter also warned, ""Please know that if you break our school rules/policies, you will not be permitted inside the school until you return appropriately dressed for the school setting.""
""Please know we have to have standards,"" the letter added, ""most of all, we must have high standards.""
In addition to the letter, the school also posted the policy on the school's web page for parents to peruse.
Brown's letter also explained that the dress code applies to all functions — including sports events — that take place on school property.
Tomiko Miller, the mother of one student, told the Houston Chronicle that she's ""almost insulted"" by the new policy.
""I really think it was discriminatory, the language that was used,"" Miller explained. ""It was demeaning. And I'm African-American — and if it's misty outside and I have a hair bonnet on, I don't see how that's anyone's business.""
Zeph Capo, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers, also told the outlet that the dress code is ""classist,"" ""dismissive,"" and ""belittling.""
""Who are you to judge others who may not have the same opportunities that you do?"" Capo asked. ""Having a wrap on your head is not offensive. It should not be controversial.""
What else? The Chronicle also reported that similar plans are in the works in other school districts across the U.S.
Two Tennessee legislators sponsored a bill that would require schools to have a parent dress code in place. State Rep. Antonio Parkinson (D), one of the lawmakers responsible for the bill, said that it is imperative for parents to wear appropriate clothing to set an example for children.
""I've heard from people literally from New York to California to Washington state saying there is a need for this,"" Parkinson said.
Parkinson also spoke to the notion that some parents believe that the idea of a dress code targets people from certain demographics.
""I'm not speaking about affordable as much as priorities,"" he said. ""What could be a higher priority than bringing your child to school? You wouldn't go to a date like that."""
"Mother gets jailed for a week, loses her job and kids after being wrongly arrested due to police error",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-jailed-loses-job-kids-due-to-police-error,"Police wrongly arrested and jailed an Ohio mother earlier this month, acting on a warrant intended for a drug-trafficking suspect who shared the same name. But before law enforcement realized the mistake, the innocent woman had spent a week behind bars, lost her job and temporarily lost custody of her children in the meantime.
What are the details? Authorities arrested Ashley Foster, 26, in a Target parking lot April 11, after a Hamilton County Sheriff's deputy ran her plates as part of a routine patrol.
""I told him my name was Ashley, he asked me to step out of the car,"" the mother later recalled to WXIX-TV . ""They said, 'Do you know you have a warrant out for your arrest?' And I said, 'No! What did I do?' He said it was for tracking heroin, and I broke down in the parking lot, on the ground crying.""
However, the deputy was relying on information from Brown County, where the Aberdeen Police Department had issued the warrant intended for a suspect named Ashley Foster on April 1. Problem was, nearly all of the identifying documentation in the system matched the wrong woman.
""They showed me the computer, everything they had in front of them, it was my ID, my picture, my birthday, my social security number, but it was not my address,"" Foster confirmed. ""I said that I didn't do anything and that they had the wrong person.""
Nonetheless, Foster was cuffed and her two sons — who were in the vehicle — were taken into custody by child protective services.
""My youngest is 8 weeks old yesterday, they wouldn't let me feed him, wouldn't let me change his diaper. I listened to him scream,"" she told WXIX.
Foster spent the next five days in the Hamilton County Justice Center before being transferred to the jail in Brown County to spend another two days behind bars. She was eventually interviewed by Aberdeen Police Chief David Benjamin, who realized the wrong Ashley Foster was in custody.
All charges were dropped and she was released upon the discovery, but there was no apology from the chief, according to Foster.
""He just said, 'Thank you for your time,'"" she told the Cincinnati Enquirer .
Benjamin told WXIX that the investigation is ongoing and that's all he can say at this time.
Anything else? Once Foster was released from jail, she returned to her vehicle in the Target parking lot and found it with a flat tire. According to Reason , she lost her job because she missed work due to her incarceration, and only regained custody of her children after Clermont County Job & Family Services ""interviewed her to determine her competency as a mother and inspected her home.""
WXIX reported that Foster planned to meet with an attorney and ""wants everyone to keep in mind that never in her wildest nightmare could she have imagined this happening to her, and it could, in theory, happen to you as well."""
'Where is the outcry?' Glenn Beck warns Christians to take a stand against growing persecution,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/glenn-tv/sri-lanka-christian-persecution,"The bombings in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, which left more than 300 people dead, was one of the world's worst terror attacks since 9/11. Christians were literally targeted in their churches by suicide bombers from a radical Islamic group.
""Where is the outcry that this has to be stopped?"" asked Glenn Beck on Monday's episode of "" Glenn TV .""
Glenn noted how, in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand that left 50 dead, leftist lawmakers and media were quick to vilify white males and Christians because the ""one demented psychopath"" who carried out the horrific attacks self identified as an anti-Muslim white supremacist.
""The media jumped to shame and rebuke white men ... particularly white Christians everywhere,"" he said. ""By the way, did you know that the New Zealand shooter was an atheist?""
Glenn compared the New Zealand attacks to the attacks in Sri Lanka, which were carried out by at least six members of the Islamic State ( ISIS ) in six organized attacks on churches and hotels where Christians were celebrating Easter, killing at least 300 people and injuring at least 500 more.
""Christians, not 'Easter worshippers' but Christians , were specifically targeted. There is no doubt on that,"" said Glenn, emphasizing that many on the left are replacing the word Christians with "" Easter worshippers .""
""Christians face a new persecution, a growing persecution,"" said Glenn. ""America, we are so close to being lost into nothingness that I think for Christians to even stand up and say ... 'hey, we're being targeted' is going to look like a miracle.""

President Trump is telling members of his administration to skip White House Correspondents' Dinner,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-is-telling-members-of-his-administration-to-skip-the-white-house-correspondents-dinner,"President Donald Trump has reportedly been ordering members of his administration not to attend the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner.
Here's what we know While Trump has never attended a Correspondents' Dinner while in office, members of his administration have gone.
Last year, comedian Michelle Wolf mocked press secretary Sarah Sanders for burning ""facts"" and using ""that ash to create the perfect smokey eye. Like, maybe she's born with it, maybe it's lies. It's probably lies."" After the dinner , CNN reporter Laura Jarrett (the daughter of Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, described Wolf's comments to Sanders as ""uncomfortable,"" ""brutal,"" and ""cringeworthy I think at best""
The year before this incident, White House officials had voluntarily boycotted the dinner out of support for Trump.
On April 30, 2018, Trump tweeted that the dinner was ""a total disaster and embarrassment to our great Country.""
This year, rather than have another comedian at the dinner as has been tradition, the White House Correspondents' Association will have presidential historian Ron Chernow speak. Chernow has written a number of well respected historical books including one on former President Ulysses B. Grant and the biography of Alexander Hamilton that inspired Lin-Manuel Miranda's Broadway musical.
""The President and members of his administration will not attend the White House Correspondents' Dinner this year,"" the White House said in a written statement, according to USA Today .
According to CNN , members of his staff have been trying to talk him out of ordering them not to attend.
This year's dinner will be held on Saturday. Instead of attending the dinner, Trump is planning to hold a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin."

What are the details? Speaking at an event in his home state, McConnell asked , ""Are we going to turn this into a socialist country?"" before warning, ""Don't assume it cannot happen. It'll all be in the hands, I think, of the voters of this country next year.""
McConnell went on to promise, ""If I'm still the majority leader of the Senate after next year, none of those things are going to pass the Senate,"" CBS News reported. ""They won't even be voted on. So think of me as the Grim Reaper — the guy who is going to make sure that socialism doesn't land on the president's desk.""
McConnell continued, ""You pass the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, you have fundamentally changed this country, fundamentally changed it into an unproductive place with significant unemployment and huge problems.""
Pointing out that such far-left fringe ideas have worked their way into the mainstream, the majority leader noted that a number of senators running for Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 have expressed support for both proposals; namely Cory Booker (N.J.), Kamala Harris (Calif.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).
Anything else? McConnell has expressed increasing concern over socialist programs touted by Democrats of late, particularly the multi-trillion dollar Green New Deal and Medicare for All proposals."

According to Fox, the escorts then returned back across the border. Meanwhile, the woman and her child turned themselves into Border Patrol agents who were responding to the crossing.
On Tuesday afternoon, U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a video of the incident to their social media pages.
There is no pedestrian fence separating the U.S. and Mexico in the border crossing area, which borders a highway in Sonora, Mexico, the report added.
In a news release, CBP explained that ""Border Patrol cameras observed several men armed with assault rifles escort a mother and child to the international boundary west of Lukeville,"" adding that the area is "" commonly used by smugglers to bring massive numbers of Central Americans into the country illegally.""
The video broke amid mounting concerns about the deteriorating security situation at the border, coupled with the ongoing collapse of political stability in Mexico, along with its government's failure to keep Mexican citizens safe from criminal cartels.
An unnamed Border Patrol agent told Fox News that the incident is ""highly unusual"" but also ""highly concerning to the agency,""
""These armed individuals along the border represent an escalation of tactics. This is not mom and dad and kids deciding to head to the border,"" the Border Patrol agent added. ""This is a, no kidding, orchestrated effort to bring individuals to the U.S. It is not just the numbers. It's who is running this enterprise.""
Agents caught up to the woman and her son west of Lukeville, Arizona, according to KGUN-TV.
The development came just one day after President Donald Trump signed a new memorandum asking the secretary of state and secretary of Homeland Security for a plan to crack down on illegal immigration by further scrutinizing visa overstays. "
University offers Trump-related course that actually welcomes conservative students,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/university-offers-trump-related-course-that-actually-welcomes-conservative-students,"A university in Pennsylvania is going against the grain of the anti-conservative bias on college campuses with a course related to President Donald Trump that isn’t hostile to conservative students, according to Campus Reform.
Lock Haven University professor Kimberly Johnson will be teaching a sociology course titled “Culture and Society in the Age of Trump” in the fall.
Who created the course?
Johnson told Campus Reform that she wanted to create an environment where students, regardless of political affiliation, can have open and productive discussions about Pres. Trump and his impact on the country.
“Conservative students have told me that they wish they had a class where they could openly express themselves, particularly concerning Trump and his politics,” Johnson said. ""For me, it doesn't matter what a student's views are on our current president; I hope to provide an environment where we can genuinely examine what is going on in society during such turbulent times.""
What will it be about?
The course, according to the description, will explore the sociological factors that led to Pres. Trump’s election, as well as responses to that event. From Campus Reform:
“Students will learn about race, class, and gender and how these important societal components were directly applicable to the presidential election and the reaction that followed,"" the course description states. ""This course also examines the sociological background to some of the key elements that shaped global society and culture, such as populist movements.""
Did the school oppose it?
Johnson said that even though Lock Haven, like many universities, leans left politically, approved of the educational value of open and non-judgmental discussion.
“I would love to see [schools] return to its classical days where both theory and research were objective areas of serious study,” Johnson said. If students enroll in our sociology program at LHU, they can get a taste of that."""

Crenshaw shot down the proposal and explained why he thought her policy was ""terribly clumsy"" and unfair.
""Loan forgiveness for people making up to $250k?"" Crenshaw responded with a link to Warren's tweet.

Dem candidate who said the gov't could nuke gun owners now says threats are the 'lowest form of communication',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dem-candidate-who-said-the-govt-could-nuke-gun-owners-says-threats-are-the-lowest-form-of-communication,"Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who is running for president, criticized people making threats against him over his stance on gun control—despite Swalwell's previous implication that the government could nuke gun owners who refused to surrender their firearms.
What's this about? A Florida man was arrested for making threats against Democratic lawmakers last week. His targets included Swalwell, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).
Swalwell is running on a platform focused on gun control . The man focused on that issue in the threatening voice message.
""...the day you come after our guns, motherf***er, is the day you'll be dead,"" the message said.
Swalwell, like anyone, took offense to being threatened over his political beliefs.
""Making threats is the lowest form of communication,"" Swalwell wrote on Twitter. ""If your response to a lawmaker proposing to change gun laws is to threaten to kill that lawmaker, you are proving why we need better laws on firearm possession in America.""
While threats of that nature are indeed inappropriate, it's hard to forget Swalwell also engaging in threatening dialogue with a citizen who opposed his gun control ambitions.
Back in November, Joe Biggs wrote of Swalwell, ""So basically @RepSwalwell wants a war. Because that's what you would get. You're outta your f***ing mind if you think I'll give up my rights and give the gov all the power.""
Swalwell responded, ""And it would be a short war my friend. The government has nukes. Too many of them. But they're legit. I'm sure if we talked we could find common ground to protect our families and communities.""
The implication being that if a gun owner resisted a government effort to take away his or her gun, the government could use nuclear force against gun owners to accomplish its mission. Hyperbole of course, but still threatening.
Perhaps Swalwell has now learned that violent rhetoric is unacceptable from either side of the debate.
Swalwell has recently been begging National Rifle Association president Oliver North to debate him, while refusing numerous invitations from NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch to engage in serious dialogue about gun laws."

Jon noted that during Monday's five back-to-back town halls with Democratic candidates, CNN didn't ask a single question about Muslim extremists. Following the Christchurch mosque shooting, the mainstream media reacted with near-hysterics over the ""rising threat of white nationalism."" In contrast, when Christians were targeted by Islamic extremists, the media just stuck to their tired narratives about impeaching President Donald Trump.
""Remember when the Christchurch shooting happened, there was this huge rush to condemn white men,"" said Jon. ""But after this attack, if you listen carefully enough you might even be able to hear the crickets chirping in the wind.""

Brothers who accuse Smollett of race hoax sue for defamation — but their target is not Jussie himself,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/jussie-smollett-lawyers-sued,"The brothers who claimed that ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett paid them to perpetrate a racial and homophobic attack hoax are now suing the star's lawyers for defamation.
The Osundairo brothers say that Smollett's lawyers have made false and defamatory claims in the process of defending their client.
Smollett's case was dismissed after he forfeited a $10,000 bail bond and completed some community service, much to the shock of many in the public.
The brothers filed a federal defamation claim Tuesday saying that their reputations had been damaged by many of the statements made by Smollet's attorneys Tina Glandian and Mark Geragos.
""Attorneys Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian through their continued false statements and hateful rhetoric,"" said the brothers' attorney Gloria Schmidt, ""have only deepened the damage.""
The lawsuit says that by calling the brothers liars, Smollett's lawyers are accusing them of perpetrating an actual hate crime.
""Other than the self-serving statements by the two brothers, nothing actually connects Jussie to the act,"" Glandian claimed.
In one case, Smollet's lawyers implied that one of the brothers might have had an intimate relationship with Smollett, who is openly gay.
""The younger brother did end up spending the night at Jussie's house close in time to when this attack took place. I will leave it at that,"" Geragos said.
""Oh, there's a relationship?"" inferred a podcast host.
""I'm just gonna leave it at that!"" responded Geragos.
Geragos and Glandian responded that they believed the lawsuit was a joke at first and said they were confident that the case would be dismissed.

Earlier Pelosi had said that it was not ""worth it"" to impeach the president, a sentiment echoed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) after the Mueller report was released. The leadership had been pressured by other Democrats who vehemently called for impeachment.
""I say to you, as I said earlier, there are many ways to hold the president accountable,"" Pelosi explained. ""The Congress, The Justice Department may have not decided to use its full power to impeach - to indict.""
""Congress will not be silent in terms of using our constitutional power to find the facts for the American people,"" she concluded.
When asked if she thought the president had acted in a criminal manner, she responded that it ""remains to be seen,"" and said they will discover the answer to that question when they see an un-redacted version of the Mueller report.

Several states' National Guards are openly defying Pres. Trump's ban on transgender troops,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/several-states-national-guards-are-openly-defying-pres-trumps-ban-on-transgender-troops,"The National Guards of three states will not comply with the Trump administration's ban on transgender troops serving in the armed forces, according to the Washington Examiner .
Officials from California, Nevada, and New Mexico have all publicly stated that they will allow transgender people to enlist and serve in their National Guards, regardless of the president's wishes.
""Every transgendered soldier or airmen currently serving in the California National Guard will remain in our ranks,"" Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers of California said. ""Further, we will not treat any soldier or airmen any differently today, than we did yesterday. Anybody who is willing and able to serve state [and] nation should have the opportunity to serve. It's unconscionable in my mind that we would fundamentally discriminate against a certain class of people based on their gender identity. That should be the absolute least of our worries.""
Background President Donald Trump introduced the ban on transgender troops in a series of tweets back in July 2017. After nearly two years of court battles, the administration has been allowed to implement the ban.
There is a grandfather clause to allow service members who came out as transgender after 2016 (when a previous ban was lifted) and before the new ban to continue to serve.
While the military branches will no longer accept new transgender recruits, a Pentagon spokesperson said they will not ""hunt down"" transgender service members to punish them, according to Buzzfeed .
Why some states are disobeying Spokespeople for Nevada and New Mexico said that the only criteria they would enforce for their National Guards are fitness and willingness to serve.
""The State of Nevada does not discriminate against anyone, including and especially service members, based on gender identity or expression,"" Helen Kalla, communications director for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) said, according to The Daily Beast. ""Governor Sisolak believes the only criteria to serve in the Nevada National Guard is one's readiness to serve."""
Uber driver fired after refusing to take a passenger to an abortion clinic,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/uber-driver-fired-after-refusing-to-take-a-passenger-to-an-abortion-clinic,"An Uber driver was fired after he refused to take a passenger to get an abortion, and the passenger is considering taking legal action against him as well, according to Yahoo Style .
What happened? A 20-year-old woman in upstate New York intended to get an abortion. The nearby Planned Parenthood clinic did not have any available appointments, and she did not have a car, so she summoned an Uber to take her to a clinic about an hour away.
The driver picked her up and began driving her to the destination. Based on the information she put into the app, there was no obvious way for the driver to know she was going to an abortion clinic. But he seemed to have a hunch.
She recounted the interaction with the driver on Reddit:
""My appointment was at 11:30am so at 9:58am my Uber arrived and he immediately seemed uncomfortable. After about five minutes in the car, he asked, 'are we going to a planned parenthood?' I said no (because we weren't), but it set off alarm bells that he would even ask that, The destination I put in was just the name of the doctor and the address of the clinic, there was nothing that would suggest it was an abortion clinic. After a few more minutes he asked, 'are we going to an abortion clinic?'""
""I was shocked. I had no idea what to say, so I just remained quiet. He then said 'I know it's none of my business, but…' and proceeded to mention something about his wife being pregnant, how awful the procedure was (and proceeded to explain it in graphic detail), and that 'there is so much they don't tell you'. He then said 'you're going to regret this decision for the rest of your life' and that I was making a mistake."" After a little while longer, the driver pulled over and said he could not complete the trip. He offered to take her back home, but said he would not take her to the clinic. They were approximately at the midpoint of the hour-long journey.
The woman contacted her boyfriend, who informed the clinic she would be late. Then she took a cab to the abortion clinic.
She reported the driver to Uber, which terminated him, and also reported the incident to the police. She said she wants to take legal action against him, but is not yet sure how to proceed.

Piers Morgan bashes Ocasio-Cortez for her lack of interest in Easter terror attacks on Christians,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-on-terror-attack,"Piers Morgan pointed out a curiosity about the difference between the attention Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) paid to terror attacks that targeted Muslims versus that which targeted Christians.
Twitter-obsessed @AOC posted 14 times about the terror attack on Muslims in New Zealand, but has posted nothing about the terror attack on Christians by Muslim extremists in Sri Lanka,"" Morgan noted.
""Very odd,"" he concluded.
He was referring to a series of horrific bombings on the Christian religious day of observance for Easter that killed at least 321 at last count, and injured hundreds more.
But while Ocasio-Cortez showered attention on the terror attacks on Muslims in New Zealand, she showed such interest in that on Christians.
In one controversial tweet after the New Zealand terror attacks, Ocasio-Cortez appeared to mock those offering prayers for the victims.
""What good are your thoughts & prayers when they don't even keep the pews safe?"" she tweeted .
In another tweet, she praised the government in New Zealand for banning guns after the attack.
""This is what leadership looks like,"" she tweeted.
TheBlaze could not substantiate the claim that Ocasio-Cortez tweeted 14 times about New Zealand, which appears to be repeated often on social media, but without evidence.
Other Democratic politicians have been criticized for their response to the terror on Christians in Sri Lanka, including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who referred to the victims as ""Easter worshippers.""
On Tuesday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the heinous Easter attacks.
Here's the latest on the Sri Lanka attacks: Preview: Hey media, there is absolutely a war on Christians! | Sri Lanka Attack www.youtube.com "
Young girl without hands wins national handwriting competition,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/young-girl-without-hands-wins-handwriting-competition,"Ten-year-old Sara Hinesley of Frederick, Maryland, can write cursive well enough to win an award for it. This is quite the accomplishment for someone so young, especially when you consider that Sara was born without hands.
What's the story? Speaking to WJZ-TV , Sara said she found writing in cursive to be ""kind of hard — well sometimes easy and sometimes kind of hard — cause you don't really remember all the letters to write.""
She attends St. John's Regional Catholic School in Frederick. In addition to practicing her cursive, she likes to draw.
The Zaner-Bloser National Handwriting Contest awards students in kindergarten through eighth grade for their writing skills. It includes a category for students with special needs. Sara will receive a trophy for winning the award when school ends on June 13 and a $500 prize. She told CNN that she wasn't sure what she would do with the money.
Sara's family told CNN that they had looked into getting prosthetic arms for her, but had decided against it when they saw how much she could accomplish without them.
""She is so amazing and functional without prosthetics that really there is not a need,"" her mom told CNN. ""She can do just about anything — often times better than me or my husband."" She also described her daughter as being ""very independent.""
It seems that Hinesley isn't the only overachiever in her family. Her sister Veronica, who is also only 10, built a rudimentary prosthetic hand for her sister in science class, so that the two of them could play catch together.
What else? The sisters also go rock climbing together.
""Anytime I fail, I just keep doing it with Veronica cheering me on — I can always get to the top,"" Sara told WBZ."
Report: Illinois' Democratic billionaire governor facing federal investigation for toilet-based tax fraud,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/illinois-democratic-billionaire-governor-under-investigation-toilet-based-tax-fraud-report,"Illinois' Democratic billionaire governor J.B. Pritzker is under a criminal tax investigation by federal authorities, according to a report from Chicago's WBEZ radio station.
Pritzker, his wife and his brother-in-law are under investigation for a questionable residential property tax appeal that plagued him during his previous campaign, the station reported.
A Cook County Inspector General's report that first came to light in October said that $330,000 in tax breaks and refunds that then-candidate Pritzker received on a 126-year-old Chicago mansions resulted from a ""scheme to defraud."" One way that Pritzker and company have been accused of doing so is by removing toilets.
According to the report, now-first lady Pritzker wanted the toilets removed on the property with no directive to reinstall them in an effort to have the property reassessed as ""uninhabitable"" for the purpose of receiving tax benefits.
The report contains a 2015 work-order email from a plumber who worked on the house.
""She is going to have the house re-assessed as an uninhabitable structure,"" it reads, the report said. ""To do this, she would like to have us pull all toilets and cap all toilet lines in the house.""
The Chicago Sun-Times first noted in 2017 that the Pritzkers had purchased the home next to theirs, let it fall into disrepair and then raked in a lot of money in tax breaks after having it declared uninhabitable.
The WBEZ report also added that the first lady's personal assistant, who was involved in the tax appeal, is currently being represented by high-powered, influential Chicago area lawyer Reid Schar, a former federal prosecutor.
But Gov. Pritzker says he's not worried about the matter.
""Let me be clear that I'm very confident that any review of this matter will show that all the rules were followed,"" he said in a Wednesday news conference where he blamed his political opponents for the problem resurfacing. He added that he has ""no concern at all"" about political charges.
The Land of Lincoln is no stranger to seeing its chief executives in trouble with the law. Four of Illinois' governors since the 1960s have gone to prison . Most recently, Democrat Rod Blagojevich was impeached before being convicted on several corruption charges in 2011."
'Fat Sex Therapist' declares science that says overweight people are unhealthy is akin to 'Nazi science',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/fat-sex-therapist-declares-science-that-says-overweight-people-are-unhealthy-is-akin-to-nazi-science,"Sonalee Rashatwar calls herself ""The Fat Sex Therapist,"" and she declared to an audience at St. Olaf College in Minnesota last week that science and medicine that insists overweight people are unhealthy is akin to ""Nazi science.""
""Nazis really love this idea of an idealized body,"" Rashatwar said during her lecture titled, ""Race as Body Image Issue.""
What else did she say? Rashatwar — who identifies as ""nonbinary"" and ""queer"" — railed against ""diet culture"" and ""fat phobia"" and ""size-ism"" and ""weight bias"" and ""body-image abuse"" and a ""rich thin ideal,"" tying it all to white supremacy, capitalism, classism, and even a ""police state"" that engages in ""social control.""
She added that when she was 8, 9, and 10 years of age she was subjected to ""non-consensual diets"" and told not losing weight might cost her career advancement, the interest of a ""male partner,"" and the possibility others would view her as ""lazy."" Rashatwar acknowledged that such warnings weren't without merit, but she then concluded, ""So what?""

""I truly believe that a child cannot consent to being on a diet the same way a child cannot consent to having sex,"" she added, noting the she endured a ""constant state of surveillance"" as a kid.
Rashatwar also said that intentional weight loss is ""scientifically"" impossible, that she ""inherited"" her body, and that an attempt to lose would be akin to ""defy[ing] my biology.""
She added that ""thinness doesn't mean health,"" noting she doesn't use words like ""obesity"" and ""overweight"" because doing so ""hypermedicalizes our understanding of fat.""
Rashatwar also argued that ""all food has nutritional value"" and OK to eat unless it's ""poisonous"" — and that one even can be allergic to certain foods and eat them. Rashatwar also said those who eat ""good foods"" are viewed as ""good people,"" and those who don't eat ""clean"" foods are viewed as ""dirty.""
She also implied that it's wrong to make health the responsibility of each individual, saying such thinking is a product of the 1980s and the policies touted by former President Ronald Reagan. Instead, Rashatwar said there should be ""social supports that also help me to subsidize my food costs.""
'Nazi' comparisons
Rashatwar also said that ""fat phobic science"" is often ""eugenic science"" and that ""eugenic science is Nazi science.""
Underscoring her point, she actually brought up the individual responsible for the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, noting that she finds it unsurprising that he ""was also a fitness instructor.""
Acknowledging the tension in the room, Rashatwar doubled down and said it's ""a clear communication that there's still an idealized body. Nazis really love this idea of an idealized body, and so it makes a lot of sense to me that a fitness instructor ... might also think about an idealized body in this thin, white supremacist way.""
Image source: St. Olaf College video screenshot
She also said that listeners ""cannot after leaving this room continue to call yourself progressive"" or ""leftist"" or ""radical"" or ""Marxist"" or ""communist"" or ""socialist"" or ""anarchist and still hold on to fat phobic values.""
What did one student have to say? After the lecture, a St. Olaf freshman, who's lost over 100 pounds, told Campus Reform he was disturbed by Rashatwar's claims.
""The entire speech was very troubling to me,"" Will Douty told the outlet. ""I know from personal experience that health is absolutely connected with weight ... when you decide to give up and claim that doctors are lying to you, and you're perfect the way you are, all you truly end up with is repressed emotions and an early funeral ... I can guarantee that maintaining healthy eating habits will help me live a much longer and healthier life than I was originally on track to have. Your life can only improve if you take responsibility for yourself.""
Campus Reform said it reached out to St. Olaf College regarding Rashatwar's claims but didn't receive a response in time for publication."
"Trump accuses Mexican troops of actively helping drug smugglers, says he will send armed soldiers to the border",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-accuses-mexican-troops-of-actively-helping-drug-smugglers-says-he-will-send-armed-soldiers-to-the-border,"In a flurry of tweets Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump accused the Mexican government of not doing enough to stop migrants from traveling through its country to the U.S. border and claimed that Mexican soldiers had tried to create a diversion ""for drug smugglers.""
He also announced that the U.S. was sending ""armed soldiers"" to the border to counter this.
What did Trump say? The president began by tweeting , ""A very big Caravan of over 20,000 people started up through Mexico. It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming. Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border & call up the Military. The Coyotes & Cartels have weapons!""
There is, in fact, another caravan traveling through southern Mexico at the moment heading for the U.S. border. It is currently estimated to be made up of roughly 10,000 people .
Earlier this month , Trump threatened to shut down the southern border if the Mexican government did not do more to stop drug trafficking. However, even Trump supporters like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) warned that closing the border could be "" devastating "" to U.S. businesses who depend on commerce coming through legal ports of entry between the two countries.
The president Wednesday went on to tweet , ""Mexico's Soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard Soldiers, probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the Border. Better not happen again! We are now sending ARMED SOLDIERS to the Border. Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending & returning!""
What happened? Trump is referring to an incident on April 13 when two U.S. soldiers were detained by six members of the Mexican military. The Mexican soldiers had reportedly believed that they were on the Mexican side of the border when they were in fact on the American side. So far, apart from Trump's tweet, there has been no indication that the incident was some sort of diversion and not accidental. However, the Pentagon is investigating the event.
While Trump has accused the Mexican government in the past of not doing enough to stop drug smugglers, this seems to be the first time that he has actively accused people officially connected to the Mexican government of running interference to actively help them.
Trump has previously said that he planned to send U.S. troops to the southern border until a wall could be built.
President Trump later posted praise for the Border Patrol and a demand that Democrats act on illegal immigration, saying, ""Can anyone comprehend what a GREAT job Border Patrol and Law Enforcement is doing on our Southern Border. So far this year they have APPREHENDED 418,000 plus illegal immigrants, way up from last year. Mexico is doing very little for us. DEMS IN CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW!""
The 418,000 number refers to the number of apprehensions reported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. That number is higher than the 404,142 apprehensions that took place during the entire 2018 fiscal year.
According to public data made available from CBP , 207,475 total apprehensions took place at the border during the first three months of calendar year 2019. Data for April is not available."
High school newspaper wages First Amendment battle with administrators over a story about a student working in the porn industry,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/high-school-newspaper-porn-story,"Students and administrators at Bear Creek High School in Stockton, California, are squaring off over whether the high school newspaper should run a story on an 18-year-old student who works in the pornography industry.
Students and the journalism teacher who runs the paper are claiming that free speech is the issue — but the administration is more concerned that the feature is simply inappropriate for students.
What is the stance of the publisher? According to KOVR-TV , Kathi Duffel, the teacher behind the school's Bruin Voice, believes that free speech should be the priority.
""When you are on the side of free speech, you will never lose,"" Duffel said.
The administration sent a letter to Duffel earlier in April, threatening that she could be subject to termination if the story isn't sent to the administration for prior approval before publication.
""I opened it up and read it ... and then I cried,"" said Duffel, who later consulted an attorney.
""We believe this student has every right to tell her story legally, and that we have every legal right to tell it,"" Duffel insisted.
Staff writer Bailey Kirkeby told the outlet that the unidentified student in the adult film industry engages in the work to help pay living expenses, such as rent.
""I think a lot of people assume that she's just the porn star, but the story is actually giving her a personality,"" Kirkeby told KOVR.
What is the stance of the administration? In a statement provided to the outlet, Lodi Unified School District said that they also have legal options.
""Lodi Unified School District supports the rights our students have to freedom of speech,"" the statement began. ""The District has not censored nor stopped the publication of the Bruin Voice, or any article originally scheduled to be published on April 23, now scheduled for May 3.""
""The District is legally required to ensure that publications do not violate Education Code Section 48907,"" the statement continued. ""This law requires districts to prevent the publication of obscenity, defamation, and incitement. It also prohibits the publication of content that fails to meet the professional standards of English and journalism.""
""The District will legally intervene to ensure that any school-related activity complies with the law. We are working cooperatively with Mrs. Duffel, the teacher who oversees the Bruin Voice. After refusing to allow the District to see the article, she proposed that an independent attorney review the article to ensure compliance with the law,"" the statement revealed. ""The District agreed on April 18. In addition, Mrs. Duffel acknowledged that the District's concerns raised some interesting points and that the students have more work to do. Regardless of action taken by Mrs. Duffel, the District remains committed to the agreed upon process.""
So what's going to happen?
The paper is set to run the feature on May 3, despite pushback from the administration.
Gabriella Backus, the paper's editor-in-chief, said she will not back down.
""[The administration's] intimidation tactics, which we've all seen at this point, should not scare [the student] away from defending herself,"" Backus said.
Duffel supports the decision.
""Our students are the watchdog of our administration, and I want our administration to know we are watching and they will be held accountable,"" Duffel said."
"After backlash, Kamala Harris gets tough on depriving convicted terrorists, sexual predators of voting rights",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-felon-voting,"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, definitively stated Tuesday that convicted terrorists and sexual predators should not be allowed to vote, walking back willingness to discuss the controversial issue.
Harris' comments come amid broad discussion within Democratic circles whether convicted felons should be stripped of voting rights, including those who remain behind bars.
What did Harris previously say? During a CNN town hall Monday, Harris said she believes there needs to be a ""conversation"" about whether convicted terrorists who are American citizens should be allowed to vote from prison.
""People who are convicted, in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber on death row, people who are convicted of sexual assault, they should be able to vote?"" CNN host Don Lemon asked Harris.
""I think we should have that conversation,"" Harris replied.
Image via Twitter @RealSaavedra screenshot
Harris' comments came after Democratic presidential front-runner Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he believes convicted terrorists like the Boston Marathon bomber should be allowed to vote from prison.
""If somebody commits a serious crime, sexual assault, murder, they're going to be punished,"" Sanders said. ""But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy. Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away … you're running down a slippery slope … I believe even if they are in jail, they're paying the price to society, that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.""
What did Harris say Tuesday? While speaking to media Tuesday in New Hampshire — the first state to hold a primary election — Harris was asked to clarify her position on felon voting.
""Do I think that people who commit murder, people who are terrorists should be deprived of their rights? Yeah, I do,"" Harris said.
Voting rights issues are important for Harris in particular because of her extensive background as a prosecutor and California's attorney general, which diminishes her appeal among progressives who believe criminal justice reform is paramount.
Her comments at the town hall were likely an effort to appeal to hardline progressives who are inclined to support Sanders. However, backtracking so quickly will raise red flags among criminal justice reform advocates and likely diminish her standing among far-left progressives."
