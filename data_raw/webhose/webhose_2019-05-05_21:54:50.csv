We wouldn’t be where we are without the totally fabricated, not a shred of evidence to even allude to Trump-Russia collusion. There is not any evidence. There never has been any evidence. There wasn’t any evidence. They tried to manufacture evidence with the Trump dossier. All of this literally made up, and none of the rest of what’s happened, Flynn’s lies, Mueller’s investigation, none of it would have happened if it weren’t for all of that being made up. We have been lied to, we have been misled, we have been misdirected by a willing accomplice Drive-By Media working with Robert Mueller and his staff of anti-Trump lawyers and the entire Democrat Party combined with the Washington establishment to create in the minds of the American people a story that didn’t happen, couldn’t happen, nobody can ever prove did happen. Where is the tampering of votes? Where are the meetings? Where is the strategy? Where is the evidence that Trump got together with Russians / Putin to sabotage the Hillary campaign? Which is what everybody has been led to believe happened here. Robert Mueller has nothing because there is nothing on what everybody in this country has been misled to believe for the past two years.
