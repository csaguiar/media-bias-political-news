Trump downplays North Korean missile treat | Fox News,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-downplays-north-korean-missile-treat,"Trump also said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un&apos;s attacks on one of his Democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, had made him smile. The remarks were the latest example of Trump&apos;s willingness to publicly undermine senior advisers, flout Democratic norms and side with totalitarian leaders, even on the world stage. He did so this time during a four-day state visit to Japan where he&apos;ll become the first leader to meet with the country&apos;s new emperor.
""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" Trump tweeted in one of a flurry of early morning messages that suggested he&apos;d spent little time sleeping after the lengthy flight to Asia.
""Some"" of his ""people"" appear to include national security adviser John Bolton, who told reporters at a briefing Saturday ahead of Trump&apos;s arrival that a series of short-range missile tests by North Korea earlier this month were a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
""In terms of violating U.N. Security Council resolutions, there is no doubt about that,"" said Bolton, responding to the May 4 and 9 tests that ended a pause in launches that began in late 2017. Trump ignored a shouted question Sunday about whether he agreed with Bolton&apos;s assessment.
Trump and other administration officials have sought to downplay the significance of the tests, insisting they do not violate an agreement Trump reached with Kim for a moratorium on launches.
""The moratorium was focused, very focused, on intercontinental missile systems, the ones that threaten the United States,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a recent television interview. That raised alarm bells in Japan, where short-range missiles pose a serious threat because of the country&apos;s proximity to North Korea.
Trump in his tweet said he had ""confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,"" while at the same time embracing Kim&apos;s recent attacks on Biden, whose name he misspelled.
Trump said he ""smiled"" when Kim ""called Swampman Joe Bidan a low IQ individual, & worse.""
""Perhaps that&apos;s sending me a signal?"" Trump asked.
North Korea this week labeled Biden a ""fool of low IQ"" and an ""imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being"" after the U.S. presidential hopeful accused Trump of cozying up to ""dictators and tyrants"" like Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin during his campaign launch speech.
Biden&apos;s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday, but a spokesman for his campaign, Andrew Bates said Wednesday that, ""Given Vice President Biden&apos;s record of standing up for American values and interests, it&apos;s no surprise that North Korea would prefer that Donald Trump remain in the White House.""
The tweet came early Sunday before Trump left his hotel for a round of golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He&apos;ll also be attending a sumo wrestling match and handing out a ""President&apos;s Cup"" to the winner as part of a visit meant to showcase the close ties between the nations.

One day my dad made me read an article in the local paper concerning how Elton announced he was 'bisexual'. I remember after reading that I put my Elton albums away and not listening to them anymore. Since that day, when I was about 15 or 16 years old, I have grown. Met a few 'gay' people and frankly, they are some of the nicest people I have ever known. But still, personally, I think Elton has been living off the music he created back in the 70s, because nothing I have heard since then quite measures up. That was 40 years ago. What has he done since then? Sure, lots of albums, but was there any good songs after Bernie Taupin was no longer involved? I don't think so."

I like Elton John's old music but could not stand this movie. It was like watching a really weird version of High School Musical. The fact he was involved with as producer also made it feel like a self-absorbed view of just how important he sees himself. Sort of like his 3 year going away tour.
