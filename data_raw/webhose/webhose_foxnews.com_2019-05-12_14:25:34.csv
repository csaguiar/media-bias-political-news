'Holy Stairs' climbed by Jesus before crucifixion opens for first time in 300 years News,www.foxnews.com,Caleb Parke,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values/holy-stairs-jesus-climbed-before-crucifixion-open-after-300-years,"The 28 steps of Rome&apos;s Scala Santa, or ""Holy Stairs,"" are believed to be part of Pontius Pilate&apos;s Jerusalem palace where Jesus was tried before being sentenced to crucifixion. EGGS SHOW KIDS THE &apos;TRUE MEANING&apos; OF THE HOLIDAY ""I already did it when it was wooden steps but it&apos;s much more moving now,"" one pilgrim told AFP News. ""If you think about the fact that Jesus was here, and where he was held and where he suffered, it&apos;s very emotional.""

According to tradition, the marble stairs were brought to Rome by St. Helena, Emporer Constantine&apos;s mother, around 300 years after Christ&apos;s death and when Christianity was the religion of the Roman Empire.
The stairs were opened to pilgrims Thursday until Pentecost, a total of 60 days. The stairs have been encased in wood since 1723 to protect them from being worn down further when Pope Innocent XIII decided it could no longer stand the wear and tear of millions of pilgrims.
“If you close your eyes for a moment, you can imagine yourself back in the medieval era, the last time that people scaled these steps on their knees,” said Guido Cornini, a curator from the Vatican Museums.

Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, Vicar General of the diocese of Rome, blessed the staircase before crowds of Catholic congregants got down on their hands and knees to ascend the deeply worn marble stairway, as is the tradition.
There are three crosses along the stairs, believed to be the locations where Jesus fell and there are drops of his blood. Pilgrims kissed the crosses as they made their way up, with protective covers over their shoes to maintain the marble.
The steps lead to the Sancta Sanctorum, or Holy of Holies, which was once the private chapel for popes and where several Roman Catholic sacred relics are stored.
The restoration of the steps was funded by Patrons of the Arts in the Vatican Museums and will be open until June 9, after which they will be covered once again.

The arrest of Assange reignites a debate with no easy answer: Is the former computer hacker and founder of WikiLeaks a journalist or not? His lawyers are quick to characterize the case against him as a threat to all journalists. (Stefan Wermuth/Pool Photo, File) COPENHAGEN, Denmark – When Julian Assange sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012, he was fleeing from sexual assault accusations against him in Sweden. Swedish authorities could still go after the WikiLeaks founder, who was arrested Thursday after Ecuador withdrew its protection and allowed British police to drag him out of the embassy. A closer look at the case: ___
WHAT WERE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ASSANGE IN SWEDEN?
Swedish prosecutors opened an investigation into Assange after two women accused him of sexual offenses during a 2010 visit to Sweden.
Assange denied the claims. He left for Britain in September of that year, and in November, a Stockholm court approved a request to detain Assange for questioning. Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant for him.
___
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE ACCUSERS?
Assange met both women in connection with a lecture on Aug. 14, 2010, in Stockholm. One was involved in organizing an event for Sweden's center-left Social Democratic Party and offered to host Assange at her apartment. The other was in the audience. After Assange had sex with both within a week, they went to police together to seek advice. A police officer who heard their accounts decided there was reason to suspect they were victims of sex crimes and handed the case to a prosecutor.
___
WHEN AND WHY WAS THE SWEDISH CASE CLOSED?
In June 2012, Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy to avoid arrest, fearing extradition to the United States. In 2015, Swedish prosecutors dropped a case of alleged sexual misconduct when the statute of limitations ran out. That left a rape allegation. Two years later, prosecutors dropped the probe into the rape claim, saying there was no way to detain or charge Assange ""in the foreseeable future"" because of his protected status inside the embassy. Authorities said it was ""no longer proportionate"" to maintain the European arrest warrant.
After Sweden dropped the case, Assange remained inside the embassy because he was still subject to arrest in Britain for jumping bail.
___
CAN SWEDEN REOPEN THE CASE?
Yes. Swedish prosecutors have said the case could be reopened before the statute of limitations for the rape claim ends in August 2020. After Assange's arrest on Thursday, the prosecution's deputy director, Eva-Marie Persson, was tapped to look into a request from a lawyer for one of the accusers to find out whether the case can be reopened.
Elisabeth Massi Fritz, the lawyer for the woman who reported being raped by Assange, told The Associated Press that she would ""do everything"" to have the Swedish case reopened so Assange can be extradited to Sweden and prosecuted.
___
WHAT IS SWEDEN'S DEFINITION OF RAPE?
Under the Swedish criminal code, rape is defined as forced sexual intercourse initiated by one or more people without consent but also intercourse and comparable sexual acts against someone incapable of giving consent (fear or unconsciousness, for instance.) In 2018, Sweden passed a new law that criminalizes sex without consent as rape, even when there are no threats, coercion or violence involved.
___
CAN SWEDEN REQUEST HIS EXTRADITION?
Yes. Ove Bring, professor emeritus of international law at Stockholm University, said a new European arrest warrant for Assange could be issued, ""but we are not there yet."" Persson said the case would be reviewed, but that no investigation has resumed and no timetable set.
___
IF SENT TO SWEDEN, DOES ASSANGE RISK EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES?
Bring concluded that an extradition to the U.S. is ""completely unthinkable"" if the person is wanted for ""political reasons."" The decision would be up to the Swedish government, with input from the prosecution and a veto right given to Sweden's Supreme Court in cases where the requested person does not accept to be extradited.

Bernie Sanders’ challenge: Standing out in a field of copycats,www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-challenge-standing-out-in-a-field-of-copycats,"What makes Bernie Sanders a front runner among 2020 Democrats? Fox News contributors Tammy Bruce and Donna Brazile react to the top picks for Democrats in the 2020 presidential elections. CONCORD, N.H. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. But the self-proclaimed democratic socialist arguably accomplished a more lasting feat. He changed the conversation – bringing one-time fringe positions like a ""Medicare-for-all"" single-payer health care system, a massive increase in the national minimum wage, and free tuition at community colleges and some public schools into the mainstream of the Democratic Party’s agenda .
WATCH THE BERNIE SANDERS TOWN HALL ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL AT 6:30 PM ET MONDAY
Now, his own success in shaping that agenda has raised an obvious challenge: He's no longer the only candidate in the field who stands for these issues. In fact, he's one of many.
Crystallizing this conundrum, the senator this week re-introduced an updated version of his Medicare-for-all bill and was quickly joined by four of his rivals for the nomination -- with Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts all co-sponsoring.
It was the latest example of how, as the independent senator from Vermont runs a second straight time for the Democratic presidential nomination, he's both leading the charge on these policies but also fighting to stand out in a field of nearly 20 candidates, many like-minded. Video
For the time being, polling suggests primary voters are enthusiastic about the original purveyor of these proposals. He consistently rates at the top of the field alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to jump in. Sanders himself is quick to remind voters he was the one promoting these ideas before they were so popular.
“I want to offer a very special thanks to the people of New Hampshire. In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off. Thank you, New Hampshire,” Sanders said in March as he returned to the first-in-the-nation primary state for the first time since declaring his 2020 candidacy.
Recalling his marathon primary battle against Hillary Clinton, he said, “the ideas that we were talking about then were considered by establishment politicians and mainstream media to be ‘radical’ and ‘extreme’ -- ideas, they said, that nobody in America would support.”
He highlighted that thanks to the wave that nearly carried him to the nomination, “those ideas that we talked about four years ago that seemed so very radical at that time -- well, today, virtually all of those ideas are supported by a majority of the American people and have overwhelming support from Democrats and independents. And they're ideas that Democratic candidates all across the board are supporting.” Video
Medicare-for-all is a prime example. A January poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation – which focuses on health care polling – indicated that 81 percent of Democrats supported a single-payer insurance model. That support dropped to 53 percent for independents and 23 percent among Republicans questioned. On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, support remains limited, with Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer stopping short of endorsing it .
Sanders said his mission in the 2020 election is “to turn our vision and our progressive agenda into reality.”
But that mission is also the goal for many of his rivals for the Democratic nomination.
Sen. Warren, another politician popular on the left, is also pushing the same progressive proposals. And some of the other leading 2020 candidates – such as Sens. Booker of New Jersey and Harris of California, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg – are promoting similar plans, from criminal justice and immigration reform to refusing contributions from super PACs, corporations and lobbyists to battling climate change. Video
And some of those rivals are years younger than the 77-year-old Sanders and don’t carry with them a ‘socialist’ target on their backs.
Former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile says that while Sanders does face a lot of competition in the progressive lane for the nomination, “they don’t have the same name ID as Hillary Clinton and the same type of broad support that Clinton had” in 2016.
“I do believe this is Senator Sanders' opportunity – his last opportunity on the national level – to score a major victory. This is about delegates, not popularity,” explained Brazile, a Fox News contributor.
SANDERS SAYS FELONS BEHIND BARS SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE
It’s early in the 2020 cycle – we still have 10 months to go before the voting begins – but so far Sanders has kept other candidates from stealing his thunder.
He surged out of the gate following his Feb. 19 announcement, drawing large crowds and racking up big bucks. Sanders hauled in $18.2 million in fundraising in the first 41 days of his campaign.
The senator consistently registers in second place in double digits in 2020 polling, trailing Biden – an all-but-certain White House contender – but ahead of the rest of the field.
And even though they have plenty of candidates to choose from this time around, many of his supporters are sticking with Sanders.
New Hampshire Sanders supporter Lorna Wakefield, who came in person to see Sanders in March when he returned to the Granite State, said she’s sticking with the senator 100 percent.
“Bernie’s the one who started this all. We’re with Bernie,” she said.
And, Chris Liquori – a member of the Sanders steering committee in New Hampshire – argued, “Why settle for the imitation when you’ve got somebody who’s been doing this for 40 years, who brought the party to its knees and brought them where they are now? Why would you go with anyone else?” Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in New Hampshire. Trending in Politics"

After all, they should have rights, right?
It’s not like their selfish, violent, or criminal actions impacted anyone else’s rights, right?
WRONG.
So freakin’ wrong I don’t know where to start.
It’s time for ""First Thoughts.""
Sanders has always fought for voting rights for convicted felons but now he’s pushing for more -- voting from behind bars.
""I think that is absolutely the direction we should go,"" Sanders said recently.
""In my state, what we do is separate. You’re paying a price, you committed a crime, you’re in jail. That's bad, but you’re still living in American society and you have a right to vote. I believe in that, yes, I do.”
Vermont and Maine already allow felons to vote while serving their sentences, not surprising.
What is surprising and disheartening is the growing number of so-called conservatives pushing for similar crap. Like Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds.
She tried to get it done in Iowa by changing the state constitution to restore voting rights to former felons but, thank goodness, her fellow Republicans in the state Senate stopped it.
I’m sick of this redemption BS.
You want redemption? Serve your time and pay the consequences -- which include getting some of your rights taken away.
Oh, boo-woo felons feel disenfranchised. Guess who else feels slighted and disenfranchised?
The people who lost everything, lost a loved one or died because of the actions of selfish felons.
I also take huge issue with those advocating an end to the death penalty because it’s “the right thing to do.”
Tell that to the families whose loved ones were brutally murdered by one of your felons.
Like Marc Klaas. His daughter Polly was kidnapped as a young girl and strangled in 1993 right here in California.
Her killer, Richard Allen Davis, flipped her father off in court, was convicted of her murder, in 1996 and then sentenced to death BUT not on Gov. Newsom's watch. Nope.
The fact some people think we should just hand convicted criminals the key to the jail and the city is infuriating to me.
Whether it’s halting the death penalty, letting felons out early with the First Step Act, or advocating for their voting rights, it’s all BS.
There is NO such thing as a victimless crime, by the way.
Whether it’s dealing drugs, running a Ponzi scheme, rape or murder.
Someone’s life was damaged by that felon and no, they don’t deserve a pass.
Oh and, dear Conservatives:
Saying “Come vote for us and we’ll let you vote behind bars or better yet, let you out of prison,” is just as bad as the Democrats saying, “Come vote for us and we will give you repartitions and free things.”
And President Trump, no one filling stadiums at your rallies chants “let them out.”
Rather, it’s “build that wall,” so remember that.
Those are my ""First Thoughts."" From Los Angeles, God bless and take care.

The home where a body was found murdered is shown Friday, April 12, 2019 in Phoenix Phoenix police say a man has been arrested on suspicion of killing his wife, his two young daughters and a man who the suspect thought was romantically involved with his wife. (AP Photo/Matt York) PHOENIX – A Phoenix man who thought his wife was having an affair killed her, two of their young daughters and a man, police said Friday. Austin Smith was booked on suspicion of four counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder and three counts of aggravated assault, Sgt. Tommy Thompson said.
Bail was set at $2 million, court records show. A Maricopa County Superior Court sent Smith's case to the local public defender's office. But no specific attorney had been assigned to him by Friday evening.
Smith was arrested Thursday evening as he drove from an apartment complex where officers had responded to a shooting. There, they found the body of 46-year-old Ron Freeman. A woman and another man were shot and wounded at the complex, Thompson said.
Police initially said that Smith thought that the man who was killed was romantically involved with his wife, but a probable cause statement later filed in court said the suspect thought it was his brother, who was not named in the document, who was having an affair with her. The victim, described as a family friend, told Smith ""he was crazy"" before Smith killed him.
Officers who went to Smith's home later Thursday found his wife, 29-year-old Dasia Patterson, and their 5-year-old daughter, Nasha Smith, dead from gunshot wounds. Their 7-year-old daughter, Mayan Smith, died from apparent blunt-force trauma, and the couple's 3-year-old daughter was found uninjured under a bed at the family's home.
""It is my understanding that for whatever reason he elected not to shoot her,"" Thompson said.
The suspect told detectives during an interview that he believed ""in God's eyes it was all right for him to deal with someone in this manner who had been involved in adultery or an extramarital affair,"" Thompson said.
The court document released later in the evening described Smith punching the older daughter, throwing her to the ceiling and onto the floor, then striking the child's head several times with a baseball bat.
Thompson described the scene at the apartment complex as chaotic, with firefighters treating victims while authorities did not initially know the shooter's whereabouts.
Officers with a warrant searched the car Smith was driving and found a 9mm handgun, a .45 caliber handgun and a .223 caliber rifle they believe were used in the shootings, according to the probable cause statement.

Developers push to make gaming more inclusive for players with disabilities,www.foxnews.com,Fox News,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/developers-push-to-make-gaming-more-inclusive-for-players-with-disabilities,"""Evil Controllers"" is one of the world&apos;s biggest gaming device companies. They&apos;re best known for making controllers for top tier competitive gamers, but now they&apos;re branching out, customizing their products for gamers with physical disabilities. ""Evil Controllers"" president Adam Coe tells us they&apos;re now getting multiple orders for controllers built for amputees. Their devices are similar to the XBOX Adaptive Controller released last year - but more customized. The games themselves are also adapting to cater to gamers with special physical needs. ""Collapsus"" by Wraith Games is coming soon to almost every gaming system. The motion-control capture game has over 40 disability options. The push to help impaired gamers also includes people with visual impairments as well, like blindness. They can now enjoy games based on sound alone, using the Bose AR Sunglasses. The headset shows no video, instead relying on sound and movement for the games to work. They teamed up with game maker Playcrafting to make a game along the lines of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" - where you launch unsuspecting bovine toward a Frenchman taunting you from a high castle wall, using only the audio clues and your ears. The owner of Playcrafting also told us he sees a lot of potential for GPS and other more functional uses for the gear.
And for help with the types of disabilities we can&apos;t see, try ""Destiny’s Sword"" by 2Dogs Games. It details the journeys of a group of soldiers in a futuristic war, where - using what Creative Director Ken Hall describes as the ""Intuition Engine"" - the characters suffer through anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder that can seriously hinder gameplay. The catch: your job as a player is not to fix them, but to learn how to effectively help them through their journey.

"Trump doubles down on plan to ship migrants to sanctuary cities, says ‘Radical Left’ should be happy",www.foxnews.com,Brooke Singman,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doubles-down-on-plan-to-ship-migrants-to-sanctuary-cities-says-radical-left-should-be-happy/,"Trump doubles down on plan to ship migrants to sanctuary cities, says ‘Radical Left’ should be happy Posted on 12 Apr President Trump responded to reports Friday that his administration proposed releasing immigrant detainees in sanctuary cities by not only confirming the plan but saying it remains under “strong” consideration. Further, the president tweeted that relocating illegal immigrants to these districts should make the “Radical Left” happy.
The comments came after The Washington Post first reported that the White House proposed sending the detainees to sanctuary cities twice in the last six months. The proposal was first floated in November amid reports of a large migrant caravan from Central American making its way to the southern border. The idea was again considered in February, amid the standoff with Congress over a border wall.
PELOSI FUMES OVER WHITE HOUSE PLAN TO RELEASE IMMIGRANT DETAINEES IN SANCTUARY CITIES
The Post said the plan was shot down both times. But on Friday, Trump signaled the proposal isn’t dead.
“Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,” Trump tweeted.
“The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy—so this should make them very happy!” he continued.
The president doubled down as Democrats fumed over the relocation idea.
“The extent of this Administration’s cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said in a statement Friday. “Using human beings—including little children—as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal.”
She added: “The American people have resoundingly rejected this Administration’s toxic anti-immigrant policies, and Democrats will continue to advance immigration policies that keep us safe and honor our values.”
Pelosi’s district—San Francisco—was among the sanctuary cities the administration considered sending detainees to.
WHITE HOUSE PROPOSED RELEASING IMMIGRANT DETAINEES INTO ‘SANCTUARY CITIES’ TO TARGET POLITICAL FOES: REPORT
White House officials, though, stressed earlier Friday that the plan never went anywhere. A source familiar with discussions told Fox News that Democrats who advocate leniency toward illegal immigrants should work with the administration to find ways to transport those set for release, including in their states and districts.
The proposal was apparently rejected both times it came up by administration immigration agencies.
A Nov. 16 email from the White House to officials at several agencies reportedly asked whether migrants could be arrested and bused to “small-and mid-sized sanctuary cities” and other Democratic strongholds. Pelosi’s district in San Francisco was considered one of the areas targeted, according to The Post.
The proposal was intended to alleviate crowded detention centers, the White House told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
The same report said “the attempt at political retribution raised alarm within ICE.” An ICE official responded, noting that there were budgetary and liability issues, but also said “there are PR risks as well.”
The source familiar with the discussions argued, however, that the White House did not view this as political retribution.
“This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,” the White House told The Post.
In a statement, Deputy ICE Director Matt Albence also pushed back and said he was not pressured by the White House – though indicated such a proposal was put forward.
“As the Acting Deputy I was not pressured by anyone at the White House on this issue. I was asked my opinion and provided it and my advice was heeded. The email exchange is clear and suggesting that it indicates inappropriate pressure is inaccurate,” he said.
It is unclear, at this point, whether immigration agencies would now support the proposal.
Trump has repeatedly blasted sanctuary cities, which are areas where local authorities refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agencies. The cities are typically run by Democrats.
The president was also hit this week with questions over the administration’s past family separation policy at the border. Trump said they have no plans to revive the policy, amid renewed speculation about whether the practice could return amid a shake-up in staffing at the Department of Homeland Security including the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
Kevin McAleenan, who was serving as CBP commissioner, is replacing her as acting secretary.
Nielsen’s resignation comes amid an influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Nielsen was reportedly frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the border. But administration officials told Fox News that McAleenan best fits Trump’s requirement of being the “toughest cop” on the frontier, and that Nielsen had been viewed as resistant to some of the immigration measures pushed by the president and his aides.
By Tuesday, DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady also resigned.
And on Wednesday, Nielsen announced that ICE Acting Director Ron Vitiello would be stepping down by the end of the week.

Emergency crews look over the wreckage Friday morning April 12, 2019 of a plane that crashed on the field at Wilcox Technical High School in Meriden Thursday night. (Richie Rathsack/Record-Journal via AP) A small plane reportedly crashed into a high school baseball field in Connecticut Thursday evening, injuring two people and causing a power outage that led the administration to cancel class Friday. The pilot was performing a touch-and-go drill, which involves landing on a runway and taking off again without coming to a full stop, near Meriden-Markham Airport, when he crashed into ballfields at Wilcox Technical High School in Meriden, public information officer Sgt. Christopher Fry told WTIC.

Police were called to the scene around 7 p.m. where first responders found two men, one in his 30s and one in his 50s, near the wreckage, WTNH reported. One man was able to pull himself out of the plane without assistance. The other was pulled from the plane by emergency personnel.
No one died in the crash and no one on the ground was injured. The two occupants of the plane, who are both pilots, were both transported to the hospital to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed only two people were onboard.

The plane careened into a high tension power line, knocking it into a second power line, which resulted in a power outage. About 17,000 were without electricity due to the crash. Wilcox Technical High School canceled classes Friday.
Eversource Energy, the electric services company in the area, dispatched almost a dozen crew members to the site who were able to restore power by early Friday morning, WTIC reported. Some customers were prevented from going into their homes while crews made repairs.
The Federal Aviation Administration, which is investigating the incident, confirmed the plane was a Piper PA-28 model. The National Transportation Safety Board will make a conclusion on the probable cause of the accident, WTNH reported.

Tesla Model 3 test drive: A masterwork ... in progress,www.foxnews.com,Gary Gastelu,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/tesla-model-3-test-drive-a-masterwork-in-progress,"I recently got around to spending some quality time in a Model 3 that I borrowed from a private owner. It wasn’t the long-awaited $35,000 model ( which folks are still waiting for ), but a dual-motor Long Range with a premium interior and about 6,000 miles on it. All problem-free, according to him.
(Fox News Autos)
He said he paid $53,000 for it last year. Last week a similar car cost $48,500. Today it&apos;s $49,500. This is how Tesla’s direct sales model works. It meets demand with frequent list price adjustments, sometimes dramatic, instead of offering incentives. It differs from industry practice, and is an honest way of doing things, but for loyal customers tracking the resale value of their cars, or Wall Street investors watching the company, comes across as a bit frenetic.
One thing that won’t change is the size of the Model 3, which is more of a compact 4-door than the midsize Elon Musk and Tesla bill it as. It’s not as long and has the same rear legroom as a BMW 3-Series, a chief competitor and the quintessential compact. What makes the difference is that the overall interior volume – boosted by a front trunk where an internal combustion engine would usually be – squeezes it over the threshold for a midsize on the EPA scale.
The driver's seat isn't all the way back in this photo, but set comfortably for the author's 6-foot 1-inch frame. (Fox News Autos)
In reality, if 6-footers are in the front seats, either they are completely comfortable, or no one is. There’s nothing wrong with this. Some cars are just smaller than others, but if you’re buying a Model 3 sight unseen, as many do, don’t expect a limousine to get dropped off in front of your house on delivery day.
(Tesla)
The cabin is airy, however, thanks to a full panoramic glass roof that’s tinted just enough to dim the sunlight to a pleasant level. At least in New York in early spring. Even rear seat passengers have the sky above their heads. Below them is a synthetic leather that’s so supple it feels more like a fabric than a hide. If I could, I would upholster my entire life with it. The front seats are showstoppers that fully live up to the “premium” billing and do a lot to distract from the fact that the rest of the cabin trim isn’t any nicer that what you find in a Mazda these days.
(Tesla)
The minimalist design of the dashboard is visually stunning, however, as it stretches door to door with just a steering wheel to ruin the symmetry. In models with a wood trim, it reminds me of an Atari 2600 console . This is an interesting coincidence since the 15-inch touchscreen mounted in the center of it is equipped with several games from the company’s archive.
The screen is also what you use to control nearly everything in the Model 3 and it houses all of its displays, including the speedometer. The positioning is fine, but considering how much real estate is available, some of the text and icons are smaller than necessary. Executing simple tasks, like adjusting the steering wheel or climate control, also require more steps than knobs or buttons would and your eyes off the road for too long. The fact that it does so many things is impressive, the ease and speed at which it does some of them less so.
(Tesla)
That’s where Autopilot comes in. Tesla’s SEMI-autonomous driving aid is a countermeasure to distractions, although it can be a bit of one itself. It has an evolving feature set that makes it hard to resist pushing the limits to see what it is capable of when you should be relying on it as backup to your own driving.
Autopilot can control the speed of the car and steer it within a lane, which it excels at on the highway. As long as it has a bead on things, it’s smoother than you would likely be. The slower and windier the road gets, the jerkier its inputs become, but I can see why videos have started popping up of “sleeping” Tesla drivers, because it lulls you into a sense of confidence in its abilities.
If you take your hand off the wheel, it will eventually warn you not to do that and then disengage. Tesla hasn’t made it clear exactly how long the Model 3 can go without any driver input, but I went about a minute before it posted a message on the screen, followed by a flashing light and then an audible alarm as it signed off. If you make it that far, you have to pull over and turn the car off to use Autopilot again. If you don’t do anything, it’s programmed to turn the hazard lights on and bring itself to a stop in the lane. But keep checking in and Autopilot will cruise indefinitely.
There are Mercedes-Benzes that can do this , but the Tesla does it better. Both systems will also change lanes with a flick of the turn signal, but here the Mercedes-Benz might have the Tesla beat. In a couple of instances, when there was a car far behind me in the passing lane, the Model 3 couldn’t seem to figure out if it should go or not and started doing an unnerving serpentine before making the move. In my experience, Mercedes-Benz’s system is more decisive.
Soon, you won’t have to be in the Tesla. It offers a Navigate on Autopilot feature that can drive the car all the way from on ramp to off ramp on the highway if you have a destination set, merging into traffic, changing lanes and passing other vehicles along the way. Initially, it would only suggest the maneuvers and require you to acknowledge them with the turn signal stalk, but there’s an update rolling out that that’s smarter and allows you to give it blanket prior approval to just go for it whenever it wants to, as long as it senses any sort of “user” input, according to Musk.
The version I tried was a mixed bag. It was seamless most of the time, but often abruptly adjusted its speed in the merging lanes, and once accelerated rapidly directly toward two cars that were far too close for it to fit between them. I didn’t wait to see how that was going to pan out and tapped the brakes.
Negotiating off ramps was both inconsistent and consistent. I used the same exit five times as a control. Twice the car asked me to take over before we even arrived at it and on the three other attempts it followed an aggressive line at a speed faster than I would have, but exactly the same one each try. Tesla constantly collects data from all of its cars on the road to update how Autopilot works, and I got the impression it had developed that specific path from the information, rather than just having the car follow the painted lines.
(Tesla)
Autopilot is a work in progress and far from perfect, and my experience suggests that you should resist the urge to convince yourself that it is. People have gotten hurt and worse by doing that. But if you treat it as an assistant, it may save your bacon someday. According to Tesla, its data indicates that you’re much less likely get into an accident with it turned on.
The Model 3 is a car you’ll want to drive yourself, anyway. And with 310 miles of range that can be replenished to 80 percent in about 40 minutes at the newest Supercharger stations , you can do plenty of that. The rear-wheel-drive model was also rated at only 310 when it was new, but an over-the-air software update in the middle of the night a few weeks ago added an extra 15 while also making all Model 3s a little faster. The tooth fairy is on notice.Tesla’s a bit hazy on how much power the Model 3 has on tap, but says it will accelerate to 60 mph in under 4.5 seconds. That speed arrives in near silence with all of the immediacy that electric motors are known for.
(Tesla)
The steering is similarly responsive and the Model 3 feels solid as a steel brick, despite concerns raised by Consumer Reports and others about its long-term reliability. Its tires are a little stiff for the New York metro area’s rutted roads, but the overall blend of ride and handling is superb for car that doesn’t have an electronically controlled suspension. Turn up the juice in a bend and you’ll find that it’s tail-happier than a typical all-wheel-drive car, but that’s the fun way around one. If not the most reassuring for everyone onboard.
The problem with making a final assessment about the Model 3 is that it’s a constantly moving target. Even in the time since I started writing this, Tesla altered its model lineup and added a leasing program . One thing is for certain: There’s no electric car anywhere near its price range that comes close to competing with it, and a lot of the liquid-fueled ones have trouble, too.

Teen accused of killing his mom escapes California jail,www.foxnews.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/teen-accused-of-killing-his-mom-escapes-california-jail,"Ike Souzer escaped the Orange County Juvenile Hall, somehow got onto a roof and then jumped a perimeter fence just after midnight Friday, said Steve Sentman, chief probation officer for the county. Jail staff spotted Souzer on the roof, then turned on a facility-wide alarm and called the sheriff&apos;s office, he said.
Sheriff&apos;s Capt. Mike Peters said deputies were ""very quick"" to respond but Souzer was able to elude capture.
The sheriff&apos;s office released surveillance footage showing Souzer tending to an apparent wound on his leg shortly after escaping and then walking seemingly casually away from the facility. The 6-foot, 200-pound teen was wearing red pants and a white shirt.
""We are still searching and widening our search as we go along,"" Peters said at a news conference. ""We&apos;re following up on every lead possible and making sure that no rock is unturned.""
He said the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service have joined the search.
There&apos;s no evidence that Souzer was armed but the public should call 911 if they think they&apos;ve spotted him, Peters said.
""We just want his safe return back into custody,"" he said.
Sentman said it&apos;s the first escape from the 434-bed facility in at least two decades and that an investigation is underway into how it happened.
Souzer has been in custody since he was 13, when he was arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing his mother, 48-year-old Barbra Scheuer-Souzer. His escape came in the middle of Souzer&apos;s trial on a murder charge in juvenile court, said Kimberly Edds, a spokeswoman for the district attorney&apos;s office.
Souzer&apos;s public defender, David Hammond, didn&apos;t immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.
A Gofundme page for Scheuer-Souzer says she was so good at helping her son with autism that she went back to school to help others with the condition and was about to graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles.
""Through her unconditional love and commitment, she helped her son go from non-verbal to verbal status,"" according to the page. ""Her whole goal was to help her son and the autistic community by giving back and serving the needs of others.""
Scheuer-Souzer had three other grown children and three grandchildren.

The paper also stressed that the column’s author, Luke O’ Neil, is not a staff writer. A statement from The Globe reiterated the points made in that note.
""The Globe Opinion page removed from our website the April 10 column by freelance writer Luke O&apos;Neil on former homeland security chief Kirstjen Nielsen.,"" it said. ""The column should never have been published. Editorial protocol was not followed and the column did not receive sufficient editorial oversight. Globe Opinion is a platform for a variety of viewpoints and welcomes a range of voices to promote discussion on important topics in a productive way.""
“Keep Kirstjen Nielsen unemployed and eating Grubhub over her kitchen sink,” read the headline of the article published on Wednesday, written by O’Neil, an occasional writer for the Guardian, with bylines as well in The New York Times, New York magazine, and elsewhere.
“One of the biggest regrets of my life is not pissing in Bill Kristol’s salmon,” read the article’s first sentence before it was shortly scrubbed, with the Globe issuing a prominent editor&apos;s note saying that the previous tone wasn’t appropriate.
“A version of this column as originally published did not meet Globe standards and has been changed. The Globe regrets the previous tone of the piece,” the note read.
On Thursday, the entire article was axed.
The piece also accused Nielsen of being a “reluctant triggerman for Donald Trump’s inhumane policies of ethnic cleansing” and called for throwing out current and former administration officials from restaurants over the Trump administration&apos;s zero-tolerance enforcement of illegal immigration practices that existed prior to Trump&apos;s election.
O’Neil wrote that the 2016 election “was the last time I remember being proud to be an American.” Last year, Nielsen, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and others from the administrationwere forced to leave restaurants due to rowdy protesters.
The author then criticized media figures for “scolding” the protesters who ushered the officials from public places, stating that he supports America becoming a country where Republicans aren’t allowed to eat at certain restaurants.
O’Neil admitted that the situation at the southern border predates the Trump administration, and added that members of both the Trump and Obama administrations should be sent to prison, or at least thrown out of a restaurant.
 O’Neil’s current status with The Boston Globe was not available.

""I said, &apos;It&apos;s just a joke! Did you really believe?&apos; They all believed it,” Coster-Waldau said. “They&apos;d also called my manager. HBO had started to talk about suing me and it had gotten out of control.""
On Tuesday night, Coster-Waldau played a prank with fewer consequences on “ Jimmy Kimmel Live .”
The star was discussing fan theories with the late-night host when he suggested one prediction he thought might come true — though it ended up being a joke about a soccer team in the U.K.
“There’s also this thing about a guy called Bielsa, which is a guy who comes and magically transforms this world for the good,” Coster-Waldau said, explaining the fake fan theory.
Though Kimmel fell for the joke, the actor eventually admitted it was a reference to Marcelo Bielsa, the manager of Leeds United.

Students at Mormon-owned BYU urge honor code compassion,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/students-at-mormon-owned-byu-urge-honor-code-compassion,"Christianity Published 1 day ago Students at Mormon-owned BYU urge honor code compassion By BRADY McCOMBS | Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email PROVO, Utah – Several hundred students at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University chanted ""If God forgives me, why can&apos;t you?"" during a protest Friday aimed at pushing college officials to be more compassionate with punishments for violators of rules banning things that are commonplace at other colleges — including drinking, premarital sex, beards and piercings.
The demonstration was part of an informal campaign that started with an Instagram account created earlier this year by a former student who had a negative experience with the college&apos;s honor code office. That led to a flood of stories from other students claiming they had negative experiences over transgressions and punishments.
People held signs such as ""Stop playing God"" and ""Practice compassion"" on the campus in Provo, south of Salt Lake City. Riley Mabry, a 21-year-old student from Memphis, Tennessee, carried one with a picture of Jesus and the words, ""The only big brother I need watching me.""
""We shouldn&apos;t live in fear of messing up,"" said Mabry, who is bisexual. ""That doesn&apos;t align with the teachings of the church. One of the biggest tenets is that we are capable of repentance and forgiveness.""
Some students want parts of the honor code changed and others want punishments reduced, saying they agreed to adhere to the code when choosing to attend BYU, which is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Nearly all students are members of the faith. Current punishments for violations range from discipline to suspension and expulsion.
The ""Restore Honor"" group that organized the protest wants the honor code office to be more forgiving and less judgmental and more transparent, said freshman Grant Frazier.
He said students who are investigated and punished by the honor code office often end up unhappy with BYU and have their spiritual growth stunted.
""I love BYU and I love the gospel,"" said Frazier. ""But we just think that our university can be doing a little better.""
This is the latest unwanted attention for BYU&apos;s honor code, which was criticized in 2016 by female students who spoke out against the school opening honor-code investigations of students who reported sexual abuses to police. The college changed the policy to ensure that students who report sexual abuse would no longer be investigated for honor code violations.
University spokeswoman Carri Jenkins said Friday in a statement that BYU wants all students to have a positive experience and are monitoring the conversations on social media and arranging meetings with students and the director of the honor code office, Kevin Utt.
The university posted a Q&A with Utt earlier this week in which he said the rules exist to ""protect the interests of the community and guide those whose behavior is not in accordance with its policies."" He said 10-15 students are expelled due to honor code violations each year with the rest remaining enrolled. The college has about 33,000 students.
Actions taken against violators are ""intended to develop students&apos; moral and ethical decision-making,"" Utt said. There is no firm set of punishments, he said, because decisions are based on context, motivation, intent and openness.
BYU graduate Brayden Smith said he was suspended after he turned himself for something that happened with his girlfriend, declining to provide specifics because he did not feel comfortable doing so. Smith said he was left spiritually damaged after he was required to perform 35 hours of community service each month and was banned from using social media or dating apps.
""There&apos;s gigantic dark mark on my collegiate experience,"" said Smith.
The code has a section dedicated to ""homosexual behavior,"" which echoes the religion&apos;s belief that being gay isn&apos;t a sin, but engaging in same-sex intimacy is. It includes a clause stating that ""all forms of physical intimacy that that give expression to homosexual feelings"" is prohibited.
Amy Jacobs, a lesbian student, said the rules should be the same for gay and heterosexual couples, who are allowed to hold hands and kiss.
The senior history major said she has lived in fear that someone would report her for an innocuous hug with another woman.
She held a sign that said, ""Report me, I&apos;m gay,"" a sarcastic nod to a common complaint among students that a culture of tattle-telling exists at the university since the honor code accepts reports of violations from other students.
""I&apos;m afraid of the honor code office,"" said Jacobs, 21, of Kaysville, Utah. ""I kind of hate myself here.""
Jacobs said she has thought about transferring to another college but stayed at BYU because she had dedicated so much time to her studies toward a history degree and had good mentoring professors.
""BYU is a good education and I want to love it, but I just don&apos;t,"" said Jacobs, who will graduate this spring. ""If I stayed a BYU any longer, it would kill me."""

Zimbabweans are gathering for a nationwide protest over the country's economic collapse and what the opposition calls the new government's ""cocktail of lies."" (AP Photo/Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi) HARARE, Zimbabwe – Thousands of exasperated Zimbabweans gathered Thursday in a nationwide protest over the country's economic collapse and what the opposition calls the new government's ""cocktail of lies."" Some cheered the protesters from kilometers-long lines at gas stations that still have fuel. President Emmerson Mnangagwa's administration is under growing pressure one year after taking office following the removal of longtime leader Robert Mugabe. Tensions remain high after July's disputed election that Mnangagwa narrowly won.
Zimbabwe's government is struggling to even arrange a reliable currency as many citizens in the southern African nation say they've seen no progress on promises of ""jobs, job, jobs."" Inflation spiked to 20.9 percent in October, the highest since 2009.
The protest played out peacefully under heavy security in the capital, Harare, with opposition supporters singing anti-government songs.
Main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, echoing some of the other speakers, said life in Zimbabwe is more difficult now than under Mugabe.
""Our lives are worse off,"" he told the crowd, promising to intensify the street protests until the political standoff in the country is resolved.
Chamisa this week said he is ready for dialogue with Mnangagwa, a longtime Mugabe enforcer. The ruling party says Chamisa, who unsuccessfully challenged the election results in court and claimed victory, should accept Mnangagwa's win before talks can commence.
The protesters delivered a petition to parliament calling for political dialogue and an end to the economic crisis, and Chamisa said he would deliver another one to southern Africa's regional bloc.
""We are assuring them that we will not use guns to fight Mnangagwa,"" he said.

Lori Loughlin didn't take a plea deal for the fraud charges she's currently facing in the college admissions cheating scandal and that's reportedly because the actress doesn't think of her actions as illegal. The ""Full House"" star and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Gianulli , are now facing 40 years behind bars after being hit with new money laundering charges earlier this week.

The source added, ""From the beginning, she didn’t want to take a deal, because she felt that she hadn’t done anything that any mom wouldn’t have done, if they had the means to do so."" Video
“So this wasn’t her being obstinate; this was her truly not understanding the seriousness of the allegation,"" continued the source.

He's survived an 8-year war to topple him and an Islamic caliphate over part of his broken country. But Bashar Assad's path is strewn with difficulties and the war for Syria is far from over. (AP Photo/Adel Hana, File) BEIRUT – It's Arab Spring, season II, and he's one of the few holdovers. The last man standing among a crop of Arab autocrats, after a new wave of protests forced the removal of the Algerian and Sudanese leaders from the posts they held for decades. Syria's President Bashar Assad has survived an uprising, a years-long ruinous war and an Islamic ""caliphate"" established over parts of his broken country. As the Syrian conflict enters its ninth year, the 53-year-old leader appears more secure and confident than at any time since the revolt against his rule began in 2011.
But the war for Syria is not over yet, and the path ahead is strewn with difficulties.
The back-to-back ouster of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after two decades of rule and Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir after three, has been dubbed a ""second Arab Spring,"" after the 2011 wave of protests that shook the Middle East and deposed longtime dictators in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen.
Social media has been filled with pictures of leaders at past Arab summits, noting almost all of them were now deposed except for Assad. Some pointed out ironically that al-Bashir's last trip outside of Sudan in December was to Damascus, where he met with the Syrian leader.
In most countries of the Arab Spring, the faces of the old order were removed, but either the ruling elite that had been behind them stayed in place or chaos ensued.
In Syria, Assad and his inner circle have kept their lock on power and managed to survive eight bloody years of chaos. That resilience may keep him in power for years to come even with a multitude of challenges, including a rapidly degenerating economy and a persisting insurgency in the northwest.
___
WHAT IS ASSAD'S STAYING POWER?
Assad has survived through a mix of factors unique to him. His is a minority rule, and he has benefited from a strong support base and the unwavering loyalty of his Alawite sect, which fears for its future should he be deposed.
That support stretched beyond his base to other minority sects in Syria and some middle- and upper-class Sunnis who regard his family rule as a bulwark of stability in the face of Islamic radicals. Despite significant defections early in the conflict, the security services and military have not shown significant cracks. Loyal militias grew and became a power of their own.
Even as vast parts of his country fell from his control or turned into killing fields, Assad kept his core regime in place.
Perhaps Assad's largest asset is Syria's position as a geographic linchpin on the Mediterranean and in the heart of the Arab world. That attracted foreign intervention, particularly from Russia and Iran, whose crucial political and military assistance propped up Assad and turned the tide of the war in his favor.
The unwavering backing from powerful friends is in sharp contrast to the muddled response by the U.S. administration, and something none of the other Arab leaders benefited from in their own struggle against their opponents.
Is he completely out of the woods?
For now, Assad appears to be secure. With the help of Russia and Iran, he has restored control over key parts of the country, and the world appears to have accepted his continued rule, at least until presidential elections scheduled for 2021.
Gulf countries reopened embassies after years of boycott. Delegations from Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan have visited in recent months, discussing restarting trade, resuming commercial agreements and releasing prisoners. Although the Arab League said it was not yet time to restore Syria's membership to the 22-member organization, the issue was discussed at their annual summit for the first time since the country was deprived of its seat eight years ago.
Much of what happens next depends on Assad's ability to keep a lid on rising discontent as living standards deteriorate, and whether he is able to preserve Russia and Iran's support.
___
AN ECONOMY IN SHAMBLES
After years of war and ever-tightening U.S. sanctions, Syria's economic pinch is becoming more painful. The government's coffers are reeling from lack of resources, and the U.N. estimates that eight out 10 people live below poverty line.
Gas and fuel shortages were rampant in Damascus, Latakia and Aleppo this winter. Social media groups held competitions over which city had the longest lines at gas stations, forcing the issue to be debated in parliament.
This week, the government imposed gas rationing, limiting motorists to 20 liters every 48 hours. The crisis was worsened when reports spread about an impending price hike, prompting lines of hundreds of cars to stretch for miles outside gas stations. Oil Minister Ali Ghanem denied plans for a hike, warning of a ""war of rumors that is more severe than the political war.""
The government's inability to cope with rising needs has fueled criticism and anger even among its support base. Still, it's unlikely the discontent will set off another wave of protests. Most Syrians by now will put up with anything to avoid another slide back to violence.
Still, the United Nations describes the level of need in the country as ""staggering,"" with 11.7 million Syrians requiring assistance, nearly 65 percent of the estimated 18 million people who remain in the country, millions of whom are displaced from their homes. Another more than 5 million fled abroad during the war.
___
GOING FULL CIRCLE?
Demonstrations reminiscent of the early years of the conflict have resurfaced.
In Daraa, where the revolt started, hundreds took to the streets recently, offended by the government's plan to erect a statue of the president's father, the late Hafez Assad. Further protests took place in some former opposition areas recaptured by the government after authorities moved to enforce military conscription there despite promises to hold off.
Arrests and detentions continue to be reported in recaptured areas, fueling fear that so-called reconciliation deals between authorities and residents of former opposition areas are only facades for continued repression and exclusion.
In eastern Ghouta, which the government recaptured last year after a siege, the government has been arresting former protest leaders and anti-government groups despite reconciliation deals, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Militarily, the defeat of the Islamic State group's ""caliphate"" last month closed one brutal chapter of the war but opens the door to an array of potential other conflicts. The militant group's defeat sets the stage for President Donald Trump to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria, a drawdown that's expected to set off a race to fill the vacuum.
The focus also pivots to Idlib, the last remaining rebel bastion in Syria where an estimated 3 million people live, under control of al-Qaida-linked militants. Trending in World "
New Jersey autism rate soaring compared to other states in CDC study,www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-jersey-autism-rate-cdc-study,"The percentage of four-year-olds in New Jersey with autism spectrum disorder increased by 40 percent between 2010 and 2014, study concluded that New Jersey had the highest percentage of children with the developmental disability, which causes significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. The Early Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, which has analyzed rates of autism diagnoses for 19 years, partnered with researchers at Rutgers University to conduct a seven-state analysis of the rates of autism spectrum disorders in children across Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin.
The percentage of 4-year-old children with autism spectrum disorders in New Jersey increased dramatically between 2010 and 2014. 19.7 per 1,000 children in 2010 had a form of the disability compared to 28.4 per 1,000 in 2014, the study said.
New Jersey saw the highest prevalence of African American and Hispanic children with the disorder. New Jersey boys were also more likely to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders than girls.
Walter Zahorodny, an associate professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School who directed the New Jersey section of the study, explained to USA Today that researchers cannot give a clear reason as to why autism rates have increased in New Jersey or in other states. Children born to parents older than 30, born prematurely to an ill mother or who have certain genetic mutations may be more likely to have the developmental disability, the professor said.
Across the whole United States, 17 per 1,000 children have autism spectrum disorders, reported NBC New York . The developmental disability is generally more common among boys than girls and white children are diagnosed more frequently.
Zahorodny said there’s progress to be made in New Jersey in detecting autism earlier in life. Because the brain develops the most at the beginning of life, identifying and intervening in cases of autism early on can maximize a child&apos;s ability to function and participate in the community, USA Today reported.
""The experience of our special education system and the number of developmental specialists in our region"" suggested that New Jersey&apos;s data was probably more complete than that of other states, Zahorodny told USA Today. States that had lower percentages of autism cases probably had not identified all those affected, he "

The Hollywood staple revealed that he basks in the opportunity to portray special counsel Robert Mueller on “ Saturday Night Live ,” and even believes it’s his duty to channel the prosecutor’s bravado on the comedy sketch show.
ROBERT DE NIRO HAD A MELTDOWN OUTSIDE OF A MANHATTAN COURTHOUSE AFTER A DAY OF DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS
""I consider it my civic duty to do that part — just to be there because [Mueller] doesn't say much, but he doesn’t have to. It's that simple,"" De Niro told the Hollywood Reporter ahead of the Tribeca Film Festival in an interview published on Friday. ""I might even be happier the day that Mueller puts him in handcuffs, takes him in an orange jumpsuit and puts him away for a long time.""
In discussing the four-page assessment of Mueller’s report by Attorney General William Barr that was released last month, the “Goodfellas” star insists the summary doesn’t tell the entire story and was simply a ruse that allowed Trump to come out the other side looking more auspicious.
ROBERT DE NIRO SLAMS TRUMP WHITE HOUSE: 'LIKE A NIGHTMARE YOU REMEMBER'
""It's pathetic. You know that's interesting. That Democrats are trying to do the right thing and say, 'We're waiting for justice to come,' and then it doesn’t come,” De Niro, 75, lamented. “Or it will come in a way – Mueller presented it in a way that's up to us and Congress to make, come up with the results, but now it’s being barred by Barr. And that's to be seen now what Congress will do and how effective they're going to be.""

The actor continued: ""But I think there's going to be a lot of mass demonstrations, a lot of protests if this is not resolved. We have to know what went on. We have to know. The handwriting is on the wall.""
De Niro has long suggested that the president will serve jail time for the alleged collusion with Russia in the 2016 election.
Late last year, the “Raging Bull” performer slammed Trump as a “New Yorker who I never would want to meet, never want to meet him, and now he's president. And the reason I wouldn't want to meet him is because of the kind of person he is. As we all know now, there's nothing new. It's disgraceful, but we'll get past it."""
Warren not worried about polls: ‘It’s early.. I’m running the campaign that I want to run’,www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-not-worried-about-polls-its-early-im-running-the-campaign-that-i-want-to-run,"But the Democratic White House hopeful from Massachusetts isn’t popping in the polls. Pointing to the calendar – there are still 10 months to go until the first primary votes are cast - Warren says she’s not worried.
“It’s early and I&apos;m running the campaign that I want to run,” Warren said when asked by Fox News if she was concerned about her poll position.
“I love this,” she said as she professed her love for meeting and taking questions from voters on the campaign trail. “There’s no place I’d rather be today.”
The populist senator who’s a champion to progressives is hovering in the mid-to-upper single digits in most public opinion polls in the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination race. That puts her alongside a pack of rivals, trailing former Vice President Joe Biden – who’s all but certain to launch his campaign in the next couple of weeks – and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – another rock star on the left.
Warren came quickly out of the gate after launching a presidential exploratory committee on Dec. 31. She grabbed tons of media attention and large crowds in the first weeks of her campaign. She formally announced her candidacy at a big event in Lawrence, Massachusetts in February.
But since then, Sanders soared after his mid-February announcement that he was running, as did former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who declared his candidacy a few weeks later. Over the past month South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has gone from a long-shot for the nomination to a legitimate player.
Asked if her campaign is on course, Warren replied, “I’m happy.”
Warren took questions from Fox News and other news organizations following an event at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, her first stop in a jam-packed, two-day swing through the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.
Warren became a household name thanks to her longtime fight against Wall Street and major corporations and she’s making fighting corruption and big money in politics two central themes in her presidential campaign.
Her latest policy proposal, unveiled Thursday, is a surtax on profits of the largest corporations, which she said would prevent corporate giants from exploiting loopholes to avoid federal taxation in the wake of the business tax cuts passed in 2017 by the then-GOP controlled Congress and signed into law by Republican President Donald Trump.
“What I propose is for every company that makes a public statement of $100 million or more in after-tax income in a single year have to pay seven percent in, so we can make investments in the rest of the country,” she told the crowd.
She touted that her corporate tax proposal, along with her plan to increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy, “would raise $4 trillion over the next ten years. What could we do with that. Think about what it would mean to reduce the student loan debt burden.”
Warren added that the revenues could also increase investments in universal childcare and pre-K, housing, infrastructure and make a down payment on a Green New Deal.
She touted that “folks with power and a lot of money don’t like some of my proposals. But I’ll tell you this, in the long run this is the only way we’re going to keep this economy and this country working.”
Warren claimed her plans would have bipartisan appeal.
She pointed to Amazon making more than $10 billion in profits last year and not paying any federal taxes, and argued that “it’s not OK with Democrats. It’s not OK with independents. It’s not OK with Republicans. It’s not OK…I don’t think it’s just Democrats we’re talking to. I think we’re talking to people all across this country.”
Asked why she produces policy proposals at a faster rate than her rivals for the Democratic nomination, Warren explained that “policy is optimism.”
Warren arrived in New Hampshire hours after the president confirmed reports that he’s considering releasing detained immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities, apparently in part to retaliate against Democrats who oppose his push to extend the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
She targeted the president, saying “this is President Trump playing politics with people’s lives and do his best to distract people from the fact that his administration is not working for them. That the things he promised are not happening. And he hopes that if can stir up a little more hatred and division, that maybe people won’t notice and he’s wrong.”
The Republican National Committee targeted Warren, calling her White House run “mediocre.”
“Even Elizabeth Warren knows her platform of government-run healthcare, free college and the Green New Deal are too costly and unrealistic, which is why she keeps proposing new tax hikes to try and offset their trillions of dollars cost,” RNC spokesperson Mandi Merritt said.
Asked what she would do with the immigrants detained trying to cross the border into the country, she said “for openers, we should be helping people in Central America so that mommas who are threatened by gangs don’t feel like they have to wrap up their babies in the middle of the night and run. We need to continue our aid and help stabilize the governments down there. That’s how we prevent crisis. That’s what makes sense in these circumstances.”

Geraldo on 'The Five': Give Rep. Omar 'a break',www.foxnews.com,Victor Garcia,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/geraldo-on-the-five-give-rep-omar-a-break,"Rep. Ilhan Omar under fire for 9/11 remark On "" The Five "" on Friday, co-hosts Jesse Watters and Geraldo Rivera debated comments made by Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , regarding 9/11 and her progressive colleagues defending her. “I don't think she's a hero. I also don't think she's a victim. I think she's a below-average talent who doesn't have this sensibility to survive very much longer in Congress,” Watters told his co-hosts, criticizing Omar for her remarks and her defense.
CRENSHAW CALLS OUT OMAR FOR DESCRIBING 9/11 ATTACKS AS 'SOME PEOPLE DID SOMETHING'
Rivera asked Watters, “How do you know that?”
Watters then said that if not for her friendship with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the Democratic Party would “cast her aside because she’s not worth the trouble.” For the first time in history you have two Muslim women in the Congress of the United States. They carry an enormous burden — Geraldo Rivera on Rep. Omar and Rep. Tlaib
Omar is being scrutinized after a speech at a Muslim rights group’s event in which she described the 9/11 terror attacks as “some people did something”.
Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., have staunchly defended defended Omar and criticized her critics, saying the attacks are racist and anit-Muslim.
“What I don't like is that she never really acknowledges what she says once she's attacked. She says you're only attacking me because of my identity not what I actually said,” Watters said.
Rivera defended Omar, noted that she was receiving death threats, and compared her situation to former President John F. Kennedy’s Catholicism being debated during his presidential campaign.
That brought a response from Watters. I think she's a below average talent who doesn't have this sensibility to survive very much longer in Congress. — Jesse Watters on Rep. Ilhan Omar
“If this was a white guy saying this, a white straight male Christian freshman Democrat congressman, you don't think the Republicans would be running up the score on something like that?” Watters asked Rivera.
“It's a gotcha. I mean let her learn on the job. Give her a break, Jesse,” Geraldo said.
Co-host Dana Perino then interjected, criticizing Omar for consistently saying or releasing her controversial thoughts.
“I can remember one time where I was taken out of context. And the reason for that is because I'm thoughtful about what I'm going to say. Every week she complains about being taken out of context,” Perino said.

"Johnny Bobbitt, Philadelphia homeless man involved in GoFundMe scam, sentenced to probation",www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-homeless-man-400k-gofundme-scam-probation,"Email
Johnny Bobbitt stands in the courtroom during his sentencing hearing at Burlington County Superior Court in Mount Holly, N.J., Friday, April 12, 2019. Bobbitt, the homeless veteran who admitted to conspiring with a New Jersey couple in a GoFundMe scam that raised more than $400,000, was sentenced Friday to five years' probation. A Philadelphia homeless man who conspired with a New Jersey couple to create a GoFundMe scheme that raised more than $400,000 was sentenced Friday to five years of probation and agreed to enter a drug treatment program. Thirty-six-year-old Johnny Bobbitt Jr. pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy to commit theft by deception charges, admitting to helping Kate McClure and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico in their GoFundMe scam in November 2017, NBC News reported.
'MODERN FAMILY' STAR CALLS OUT 'HATE TWEETS' OVER SHARING GOFUNDME POST
Prosecutors said Bobbitt, a veteran who was homeless at the time, posed with McClure, who posted a fake story to GoFundMe in which she said she was raising money for Bobbitt after he generously gave her his last $20 when her car ran out of gas on the highway.
As part of a plea deal, Bobbitt will be sent to an inpatient rehabilitation center before his release and agreed to testify against McClure and D’Amico in the future. A New Jersey judge said Bobbitt will serve five years in state prison if he violates probation.
About 14,000 people donated almost $403,000 to the GoFundMe page, falling for the story. Bobbitt, who was homeless at the time, exposed the couple’s fraud when he filed a lawsuit against McClure and D’Amico in August, arguing they withheld funds and never cut him in on the deal.
McClure and D’Amico accused the homeless man of spending the GoFundMe money on family, drugs, a truck and a trailer. Federal authorities investigated the case, and prosecutors said the couple was experiencing financial troubles at the time and used the GoFundMe account as a scam.
McClure pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to commit wire fraud and will serve a 20-year prison sentence. D’Amico also faces state-level theft and conspiracy charges. Trending in US"

The Chevin cross has become a well-known Easter symbol, normally erected two weeks before Easter, made from wood salvaged after the 1996 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb which devastated part of central Manchester. (Danny Lawson/PA via AP) For Christians around the world, Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week, which includes numerous activities and celebrations that precede Easter Sunday. Common activities commemorating the Passion of Christ include performing the Stations of the Cross, which revisits Jesus’ crucifixion, Seder meals to recall the Last Supper, washing of the feet, which Jesus did for his disciples, and processions on Good Friday, the day Jesus died.
But some cultures take these celebrations beyond mere remembrances. From Palm Sunday to some extreme Good Friday celebrations to Resurrection Sunday, there are all kinds of commemorations: Jerusalem, Israel

One of the most packed places is in the Holy Land, where it all took place over 2,000 years ago. Pilgrims from around the world celebrate in their own ways, in their own language and across denominations, to visit the holy sites. One being the Via Dolorosa in the Old City of Jerusalem.
From a massive procession on Palm Sunday where thousands of Christian pilgrims climb Jerusalem's Mount of Olives to re-enact Jesus' entry into Jerusalem with palm branches to the Church of All Nations to Saint Anne Church, St. Steven's Gate (the Lions Gate), the Old City and down the Via Dolorosa singing songs and reciting blessings.
Through Good Friday, there are daily masses at the Church of Holy Sepulcher and the Garden of Gethsemane church, the Basilica of the Agony. Rome, Italy

Many Catholics make pilgrimages around the world during Lent, but one of the easiest places to visit different basilicas is the Holy City.
This year, the faithful can go up the Scala Santa, or "" Holy Stairs ,"" that were previously covered for the last 300 years. These are the steps that it is believed Jesus walked up before he was tried by Pontius Pilate to be crucified.
Attendees crawl up the stairs on their hands and their feet, which need to be covered to protect the marble. Iztapalapa, Mexico

In Mexico City residents perform a realistic ""Passion Play,"" dramatizing Christ's crucifixion and death on a cross. The local government, not the Catholic Church, sponsors the event which is designated an “intangible cultural heritage” in Mexico City by UNESCO.
Thousands of local actors re-enact Christ's walk to his death on Calvary. The person chosen to play Jesus is picked for their moral character and strength because they need to wear a crown of thorns and be flogged while carrying a 200-pound cross. He is then tied to it in a re-enactment of the crucifixion. Pampanga, Philippines

In the Philippines, participants are physically nailed — hands and feet — to a cross just as Jesus Christ was 2,000 years ago. The San Pedro Cutud Lenten Rites in Pampanga have taken place on Good Friday after a two-hour street play every year since 1962.
At least three, and as many as 12, individuals are nailed to a cross on a makeshift Calvary. Each person remains on the cross until he “feels cleansed of his sin,” while others flog themselves with bamboo sticks tied to a rope. One man has been nailed to the cross 22 times. Trafalgar Square, London

This realistic interpretation of Jesus’ death is not as graphic as Pampanga’s, but it’s still not advised for young children. The Passion of Jesus in Trafalgar Square involves more than 100 participants from the Wintershall Players, as well as horses, doves and donkeys.
Some 20,000 spectators attend the event, which has free 90-minute performances at noon and 3:15 p.m. on Good Friday, as well as big screens to ensure everyone can watch. San Vicente de la Sonsierra, Spain

Germany’s take on the suffering of Jesus is a bit tamer. The charming southwestern town of Bensheim, which just celebrated its 1,250th anniversary, has hosted an annual Good Friday procession presented by local Italian families since 1982.
Crowds gather for the theatrical performance, which begins with Judas’ famous kiss of betrayal and includes Jesus’ appearance before the Sanhedrin, Pontius Pilate sentencing him to death and Jesus’ scourging, carrying of the cross and death.

Wisconsin youth prison probe closes without charges,www.foxnews.com,TODD RICHMOND,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/wisconsin-youth-prison-probe-closes-without-charges,"The U.S. attorney&apos;s office in Madison said an investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice&apos;s Civil Rights Division found insufficient evidence that staff members at Lincoln Hills School had used unreasonable force against inmates repeatedly. The attorney&apos;s office said in a statement that prosecutors faced a heavy burden in proving that staff members willfully used more force than necessary. ""Federal prosecutors must not only prove that the force was excessive, but must also prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the staff member acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids,"" the statement said. ""In this instance, there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt a violation of the federal criminal civil rights statutes.""
Problems at the youth prison outside Irma in northern Wisconsin have been building for years. Workers say conditions got worse in 2011 when two juvenile prisons near Milwaukee closed and teens were consolidated at the facility. The FBI launched the probe in 2015.
The prison also has been the subject of multiple lawsuits, including one that resulted in a federal judge ordering sweeping reductions in the use of pepper spray, solitary confinement and shackles on juveniles.
Valerie Landowski, a spokeswoman for American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 6, which represents guards at the prison, said the union is satisfied with the a decision not to prosecute anyone. She said conditions at the prison have been deteriorating because former Gov.-Scott Walker&apos;s signature law stripping public workers of their collective bargaining rights has prevented the guards from negotiating to improve morale and safety, leaving them overworked.
""Whether or not they&apos;re exonerated in this particular case, we&apos;ll let the investigation speak for itself,"" Landowski said.
Walker signed a bill last year that requires the Department of Corrections to close the prison by 2021 and allows the agency to borrow up to $40 million to build smaller regional facilities to house serious juvenile offenders and expand the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center in Dane County.
Current Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has said the closure timeline is too aggressive. He wants to keep the prison open indefinitely until replacement facilities are built. The corrections department announced last month that it plans to build two new facilities in Milwaukee and Outagamie counties to house serious juvenile offenders.
Republican state Rep. Michael Schraa, chairman of the Assembly&apos;s corrections committee and one of the bill&apos;s chief sponsors, said he was pleased to hear the federal investigation had ended without turning up enough evidence to prosecute anyone.
""It was a black cloud hanging over the (Department of Corrections) for a long time,"" he said. ""When we visited the (youth prison) two years ago, that was one of the things they said, they felt like they were walking on eggshells. They didn&apos;t know when the hammer was going to fall. Now that it is concluded and there&apos;s no indication excessive force was used, I think the anxiety level for the (guards) will go down. That makes a better environment.""
Sen. Lena Taylor, a Milwaukee Democrat who sits on the Senate judiciary committee, said in a statement that she doesn&apos;t have ""a ton of confidence"" in the information provided to investigators.
""We know that something was very wrong at Lincoln Hills,"" she said. ""There are lawsuits, injured youth and records of excessive use of pepper spray and solitary confinement to support that belief.""
Evers&apos; spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, issued a statement saying the governor looks forward to working to get juvenile inmates the support they need in settings closer to home.
Cass Bowers, the communications director for the Wisconsin chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit resulting in the reduction in the use of pepper spray and solitary confinement. He said in an email that the investigation doesn&apos;t affect their case but a decision not to file charges ""doesn&apos;t amount to an endorsement of the practices that allegedly took place back before 2015.""

Members of Congress allegedly sexually harassed night shift staff: report,www.foxnews.com,Adam Shaw,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/members-of-congress-allegedly-sexually-harassed-night-shift-staff-report,"The IG report , first reported by Roll Call , examines the Architect of the Capitol’s (AOC) response to sexual harassment complaints over the last 10 years. It includes allegations that workers endured sexual harassment by members of Congress and their staff, “Staff have reported overhearing harassing conversations, being the target of harassment, and observing materials such as pornography, but do not speak up due to fear of losing their jobs,” the report says.
It found 57 incidents of sexual harassment reported since 2008, 44 percent of which it says were substantiated. The report notes that it is a relatively low number, but the perception remains that harassment is a problem.
The IG said that it found “reluctance to cooperate” with the inquiry from AOC, and cited it as evidence of “cultural resistance and lack of transparency at all levels.” It blasted an “outdated cultural attitude” in some departments, which it said has set a tone of “permissibility.”
In its introduction the IG report says that the results of the inquiry were “primarily positive” and said that the majority of identified gaps were already receiving attention of officials.
“No one had an answer when we asked ‘What happens if the harasser is a member of Congress?’” one employee told the IG. “This was not a hypothetical question. It happens.”
The outlet notes that dozens of lawmakers reportedly sleep in their offices rather than rent an apartment, some sleep of mattresses, futons and murphy bed -- meaning that night staff can possibly encounter lawmakers in states of undress.

President Donald Trump is weighing in on the most recent controversy involving Omar, retweeting video edited to suggest that the Minnesota congresswoman was dismissive of the significance of the Sept. 11 attacks. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump weighed in Friday on the most recent controversy involving Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, retweeting video edited to suggest that the Minnesota congresswoman was dismissive of the significance of the Sept. 11 attacks. The video pulls a snippet of Omar's speech last month to the Council on American-Islamic Relations in which she described the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center as ""some people did something,"" as well as news footage of the hijacked planes hitting the twin towers. Trump tweeted, ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET!""
Omar's remark has drawn criticism largely from political opponents and conservatives who say the congresswoman, one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress, offered a flippant description of the assailants and the attacks on American soil that killed nearly 3,000 people and pointed the U.S. toward war.
Neither Trump's tweet nor the video includes her full quote or the context of her comments.
Omar told CAIR in Los Angeles that many Muslims saw their civil liberties eroded after the attacks, and she advocated for activism.
""For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,"" she said in the March 23 speech, according to video posted online. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""
CAIR was founded in 1994, according to its website, but its membership increased dramatically after the attacks.
Many Republicans and conservative outlets expressed outrage at Omar's remarks.
""First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something,'"" tweeted Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, a retired Navy SEAL who lost his right eye in 2012 in an explosion in Afghanistan.
""Here's your something,"" the New York Post blared on its cover beneath a photograph of the flaming towers.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she wants to hear from Omar about the comment, but the Minnesota Democrat doesn't seem to be backing down.
Omar tweeted a quote from former President George W. Bush shortly after the attacks, when he said: ""'The people — and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!""
""Was Bush downplaying the terrorist attack?"" Omar tweeted. ""What if he was a Muslim.""
A pair of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates waded into the debate to condemn Trump's tweet and to stand with Omar.
""She won't back down to Trump's racism and hate, and neither will we,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted.
""The president is inciting violence against a sitting congresswoman — and an entire group of Americans based on their religion,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wrote, also on Twitter.
Omar has repeatedly pushed fellow Democrats into uncomfortable territory over Israel and the power of the Jewish state's influence in Washington. She apologized for suggesting that lawmakers support Israel for pay and said she isn't criticizing Jews. But she refused to take back a tweet in which she suggested that American supporters of Israel ""pledge allegiance"" to a foreign country.
Her comments sparked an ugly episode among House Democrats when they responded with a resolution condemning anti-Semitism became a broader declaration against all forms of bigotry. Trending in US"
Nebraska GOP critical of college speaker's abortion stance,www.foxnews.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nebraska-gop-critical-of-college-speakers-abortion-stance,"The state party&apos;s executive director, Ryan Hamilton, released a statement Thursday saying Creighton University should find a different commencement speaker and ""take a stand for their pro-life values."" The university declined to comment.
""Creighton is a Jesuit institution formally affiliated with the Catholic Church, one of the country&apos;s most consistent and reliable advocates for pro-life causes,"" Hamilton said. ""Nebraska is a pro-life state and Republicans are a pro-life party.""
He said Kerrey voted against banning late-term abortions while in the Senate, calling him a ""pro-abortion advocate.""
Kerrey, who also formerly served as Nebraska&apos;s governor, said he supports Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
""That doesn&apos;t make you pro-abortion,"" he said. ""That makes you pro-civil rights.""
Kerrey said he won&apos;t speak at the May 18 commencement if his presence would be a distraction.
""I don&apos;t want this to be about me,"" Kerrey said. ""It&apos;s about the students.""
Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb accused Republicans of demanding protection for freedom of speech on college campuses while pressuring a private university to cancel Kerrey&apos;s speech ""because they do not agree with Sen. Kerrey&apos;s words.""
Kleeb also questioned the GOP attack on Kerrey, a Vietnam veteran who lost part of a leg in combat and was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism during his service.
""Sen. Kerrey put his life on the line to defend our American values,"" Kleeb said.

This photo provided by Caddo Sheriff's Office shows former Catholic priest Gilbert Gauthe. The U.S. Catholic diocese where the first widely reported case of clergy sex abuse became public in the 1980s is releasing a list, Friday, April 12, 2019, of clergy who face credible accusations of sexual abuse. The names of 33 priests and four deacons are on the list. Other Louisiana dioceses have reported about 150 priests, deacons and other clerics. There may be some overlap, since the Lake Charles diocese was carved out of the Lafayette diocese in 1980. The Lafayette Diocese employed the first widely known abuser, Gauthe, who pleaded guilty in 1985 to abusing 11 boys and testified that he’d abused dozens while serving at four churches in the diocese. (Caddo Sheriff's Office via AP) NEW ORLEANS – The U.S. Catholic diocese where the first widely reported case of clergy sex abuse became public in the 1980s released a list Friday of 33 priests and four deacons credibly accused of sexually abusing a minor or vulnerable adult. The list released by Bishop Douglas Deshotels of Louisiana's Diocese of Lafayette identifies three priests who were convicted or pleaded guilty but did not indicate where any of the 37 was accused, let alone give details of the accusations.
It gives each man's birth and ordainment year, assignments, and his status, such as whether he was removed from the clergy, resigned or both. Three were removed last year.
Unlike bishops in some other dioceses, Deshotels did not release the names of people in religious orders who were accused while working in the diocese. He wrote in a pastoral letter released Wednesday that any such disclosures are up to the orders.
The Lafayette diocese employed Gilbert Gauthe (goh-THAY), who pleaded guilty in 1985 to abusing 11 boys but testified that he had abused 35 youngsters while serving at four churches. Gauthe himself was named on the list as one of two priests who both resigned and were removed from the priesthood in 1983.
""In 1984,"" Deshotels wrote, ""the Diocese of Lafayette was plunged into the heart of a terrible darkness when, for the first time, publicly, the Catholic Church was confronted with the harsh reality that men consecrated for God's work had betrayed their sacred trust.""
But the list made it clear that private confrontation came much earlier. The earliest dates are for Cornelius Van Merrianboer, a priest who was born in 1898, ordained in 1924, resigned in 1933 and died in 1960.
Other credibly accused priests resigned in 1968, 1973 and 1978; two died in 1970 and 1977; and two retired in 1979 and 1982.
One was removed in 2016, the year Deshotels began leading the diocese, and three in 2018.
At least three names also were among 12 released Thursday by the Diocese of Lake Charles, which was part of the Lafayette diocese until 1980.
That apparently brings the number of credibly accused priests in Louisiana to 185.
The Archdiocese of New Orleans described 57 cases in November. The Diocese of Baton Rouge has reported 41, the Diocese of Alexandria 27, and the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux, 14.
The Times of Shreveport reported in February that 17 names on the Alexandria list had ties to north Louisiana, but the Shreveport diocese had not received any allegations of abuse by a bishop, priest or deacon since being carved out of the Diocese of Alexandria in 1986.
Deshotels' letter noted that some people who have accused priests or deacons may not find those names on the list.
""Be assured that your report was treated with the utmost seriousness and respect, but the standard for establishing credibility may not yet have been met,"" he wrote. ""If you, or anyone, has further knowledge which would establish credibility, we implore you to please come forward to civil authorities"" and then the diocese.
""We have come to believe that involving law enforcement at the outset of an allegation is the prudent thing to do,"" Deshotels wrote.
He also encouraged anyone who has been abused as a minor or vulnerable adult but has not reported it to come forward. Trending in US"

A former New Mexico inmate has won a $2 million verdict in a lawsuit accusing corrections officers of leaving him and other prisoners in a van on a summer day as some passed out and others screamed and rocked the vehicle in hopes of rescue.
The Roswell jury returned the award late Thursday, more than three years after Isaha Casias sued the New Mexico Department of Corrections and two prisoner transport officers. He accused the officers of leaving him and 10 other shackled prisoners in the back of the vehicle parked outside the state penitentiary in Santa Fe in 2013.
The officers didn&apos;t come back for an hour, and Casias said he passed out in that time.
When they opened the back doors, Casias said he fell and hit the vehicle&apos;s bumper while unconscious. He suffered wrist and back pain that went untreated for weeks as he served his prison sentence, the lawsuit said.
""I would like for a human being to be treated like a human being,"" Casias said in a phone interview Friday. ""No matter what the situation, we are still human beings. We still have rights.""
Casias was convicted in 2013 of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm or destructive device by a felon, according to court records. He was released from prison in August 2014.
He said he was satisfied with the verdict. His attorney, Matthew Coyte, said he was glad the judgment came after a jury trial because he believes it can improve the chance of the case leading to reforms.
Coyte said he was not aware of the Corrections Department enacting any policy changes in recent years for improving protocols during prisoner transports.
An attorney for the Corrections Department and the two officers named in the lawsuit — Taracina Morgan and Herman Gonzales — did not respond to phone messages requesting comment.
The two officers were found to have violated department policy, according to an investigative document.
Coyte said other inmates who had been in the van served as witnesses. But the depositions of those still in custody had to be taken behind bars instead of in a courtroom because they refused to get into a prisoner transport van again."
