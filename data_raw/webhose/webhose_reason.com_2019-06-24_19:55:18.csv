The situation at the Mexican border may, for the migrants and for DHS, be an emergency, but calling it a military emergency and using DoD appropriated funds to address it is a big stretch. It is, in any case, far from an emergency in its impact on people in the US near the Mexican border.
President Trump failed to convince the Congress of the need for these funds, and now must (or should) resort to the bully pulpit the presidency gives him. It may be unfortunate for his cause, but he has over used that, through Twitter and other media, to the point it may have become ineffective."

The ethic of judicial independence, and the idea that the common learning of the law (which was not precisely precedent, Inns talks, or books, but could be gleaned from them) offered a competence separate from the charms of the sovereign’s power (cf. Weber) takes hold with Coke v. Ellesmere. Blackstone, which became the vade mecum for itinerant colonist lawyers, embraced this challenge to Parliamentary sovereignty, although the principle ended up not taking hold in the UK. But it’s not illogical to think that a legal culture that had grown up isolated from the jurisdiction of the common-law courts would interpose a check on legislative supremacy. (With the benign neglect of Parliament and the lack of jurisdiction of the writs-courts, cases and controversies ran to Privy Council.)
The interesting thing, though, is the competence asserted. English judges knew the law, so they could confidently speak truth to power. There’s not really a tenable argument to say that the Supreme Court knows the Constitution better than Congress does. It’s become the umpire, not the expert on the rulebook."

Recall just before the midterms: There was a caravan of men, women and children moving slowly on-foot up through Central American. This had occurred before and the result would be the same this time : The crowd would thin as it moved north; it would approach the border numbering in the hundreds to apply for asylum; U.S. border security would handle the situation. But this time was an election, so instead :
1. Trump claimed that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed” in with the group. There was no evidence of this, then or now.
2. Trump claimed it was “actually mostly men” who were “pushing the few kids right up to the front”. This was pure lying.
3. Trump said, “You look at that, it almost looks like an invasion. . I think it could be considered an invasion of our country”. This was either delusional panic or still more lying.
4. Trump said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if George Soros was funding the caravan. This was either stomach-churning pandering or stomach-churning paranoid delusion, one or the other.
5. Trump gave a speech bragging, “They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,” he said. “I told them, consider it a rifle.” Having been in the military, I can assure you military commanders down the chain of command did not appreciate his juvenile crap.
So Trump sent 6,000 troops and promised 10k more. For form’s sake, Defense Secretary James Mattis said, “We don’t do stunts in this department” before acting as stunt coordinator. The Army commander overseeing the mission began drawing-down his troops just after the election, even before the refugees reached the U.S. port of entry near Tijuana. Trump, of course, stopped mentioning the “invasion” caravan immediately after the voting ended.
It was a cartoon spectacle worthy of a banana republic. Who’s “understanding of military history” would you trust, Federal District Judge Haywood Gilliam or Donald John Trump?"

In any event this looks to be about whether Congress has denied funds for the item (or the purpose.) Not about whether Congress has voted funds for the item (or purpose) but less than the government would like to spend.

Go look up the The Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the powers of the federal government to use federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States. It dates from 1878, but represents a bedrock principle of federalism which long predated that.
It has exemptions, such as those which allowed Eisenhower to call up military forces when state authorities refused to suppress violence against people exercising their constitutional rights. And it’s been modified – such as in 2006, with the provision that “armed forces could restore public order and enforce laws in the aftermath of a natural disaster, terrorist attack or incident, or other condition”.
But almost everyone agrees – regardless of their ideology : The United States military should be involved in enforcing this country’s domestic laws to the absolute minimum possible extent and degree. Immigration enforcement is a matter of domestic law, executed by domestic law enforcement. Migrants and the so-called caravans are NOT invasions, despite Trump’s tin-horn third-world-grade theatrics. Sorry, Toranth, but even you can’t make a heroic battle from a few hundred ragged men, women and children on foot – your sepia-colored nostalgia notwithstanding.
They are the purview of domestic enforcement agencies, exactly as Judge Haywood Gilliam said. Since you’re swimming in confusion about this, let me assure you Gilliam would welcome military action when Mexico sends tanks across the border. But that’s not what we’re discussing, is it?"

First, discussion of the basis for standing is very weak. It is nonexistent in the standing section. The opinion there asserts the plaintiffs have an interest in the case without any supporting facts. Standing is first discussed in the irreparable injury section. The plaintiffs assert that their recreational interests in the area would be damaged. The opinion simply accepts this assertion at face value. It doesn’t even explain why they think this is so, let alone recite any evidence to support it. Similarly, it accepts the plaintiffs’ assertion they have organizational standing at face value. It doesn’t explain why the plaintiffs are compelled to initiate this litigation, as opposed to doing so voluntarily. Nor does it provide any evidence funds were actually diverted to do so. For all we know, taking on this case might have resulted in a net increase in their funding and benefitted rather than harmed them.
A second weakness is it provided very little discussion of what is meant by terms like “emergency” and “unforeseeable.” I agree with the ultimate outcome. But in an important case like this, I think the court should have taken a more scholarly approach, canvassing a more comprehensive set of sources before concluding that these terms exclude the circumstances of the Administrations current conduct.
In short, I think the opinion probably got it right. But it was just sloppy about critical issues in an area that really calls for the exercise of care. Before a judge enters into a showdown between Congress and the President, they should really take great care to ensure standing is established and there is a basis for the judiciary butting in. And matters of this nature really need to be decided in a deliberative, careful, and scholarly way."

“Hate makes a comeback in the Pacific Northwest”
[…]
“SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Nearly two decades after the Aryan Nations’ Idaho compound was demolished, far-right extremists are maintaining a presence in the Pacific Northwest.
[…]
In 2018, at least nine hate groups operated in the region of Spokane and northern Idaho, including Identity Evropa, Proud Boys, ACT for America and America’s Promise Ministries, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The center does not track how many members belong to each group.
[…]
Keegan Hankes, a researcher for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the number of hate groups is growing across the U.S., driven in part by a toxic political culture. The human rights group counted 784 active hate groups in the U.S. in 2014 and 1,020 in 2018….”

There are very few activities which reduce the wealth of mankind as thoroughly as war, or concentrate the powers of government. But even given the NAP, war is at times indicated, as sad as that is; “optional” wars not included.
And then people vary in their ability to tolerate stress; most doing pretty well. Witness most of those returning from WWII and the Korean war; Eleanor proposed isolating returning WWII vets until they were ‘civilized’ again. Not a good idea.
So let’s despise and oppose “optional” wars as the friend of government and the killer of wealth, let’s despise non-optional wars but tolerate them. And let’s be careful judging people’s response to violence from a bunch of 3rd-party anecdotes. Especially in the case where (unlike the present commenter) they chose to join."

Perhaps hunters have a right not to be prosecuted for things they did before the recession. But does this also give them a permanent right to continue to remain in the sanctuary and hunt there afterwards?"
