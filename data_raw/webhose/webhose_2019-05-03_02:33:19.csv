Polish priest ‘very sorry’ for Harry Potter book burning,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2019/04/03/polish-priest-very-sorry-for-harry-potter-book-burning/,"Polish priest ‘very sorry’ for Harry Potter book burning By - April 3, 2019 7:31 PM Three Polish priests had burned a number of books last week, saying they were ‘linked to the occult and magic’. (Reuters pic)
WARSAW: A Polish priest apologised Wednesday for burning “magic” Harry Potter books, after his actions sparked a wave of protest and comparisons with totalitarian regimes and the Inquisition.
Last Sunday, after mass, three priests in a parish at the Baltic port city of Gdansk presided over the burning of items including books they said were “linked to the occult and magic”.
They had burned them in line with Biblical exhortations against practising idolatry, they said.
A post detailing the incident on a Facebook page run by the Catholic “SMS from Heaven” evangelical group went viral, drawing heavy criticism online and headlines around the world.
On Wednesday Father Rafal Jaroszewicz, one of the three priests involved, posted on the same Facebook page that he was “very sorry”.
“The fact of burning books and other objects was unfortunate,” he wrote.
“However, it was not irreverent to any social group or religion, nor was it aimed at books as such or culture.”
The offending – which included photographs showing two altar boys standing over the fire pit as Jaroszewicz prayed over the “occult” items – had been deleted, he added.
Father Jaroszewicz had appeared unrepentant in a post on Monday.
He “dreamed of the day” when “the killing of unborn babies” would trigger as much outcry as the book burning, he wrote then.
‘Ideological madness’
The books burned included some from British author JK Rowling’s famed Harry Potter fantasy series; and at least one from the Twilight vampire-themed fantasy romance stories.
But other items included a Hindu religious figurine.
The Polish Episcopate declined to comment despite calls for it to condemn the incident.
Respected commentator Lukasz Turski described the “participation of children” in the burning as “particularly reprehensible”.
“In 1821, Heinrich Heine made a prophetic statement in his ‘Almanzor’ drama: ‘When we start to burn books, we finish by burning people’,” he wrote in the liberal daily Gazeta Wyborcza.
“A hundred and some odd years later, in Nazi Germany, Heine and (Thomas) Mann’s books and many other prominent artists were burning in piles in Berlin; a dozen or so years later, crematoria burned… the victims of the ideological madness of the supposedly civilised world.”
The top-selling Fakt tabloid daily thundered that “nobody expected a Holy Inquisition”, referring to the campaign against heresy led by the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, which involved burning books and witch-hunting.
The row blew up as Poland’s influential church is struggling to deal with the fallout of unprecedented revelations about paedophilia among priests.
A Kantor Millward Brown survey published on Monday suggested that 64% of Poles want a secular state, with 29& opposed and 7% without an opinion. "

Daniel Seaman, CEO of Middle East Forum, spoke Wednesday at the Jerusalem Post Elections Conference. He said the question that interests the citizens of Israel is when there will be peace.“It is customary to say that peace is made with enemies,” he said. “But peace is made with ex-enemies. It will be possible to sit down for negotiations and turn to diplomacy when the basic assumption is reached that the Palestinians will stop terror, that they will recognize the fact that Israel is a reality - when the Palestinians recognize Israel, other countries will find it difficult to ignore it.” Seaman said that to achieve this, one must be determined to show the people of Gaza that their future will be better if they recognize Israel. “The Arab states understand that Israel is part of the Middle East solution and not so much the problem,” Seaman explained. “Israel has become a technological superpower and most countries in the Middle East understand that cooperation with us pays for them.”He said that once the Palestinians recognize Israel’s existence, then recognition will not be the basis for discussion and the parties will be better poised to examine solutions - two states or any other idea.“The time has come for the Israelis themselves to understand and internalize a strong Israel that upholds its rights, that wins,” he said. “From there, we can sit down together and bring an end to the conflict and achieve the peace we all desire.”

SHAH ALAM: A police investigating officer today told an inquest that the court should subpoena Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun over his statement that fireman Muhammad Adib Mohd Kassim was assaulted after a temple riot.
Lew Keng Joe, of Subang Jaya police headquarters, said this when questioned by lawyer Ahmad Taufiq Baharum, who is representing Adib’s family, on Fuzi’s statement.
He said such a statement by the IGP did not provide much help to his investigation.
Taufiq further questioned Lew how the country’s police chief would make such a statement on Adib’s situation.
To that, Lew said, “maybe you should subpoena the IGP and ask him”.
Earlier, Lew told the inquest he had seen photos of Adib when the fireman was initially admitted to Subang Jaya Medical Centre (SJMC) and said there were no injuries on the fireman’s face.
“If he was assaulted by others, he would have injuries on his head,” he said.
Lew also told the inquest that the investigation papers were reclassified as murder just before the post-mortem was conducted.
He said he was notified of the matter by the Selangor police just after Adib died on the night of Dec 17, 2018.
“I received this message from an officer in the state police when I was at Institut Jantung Negara that day.”
Adib’s case was initially investigated for attempted murder.
Lew said Adib’s post-mortem was done in the early hours of Dec 18 at Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL).
The inquest was called by the government amid conflicting claims on the cause of Adib’s death.
Adib was part of a response team sent from the Subang Jaya fire and rescue station on Nov 27 last year to the temple area in response to a call that cars had been set on fire. He died at IJN on Dec 17.
The inquest will resume on March 9 and March 11 before coroner Rofiah Mohamad.
Two expert witnesses from the housing and local government ministry will testify then. "

Raul Srugo, president of the Israel Builders Association, spoke Wednesday at the 2019 Jerusalem Post Elections Conference, delivering a powerful message: The upcoming elections will be more personal and less political, but one cannot ignore the housing crisis, which is one of the most critical issues in the country.In his remarks, he revealed several facts: 1 - According to data from the Construction and Housing Ministry, contractors profit around 15.1% minus taxes, which means around 8%. The investment of the government in the cost of housing is more than 60%. “So, it is impossible that the crisis starts with us. Apparently, the problem is in the hands of the government.”2 - Srugo noted that 55,000 families are formed in Israel each year. If we add to this number the couples who decide to buy, we reach around 70,000. With the expected rise in antisemitism around the world, there is expected to be further need in the coming year. But we only build around 45,000 apartments annually - so this gap is widening each year.3 - If you look at Israel in comparison to other OECD countries, we see that the basis of our failure lies in infrastructure. The next government should examine how best to investment in infrastructure, as you cannot talk about housing without concurrently discussing infrastructure. ""I think that we have done injustice to Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz. He promoted more infrastructure than any other minister, but there is still much more to go. We must invest between NIS 30 billion and NIS 40b. a year on infrastructure. We need a Transportation Ministry that is forward-thinking and plans today so we can reap rewards tomorrow.4 - The problem is building enough housing to meet our needs by 2050, when the number of citizens in Israel is expected to double. In other words, we need at least 3 million housing units. We are always proud of what we have been able to accomplish in this country in 70 years, but we need to make this next leap within 30. If it does not happen, we will see cities of temporary houses and tents.Srugo said that if Israel does not deal with the housing crisis, “we are marching toward the greatest crisis that Israel will have seen since the establishment of the state.”He said that to solve the problem, we need to think strategically.“In the early years, they said that we would raise the purchase tax and the bubble would explode,” he said. “But it did not happen -because this is not a bubble. It's a concrete ball and its growing. And to dismember this concrete ball requires strong tools.”The solution he said cannot just be subsidized housing, though that can be one aspect of a plan. He praised Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon for his “truly commendable” efforts and said he understood that the minister “wanted to be Robin Hood, taking from the rich and giving to the poor.” But he said it is not enough.“We need to build 100,000 housing units a year, Srugo continued. “We have to allow foreign workers to come and help us build.“We are not the problem, we are the solution,” he said of the Builders Association. “On the one hand, they tell us, you have foreign workers, and on the other hand you tax us for bringing in foreign workers. It is untenable.”He said that with three million apartments to be built, we must expand where we build by developing new metropolitan areas in the Golan Heights and in the Negev.He added that many mayors are opposed to programs such as Tama 38, which expands and refurbishes area apartments, and that they protest city planning.“The government must push the mayors to move forward with these plans and strengthen existing housing,” he said.

(Reuters pic)
BANGALORE: Fulham chairman Shahid Khan has apologised to the club’s supporters after the London club were relegated from the Premier League following a 4-1 defeat at Watford on Tuesday.
Needing at least a point to extend their battle against the drop, there was a glimmer of hope with the score 1-1 at halftime. However, they then conceded three times to ensure they follow Huddersfield Town into the second-tier Championship.
“I’m sorry that we let you down,” Khan said on Wednesday in a statement on the club’s website.
“Our goal this season was to build on what we achieved in promotion and deliver on our pledge to invest heavily in the squad, ensuring that Fulham would always compete in the Premier League and, no matter the result, never disappoint.
“Last night’s outcome made official what we didn’t think would be possible in August and tried desperately to remedy and avoid as the season wore on.”
The club spent an estimated 100 million pounds (US$131.79 million) on new players in the close season after gaining promotion to the top flight.
But they failed to click as a team, even naming three managers over the course of the season with Slavisa Jokanovic being replaced in November by Claudio Ranieri, who was then sacked in February and succeeded by interim coach Scott Parker.
“We hold ourselves accountable,” Khan added. “We will reflect, plan thoroughly and respond accordingly. In the weeks ahead we will communicate further as to our vision for the future.”
Fulham, who have the worst defensive record in the league having conceded 76 goals in 33 games, could still finish bottom with Huddersfield only three points behind with a game in hand. "

HONG KONG: Hellobike, a bicycle-sharing startup backed by Ant Financial, plans to raise at least US$500 million in funding as it fights for customers in a brutal Chinese market, people familiar with the matter said.
The startup could seek as much as US$1 billion as it gauges interest from both existing investors and new backers, the people said, requesting not to be named because the matter is private.
While the Shanghai-based company’s valuation wasn’t clear, in June it said it was worth US$2.3 billion.
Just a few years after Chinese startups built dockless bike-sharing into a global business, the sector is floundering as pioneer Ofo flirts with bankruptcy and Mobike shows no signs of ending losses.
Hellobike, a relative late-comer, emerged as a strong contender with the backing of Ant Financial, which is leveraging the platform to win mobile payments business.
Though the funding may look surprising given the financial tumult, Hellobike is part of a proxy war in China.
Ant Financial is the finance affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which is locked in brutal fight for e-commerce customers with Meituan Dianping, the owner of Mobike.
Hellobike and Ant Financial, formally known as Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group, declined to comment in separate e-mailed statements.
While Hellobike has managed to remain a standalone entity and now has 200 million registered users, it’s done so by repeatedly raising new capital.
Hellobike tapped investors at least twice last year, completing a 4 billion yuan (US$596 million) round as recently as December, according to Chinese news publication Jiemian.
Co-founder Li Kaizhu said in a January interview that the company would seek a future initial public offering without specifying a time-frame.
Meituan’s US$3.4 billion purchase of Mobike is proving problematic with Hellobike’s heavy investment in the sector.
Since the deal, Meituan has announced plans to pull out of most overseas markets and reduce the number of bikes it has on the streets as it tries to turn a profit. "

SEREMBAN: Mohamad Hasan, the Barisan Nasional candidate seeking to retain his seat in the coming Rantau by-election, had thought of quitting politics altogether after BN’s disastrous outing in the May 9 polls.
Mohamad, fondly known as “Tok Mat”, said he had been prepared to throw in the towel as he was fed up with politics.
“I was just really tired and hurt when I was given the notice to leave my official residence immediately after the election defeat,” the former menteri besar told a crowd in Kampung Bemban.
“I just packed my clothes and dumped them in a box. I did not know where to move my family to, and at that moment, I decided to quit.”
Mohamad, who is Umno’s acting president, said he decided to stay with one of his children in Negeri Sembilan as he did not own a house in the state.
He attributed this to his hectic schedule of governing the state for 14 years.
But Mohamad said he decided to cancel his plans to retire from politics after feeling frustrated with Pakatan Harapan ministers.
The ‘penumpang’ controversy
Mohamad again clarified his controversial “penumpang” (passengers) remark, which saw DAP lodge police reports against him, insisting that there were no racial undertones.
He said it was to describe the underperforming ministers in Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s Cabinet.
“But it was intentionally misinterpreted by Pakatan as a slur against non-Malays.”
Mohamad had, when campaigning for BN in the Semenyih by-election, reportedly said Malays were being made to feel like visitors in their own country as there were too many “penumpang” in Parliament.
In the Rantau by-election on April 13, Mohamad will be up against PH’s Dr Streram Sinnasamy and two independents, Malar Rajaram and Mohd Nor Yassin. "

(Bernama pic)
PETALING JAYA: The government today said it is working towards zero dependency on Singapore treated water for Johor and is conducting a study to ensure sufficient water supply in the state.
The study is being conducted by the water, land and natural resources ministry with the cooperation of the National Water Services Commission (SPAN) and the Johor government.
“We want zero dependency for Johor and we don’t want them to get (treated) water from Singapore anymore.
“At the same time, the study will ensure sufficient water supply in Johor in the future,” its minister Xavier Jayakumar said after launching a SPAN water conservation campaign in conjunction with World Water Day at the Petaling Jaya Boulevard.
He said the findings of this study will be submitted to Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad in a month’s time.
Johor Menteri Besar Osman Sapian had said last month the state government planned to stop depending on Singapore for its treated water supply.
At present, Singapore buys raw water from Johor at the price of 3 sen per 1,000 gallons and then sells back treated water to Johor for 50 sen per 1,000 gallons.
Asked about the water levels at dams nationwide because of the hot weather, Xavier said they were under control.
“Although the water levels at several dams are low, they are not critical. Anyway, it has started to rain and we expect certain areas hard hit by the hot weather to experience rain this month,” he said.
Earlier, Xavier announced the appointment of seven new SPAN commissioners – Steven Choong Shiau Yoon, Abdul Rashid Maidin, Gurdial Singh Nijar, Abdul Halim Jantan, V Subramaniam, Faizal Parish Abdullah and Sarajun Hoda Abdul Hassan.
“They will determine the direction to be taken by SPAN and ensure the commission functions smoothly,” he said, adding that they were picked based on their experience and expertise in water-related matters. "

(Reuters pic)
BOSTON: Actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are among 15 wealthy parents due in Boston federal court on Wednesday to face charges that they participated in what prosecutors call the largest college admissions scam uncovered in US history.
They are among 50 people federal prosecutors allege participated in schemes that involved cheating on college exams and paying US$25 million in bribes to buy the children of affluent Americans seats in well-known universities including Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California.
The scam’s mastermind, California college admissions consultant Rick Singer, has pleaded guilty to overseeing a racketeering scheme in which parents paid to help their children cheat on admissions tests and bribe coaches to present them as elite prospects in sports including sailing, crew and water polo even if they had no athletic experience.
“Desperate Housewives” star Huffman and “Full House” actor Loughlin, along with a former chief executive and a major law firm’s onetime chairman, are part of the group scheduled to make their first appearances in Boston court.
Prosecutors allege that Loughlin and her husband, Los Angeles fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, agreed to pay US$500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC’s crew team, even though they did not row competitively.
Prosecutors said Huffman, who is married to the actor William H. Macy, made a US$15,000 contribution to Singer’s foundation in exchange for having an associate of Singer’s in 2017 secretly correct her daughter’s answers on an SAT college entrance exam at a tescentreer Singer “controlled.”
Huffman later made arrangements to engage in the scheme again on her younger daughter’s behalf before deciding not to, prosecutors said.
Other accused parents expected to appear in court include Manuel Henriquez, the former chief executive of specialty finance company Hercules Capital Inc, and Gordon Caplan, the former co-chairman of the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher.
Henriquez resigned his position and Caplan was placed on leave after they were charged.
The US Education Department has opened an investigation into eight universities linked to the scandal.
Several of the schools have said they would revoke admissions offers to students who had gotten in fraudulently but not yet enrolled and would consider expelling students whose parents participated.
Prosecutors have not yet charged any applicants for illegal activity and said that in some cases the parents charged took steps to try to prevent their children from realising they were benefiting from fraud. "

KUALA LUMPUR: Attorney-General Tommy Thomas today said the prosecution of Najib Razak for seven charges in relation to former 1MDB unit SRC International shows that no one in high office is above the law.
He said the trial amply demonstrates Article 8(1) of the Federal Constitution that all persons are equal before the law.
“A former prime minister is charged under due process in the ordinary court of the land, like any other accused,” he said when reading the 11-page opening statement in Najib’s long-awaited trial.
He said Najib, who occupied the nation’s most powerful office for nearly a year, had wielded near-absolute power.
He added that Najib had also held the position of finance minister during the time when the offences were allegedly committed, thereby controlling the nation’s purse.
“In holding the office of prime minister, and thus being the highest elected public officer and head of government, the highest trust was reposed by our people on the accused,” he said.
Under such circumstances, he added, the law demands the highest standards of care in the discharge of duties and obligations as trustee of public offices.
Besides holding the twin positions of prime minister and finance minister, he said, Najib was also appointed as chairman of the board of advisers of 1MDB and adviser emeritus of its subsidiary SRC International.
He said a common feature of both companies was that the true power in directing and managing their affairs did not lie with the board of directors but with the accused.
Thomas also said this trial is the first of many prosecutions linked to 1MDB.
He said the prosecution would rely on direct and circumstantial evidence, both oral and documentary, that the accused is guilty of the charges.
“The burden is now on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the criminal charges against him in this trial,” he added.
The first prosecution witness to take the stand was the Companies Commission of Malaysia assistant registrar Mohd Akmaluddin Abdullah who gave his testimony through a witness statement.
In the examination in chief conducted by deputy public prosecutor Manoj Kurup, Akmaluddin narrated the history of the formation of SRC, Gandingan Mentari Sdn Bhd and Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd.
“SRC was registered on Jan 7, 2011, with a paid up capital of RM1 million,” he said, adding that the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission had earlier called him to record a statement.
At the outset of today’s proceedings, the defence urged Justice Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali to first hear an application that the abuse of power and criminal breach of trust charges were defective.
Lawyer Mohd Yusof Zainal Abidin, also in Najib’s legal team, said this matter should be ironed out before the trial started.
In response, ad-hoc prosecutor V Sithambaram said the prosecution would take the risk as it would have to prove the charges first before the court decided whether Najib must enter defence.
Sithambaram said Najib would not be prejudiced if the trial started with the charges unaltered.
“We could amend them in the midst of our case. They made this application with the intention of adjourning the trial,” he said.
Nazlan later fixed the trial to continue from April 15 to May 10, despite lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah and Harvinderjit Singh telling the court they had cases to attend to during that time.
“Since this is a public interest case, it must be given priority. Parties must make alternative arrangements (for the other matters),” he added "
"MySalam, not quite a private health insurance scheme",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Murallitharan M,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2019/04/03/mysalam-not-quite-a-private-health-insurance-scheme/,"MySalam, not quite a private health insurance scheme By - April 3, 2019 6:19 PM
One of the new welfare schemes that have come out as part of the government’s programmes for the B40 group is MySalam. The brainchild of the finance ministry and co-owned by the health ministry, it is, in essence, a welfare scheme designed to alleviate the cost of catastrophic health expenditure due to severe medical diagnoses – a one-off payment of RM8,000 when diagnosed with one of 36 critical illnesses – and to provide some form of financial protection for daily wage earners, as the scheme allows recipients to receive RM50 a day for up to 14 days a year.
The MySalam initiative has received a mix of bouquets and brickbats from a range of groups, the most recent being a group of organisations and individuals who sent a memorandum to Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad urging him to implement a moratorium on the programme.
Following a roundtable session I attended in Parliament last week, I think there are quite a few things pertaining to the scheme about which people are unclear.
The overriding question for many people is whether MySalam is a health insurance scheme. The government says it is not, and I agree.
At the risk of oversimplifying matters, let me explain a little. With any insurance, the people enrolling try to reduce their risk of paying a lot of money when they run into some kind of disaster by buying an insurance policy. This policy is usually a lot cheaper than the actual cost of the disaster.
For example, a car accident may cost you RM10,000. In order to avoid paying this sum, you buy an insurance policy for RM100. You may get into an accident, in which case you are covered, or you may not, in which case you lose RM100. This is called risk mitigation.
So how do insurance companies make money, you might ask. Let’s say 1,000 people buy the above-mentioned insurance at RM100, but only five people actually make a claim in a year. The money which remains is the profit earned by the insurance company.
As a profit-making concern, the insurance company has already had its experts – actuaries – calculate the probability of how many people will get into accidents per year. With that, along with other relevant information, they calculate what the price of the premium should be.
Here’s where another dimension comes into play. Insurance companies always use an additional concept called individual risk rating. Remember the RM100 premium mentioned earlier? If you compare a young driver who has had multiple accidents and an experienced driver who has been driving for 20 years without encountering a single scrape, do you think their premiums should be the same?
The insurance company will impose a higher premium of, say, RM150 on the young driver since he is more likely to get into a car crash – i.e. he has a higher risk. This is what individual risk rating means.
Health insurance works the same way. When you buy private health insurance, you are insuring yourself from the medical expenses associated with an illness. As per your insurance plan, you are covered for a certain number of health conditions.
Unfortunately, private health insurance also comes with a complex assessment of individual risk rating. Different factors such as your age, your family history, and whether you already have a certain disease, all increase your risk rating and thus the cost of your insurance premium.
Health insurance also usually covers only the cost of treatment and is almost always paid directly to the provider. For example, you have private health insurance and you are admitted for a chest infection for a week. Your final hospital bill is RM5,000. In most cases, if the admission is covered by insurance, the insurance company doesn’t pay you the money. Instead, it pays the hospital directly.
Now let’s look at the MySalam scheme and how it fits in the health insurance framework.
The MySalam scheme automatically enrols all Malaysians identified under the Cost of Living Aid (BSH). It covers not only the individual registered under the BSH scheme but also their spouse (the scheme covers around 3.7 million individuals between 18 and 55 years old).
The government, via its partnership with Great Eastern Insurance, has paid the annual premium for individuals and their spouses for five years, which works out to be about RM125 per person per year. In return, when they are diagnosed with one of the 36 illnesses listed, or are admitted to the hospital for a period of time for any disease, they are eligible to make monetary claims from the system online.
Already, there are several obvious differences between MySalam and a private health insurance scheme. First, the scheme’s participants are automatically enrolled in the system, unlike a private health insurance scheme where interested parties have to pay their own premiums.
Secondly, irrespective of your disease risk, the premiums remain the same for everyone. There is no form of risk rating.
Research shows that those in lower socio-economic groups are more predisposed to illnesses than those in higher socio-economic brackets. When you take that into account, this definitely does not seem to be a private health insurance scheme since it has enrolled people who are more at risk – something that no conventional health insurance scheme would do.
Thirdly, unlike private health insurance schemes where providers, i.e. hospitals, are directly reimbursed, MySalam reimburses clients directly, as mentioned on the website. This is apparently so that the recipient is free to utilise the money to resolve any part of the financial difficulty arising from the illness, which may or may not be directly related to treatment.
Based on these points, it is quite clear that the MySalam scheme doesn’t fit the definition of a private health insurance scheme. So what is it?
Going by its description, it seems to be a social welfare protection scheme focused on health issues, which makes it unique as one of the largest such schemes ever proposed in Malaysia.
As one of the organisations working on the ground, we at the National Cancer Society Malaysia are well aware of the financial struggles our patients and their families face when confronted with a severe illness such as cancer. It makes it impossible for them to start and finish treatment while managing their households due to the additional burden of treatment – and this is at highly subsidised government hospitals. So kudos to the government for conceptualising and undertaking such a project, which will directly impact the lives of Malaysians.
There are quite a few hiccoughs which may arise with the implementation of MySalam, and these areas need to be further improved to ensure that the scheme does what it is meant to do.
But it’s important to end on the note that MySalam as it is being deployed now is a good initiative. It is a work in progress that can be improved through input. And that’s what we want to do: to ensure that in the end, all schemes and programmes rolled out are effective and benefit us, the people.

The world’s best still waters hail from Greece,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP Relaxnews,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/04/03/the-worlds-best-still-waters-hail-from-greece/,"The world’s best still waters hail from Greece By - April 3, 2019 6:15 PM Theoni was crowned the best ‘balanced still water,’ while Athos Clear and Zeus of Olympus came joint first in the ‘still waters of character’ category. (Facebook pic)
Greece proved a big winner at the third edition of the Gourmet Waters International Contest AVPA – Paris 2019, taking gold medals in the “balanced still water” and “still water of character” categories.
The results were announced on Monday, April 1.
For the last three years, France’s Agency for the Valourisation of Agricultural Products (AVPA) has organised a contest to crown the world’s best still and sparkling waters.
Brands are invited to enter their products into the contest, in which waters are grouped into six – three for sparkling and three for still.
Their mineral content is analysed to establish in advance whether the waters are classed as “light,”“balanced” or “of character,” the last category being for waters with the highest mineral levels, giving the products a stronger or more unusual taste.
A total of 70 waters featured in this year’s contest, hailing from around 20 different countries.
In the still water categories, Greece’s products proved particularly popular with the judging panel, comprised of food industry professionals and gourmets who sampled the waters in a blind test.
Three Greek brands won gold medals. Produced in the country’s Thessaly region, Theoni was crowned the best “balanced still water,” while Athos Clear and Zeus of Olympus came joint first in the “still waters of character” category.
Romania took two gold medals in the sparkling categories, with Azuga winning in the “light” category and Aqua Carpatica coming top of the “balanced” waters.
The best “sparkling water of character” was France’s Châteldon. "
"Let my daughter stay buried as a Muslim, pleads Surinder’s mum",www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Predeep Nambiar,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/03/let-my-daughter-stay-buried-as-a-muslim-pleads-surinders-mum/,"Let my daughter stay buried as a Muslim, pleads Surinder’s mum By - April 3, 2019 6:02 PM Nazirah Bibi, 68 (second from left) with family friend Hamidah Begu at her flat in Jelutong, Penang, today. Consoling her is her son Imran Khan Mohamad Qurban Ali (left).
GEORGE TOWN: The mother of the late K Surinder Kaur today made an impassioned plea to let her daughter rest in peace and remain interred together with her late father and brother, who were both Muslims.
Nazirah Bibi, 68, said her youngest daughter had told a family ustaz recently that in the event she died, she wanted to be buried next to her late father and brother.
“She said that to our family friend, who is an ustaz, just two weeks ago. And now, she is gone,” she said when met by reporters at her home in Jelutong here today.
Surinder, 37, died on Monday after suffering brain injuries following an assault. She was in the spotlight after several parties disputed the status of her religion after news filtered out that there were no documents proving she was a Muslim.
She was buried at a Jelutong mosque cemetery next to her late father, Kirpal Singh @ Mohamad Qurban Ali, and her late brother, Narinder Singh @ Irfan Khan.
Nazirah said Surinder, her youngest daughter out of six children, was a practising Muslim but had never had her religion changed on her identity card or informed the Muslim authorities.
Nazirah said Surinder converted to Islam 20 years ago when her late husband did the same. She said weeks later, the rest of the family also converted.
Qurban died at the age of 57 in 2007.
“Kogee was just like us, she has said the kalimah shahadah many times by heart,” Nazirah said, referring to Surinder’s nickname.
Family friend Hamidah Begum, 45, said Surinder was her childhood friend and had identified herself as a Muslim since young.
‘She never came back for two days’
Nazirah said Surinder was a cosmetic salesperson and worked at a food court in Prangin Mall.
She said Surinder lived with her at her flat and was the sole breadwinner of the family. “She was doing well and had a long way to go,” she said before breaking into tears.
Nazirah said just two days before her death, she did not return home.
She said the 55-year-old man alleged to have beaten her daughter to death with a crash helmet was a “friend of the family”. She said she had considered him as an “anak angkat” (adopted son).
Nazirah said the man was an odd job worker and had previously done some renovations to their home.
She dismissed news reports claiming that the man was Surinder’s boyfriend.
“They knew each other, that is all. She was never close to the man and never even liked him. How is he then her boyfriend?”
She said Surinder was seen with the man at his home by his friend at Kampung Pisang Awak in Jelutong. But when her brother tried searching for her, she could not be found.
She said the man had asked money from Surinder before and felt the man could have held her captive.
“I hope justice will prevail. She was a good person and did not deserve to die.”
Surinder’s brother, Imran Khan, 47, said he has lodged three police reports over “nasty comments” disputing his sister’s religion.
Surinder was found lying unconscious on the ground along Persiaran Bayan Indah after an argument on Saturday night. She died in hospital on Monday. "

Trump may appoint an immigration Czar and reports are saying xenophobic charlatan Kris Kobach is one of his top choices. He immediately was featured on Lou Dobbs Tonight , promoting a concept of creating migrant process camps to imprison asylum seekers.
Kobach brought with him a three step plan that had Lou Dobbs salivating.
For step one, Kris discussed the Flores Settlement agreement, which gave an avenue for Dobbs to bash Kristjen Nielsen for being an agent of the Chamber of Commerce instead of Trump.
Then Kobach got really going.
Kobach said, ""Number two, and this one is, deploy immediately dozens of immigration judges as well as a fleet of passenger planes, and the thousands of empty mobile home trailers that the United States owns right now and is attempting to sell at bargain prices on the internet. Instead of selling them, deploy them to the border cities, and create processing towns that are confined, and so when someone comes in and falsely claims asylum, we don't release them for six months onto the streets of the United States.
He continued, "" We process them right there, in that camp , where they have the three square meals, they're living in a nice mobile home, and then as soon as they're done, as soon as the claim is rejected, they're on the next plane back home, and then the people back home suddenly realize 'Hey he just left here two weeks ago, and yet he's back, maybe going in these caravans isn't such a great deal anymore.' So let's process the claims right there at the border and not release these people into the United States where they just disappear.""

Kourtney Kardashian unveils ‘Poosh’,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,AFP Relaxnews,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2019/04/03/kourtney-kardashian-unveils-poosh/,"April 3, 2019 6:00 PM Kardashian felt there was something missing in the healthy lifestyle space. (Reuters pic)
Look out Gwyneth – Kourtney Kardashian has stepped into the wellness arena.
The reality TV star has unveiled her latest venture, ‘Poosh’, after weeks of teasing fans with the project via social media.
The brand consists of a lifestyle website covering everything from health and wellness information to fashion and beauty tips, as well as articles covering the topics of interior design and family life. The site – which is named after Kardashian’s daughter Penelope, nicknamed ‘Poosh’ – has launched with a range of content spanning an interview with the matriarch and business powerhouse Kris Jenner, tips on ‘How to look good naked’ and a focus on clean beauty products.
“I decided to launch Poosh because I felt there was something missing in the healthy lifestyle space,” the eldest Kardashian sister writes in an editorial introducing the website. “Healthy living gets a bad rap; it’s as though if you care about what you put in – or on – your body, then you’re not sexy or cool. But this just isn’t true, and Poosh is here to prove just that.”
According to WWD, the site is aimed at ‘the modern woman’, with Kardashian telling the publication: “Just because we care about those things or want to be eating healthy or living a certain lifestyle, you can still be cool and sexy and have it all. I don’t want it to feel judgmental, just really like a conversation.” The site, which is run by a small editorial team, will produce new content on a daily basis.
This is not Kardashian’s first foray into the entrepreneurial world – alongside her sisters Kim and Khloe, she formerly ran a ‘Dash’ fashion boutique in California, which later opened further locations in Miami and New York, but closed down last year. The star also created a capsule collection of apparel and accessories for the brand PrettyLittleThing back in 2017, and in 2016 she was unveiled as the face of the skincare line Manuka Doctor.
Kardashian is the latest celebrity to put her stamp on the lifestyle and wellness business, following in the footsteps of stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow, who heads up the wildly successful ‘Goop’ empire, and supermodel Cindy Crawford, who recently co-founded the wellness brand ‘We Are Ladder’ with LeBron James, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lindsey Vonn.

Nearly three weeks since Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, the needs remain profound. And the risks of more floods, spread of disease and more lives lost persist. Many areas are now affected by cholera outbreaks, with the current tally of 1,000 cases expected to grow. The storm flattened thousands of homes and flooded acres upon acres of farmland. And more than 200,000 people have been displaced. I pay tribute to the local, national and international responders who have been on the scene from the earliest moments of this crisis, saving countless lives and preventing an even more devastating outcome. The United Nations has also been on the ground from day one. We supported the initial search-and-rescue efforts. We are providing life-saving assistance. For example, the World Food Programme is providing high-energy, fortified food products and supporting efforts to assess damage in affected areas. UNICEF is working together with the government and partners to restore drinking water systems across affected parts of Mozambique. The World Health Organization is distributing cholera vaccines and supporting the set-up of treatment centres. And the Central Emergency Response Fund immediately disbursed $20 million. Yet the response is still underfunded. We also need to ensure that the response is expanded to rural areas and communities. The three countries need $392 million for the next three months. Yet only $46 million has been recorded on the Financial Tracking System. I call on Member States to bridge this gap. Ladies and Gentlemen, As we urgently stem this crisis, we must also look toward rebuilding and preventing future such disasters. Beyond the emergency phase, we need to ensure sustained support that will help people and Governments cope with the longer term development consequences of the storm, from shelter and health to food security. Such calamities can erase, in an instant, years of hard-won progress. And while it is impossible to link any single weather event with climate change, such extreme storms are consistent with what scientists are telling us about the impacts of global warming – and with what our own eyes can see. Recent hurricanes in the Caribbean, and catastrophic storms, droughts and fires in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia and North America are driving home the existence of a new normal from which no country is immune. Just last week, the World Meteorological Organization reported that the impacts of climate change keep gathering speed. In 2018, no region was immune to devastating natural disasters. So we have our work cut out for us. I urge you to take four simple steps. First, respond quickly and generously to the humanitarian appeals for Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. Second, support long-term reconstruction efforts in the affected countries. Let us work to ensure that we rebuild communities in a manner that makes them more resilient to future shocks. That doesn’t just mean constructing houses and infrastructure in a different manner--it also implies investing in better disaster prediction and warning systems that reach all parts of the population. Third, accelerate your efforts to build resilience in the face of climate impacts, economic shocks and other kinds of uncertainty and upheaval. And, make sure that in doing so, you prioritize those furthest behind. And fourth, raise ambition on climate action – on both mitigation and adaptation. There is still time to win this race, but it requires concerted action -- now. Against this background, I encourage you to engage fully in the Climate Action Summit being convened in September, 2019, by the Secretary-General. The Summit is an unprecedented opportunity for national governments to bring realistic, concrete climate mitigation and adaptation plans. It is the time to show leadership and pave the path to a safer, more prosperous and sustainable world. Today, the people of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi need our strong solidarity in recovering and rebuilding. To those in the affected countries that have lost loved ones, homes, or livelihoods--I want you to know that we stand with you. We are committed to supporting you in rebuilding your homes and your communities. And we are committed to preventing further losses. Over the long term, all our lives are at stake. Let us all step up."

On World Autism Awareness Day, we speak out against discrimination, celebrate the diversity of our global community and strengthen our commitment to the full inclusion and participation of people with autism. Supporting them to achieve their full potential is a vital part of our efforts to uphold the core promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: to leave no one behind. This year’s observance underscores the importance of affordable assistive technologies to support people with autism to live independent lives and, indeed, to exercise their basic human rights. Around the world, there are still major barriers to accessing such technologies, including high costs, unavailability and a lack of awareness of their potential. Last year, I launched a Strategy on New Technologies to ensure that new and emerging technologies are aligned with the values enshrined in the UN Charter, international law and human rights conventions, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. On World Autism Awareness Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to these values – which include equality, equity and inclusion – and to promoting the full participation of all people with autism, by ensuring that they have the necessary tools to exercise their rights and fundamental freedoms. En cette Journée mondiale de la sensibilisation à l’autisme, nous dénonçons la discrimination, célébrons la diversité de notre communauté internationale et renforçons notre volonté d’obtenir la pleine inclusion et participation des personnes atteintes d’autisme. Les aider à s’épanouir pleinement est au cœur de l’action menée pour remplir la promesse inscrite dans le Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030 : ne laisser personne de côté. Il nous faut cette année mettre l’accent sur l’importance d’avoir des technologies d’assistance abordables, pour aider les personnes atteintes d’autisme à vivre en toute indépendance et à exercer leurs droits fondamentaux. Partout dans le monde, de gros obstacles continuent d’entraver l’accès à ces technologies, qui demeurent fort coûteuses, peu disponibles et méconnues quant aux possibilités offertes. L’année dernière, j’ai lancé une Stratégie en matière de nouvelles technologies, pour faire en sorte que celles-ci soient conformes aux valeurs consacrées par la Charte des Nations Unies, le droit international et les conventions sur les droits de la personne, y compris la Convention relative aux droits des personnes handicapées. En cette journée mondiale de la sensibilisation à l’autisme, réaffirmons notre attachement à ces valeurs – qui comprennent l’égalité, l’équité et l’inclusion – et à la promotion de la pleine participation de toutes les personnes atteintes d’autisme, en veillant à ce qu’elles aient les outils nécessaires pour exercer leurs droits et leurs libertés fondamentales."

I am pleased to support the new campaign, “ACT to Protect Children Affected by Conflict”. Graça Machel’s landmark 1996 report on the impact of armed conflict on children described not only the brutality faced by millions but also the centrality of this issue to advancing international peace, development and human rights. The United Nations continues its determined work to address this challenge. My Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict monitors and reports on violations, assisted by United Nations departments, funds and programmes as well as civil society. Our common efforts have led to the release of more than 130,000 children recruited by armed groups and forces, but much more is needed. Violence against children in armed conflict can take many forms: killing and maiming, recruitment and use, sexual abuse, abduction, attacks on schools and hospitals and denial of humanitarian assistance. Should a child survive and be fortunate enough to be released to a reintegration program, they still have only a slim chance of recovery. A lack of resources and a failure to provide long-term assistance to victims and their communities have made many children open to a second victimization, either through the stigmas they carry or through inadequate education and growth opportunities, leaving them trapped in a cycle of violence and despair. This new global campaign launched by my Special Representative aims to raise worldwide awareness, assist children in need and prevent them from becoming victims in the first place. Crucially, this initiative will offer children an opportunity to raise their voices. Please join me in ensuring that the Act to Protect Children in Armed Conflict campaign reaches all corners of the world so no child ever fears being left behind again."

The world must stand together to protect all religious sites, and against rising anti-Muslim hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, racism and hate speech. We must counter those who seek to demonize and divide. And we must defend the freedom of religion and belief.

Trump's infatuation: the Personality behind the WALL,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-119952.html,"Post: #1 Trump's infatuation: the Personality behind the WALL
Advertisement Trump's infatuation with the WALL and the Personality behind the WALL
We, all people in this time and in our journey have either become more interested or un-interested for the flood of propaganda that is never given clearly; to help all people better understand the ‘time’ in which we are, and prophetically for the full story to be heard.
There is an epidemic of confusion that creates further disorientation in the two time-lines like the two lanes in a highway for either direction, and we easily lose the trail that leads us to the origin of everything. In this report I stress how there is a difference between two objects and how the replacements of theology occurs when such a large book is replaced with a ‘smart phone’?
You must have access to the New Strong’s exhaustive concordance of the Bible to see it or are there ways for smart phone users to flip through the pages and your eye scroll the many columns of numbers in the Hebrew Lexicon while a finger holds a place elsewhere in the same book?
You must clear your mind of all preconceived ideas and knowledge of all things so to prevent a multitude of stumbling blocks, and put away your fears of what the Antichrist is, really? The smart phone is an object with a great role in life, and people’s lives may be ruined if all of the hand held phones suddenly where band like grounding all Boeing 737 Max8 passenger jet planes? The associations are too childish at the cost of the highest stakes, as if little children are given the freedom and positions to rule the world, and are the same as a baby doing what they will with a set of wooden baby blocks?
Okay, I’ll get to the punch because there isn’t time therefore; you do your homework and find such this book to see the same, as it was when there were books? The Antichrist isn’t obvious to the greater portion of people or perhaps, isn’t as horrible as thieves want you to believe? Let’s look at facts, and specifically the name, ‘JESUS’, and the number 2424 in the New Strong’s exhaustive concordance of the Bible and you will find number 846 is the only number that is found on page 730, and it points to John 7:50, and the story of a man named, Nicodemus.
The number, 846 specifies the Wall, which is the root of the spirit of the man named, Nicodemus, and this will help everyone better know that Nicodemus is a character that also repeats in history, and in prophecy. President Donald Trump is the Antichrist that stands in place of the real Christ while he is cast away; Trump is Nicodemus reincarnate if you please? There are many characters inside of the Trump image, and the image is Mosaic, and it changes like a kaleidoscope does as the world turns?
The story of Nicodemus is one that needs consideration when you must know who is running the world as one power, and yet there are the liars that say it’s something that is yet coming, and we better watch out because they want you to mistake God for Satan, and Satan for God? That’s too dramatic, and imposes on too many sensitive minds so then, just imagine Trump’s infatuation with a so called, WALL? (Trumpodemus?) Is Trump the last brick maker in America? Who is making bricks for Trump's WALL? Could it be his own form of a Pyramid?"
Secretary-General's remarks at Al Azhar mosque [as delivered],www.un.org,United Nations Office of the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2019-04-02/secretary-generals-remarks-al-azhar-mosque-delivered,"Secretary-General's remarks at Al Azhar mosque [as delivered]
As salaam alaikum. I am honoured to address you in this esteemed seat of Islamic learning. Standing here, one cannot fail to feel the impressive weight of more than 1,000 years of history, culture, scholarship and worship. As Secretary-General of the UN, and as a man of faith, I have come to express my respect for Islam and my solidarity with its followers in these turbulent times. It is less than a month since a terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, took the lives of 50 worshippers of all ages. Over the weeks, we have come to learn many inspiring stories about the victims. We have read about people who lost their lives saving others. And we have heard the words of a husband lost in grief over the death of his wife, yet extending words of forgiveness, because, as he said, “that’s what Islam taught me.” As the Holy Quran says in Surah Fussilat, verse 34, “Good and evil deeds are not equal. Repel evil with what is better and then you will see that one who was once your enemy has become your dearest friend.” We have also been deeply moved by the extraordinary displays of leadership, love and solidarity from the people of New Zealand and beyond. We saw it in England where a white non-Muslim man held up a placard outside a mosque that read “You are my friends; I will keep watch while you pray.” Such solidarity is often in evidence after a tragedy. We saw it in Pittsburgh, last year, after the worst anti-Semitic terrorist attack in United States history. Members of the Muslim community were quick to voice their support and raise money for the victims.
The executive director of the Pittsburgh Islamic Center said at the time. “We just want to know what you need. If it is people outside your next service protecting you, let us know. We’ll be there.”
This is the spirit that I know is deeply embedded in Islam – a faith of love, compassion, forgiveness, mercy and grace.
As UN High Commissioner for Refugees, I saw the generosity of Muslim countries opening their borders to people in distress in a world where, unfortunately, so many borders are closed. This is in line with what I regard as the most beautiful prescription for refugee protection in world history. It is found in the Surah Al-Tawbah of the Holy Quran, Surah 9, verse 6: “And if anyone seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he can hear the words of Allah. Then escort him where he can be secure.” This was revealed to the Prophet , May Peace be upon Him, more than fourteen centuries before the 1951 Convention on the Protection of Refugees. Let me emphasise that the prescription is that protection should be given to both believers and non-believers. This is a remarkable example of openness and tolerance. In this time of difficulties and division, we must stand together and protect each other. Yet, around the world, we are seeing ever-rising anti-Muslim hatred, anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia. Hate speech is entering the mainstream, spreading like wildfire through social media and radio. We see it spreading in liberal democracies as well as in authoritarian States. These dark forces menace democratic values, social stability and peace. They stigmatize women, minorities, migrants and refugees. When people are attacked, physically, verbally or on social media, because of their race, religion or ethnicity, all of society is diminished. We all have a part to play in repairing the fissures and ending the polarization that are so prevalent in many of our societies today. Our faith leaders, in particular, have a very important role. That is why it is so heartening to see the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, and Pope Francis join hands in Abu Dhabi in February in a show of interfaith brotherhood. I have here, given by the Grand Imam, the text - the common text, approved by him and the Pope, which is a fantastic testimony of mutual respect, tolerance, compassion and peace, given by the two great religious leaders to the world. As the Grand Imam stated, Muslims have paid a heavy price due to the actions of “a handful of criminals.” He also stressed that “all religions agree that God forbids killing.” The document they signed on “human fraternity for world peace and living together” calls on religious and political leaders to bring an end to wars, conflicts, and environmental decay. It further calls on Christians and Muslims to recognize and respect one another and work together for the good of humanity. And we will do our best for the UN to make sure that this document goes everywhere and is seen by everybody. I commend this bold move, and the Grand Imam’s call for Muslims in the Middle East to protect Christian communities. I also commend the initiatives taken by al-Azhar to promote the true face of Islam and counter violent extremist philosophies and terrorist propaganda. Nothing justifies terrorism, and it becomes particularly hideous when religion is invoked. To live in a world of peace, we must nurture mutual understanding and invest in making diversity a success. As the Prophet Muhammed, peace be upon him, said: “None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.” We must counter and reject religious and political figures who exploit differences. And we must ask why so many people feel excluded, and why they are tempted by extreme messages of intolerance against each other. Ultimately, we must all work together for our collective benefit. This is the reasoning behind the United Nations 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals – the world’s blueprint for a fair globalization and an inclusive and prosperous society. At the heart of our efforts, we must uphold and promote human dignity and universal human rights. Yes, we have different faiths, cultures and histories, but we are all connected by our common humanity. Instead of dwelling on our differences, let us focus on what unites us, and work together for a better future for everyone, everywhere."

Advertisement Hispanics Rally to Trump, Boosting His 2020 Chances
Get ready for the anti-Trump “resistance” to go truly loco, because new polling data indicates Hispanic support for the president is swelling, a trend that could seal his 2020 re-election victory..
...McLaughlin & Associates revealed that Hispanic approval for Trump in March jumped to 50%. This number matched the January Marist/NPR/PBS survey that shocked cynics with its own 50% approval finding. Even if those polls are too aggressive, February’s Morning Consult/Politico poll showed Trump’s Hispanic approval vaulting to a still-impressive 45%.
What explains this stunning trend?

Special Olympics can soar on its own,www.jeffjacoby.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.jeffjacoby.com/22530/special-olympics-can-soar-on-its-own,"Special Olympics can soar on its own by Jeff Jacoby April 3, 2019 http://www.jeffjacoby.com/22530/special-olympics-can-soar-on-its-own
SPECIAL OLYMPICS is a wonderful organization. For 50 years, it has provided sports training for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Millions of athletes have participated in its competitions, in the process strengthening their bodies, enlarging their confidence, and making new friends. Through its Unified Sports program, which brings players with and without intellectual disabilities together as teammates, Special Olympics promotes social inclusion and understanding for people too often marginalized.
It should come as no surprise that such an admirable organization is generously supported by charitable donations. According to its most recent financial statement , Special Olympics had expenses of about $130 million in 2017, nearly all of which was covered by the more than $113 million in contributions it received that year from private individuals and corporations. (It also reported millions in income from investments, royalties, and accreditation fees.) Special Olympics is thus a shining example of the good works underwritten by American philanthropy — a textbook illustration of how widespread public benefit is made possible by widespread private giving.
Among the host of Special Olympics' donors is me: For years I have made a modest monthly contribution to support its activities. Though my mite is only a tiny drop in a giant bucket, I'm happy to play even a minuscule part in helping advance the Special Olympics mission of transforming lives through the joy of sport .
But I was dismayed last week to learn that Special Olympics takes money from .
The issue came up when Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos testified before a House Appropriations subcommittee, which was weighing the administration's 2020 budget request for the Education Department — a budget request that included eliminating a $17.6 million subsidy to Special Olympics.
Democrats homed in on the proposed cut, raking DeVos over the coals . Representative Barbara Lee of California, for example, blasted her for ""go[ing] after disabled children."" Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said she deserved a "" Olympic gold medal for insensitivity .""
DeVos protested in vain that she has no interest in harming Special Olympics and has ""personally supported its mission."" In fact, she donates one-fourth of her salary as a Cabinet member to Special Olympics — a $50,000 annual gift . Yet that didn't stop members of Congress from accusing her of heartlessness. ""It's cruel, it's misguided, and it's outrageous,"" said Representative Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts , whose great-aunt Eunice Shriver was the organization's founder.
Of course the budget cut went nowhere. On Thursday President Trump tweeted that he had "" overridden my people "" and ordered the subsidy restored. Whereupon DeVos let it be known that the cut hadn't been her idea to begin with , and that she had defended it only because she'd been instructed to.
It was all another depressing reminder of why the federal budget is such a bloated sack of irresponsibility.
In Washington, popularity and good intentions are all the reason needed to spend taxpayer dollars. Time and again, politicians choose to keep appropriating dollars the government doesn't have rather than take heat for closing the spigot.
Special Olympics unquestionably makes the world a better place. It brings joy and meaning to innumerable lives. But that doesn't entitle it to government money.
Before the administration flipped, DeVos had it right . ""Special Olympics is not a federal program,"" she argued. ""It's a private organization.... There are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don't get a dime of federal grant money. But ... cannot fund every worthy program.""
Again: In 2017 Special Olympics attracted more than $113 million from willing donors. An organization that can motivate private giving on such a scale has no business being at the public trough. Something can be uplifting without being Washington's responsibility.
Special Olympics unquestionably makes the world a better place. It brings joy and meaning to innumerable lives. But that doesn't entitle it to government money.
I wish Kennedy had reacted to the original budget proposal not by denouncing it, but by encouraging private givers to replace the federal subsidy with increased generosity. I wish he had begun by thanking DeVos for her lavish personal support of Special Olympics, then announced a campaign to raise $18 million to make it even stronger. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would be glad to increase my contribution to Special Olympics to help free it from dependence on Big Brother.
Any charity that can raise well over $100 million each year should not be extracting money from the Treasury. Special Olympics can soar on its own.
For 50 years Special Olympics has promoted independence, self-respect, and mutual support. It inspires legions of givers and volunteers. It would inspire even more of them by living up to its own philosophy, kicking away its federal crutch, relying on the love and goodwill of its friends, and discovering how much higher it can fly.

Trump Threatens To Close Mexican Border,www.occidentaldissent.com,Hunter Wallace,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2019/04/03/trump-threatens-to-close-mexican-border/,"April 4, 2019 at 4:19 am
Here in Florida where I live I for one no longer support Trump. I won’t be voting for him in 2020. It doesn’t matter if I no longer support Trump. That’s because felons can now vote in Florida. Florida felons will be voting in the 2020 presidential election and as per The Son-In-Law the majority of felons are registering as Republicans, as per Kushner.
It’s hard to believe that the majority of felons are registering as Republicans, but that’s what Kushner says and he has more information available to him than I do. So it doesn’t matter if Trump loses his White supporters in Florida, he’s got Florida’s felons supporting him.The majority of felons are NOT White.
I didn’t think Trump would succeed in winning all of his campaign pledges, because of all the opposition to his campaign platform. I voted for him because I thought he was a fighter and I thought he would fight hard to try to get his campaign promises fulfilled and realized. I thought he would at least fight for what he said he believed in and what he said he wanted. I thought he was a fighter. I thought he was tough. I was really fooled. He doesn’t fight, he just caves in all the time. He can twitter all he wants, he’s tough when he twitters, but his “tough” twittering doesn’t cover-up his constant capitulations and his caving-in all the time.
Trump misrepresented himself during the presidential campaign, to put it mildly. He turned out to be some sort of controlled opposition candidate/president."
Former Boy Scout chaplain arraigned on new sex assault charges,www.providencejournal.com,Brian Amaral,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190403/former-boy-scout-chaplain-arraigned-on-new-sex-assault-charges,"Former Boy Scout chaplain arraigned on new sex assault charges Brian Amaral Journal Staff Writer bamaral44 10:22 47 PM
SOUTH KINGSTOWN — A former assistant chaplain at a Boy Scout summer camp, who was first arrested in February, was arraigned on three new sexual assault charges Wednesday morning in Wakefield District Court.
James Glawson, 74, of 101 Widow Sweets Rd., in Exeter, was arraigned on one count each of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, first-degree sexual assault and second-degree child molestation sexual assault.
The new charges relate to one new victim and date to various times in the late 1980s, authorities said. He is the fifth person Glawson has been charged with assaulting, and a top state police official said Wednesday that the investigation is continuing.
“With any type of investigation as serious as this, it is difficult for complainants to come forward,” Maj. Timothy Sanzi, Rhode Island State Police detective commander, told the media at headquarters in Scituate on Wednesday. “It requires a great deal of bravery. It’s a very sensitive matter.”
Some of the people Glawson is charged with assaulting were 13 or younger at the time, according to court records; one was an 18-year-old man with disabilities, authorities said.
Glawson, led into court in prison garb, said little at his arraignment Wednesday; no plea was entered to the felony counts, now numbering 16 in all, including one count of possession of child pornography. Glawson continues to be held without bail.
With the new charges, Glawson faces three separate cases. His lawyer, Steve Peltier, said he is trying to determine whether Glawson will be charged again, but declined to comment after court.
Detective Robert Hopkins of the Rhode Island State Police told Judge Madeline Quirk that “numerous” people have said they were sexually victimized by Glawson. All were former members of the Boy Scouts, Hopkins said. Some of the people came forward on their own, and some were contacted by the state police, Hopkins said.
The victim in the case police filed Wednesday said he was taken to Glawson’s home in Exeter, where he was molested, Hopkins said.
Glawson was arrested in February and charged with three counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree sexual assault. He was accused of assaulting an 18-year-old man with disabilities in 2018.
At the time, the police said they had just begun their investigation and appealed to the public for more information.
Glawson had been affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America since 1980, and served as an assistant Catholic chaplain and Eucharistic minister from 2012 to 2018 at St. John Bosco Chapel at Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Hopkinton, according to state police. He was also affiliated with the St. Bernard Church in North Kingstown and the Immaculate Conception Church in Westerly, state police have said.
The Diocese of Providence has said Glawson was a volunteer at Camp Yawgoog and that he passed a criminal background check.
In March, he was arraigned on eight additional counts of first-degree sexual assault. Those charges involve three alleged victims, including two who were 13 or younger at the time, according to court records.
Rhode Island State Police said anyone with information or complaints about Glawson can contact the detective division at (401) 764-5346. Never miss a story

"Nigeria's Small Businesses Want Government Help, But Corruption Is Draining It Away",carnegieendowment.org,,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/02/nigeria-s-small-businesses-want-government-help-but-corruption-is-draining-it-away-pub-78757,"@matthewtpage
Yet high borrowing costs, multiple taxation, currency volatility, infrastructure shortfalls, and red tape all make doing business in Nigeria exceptionally difficult. Seizing on an opportunity to expand its reach, the Nigerian government has created an alphabet soup of agencies and rolled out big-budget programs to help. Rather than meeting the needs of small businesspeople, however, these schemes are more often used by corrupt officials to help themselves. Double Whammy
Businesspeople like the wheeler-dealers of Balogun Market are not only undermined by everyday graft—shakedowns by licensing officials, extortion by safety inspectors, racketeering by police, customs officers, and local gang members—they are also hurt by the grand corruption that pervades government programs meant to help them, we write in a new report which I co-authored with Celestine Okeke for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Relative to their high cost, these programs appear to help very few actual small businesses. Instead, they are set up to fail—eroding trust in government and functioning as conduits for embezzlement, contract fraud, and the distribution of political patronage. This top-down corruption amounted to over $1 billion between 2014 and 2018—more than Nigeria’s combined capital expenditure on health and education over the same period.
These agencies and programs exude corruption red flags. They lack transparency, shirk accountability, incur high administrative overheads, and are guarded by reams of red tape. Politicians routinely interfere in them, handpicking beneficiaries and steering contracts to their cronies. Even more disturbing, this kind of corruption is self-reinforcing. It undermines the effectiveness and impact of small business programs, increasing the need for assistance, and thus makes it easier for politicians to justify expensive follow-on initiatives. Pilfering Programs
Two such schemes illustrate the huge scale, massive opportunity costs, and glaring impunity this type of corruption involves: In 2013, the Central Bank of Nigeria rolled out a $1.3 billion fund to provide inexpensive loans to small businesses across the country. Less than two years later, however, $236 million had been hastily disbursed from the fund , given out to twenty-four state governors—with few strings attached—on the eve of the 2015 elections. Four years on, none of these states has provided a detailed list of entrepreneurs that received loans under the program. Instead, evidence suggests many governors outright embezzled most or all of the funds. Nigeria’s federal legislators earmark over half a billion dollars worth of pork barrel spending— known as constituency projects —annually. Using this mechanism, they have steered $433 million over the last few years to projects—often vaguely labeled as ‘empowerment’—purporting to help small businesses. Legislators handpick which federal entities implement these projects and often even select contract awardees: a clear violation of procurement law. The little-known Border Communities Development Agency (BCDA), led by none other than President Buhari’s son-in-law , is now one of largest conduits for these dubious expenditures.
Nigeria government programs meant to help small businesses are awash with red flags. They have a history of malfeasance and an ineffective track record. Many appear to have lost touch with the very same entrepreneurs they should be helping, like the tireless traders of Balogun Market. Related analysis from Carnegie"
"McConnell Tells Trump No Obamacare Vote Before Election, Trump Responds On Twitter | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45488/mcconnell-tells-trump-no-obamacare-vote-election-ashe-schow,"McConnell Tells Trump No Obamacare Vote Before Election, Trump Responds On Twitter Mark Wilson/Getty Images April 3, 2019 views
Despite President Donald Trump’s claims last week that the Republican Party would be the “party of health care,” Senate Republicans are refusing to play ball.
The Hill reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told Trump on Monday that the senate would not vote on the president’s desired Obamacare replacement before the 2020 election. McConnell did, however, tell Trump that the senate would do what they could to pass bills that would lower the cost of health care.
""We had a good conversation yesterday afternoon and I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans' view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives,"" McConnell said on Tuesday.
As an example, McConnell said senate Republicans would be “working on prescription drug pricing and other issues. He added that he was “clear” with Trump about not developing a comprehensive health care bill to replace Obamacare.
""He did say, as he later tweeted, that he accepted that and he would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign,” McConnell said.
Trump did tweet Monday night about how terrible Obamacare has been for the country and claimed again that Republicans are working on a comprehensive plan that would lower premiums and deductibles.
“Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn’t work. Premiums & deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance,” Trump tweeted.
He continued: “The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House.” Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn’t work. Premiums & deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. The Republicans — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019 ....are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
After The New York Times published an article on Tuesday claiming Trump “backed off plans” to replace Obamacare, the president took to Twitter again to set the record straight and take a jab at the paper.
“I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare,” Trump tweeted.
“This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc. Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!” he continued. I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party.

The Hill reported that Senate Republicans did not know Trump would be asking for comprehensive health care reform prior to their meeting on Monday outside of a single tweet from the president which declared Republicans would become “the Party of Healthcare.”"

Wednesday morning, Doppler radar picked up on what may have appeared to be light rain to the untrained eye, but it was moving in odd directions, seemingly spreading away from a centralized point. This was not rain, but instead what meteorologists and biologists call ""roost rings"".
Roost rings pop up in the warmer months of the year near some of the area's lakes as large flocks of birds congregate together at night, then take flight at sunrise to forage and feed. While radar can't pick up on the type of bird, purple martins are the most common to cause roost rings.

Jones-Story died Thursday in the crash along Route 20 near Route 75 in Freeport. She was a 12-year veteran of the state police.

Remarks at a UN Security Council Open Debate on the UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH),usun.state.gov,skieran,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://usun.state.gov/remarks/9009,"U.S. Mission to the United Nations New York City April 3, 2019 AS DELIVERED
Thank you, Mr. President, and I’m glad to be the first subjected to the hourglass test.
We would like to thank Foreign Minister Edmond for joining the Council today. The United States welcomes this opportunity to address human rights not only in Haiti, but in the broader context of peacekeeping operations.
Promoting respect for human rights, as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is a central goal of our foreign policy. The protection of human rights helps secure peace, deter aggression, promote the rule of law, combat crime and corruption, strengthen democracies, and prevent humanitarian crises.
Human rights are inextricably linked to both the mission of the Security Council and to UN peacekeeping operations. We rely on the information gathered by the human rights teams of various peacekeeping operations, and we honor the courage of peacekeepers on display while they carry out this task.
The United States has just released our Annual Country Reports on Human Rights for 2018. When we document human rights issues, we shine a spotlight on the plight of victims and show our commitment to expose perpetrators. Through ongoing monitoring and exposure of human rights challenges, we use our influence and power to help promote human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to effect change by governments and societies.
In Haiti, Mr. President, we’ve seen positive change. The Haitian National Police have taken steps towards imposing systematic discipline on officers found to have committed abuses or fraud. As we’ve stated on several occasions, the HNP can further increase its effectiveness by increasing accountability and transparency.
And as we note in our human rights report, there have been improvements in the still very problematic, prison and detention conditions. We also note the progress made in filling positions in Haiti’s judiciary.
Mr. President, the United States welcomes Haiti’s progress in promoting respect for human rights and we commit to continue working with the Government of Haiti to further address the country’s significant challenges. These include: isolated allegations of unlawful killings by police, excessive use of force by police, arbitrary detention, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, a judiciary subject to corruption and outside influence, physical attacks on journalists, widespread corruption and impunity; and human trafficking, including forced labor.
MINUJUSTH has a central role in promoting human rights. Its task to strengthen national human rights institutions is essential to promoting the rule of law, democratic institution building, and security in Haiti. It contributes to ensuring accountability, as well as respect for human rights, including for women and children.
Mr. President, last month, the Secretary-General provided an assessment of where the UN and Haiti stand with achieving MINUJUSTH’s goals and benchmarks, and the dashboard is, as always, a very helpful tool in seeing this. We agree with his assessment that Haiti is on a positive trajectory, with improvements in the professionalism and efficiency of rule of law and security institutions, as well as in the protection of human rights. We also agree that the HNP has been increasingly self-sufficient in providing security across the country.
This brings me to the upcoming transition, as we prepare for the final renewal of the MINUJUSTH mandate. We look forward to continued updates from the Secretariat regarding the Secretary-General’s recommended follow-on Special Political Mission so that the Council can establish the SPM in a timely manner and ensure a smooth transition. The SPM should include a human rights pillar that can further advance progress achieved by MINUJUSTH on human rights benchmarks. In the interim, we expect the Government of Haiti, together with MINUJUSTH, to keep working towards achieving the benchmarks until the drawdown of the mission and beyond.
We expect a renewal of MINUJUSTH’s mandate for six months until October 15, 2019. This timetable is consistent with the two-year exit strategy and the assessment of the Secretary-General.
As his March 1 report states, “unless there are mounting challenges to the government’s capacity to respond to the crisis, the HNP will be able to fully assume responsibility for security and protection of Haiti by 15 October 2019.” The United States shares this assessment, and notes that it reflects the will of the Government of Haiti to conclude the peacekeeping operation by that time.
Mr. President, we do not believe this Council should link MINUJUSTH’s scheduled transition to legislative and local elections in Haiti scheduled for October 2019. Rather, the United States encourages the Government of Haiti in support of its election planning.
In this broader context, we encourage the President of Haiti and elected representatives to work together, in accordance with Haiti’s constitution, to form a new government to serve the Haitian people as soon as possible. We continue to support a constructive and inclusive dialogue among government leaders from across the Haitian political spectrum, civil society, faith-based organizations, and the private sector to find lasting solutions to the current political and economic crisis.
Mr. President, we’re convinced that genuine dialogue and compromise, leading to a transparent and accountable government, can best serve the needs and aspirations of the Haitian people.
I thank you."
Alyssa Milano Misuses the Bible and Science to Support Abortion,townhall.com,Michael Brown,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/columnists/michaelbrown/2019/04/02/alyssa-milano-misuses-the-bible-and-science-to-support-abortion-n2544159,"Alyssa Milano Misuses the Bible and Science to Support Abortion Share The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com. Source: Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File Trending Sidelined Because She Rejects Radical Green Agendas?
Actress Alyssa Milano has now marshalled the Bible and science to support her pro-abortion position. Unfortunately, she is wrong on both accounts. The Bible and science, rightly understood, are totally pro-life.
Tweeting on April 1 (with no apparent irony intended), Milano said , “I love God. I believe in God.
“But I don’t believe my personal beliefs of which we can’t confirm should override scientific facts and what we can confirm.
“‘If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?’ John 3:12”
As for Milano’s love for God and belief in God, that is between her and God. At least she is not denying His existence. That’s a step in the right direction.
As for her quoting the Bible, while the words are taken out of context and, in reality, work against her, I’m glad that she feels that quoting the Bible is important. We agree!
It’s just that she could not have chosen two worse witnesses to defend the “right” of abortion. To repeat: both the Bible and science, rightly understood, are pro-life.
Let’s start with Scripture.
First, the Word teaches that God carefully and lovingly formed us in the womb (Psalm 139:13-16).
Second, it teaches the personhood of the baby in the womb (Luke 1:41-42).
Third, it teaches the potential destiny of each child in the womb (Genesis 25:23; Jeremiah 1:5; Galatians 1:15).
Fourth, it teaches the importance of caring for “the least of these,” the most vulnerable and hurting (Matthew 18:1-6, 10; 25:31-46).
Fifth, it teaches us to stand up for the innocent being led to slaughter (Proverbs 24:11-12).
Sixth, it teaches us that God hates the shedding of innocent blood, especially of babies (see, for example, Jeremiah 7:30-34; 17:1-6; Proverbs 6:17).
(For those who have had abortions or participated in abortions, I should add that Scripture also teaches that Jesus died for every sin we have committed – including the sin of abortion – and offers us forgiveness through the cross.)
As for science – or, in Milano’s words, “scientific facts”– what exactly did she have in mind?
Does science teach that the baby in the womb is simply a clump of cells or a mass of tissue?
Does it teach that the unborn child is not human until it leaves the womb? That it does not have a beating heart? That it does not have unique DNA? That it cannot feel pain (at a certain point of development)? That it can be tossed aside for any and every reason?
What “scientific facts” support abortion? Can anyone name one?
Over at the Daily Wire , Amanda Prestigiacomo compiled some of the better responses to Milano’s tweet, including “So... When does a baby in utero become 'scientifically' human enough for you to protect their life?” (Elisha Kraus) And, “Who wants to tell her that the fact that human life begins at fertilization has been scientific consensus for almost a century?” (Lauren Enriquez) And, “If these babies aren't humans, someone should tell them to stop kicking the sh*t out of my bladder” (Emily Zanotti).
But of course. The baby is human and science confirms that. Recommended Democrat Presidential Conference Opens with Communist Cop-Killer’s Chants Humberto Fontova
More importantly, God Himself, the giver of life, confirms that. And that little life is precious in His sight.
Can anyone truly look in the face of Jesus and see Him participating in an abortion? Can anyone see Him giving approval to a baby being sliced up or burned up or suctioned to death?
It is Alyssa Milano who is misunderstanding both earthly things (here, science, but again, this is not the point Jesus was making in John 3:12). It is not surprising that she is also misunderstanding spiritual things.
At present, she now has over 100 actors who have signed her protest against Georgia’s strong pro-life bill. In effect, they have signed their names against life, against science, and against God’s Word.
They are truly on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of truth, the wrong side of compassion. May God turn their hearts and open their minds, as He did many other pro-abortion champions of the past.
For good reason, Ashley Bratcher has now challenged Milano, actress to actress and mother to mother. ( Bratcher plays the role of pro-life activist – and former Planned Parenthood clinic director – Abby Johnson in the movie Unplanned .)
Would that Milano and her co-signers take time to see the movie for themselves? It might just change their hearts and their minds. "
Neil Gorsuch Just Made Death Worse | The Nation,www.thenation.com,Elie Mystal,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thenation.com/article/neil-gorsuch-death-penalty-bucklew/,"Neil Gorsuch Just Made Death Worse Neil Gorsuch Just Made Death Worse In an appalling majority opinion, Gorsuch endorses pain-filled deaths for people subjected to capital punishment. US Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch testifies during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. (Reuters / Joshua Roberts)
The moral argument against the death penalty is actually harder to make than the legal argument against the death penalty. Most people who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds think it’s the other way around; they think that the sanctity of human life offers sufficient justification, and the law muddles it up somehow. But just Netflix any blockbuster from, say, the last 30 years, and you’ll see that view has it twisted. We live in a culture that fetishizes vengeance. Nobody is going to cry if Tony Stark blasts Thanos’s face off this summer. Nobody is going to care if Game of Thrones returns with a ritualistic burning of the Lannisters. Morally, our society is more at peace with the death penalty than it might seem. Ad Policy
Compared to moral philosophy, the law offers a much more compelling case against capital punishment. Some would argue that the first law is a law against capital punishment: thou shalt not kill. And if Charlton Heston is not your idea of a law-giver, political philosophers will tell you that the only reason we’re even in a “society” is because “law” was the only way to stop the endless cycle of revenge-killings that we would clearly engage in without it . The law has ever tried to mollify our thirst for vengeance.
Making the case that the death penalty is unconstitutional is downright easy. First of all, juries get it wrong, all the time. Apparently, 165 people have been freed from death row since 1973, and that must mean that some number of innocent people have been put to death. I’m going to go out on a limb and assume that killing innocent people violates some constitutional principle, or all of them. More specifically, we know that race plays a significant factor in who gets put to death, and that’s a pretty clear violation of the 14th Amendment’s promise of due process.
Oh, and there’s this whole constitutional amendment that says: “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” The Eighth Amendment seems pretty dispositive on this issue. The Supreme Court has literally explained why the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment, in the 1972 case Furman v. Georgia .
But Furman was functionally overturned just a few years later . Since 1976, we’ve executed around 1,500 people . Texas basically does it for sport now. The death penalty remains attached to our society like a vestigial tail reminding us of our bestial savagery.
Why? Why hasn’t the law been able to stop us from doing the thing it was arguably invented to stop us from doing? Well, because we keep putting people like Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.
This week, Gorsuch wrote a majority opinion that was both shockingly cruel and entirely consistent with arch-conservative thought. The case is called Bucklew v. Precythe . Russell Bucklew is a convicted murderer whose depraved crimes are not in dispute. He was sentenced to death in Missouri. Missouri is a lethal-injection state, but Bucklew has a rare medical condition that would cause him to be in extreme pain as the lethal drugs do their work. Bucklew appealed his sentence, arguing that the pain would be a violation of his Eighth Amendment protections, and asked for alternative methods of death that are not sanctioned under Missouri law.
Gorsuch, writing for a 5-4 majority , denied his appeal. Gorsuch wrote: “The Eighth Amendment forbids ‘cruel and unusual’ methods of capital punishment but does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death.” That’s about the most heartless-bastard thing I’ve read in a while, and I work on the Internet.
Everybody should notice the sleight of hand Gorsuch is playing at here. Saying the Eighth Amendment only forbids certain “methods” of capital punishment presupposes that the Eighth Amendment allows capital punishment. That’s no better than saying you can’t drown a person, unless she’s a witch.
Gorsuch is demonstrably wrong. The Eighth Amendment makes no mention of death, painless or otherwise. It talks about cruelty . It contemplates unusual cruelty. Throwing me off the top of the Empire State Building would be almost entirely painless until I came to a sudden stop. It would still be cruel. It would still be unusual.
Would that Russell Bucklew was the only person doomed to suffer under Neil Gorsuch’s perverse interpretations. But what Gorsuch is doing here is creating an entirely new Supreme Court interpretation of the Eighth Amendment. Later in his opinion, Gorsuch explains that the Eighth Amendment is only offended when the method of death is “superadded” with some additional measure of “terror, pain, or disgrace.”
That’s new. Up until now, even as we allow for capital punishment, the central question has been whether the method of death is the most “humane” form of murder, oxymoronic as that phrase may be. Even though conservative judges have ruled time and again that no particular method of execution is too inhumane for our bloodthirsty desires, this view that any method is okay so long as the state doesn’t go out of its way to hurt you had only been the arch-conservative minority opinion.
It’s also a standard that is near impossible for a condemned person to meet. Unlike their ancestors, modern executioners do not make a habit of preening and dancing and pontificating about how the pain they’re about to inflict is good for the condemned soul. How can a person prove that the state is trying to hurt them when it’s already established that the state is trying to kill them? It would seem Neil Gorsuch reads Franz Kafka for cool new ideas on how to mentally torture death-row inmates.
To give his monstrous opinion the veneer of civilized thought, Gorsuch digs deep into his “originalist” bag of tricks. Gorsuch spends a lot of time detailing all of the horrible methods of execution that had fallen out of favor by the time the Eighth Amendment was ratified. The goal is to show that the founding fathers were perfectly okay with capital punishment (which they were) but had a civilized approach to it that comports with our modern views. The argument is that the Eighth Amendment should be read with these upstanding fellows in mind, men who were not interested in abolishing the death penalty, but wanted to ensure that the medieval tortures of the Old World were not transported to their New World.
Gorsuch tells us that some methods of death were clearly prohibited by the Eighth Amendment at the time of the Founding: Cruel and Unusual Punishment Alabama Is Going to Execute Rocky Myers. He Might Be Innocent. Ashoka Mukpo
These included such “[d]isgusting” practices as dragging the prisoner to the place of execution, disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and burning alive, all of which Blackstone observed “savor[ed] of torture or cruelty.”
Methods of execution like these readily qualified as “cruel and unusual,” as a reader at the time of the Eighth Amendment’s adoption would have understood those words.
The founding fathers can choke on a cherry pit for all I care about their “enlightened” views on executions. Gorsuch conveniently leaves out that all of the methods he lists, every single one, remained well in use, in America, long after the Constitution and Eighth Amendment were ratified. Those methods were just primarily used to kill slaves and Native Americans is all. The originalist view of American history always seems to ignore how these same Founding Fathers treated nonwhites. I wonder why.
The Eighth Amendment should not be caged and hobbled in accordance with the wishes of the simple and bigoted minds who wrote it. It’s not our fault that these hypocrites blurted out a principle that would honor human dignity more than they had the will to in their own time. Way back in 1958 , the Supreme Court said that the Eighth Amendment “must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” The Eighth Amendment isn’t an artifact; it’s a challenge. It’s not something to hide behind; it’s something to live up to.
But Neil Gorsuch, and a legion of conservative legal “thinkers” like him, don’t want our society to mature and evolve. They want it to arrest and ossify. They don’t view the Constitution as a floor upon which we can build a better society;, they view it as ceiling which we are doomed to forever struggle against.
People will suffer because of this opinion. More people will spend their last moments on this earth in agonizing pain, because of this decision. That primarily (though not exclusively) “bad” people will suffer is the only reason Gorsuch thinks he can get away with authorizing such suffering. (I’ll spare you Brett Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion in this case, because it’s just a thoughtless contemplation of firing squads. He sounds like a child who’s just figured out he’s strong enough to pull the wings off a fly.)
This decision is immoral. It is painful. It is evil. You don’t even have to be morally against the death penalty to understand what has been done here. You just have to be more decent than Neil Gorsuch.

World Economic Forum On the Middle East And North Africa To Focus On Building New Platforms Of Cooperation – Eurasia Review,www.eurasiareview.com,Eurasia Review,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/03042019-world-economic-forum-on-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-to-focus-on-building-new-platforms-of-cooperation/,"By Eurasia Review
The World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa will be held at the Dead Sea in Jordan on 6-7 April 2019 in partnership with the King Abdullah II Fund for Development (KAFD). This will be the 10th meeting in Jordan and 17th meeting in the region. The meeting will convene more than 1,000 government, business and civil society leaders from over 50 countries.
Under the theme “Building New Platforms of Cooperation”, the meeting will focus on four transformational imperatives: Shaping a new economic and social model for the region; environmental stewardship in the Arab world; finding common ground in a multiconceptual world; and the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the Arab world.
“The region is at a pivotal time of taking the bold decisions necessary to future-proof its societies and economies. At this meeting, we will hold several strategic dialogues, with particular attention on the relationship between the public, private and civic sectors, the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on skills and jobs, and new initiatives to help resolve long-standing conflicts,” said Mirek Dusek, Deputy Head of Centre for Geopolitical and Regional Affairs and Member of the Executive Committee at the World Economic Forum.
For his part, Chairman of KAFD’s Board of Trustees Alaa Batayneh said, “Having Jordan host the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa for the 10th time reaffirms the importance of Jordan’s political and economic position within the region.” “The Forum offers an international platform to highlight the priorities and plans of Jordan and the region, in the fields of development, energy, technology applications, and natural resource management,” he added.
With the full support of the host country and presence of Their Majesties King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein, Queen Rania Al Abdullah and H.R.H. Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the meeting will bring together leaders from Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Levant and North Africa, as well as key international stakeholders from East Africa, Europe and the United States.
The Co-Chairs of this year’s meeting are: Khalid Al Rumaihi, Chief Executive, Bahrain Economic Development Board, Bahrain; Thani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment of the United Arab Emirates; Rania A. Al-Mashat, Minister of Tourism of Egypt; Alain Bejjani, Chief Executive Officer, Majid Al Futtaim Holding, United Arab Emirates; Wafa Ben-Hassine, MENA Policy Counsel, Access Now, USA; Sumantra Chakrabarti, President, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), London; Tony F. Chan, President, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia; and Sigrid Kaag, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands.
For the second time, the World Economic Forum is partnering with the Bahrain Economic Development Board to bring 100 Arab start-ups to the meeting. The initiative aims to further integrate entrepreneurs into a national and regional dialogue on pressing challenges. More than 400 applicants representing 17 countries and spanning numerous sectors including finance, energy, health, environment, media and education applied. Among the selected start-ups are Careem (UAE) – also included in the 2017 selection – the region’s first “unicorn”, which was recently sold for $3.1 billion; Coded (Kuwait), the first coding boot camps for the Arab world; Proximie (Lebanon), a company that uses augmented reality for surgeons to contribute remotely to clinical procedures; and Wahed (UAE), the world’s first halal investment platform.
The meeting will also focus on highlighting long-term approaches to responding to systemic issues. For example, the Humanitarian Investing Initiative, launched at the Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, will showcase innovative approaches to investing that respond to the long-term challenges of protracted humanitarian crises. Taking this long-term approach, other sessions will feature solution-based, forward-looking dialogues on issues of healthcare, energy, water, gender equality, the future of jobs, cybersecurity and more.

EFF Fights For Redditor Targeted By Religious Organization For Forum Posts About Its Data Collection Policies,www.techdirt.com,Tim Cushing,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190331/12091041914/eff-fights-redditor-targeted-religious-organization-forum-posts-about-data-collection-policies.shtml,"from the shut-up,-they-dmca'ed dept Wed, Apr 3rd 2019 9:38am — Tim Cushing
There goes the DMCA, being wielded as a tool of censorship again. The EFF is currently battling for a Redditor's anonymity -- something threatened by a bogus DMCA takedown and a subpoena seeking to unmask this supposed infringer.
It's about much more than simply disappearing content from the internet one party didn't want exposed. It's about targeting an individual to deter them from ever posting content like this again. Behind the subpoena is a powerful religious entity -- one that's seeking to shut down criticism of its means and methods .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is representing an anonymous Reddit commenter who is facing an abusive copyright claim from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, a group that publishes doctrines for Jehovah’s Witnesses. Today, EFF filed a motion to quash the attempt by Watchtower to unmask the online commenter.
The commenter referred to as “John Doe” in the filing is a lifelong member of the Jehovah’s Witness community. Using the handle “darkspilver,” Doe has chosen to share comments and concerns via one of Reddit’s online discussion groups. Darkspilver’s posts included a copy of an advertisement asking for donations that appeared on the back of a Watchtower magazine, as well as a chart Doe edited and reformatted to show the kinds of data that the Jehovah’s Witness organization collects and processes. Earlier this year, Watchtower subpoenaed Reddit for information on “darkspilver” as part of a potential copyright lawsuit.
There is no legitimate reason for the Watchtower's actions. The point of these efforts is to chill free speech about a large religious organization that engages in questionable behavior. Anonymity is essential to these discussions. Without this protection, Watchtower could track down users whose comments it didn't like and engage in targeted harassment until the comments stopped.
The EFF is asking the court to quash the subpoena and stand up for the right to engage in anonymous speech. As the EFF's motion [PDF] points out, members of the church stand to lose a lot more than the ability to comment on their church's actions if exposed. Their social and familial lives could be completely disrupted.
The ability to speak pseudonymously is crucial to Doe’s ability to comment freely about matters that can be deeply divisive and contentious among both current and former members of the Jehovah’s Witness community. Doe’s lifelong experience with that community makes Doe afraid to question or doubt religious doctrine or administration in public. Doe believes that dissenting points of view are strongly discouraged in the Jehovah’s Witness community, and that those who express them are likely to be labeled “apostates,” and excommunicated, or “disfellowshipped” from the community. For Doe and others, who grow up and live their lives within the Jehovah’s Witness community, alienation from their religious community means alienation from central social relationships with friends and family.
As the EFF points out, the content targeted by the bogus takedown can only be considered ""infringing"" if everything else contained in copyright law is thrown out. One targeted posting was a scan of the back of a Watchtower magazine containing instructions on how to donate to the organization. The other contained information about the organization's compliance with European data collection regulations. These were posted for informational purposes, allowing members of the subreddit to express their opinions about the organization's data collections and policies. Even if Watchtower has legal ownership of both of these pieces of content, copyright law wasn't violated by the user's posting.
If Watchtower is able to establish ownership for both items, its infringement claims would still fail because both posting are lawful fair uses. The doctrine of fair use “allows the public to use copyrighted works ‘for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching ... and scholarship.’”
[...]
The first posting, the Ad, was originally intended to raise money for the organization. Doe, by contrast, posted it on Reddit in order to spark further commentary regarding the organization’s solicitation strategy – which it did. Moreover, there is no evidence that Doe had any conceivable commercial purpose. The Chart, appears to have been originally created to summarize the Jehovah’s Witness organization’s storage and handling of personal data in connection with obligations of a new European data privacy rule. Doe’s reformatted version, by contrast, was intended to give subreddit members truthful information about the type of data the Jehovah’s Witness organization stores, and how it handles that information, to assuage potentially misguided concerns, and thus help encourage the preservation of information that might be useful in the future to reveal or punish past abuse.
The court has an obligation to protect free speech -- even the anonymous speech of a person who may reside outside of the United States. Commentary on issues of public interest is an essential element of free speech. The internal workings of a religious organization with 20 million members worldwide is definitely of interest to the public -- especially members of an online forum dedicated to discussion of this organization. Hopefully, this attempt to intimidate a forum member into silence by abusing copyright law will be decisively rejected by the court."
Looking for funded transportation projects? Check out transit authorities…you may be surprised!,www.infrastructureusa.org,Mary Scott Nabers,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.infrastructureusa.org/looking-for-funded-transportation-projects-check-out-transit-authoritiesyou-may-be-surprised/,"Looking for funded transportation projects? Check out transit authorities…you may be surprised! Posted by Mary Scott Nabers on Wednesday, April 3rd, 2019
Written by Mary Scott Nabers President and CEO, Strategic Partnerships Inc. Lots of funding is flowing to public transit authorities. An American Public Transportation Association (APTA) report points out that there’s approximately $232 billion in critical public transportation needs across the country, and if that $232 billion were spent over 10 years, the result would be a return of $928 billion over 20 years. That’s because there’s an estimated 4-to-1 return in economic activity on every dollar invested in public transportation projects in the United States. Hard to believe…but that’s what the economists say. Some of the nation’s larger transit authorities are making plans to spend billions of dollars over the next two to four decades. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA)’s CEO Jeff Parker says that the transit authority will invest $100 billion in transit and tech over the next four decades. He notes that the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority will also commit $120 billion over the next 40 years. Government leaders in Washington, D.C., say an investment of $500 billion over 20 years by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is not unrealistic. But many much-needed expansions, upgrades and past-due maintenance projects in other parts of the U.S. are being delayed or set aside. Instead of building new facilities, buying equipment and vehicles and addressing safety concerns, numerous transportation authorities are leasing buses instead of buying them and outsourcing vehicle maintenance and other services to private-sector firms. Whichever route public transit authorities choose, there’s a lot of funding and a lot of upcoming opportunities. There are hundreds of smaller projects as well as the large ones. When transit authorities decide to mitigate traffic congestion, provide better transportation options, create jobs, ensure safety and/or improve security, they open up private-sector opportunities. The smaller projects create contracting opportunities for private-sector firms of all sizes throughout multiple industry sectors. Federal funding often contributes a major portion of transit funding. And much of the funding for mass transit and transportation projects comes from the near insolvent Highway Trust Fund, where funding has been under attack for a long time. In the meantime, a number of contracting opportunities are available. The Chicago Transit Authority plans to upgrade more than 3,800 older model security cameras with high-definition cameras across its rail system. About 1,000 new cameras have already been added. The authority wants to purchase additional cameras over the next several years which would bring the total project investment to about $33 million. The New York City Transit president wants additional surveillance cameras that will cut down on riders who evade bus fares. In North Carolina, the Greensboro Transit Authority has been awarded $1.95 million to purchase as many as six all-electric buses. Greensboro wants to transition to a completely electric bus fleet. More than $5 million in additional Massachusetts Department of Transportation funding is available to regional transit authorities. Two of the projects being funded are related to the creation of a target marketing advertising campaign for Spanish language television. Additionally, funding will be available for a two-part project for installation of new mobile data terminals to interface with management software and the installation of a new Interactive Voice Response telephone notification system. In St. Paul, Minnesota, Metro Transit will receive $7 million in federal funding for a bus stop modernization project that includes shelters that provide heat, light and real-time travel information. Numerous federal grant programs provide funding for transit needs, particularly the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Over the last half century, the FTA has invested $11 billion each year in partnership with state and local governments to enhance public transportation systems. The funds have been used for projects that involve transit infrastructure, bus and related equipment purchases, safety projects and construction or rehabilitation of facilities for buses. Earlier this month, the FTA announced that $85 million in funding is available through its Low-No Program that assists in the funding or leasing of low- or no-emissions vehicles. This funding is used for advanced technologies and for related equipment or facilities for such programs. These competitive grants are available to p ublic transit agencies, state transportation departments and tribes. Grant proposals will be received through May 14.

In April of 2000, Venezuela's LNG export project was announced in a scaled-down version. Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil Corp., and Mitsubishi Corp. signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a $2 billion LNG project in northeastern Venezuela. The project will be known as Project Venezuela Liquefied Natural Gas (PVLNG) and will have a production capacity of about 4 million tonnes/ year.The venture is a downsized version of the so-called Cristobal Colon project, which involved the same four partners (but just Exxon Corp. prior to its acquisition of Mobil Corp.). That project called for an investment of more than $5 billion. [2] Articles and resources"

A preliminary deal signed by Rosneft of Russia and Venezuelan PDVSA could lead to the development of an LNG export project. Under the recent heads of agreement for joint development of the offshore natural gas project in Venezuela, the two companies will establish a joint venture for implementation of the large-scale project for production, treatment and sale of natural gas at the offshore fields Patao, Mejillones and potentially Rio Caribe in Venezuela. Rosneft will be the operator of the joint venture with both companies holding a 50 percent stake. The agreement is the continuation of the memorandum the two companies signed in June of 2015 and will see the two companies performing the feasibility study of the project. It is expected that the production from the three fields could reach 25 million cubic meters per day providing the potential to develop an LNG export project in Venezuela.

Learn more about corporations VOTING to rewrite our laws. About ALEC ALEC is a corporate bill mill. It is not just a lobby or a front group; it is much more powerful than that. Through ALEC, corporations hand state legislators their wishlists to benefit their bottom line. Corporations fund almost all of ALEC's operations. They pay for a seat on ALEC task forces where corporate lobbyists and special interest reps vote with elected officials to approve “model” bills.

In April of 2000, Venezuela's LNG export project was announced in a scaled-down version. Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil Corp., and Mitsubishi Corp. signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a $2 billion LNG project in northeastern Venezuela. The project will be known as Project Venezuela Liquefied Natural Gas (PVLNG) and will have a production capacity of about 4 million tonnes/ year.The venture is a downsized version of the so-called Cristobal Colon project, which involved the same four partners (but just Exxon Corp. prior to its acquisition of Mobil Corp.). That project called for an investment of more than $5 billion. [2] Articles and resources"

The Brunei LNG in Lumut exports 6.7 million tonnes per annum of liquefied gas through ocean-going tankers. The plant was completed in 1972, after gas reserves were discovered beneath the waters of Brunei Darussalam in the 1960s. Most shipments are to Japan and South Korea. The operating company—Brunei LNG Sdn Bhd—is owned by the Government of Brunei (50%), Shell Overseas Trading Limited and Mitsubishi Corporation (both 25%). [1]
Brunei LNG operates seven LNG carriers through the joint venture company, Brunei Shell Tankers. The first four carriers were delivered between October 1972 and October 1975. These older ships were built in France. The three newer vessels were built in Korea (Amali/Arkat) and Japan (Abadi) by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering|Daewoo and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Nagasaki respectively. The first of these three ships was delivered in June 2002, with the most recent ship, Amadi, being delivered in July 2011. [2] [3] Articles and resources"

The Brunei LNG in Lumut exports 6.7 million tonnes per annum of liquefied gas through ocean-going tankers. The plant was completed in 1972, after gas reserves were discovered beneath the waters of Brunei Darussalam in the 1960s. Most shipments are to Japan and South Korea. The operating company—Brunei LNG Sdn Bhd—is owned by the Government of Brunei (50%), Shell Overseas Trading Limited and Mitsubishi Corporation (both 25%). [1]
Brunei LNG operates seven LNG carriers through the joint venture company, Brunei Shell Tankers. The first four carriers were delivered between October 1972 and October 1975. These older ships were built in France. The three newer vessels were built in Korea (Amali/Arkat) and Japan (Abadi) by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering|Daewoo and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Nagasaki respectively. The first of these three ships was delivered in June 2002, with the most recent ship, Amadi, being delivered in July 2011. [2] [3] Articles and resources"

Note: mtpa = million tonnes per year; bcfd = billion cubic feet per day Background
Wheatstone LNG Terminal is an LNG terminal under development in Western Australia, Australia. [1] Its estimated worth is $30 billion. [2]
In 2017 it was discovered that the petroleum resource rent tax had failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue north-west Australia. According to research at Monash University, Wheatstone LNG Terminal, Pluto LNG Terminal , and Ichthys LNG Terminal are not subect to commonwealth royalities. [3]
Chevron planned to complete its Wheatstone LNG project summer of 2017. [4]
Chevron announced in October 2017 it has started producing LNG at Wheatstone project in Australia. It plans to ship its first cargo soon. Woodside plans a 15% production growth over the next three years. [5]
Reuters reported in October 2017 that the LNG market will be sharply focused on how Wheatstone progresses following the troubled beginnings at Chevron’s larger Gorgon LNG Terminal . Natural gas fields offshore of Western Australia feed both Gorgon and Wheatstone. [5]
Reuters reported in October 2017 that Wheatstone is the sixth out of eight projects in a $200 billion Australian LNG construction boom with two more facilities to be launched. The two remaining are Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG Terminal and Ichthys LNG Terminal owned by Japan's Ichthys. [5]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [6] Environment
In 2015 The Guardian reported that Australia’s top 20 emitting facilities include the Wheatstone LNG Terminal, Gorgon LNG Terminal , Ichthys LNG Terminal , and Pluto LNG Terminal . [7]
An 2011 EPA report on the Wheatstone project claim it would “substantially” increase the West Australian state’s total greenhouse gas output, emitting 10m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. This was a 13.5% increase on the state’s 2006-07 emission levels. [2]
In 2012 Wheatstone applied and was granted an exemption to state emissions regulation. [2]
In 2015 the Prime Minister of Australia approved rules for its Direct Action climate policy. Energy watchers claim will allow LNGs to increase greenhouse emissions. [7]
Bloomberg published an article in 2017 claiming the Wheatstone LNG Terminal is designed to let other producers use its equipment to liquefy their gas. Woodside is pursuing a similar strategy. It is courting energy giants as Exxon and Shell and trying to convince them to let go of plans for building new LNG facilities in favor of feeding gas into its Pluto LNG Terminal . [4]
The Wheatstone and Woodside strategy of sharing facilities with competitors is likely a lesson from Curtis Island. The island's three plants in Australia (Australia Pacific LNG Terminal, Gladstone LNG Terminal , Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal ) as an example of having exorbitant infrastructure duplication that it could have saved $10 billion on the combined $70 billion LNG projects. The three LNGs built separate jetties that now crowd the coastal land. Shared facilities, pipelines, and roads could have produced the same amount of fuel with less damage to the coast.

Sunrise Floating LNG Terminal is a proposed LNG terminal in East Timor and Australia. [1]
The Sunrise LNG Terminal would be located at the Sunrise and Troubadour fields. The fields are located approximately 93 miles south-east of East Timor and 280 miles north-west of Darwin. They hold 5.13 trillion cubic feet of gas and 225.9 million barrels of condensate. [2]
Rigzone reported on February 2016 that Sunrise development had stalled on the account that the Australia and East Timor governments had yet to agree on their maritime borders. [2]
Forbes reported in 2016 Greater Sunrise’s gas reserves are potentially worth more than $8 billion to East Timor. [3]
In October 2018 ConocoPhillips sold its 30% share in the Sunrise gas project to the government of Timor-Leste for $350 million, and in November 2018 Shell Australia sold its 26.56% share in the gas project to the government of Timor-Leste for $300 million. [4]

Pluto LNG Terminal is an LNG terminal in Western Australia, Australia. [1]
This facility is estimated to generate between 0.36 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) for every metric ton of LNG produced according to a 2013 report. [2]
In 2015 The Guardian reported that Australia’s top 20 emitting facilities include the Wheatstone LNG Terminal , Gorgon LNG Terminal , Ichthys LNG Terminal , and Pluto LNG Terminal. [3]
In 2017 Woodside, Australia's biggest oil and gas company, cancelled a small expansion of Pluto. Instead it developed plans to connect their smaller Pluto LNG Terminal with their North West Shelf LNG Terminal on the Burrup Peninsula. [4]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [5]
In 2017 it was discovered that the petroleum resource rent tax had failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue north-west Australia. According to research at Monash University, Wheatstone LNG Terminal , Pluto LNG Terminal, and Ichthys LNG Terminal are not subect to commonwealth royalities. [6] Environment
Bloomberg published an article in 2017 claiming the Wheatstone LNG Terminal is designed to let other producers use its equipment to liquefy their gas. Woodside is pursuing a similar strategy. It is courting energy giants like Exxon and Shell to let go of plans for new LNGs in favor of feeding gas into its Pluto LNG Terminal. [7]
The Wheatstone and Woodside strategy of sharing facilities with competitors is likely a lesson from Curtis Island. The island's three plants in Australia (Australia Pacific LNG Terminal, Gladstone LNG Terminal , Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal ) as an example of having exorbitant infrastructure duplication that it could have saved $10 billion on the combined $70 billion LNG projects. The three LNGs built separate jetties that now crowd the coastal land. Shared facilities, pipelines, and roads could have produced the same amount of fuel with less damage to the coast.

Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal is an LNG terminal on Curtis Island in Queensland, Australia on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. [1] Curtis Island's three plants Australia Pacific LNG Terminal , Gladstone LNG Terminal , Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal are worth $70 billion.
Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal began exporting late 2014. [2]
In Summer 2017 Queensland Curtis LNG planned for the first major shut down of the facility after it began exporting late 2014. [2]
Analysts from the Petroleum Economist predicted in July 2017 that two of the Curtis Island plants, Gladstone LNG Terminal and Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal, would likely operate below capacity until global demand exceeds supply. [3]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [4] Environmental Concerns
Dredging to widen and deepen the Port of Gladstone to allow for several LNG projects in the port caused some ocean turbidity and possible damage to wildlife the fishing industry. [5]
In 2011, the Queensland Government announced it would close up to 311 square miles (500 square kilometers) of Queensland coast to fishing. At the same time the government warned citizens that seafood should not be handled or eaten. [5]
Divisions emerged over whether dredging caused these issues. The release of acid sulphate from dredging may have damaged and killed turtles and fish. Fishermen had been warning the public about problems since October 2010. Thirty percent of the catch was infected for a month during August and September 2011. [5]
Bloomberg published an article in 2017 citing Curtis Island's three plants in Australia ( Australia Pacific LNG Terminal , Gladstone LNG Terminal , Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal) as an example of having exorbitant infrastructure duplication that it could have saved $10 billion on the combined $70 billion LNG projects. The three LNGs built separate jetties that now crowd the coastal land. Shared facilities could have produced the same amount of fuel with less damage to the coast. [6] Coal Seam Environmental Concerns
In December 2014, Queensland Curtis LNG became the world's first project to turn coal seam gas into LNG for export. Curtis Island's two other LNG plants, Australia Pacific LNG Terminal and Gladstone LNG Terminal also convert coal seam gas into LNG. [7]
Coal seam gas projects in Australia are not without controversy.
Coal seam gas (abbreviated ""CSG"") is formed by the geological process of heating and compressing plant matter to create coal. Over millions of years, methane forms within the coal. The methane is trapped by water in the gaps and cracks between the coal molecules. These gaps are known as cleats. Australia has been found to have many deposits, and is increasingly mining them through hydraulic fracturing , also known as fracking . [8]
CSG is a form of coalbed methane (CBM), or coalbed gas, and is a type of natural gas extracted from coal beds. In recent decades it has become an increasingly used source of energy in Australia, as well as the United States, Canada, and other countries. [8] Articles and resources"

Prelude Floating LNG Terminal is an offshore LNG terminal under development in Western Australia, Australia. [2] It's close neighbor is Inpex-owned Ichthys LNG Terminal . [3]
Prelude is one of the largest floating gas-export vessels to date. It is 1,601 feet long and weighs about 600,000 metric tons. [4]
Construction on Prelude began in late 2012. [4]
The facility had announced legally binding buyer agreements. [5]
As of early 2017 Prelude was still under construction. [5] . In June 2017 Prelude left the yard in South Korea, towed to Australia to be chained to the ocean floor off Australia. The first cargo of fuel is likely by mid-2018. [4]
Reuters reported in October 2017 that Wheatstone LNG Terminal in Western Australia is the sixth out of eight projects in a $200 billion Australian LNG construction boom with two more facilities to be launched. The two remaining are Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG Terminal and Ichthys LNG Terminal owned by Japan's Ichthys. [6]
The terminal began commercial operations in December 2018. [7] Natural Gas in Australia
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [8]
Prelude may positioned Australia to overtake Qatar as the world's biggest exporter of the fuel in the coming years. [4] Articles and resources"

North West Shelf LNG Terminal is an LNG export terminal in Western Australia, Australia. [1]
According to the company website in 1989 the first cargo of North West Shelf LNG left the facility's Karratha Gas Plant onboard headed to Japan’s Sodegaura Terminal. The North West Shelf LNG Project has delivered almost 4000 LNG cargoes since 1989. [2]
In 2017 Woodside, Australia's biggest oil and gas company, developed plans to connect their smaller Pluto LNG Terminal with their North West Shelf LNG Terminal on the Burrup Peninsula. [3]
North West Shelf LNG exports to Asia. Reuters reported in 2017 that the facility exports about 16.3 million tons a year. [4]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [5]
In 2017 it was discovered that the petroleum resource rent tax had failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue north-west Australia. [6]
There have been plans to extend North West Shelf LNG to serve the domestic market as well as export. In 2017 Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce supported the construction of a new pipeline linking West Australia’s gas fields to the strained markets of the east coast. He proposed North West Shelf LNG to be shipped to Melbourne where it could feed through an import terminal. [7]
Woodside and ConocoPhillips, operators of Australia’s two oldest LNG plants, Darwin LNG Terminal and North West Shelf LNG are considering cheaper development options for their Browse and Barossa gas fields to compete against Qatar. Qatar added to the fears of Australia’s LNG owners in July 2017 when it announced a 23 million ton-a-year increase in gas exports. [8]
The Woodside chief executive has made clear his preferred feedstock option is for the North West Shelf LNG would be from the 30.6 per cent Woodside-owned Browse gas field. [8] Articles and resources"

Newcastle LNG Terminal was a proposed export LNG terminal in New South Wales, Australia. [1]
In 2010 Eastern Star proposed the LNG, but to export coal-seam gas from its Narrabri project. [2] The Narrabri gas project is the last existing coal seam gas project in New South Wales. [3]
The project was cancelled in 2016, but some elected leaders as Labor's Joel Fitzgibbon are still pushing for an import terminal in the Port of Newcastle. [2]
In December 2018 South Korean company EPIK proposed an A$500 million LNG import facility at Newcastle. [4] Australia's Coal Seam Environmental Concerns
In December 2014, Queensland Curtis LNG became the world's first project to turn coal seam gas into LNG for export. Curtis Island's two other LNG plants, Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal and Gladstone LNG Terminal also convert coal seam gas into LNG. [5]
Coal seam gas projects in Australia are not without controversy. Coal seam gas (abbreviated ""CSG"") is formed by the geological process of heating and compressing plant matter to create coal. Over millions of years, methane forms within the coal. The methane is trapped by water in the gaps and cracks between the coal molecules. These gaps are known as cleats. Australia has been found to have many deposits, and is increasingly mining them through hydraulic fracturing , also known as fracking . [6]
CSG is a form of coalbed methane (CBM), or coalbed gas, and is a type of natural gas extracted from coal beds. In recent decades it has become an increasingly used source of energy in Australia, as well as the United States, Canada, and other countries. [6]
Australian green groups and farmers have raised concerns about coal seam gas development. In May 2010 four toxic chemicals - benzene , toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) - were discovered in eight exploration wells owned by the Australia Pacific LNG Terminal in the Surat Basin. But the Queensland Government has ruled out a moratorium on the industry. [7] Articles and resources"
