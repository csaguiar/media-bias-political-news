What should stay-at-home moms get at divorce?,www.forbes.com,Naomi Cahn,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/naomicahn/2019/04/19/what-should-stay-at-home-moms-get-at-divorce/,"MacKenzie Bezos helped Jeff start Amazon – and then stayed home to take care of the family (and become a successful novelist). She is one of the more than o ne-quarter of American mothers who stay home (only 7% of men do so) . That number includes about 10% of all highly educated mothers (those with a master’s degree or higher) who opt out of the workplace to take care of their families. T hese women opt out to support the careers of their husbands and to engage in the intensive mothering that is expected of them . While the women may explain they are voluntarily deciding to stay home, that choice gets strong public support: m ore than half of Americans believe that mothers will do a better job of caring for a new baby than believe that both mothers and fathers would be equally good -- and only 1% believe that fathers, not mothers, would provide better care . Thus, “ for many heterosexual couples, it’s more of a foregone conclusion.”
When these women get divorced, the law in virtually all states requires that property be distributed equitably, but only a few states require equal distribution.
That’s where this gets complicated. Should the caretaking that stay-at-home moms do be valued as equal to the breadwinning of their husbands? Consider whether that means the stay-at-home mom should be entitled to half of all assets, and whether we do not adequately “ value the often invisible and unpaid labor that so many women do to enable their husbands to build wealth and find professional success.”
This question of how to value caretaking at divorce was at the core of an innovative recent study by two Vanderbilt professors. Law profs Joni Hersch and Jennifer Bennett Shinall recruited more than 3000 subjects to find out their thoughts on the property that a stay-at-home spouse should receive on divorce. All participants read the same basic fact scenario.
Pendant of key ring in shape of house divided in two parts on wooden background, closeup view. Dividing house when divorce, division of property and real estate.
Getty John and Susan began dating in 1995, shortly after they began their first professional jobs. They married in 1998, and both continued to work until 2003, when the first of their three children was born. After the birth of their first child, John and Susan decided they could live comfortably on John’s income. Susan left her job in 2003 in order to focus on raising their three children, and she has never returned to work. (p. 12)
They were all also told that John was the one who had filed for divorce after 17 years of marriage. But then, they were given one of six different scenarios with variations in the spouses’ educational levels and occupations as well as in accumulated property, and asked how the property should be divided.
Women were more likely to give Susan a larger share, and their decisions as to Susan’s entitlement varied little, regardless of the spouses’ educational level or occupation. By contrast, men’s awards differed, and they were more likely to give a larger award to Susan if she had a higher education.
When it comes to why they made these awards, most participants believed that John’s financial contributions were an important factor. Beyond that, more men than women rated a breadwinner’s entitlement to earnings as important, and more women than men believed that the value of staying home was an important factor (although the good news is that a majority of both sexes did recognize the value of caretaking).
This study shows the impact – at divorce – of being a stay-at-home mom who gives up her own career: she is unlikely to receive half of all property earned during the marriage. And other studies show that she will probably not get long-term alimony. The study also shows the tough questions of just how we think of the institution of marriage today, according to June Carbone , my co-author of Marriage Markets and a law professor who teaches at the University of Minnesota Law School. She suggests that an alternative to trying to value caretaking is instead to treat marriage as a promise to share equally, irrespective of contribution and irrespective of fault (although she doesn’t necessarily favor that approach).
As a society, we are still working through what is right when a marriage ends, how to value caretaking versus breadwinning (and leading).
For MacKenzie Bezos, this doesn’t make a difference, of course. Based on her divorce settlement, she will become the t hird richest woman in the world."
Joyn Bio Opens California Facility To Test Its Engineered Microbes On Crop Growth,www.forbes.com,Alex Knapp,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2019/04/19/joyn-bio-opens-california-facility-to-test-its-engineered-microbes-on-crop-growth/,"Joyn Bio, a joint agtech venture between synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks and Bayer, plans to open a research facility in California to speed up the development of its engineered microbes. The aim: fix nitrogen in soil for wheat and corn fields, reducing or even eliminating the need for synthetic fertilizers. Synthetic fertilizers have been a major reason for the massive boost to crop yields that agriculture has seen over the past century. But that growth has come at a cost —synthetic fertilizers can do harm to the health of the soil, and when excess fertilizer runs off into rivers and oceans, it can cause environmental harms such as toxic algae blooms .
This is where Joyn Bio steps in, taking advantage of the resources of its parent companies. Bayer has a library of dozens of microbes that are capable of colonizing entire corn or wheat plants, Joyn CEO Mike Miille says. And Ginkgo Bioworks, a synthetic biology company that spun out of MIT, is capable of engineering those microbes to produce specific proteins. The combination, says Miille, creates a possible alternative to chemical fertilizers—and other chemicals as well.
“You suddenly have a very easy way, almost a platform-type approach for delivering almost anything you can imagine to that plant,” he said. “You now have a whole alternative to spraying those crops with chemicals.”
It’s been about 18 months since Joyn was founded with a $100 million Series A round coming from its two parent companies. In that time, researchers at the company have been diligently working to engineer microbes that can be safely and effectively used with corn and wheat plants. Now, says Miille, it’s time to put those new products to the test, which is where the new facility fits in.
Situated in Woodland, California, near Sacramento, Joyn’s new testing facility comprises about 12,500 square feet of office, lab and greenhouse space. It also sits on about 300 acres of land, making it possible to test Joyn’s microbes under field conditions, not just greenhouse conditions. The company expects to begin operations at the facility in May or June.
Once operations commence there, though, it will still take a while before any of Joyn’s products make it out into the commercial market. Even if all tests go well, it’s likely that it will take 3-4 years before any product is ready for market, with others taking 5-6 years of testing before they can be sold."
"Music Industry, Family, Fans Celebrate Luther Vandross With 'Fandross' On The Late Singer's Birthday",www.forbes.com,Adrienne Gibbs,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adriennegibbs/2019/04/19/music-industry-family-fans-celebrate-luther-vandross-with-fandross-late-singers-birthday/,"As the world prepares to celebrate what would have been the Grammy-winning crooner’s 68th birthday, the family and friends of Luther Vandross are preparing to bring a lot more Luther to a lot more people. Enter Fandross. It’s the brain baby of Vandross’ niece, Seveda Williams, and it’s officially official.
“We are celebrating and continuing [his] musical legacy,” says Seveda Williams, whose April 20, 2019 New York City “Fandross Bad Boy/ Having a Party Birthday Celebration 2019” event was hosted by fellow R&B legends Ashford & Simpson at their much-lauded Sugar Bar. “We’re doing it with quality events. They’re authentic and beautiful because I am surrounded by the actual singers and musicians who played and worked with him.”
Fandross officially launched in 2018 with a two-day music festival and memorial designed to both comfort and energize long-time fans of the crooner's signature hits. But 2019 will see a lot more action from the group, which is backed by Sony music, says Williams, who is the CEO of Fandross, Vice President of Development and Marketing for Vandross LLC, and is the family’s official liaison with Sony Music/Legacy Recordings.
After over a year of planning, the NYC Fandross event will, eventually, travel to Chicago and Philadelphia, among other cities. It’s an official remembrance tour for Vandross, who was the sort of performer whose music transcends ages and time. With songs like “Dance With My Father,” “Never Too Much” and “A House Is Not A Home,” the R&B legend’s catalog generates tribute concerts seemingly every other weekend in a number of cities, but the difference with Fandross is that it includes the band and is sanctioned.

Getty Williams hopes that Fandross will eventually teach a new generation about the wide reach of her uncle’s talents. Not only did he sing, but he wrote music that has been sampled by others. She also hopes that fans stick with Fandross rather than other outfits that use his name. That said, she reminds diehard fans that her organization won’t be doing anything disrespectful with his legacy.
“We’re not trying to be him,” she says. “Please understand that. But I will be creating situations that are always respectful to the man and his art and I want to introduce people. I want people to see how you can have a great career without compromising your dignity and I want to remind people who have been to good performances what quality singers are all about.”
On top of having five Grammys, five American Music Awards, and seven NAACP Image Awards, Vandross also built his career singing and working with other greats, including Barbra Streisand. This year he will be inducted into the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture’s “Musical Crossroads” section, says Williams, where the museum will display one of his meticulously-created performance suits. The singer died in July 2005 from complications due to a heart attack. Meanwhile, his 2003 hit, “Dance With My Father,” is one of many modern classics still in heavy rotation for Father’s Day, memorial services and weddings – something that prompted Williams to work with Sony music to solidify the next steps of this official fan and memorial club.
When asked why Fandross didn’t get organized until the past year, Williams says she just needed time to sort things out. As she mentally prepared for the logical next steps, she got together with the band annually and they sang and celebrated. Who knew they eventually would work on the same team?
“Time helps you get along. This is a lot later than 2005 and 2007 but I wasn’t ready,” she says. “I’m ready now. He’s prepared me. Over the years, there’s a reason why I kept gathering the band and everybody together.”
Now with the help of core members including Alfa Anderson (from Chic) and Vandross’ frequent co-writer and music director Nat Adderley Jr. (nephew of jazz legend Cannonball Adderley) the show will go on.
“Not all of the members are involved but core members like Alfa and Nat? You’re not going to get that anywhere else,"" says Williams. ""There will always be tribute shows by other people, and I think those are beautiful that people are still very much in love with him. But here we are, the Luther team. This has been inside of me for years; developing. That’s my energy behind this. I’m about moving forward. He taught me to move forward. I’m doing it with all the love and respect I have. Get on board this good train right here. This is what I’m doing and it’s good.”"
"Through Hard Work And Perseverance, Tiger Woods Rewrites His Narrative",www.forbes.com,Frances Bridges,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/francesbridges/2019/04/19/through-hard-work-and-perseverance-tiger-woods-rewrites-his-narrative/,"Last Sunday, Tiger Woods won his fifth masters title, his first masters in 14 years, and his first championship in 11 years. It has been a long 11 years for Woods, who has famously struggled. He suffers from back issues, and has undergone four back surgeries throughout his career, most recently in May 2017. Woods was found asleep at the wheel of his Mercedes a month later. He claimed it was “an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications,” and a toxicology test showed traces of five different drugs in his system. When Woods returned to the course in December of that year, he was ranked 1,199th in the world. He has been in and out of surgery and in and out of rehab, and no one will forget the spectacular, scandalous public break up of his marriage and the drama that ensued in 2009. Sponsors like AT&T dropped him, but Nike has stood by Woods, insisting he was addressing his issues. He was the number 1 golfer in the world, considered a role model and the greatest golfer in a generation—and he fell from grace overnight. Since then his game unraveled due to physical ailments and lack of focus on the course. Fans and pundits were not sure he would ever be the same player. Especially in 2017 with his DUI and back surgery, it was hard to believe he would win another tournament. But then he won on Sunday.
He didn’t just come back from behind in the tournament (his first ever in a tournament), he came back from behind in his career. Woods had every excuse to retire, every reason to believe he would never win a championship again, every reason to believe no one cared if he competed. Many thought Woods he was a lost cause, that his story was done: he was a once in a generation golfer who ultimately could not overcome his demons and it cost him his career. But now that narrative has changed. His legacy will no longer be defined by his struggles, but by how he overcame them. Woods won on Sunday for one reason: he did not let anyone else dictate what he could and could not accomplish. He believed in himself and he simply did not give up.
Woods spent 11 years grappling with the injuries that plague him and the demons that haunt him, and on Sunday over a decade of worked paid off. It was a stirring example of an athlete not giving up on his life’s passion, in spite of surmounting evidence that he would never win another tournament. It is an inspiring example of a person who worked through their issues in the public eye, made progress in spite of them, picked themselves up when they failed and kept going. Most people would have given up. Most people would not keep chasing a dream for 11 years against such odds and after such blistering, embarrassing failures. It’s an example of what we’re capable of if we have grit, if we persevere, if we work hard and if we never, ever, ever give up. Woods is the case in point: people overwhelmingly wrote off his career, no one believed he could win another championship, but now he is poised for a second chapter."

The Devilishly Compelling 'Hail Satan?' Challenges More Than Preconceptions,www.forbes.com,Simon Thompson,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2019/04/19/the-devilishly-compelling-hail-satan-challenges-more-than-preconceptions/,"Hail Satan? probably isn’t the documentary you’re expecting it to be. It’s also possibly a documentary that many will balk at purely because of the name and the subject matter and, as a result, avoid like the plague. People are absolutely entitled to but that, in my opinion, would be a mistake. Having premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, Hail Satan? is now getting a theatrical release, and it is perhaps one of the most surprising pieces of work I have watched in recent memory – it is undoubtedly far funnier than I expected. So how difficult is it to fund a documentary about The Satanic Temple, its origins and grassroots activism?
“It was not that hard,” Penny Lane, Hail Satan? ’s director, told me. “Satan has always sold tickets!”
“The reaction to it has been much more positive than I expected. I think that is a testament to documentary audiences: the film absolutely requires an open mind and heart and a willingness to update your priors in the face of new information. The fact that so many people not only come to understand the Satanic worldview but to embrace it is a pretty astonishing thing to happen in only 95 minutes.”
Lane admits that audience reactions to the documentary have taken her surprise, saying: “Try figuring out what to say to people who clutch your arm and say with wide eyes and a very confused smile, ‘I think I might be a Satanist?’”
Amongst an ensemble of participants, the documentary’s key figure is Lucien Greaves, the co-founder of The Satanic Temple.
“We had received countless pitches for documentaries and other film projects before Penny approached us, and I had grown quite used to turning them down. I was almost certain that I wouldn't agree to any documentaries at all by the time Penny contacted me, he explained. “I was exasperated by the constant appeals to ""humanize"" or ""normalize"" The Satanic Temple, these pitches that promised to tell our own stories.”
“What they did not realize, but Penny did, was that we weren't interested in seeking the approval of the public at large or in glorifying ourselves individually. From the start, we've only sought exposure in relation to our campaigns and the issues we champion. The story of The Satanic Temple is not the story of any one of the people that you see in the film or even any collection of them. It's the story of an idea, a movement, a new religion, and a culture war that will define the future for generations to come. It's a film about all of us because the issues explored in the film have ramifications upon all of our lives. Your role in the story is only limited to your willingness to engage with it directly.”
Lucien Greaves, co-founder of The Satanic Temple, the nontheistic religious and political activist group based in Salem, Massachusetts.
Magnolia Pictures Greaves admits that Hail Satan? has challenged his own preconceived ideas about how the story being told would be received, especially by journalists.
“I had grown used to the idea that most interviews I would do would be hostile debates,” he explained. “I am still disoriented by the Sundance experience where mainstream press journalists would introduce themselves while describing my work as 'inspirational' or even 'heroic.' I did not believe that such opinions would gain such open acceptance in my lifetime.”
Hail Satan? isn’t afraid to address some pretty significant issues head-on from the Satanic panic of the 1970s and 1980s to the separation of church and state and their fight to maintain it.
While not a political documentary, Greaves admits that the documentary’s timing, something that was years in the making, is perfect and thinks people will be surprised by its poignancy.
“I think they will, and I think that the current political-cultural environment helps people to more easily understand the meaning of Satanism,” he explains.
“It's one thing to describe the notion of Christendom as a superstitious Dark Age theocratic aspiration in relation to which Satanism stands as a new cultural mythic framework for enlightenment values, but it's another thing to actually witness the rise of an Evangelical Nationalist theocratic coup while Satanists fight to preserve pluralism and individual freedom. Satanism is soon to be an expected and accepted religious presence, and we partly have theocratic evangelicals like Mike Pence to thank.”
Hail Satan? director, Penny Lane has been ""astonished"" by the way audiences have embraced the documentary.
Magnolia Pictures Anyone coming to Hail Satan? looking for the classic preconceived tropes and traits of Satanism will probably be sorely disappointed. Nudity and sacrifices? No. Litter picking, community initiatives and a fight to uphold the United States Constitution? Absolutely. Greaves’ Satanic Temple has excommunicated those who contradict their principles and who they believe counter their seven fundamental tenets.
“The biggest misconception about Satanists, in general, is that we venerate evil and engage in a conspiracy of organized criminality,” Greaves explains. “The biggest misconception about The Satanic Temple, in particular, is that we are just atheist 'trolls' merely trying to get a rise out of Christian nationalists.
“Just by taking a naked look at who The Satanic Temple are and what we do, the documentary serves to dispel the myth of the homicidal Satanic cult conspiracy while showing the authentic religious attachment our membership has to non-theistic Satanism.”
We appear to be in something of a golden age when it comes to documentaries doing solid business at the box office. 2018 saw the likes of Won’t You Be My Neighbor? , RBG , Three Identical Strangers , and Free Solo secure rave reviews and domestic grosses of $22.61 million, $14.01 million, $12.32 million and $9.65 million respectively – one of the best years for documentaries ever.
“I remain skeptical that the big business side of the documentary industry really extends to too many films without celebrities, but there's no doubt we have seen lots of big docs,” Lane muses. “New technology has allowed for better ""production quality"" at a level people associate with the big screen, so that helps.”
“Also a whole generation or two has been raised on reality TV which surely has had an impact on our feeling that ""real life"" is super entertaining. As far as my film goes, yes, there is no doubt that the current political climate has a lot to do with the success and appeal of The Satanic Temple, and we expect that concerns about Christian nationalist lawmakers trying to inch us toward a theocracy will only increase.”
As eye-opening as Hail Satan? will be for viewers, sharing his world with others has been an equally eye-opening experience for Greaves.
He explains: “I appreciate meeting some of the really conventional, reserved types who suddenly find themselves feeling an unabashed kinship with Satanists. The profound effect that this film visibly has on many of the viewers who have come to the initial screenings is incredible. I haven't got the proper words to describe it.”
Hail Satan? is in theaters now."

Jarrell 'Big Baby' Miller: What 3 Failed Drug Tests Mean For The Rest Of His Career,www.forbes.com,Brian Mazique,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/04/19/jarrell-big-baby-miller-what-3-failed-drug-tests-mean-for-the-rest-of-his-career/,"Jarrell 'Big Baby' Miller's initial failed drug test for GW1516 was bad enough. The second dirty drop for HGH (Human Growth Hormone), which took place prior to the initially reported failure, took the cake, and now the third test that revealed EPO stomps all over it. Mix this in with a failed test back in 2014 from his kickboxing days , and the picture is much clearer than the samples Miller submits.
Originally, Miller denied wrongdoing, but as the stack of negative tests built like lost rounds in a championship fight, Miller finally took to Instagram to own up to his transgressions. In the understatement of the young year, Miller says, ""I messed up.""
Jarrell Miller has now posted this video after it emerged he'd failed three separate drugs tests for three different banned substances. He admits he ""messed up"" and says he will ""own up"" to his mistake. pic.twitter.com/HUNpmGUp9l
— Michael Benson (@MichaelBensonn) April 20, 2019
To put it plainly, Miller threw an amazing opportunity down the drain, and his once-promising career will be forever stained. No one will ever take him seriously, and in this era of memes and gifs designed to highlight a celebrity's inequities, Big Baby just made himself the most popular target in combat sports.
Here's what I used to think about Miller:
He's a huge heavyweight who could stand to drop some weight, but he's nimble on his feet, has good hand speed, decent stamina, and average to above-average punching power. Miller also has the gift of gab. He's one of the few guys in the division with the ability to sell a fight with his personality and outrageousness.
This is primarily why Matchroom chose him as Anthony Joshua's next opponent in June.
After the three failed drug tests, this is where I am now, and something tells me I'm not alone with this perception in the boxing community:
He's one of the most egregious and sloppy cheaters in combat sports in recent memory. The UFC's Ruslan Magomed is perhaps the only guy of any level of prominence who has a rap sheet on par with Miller. As much credit as Miller has received for his stamina, we don't know where his physical gifts begin and end, and where EPO and GW1516 filled in the gaps.
Everything he's done, which wasn't much, to begin with, and anything he accomplishes moving forward will be questioned and looked upon with skepticism.

Getty To be totally honest, he would have been better off fighting Joshua and getting knocked out in the first 30 seconds of the fight than to disgrace himself in this way. Moving forward, Miller will have to serve whatever suspension comes his way, but in the thirsty-for-notoriety environment that rules American entertainment, someone will give him another chance.
Because of his past, he will have a heck of a mountain to climb to reach respectability, and it will be easy for big-name fighters to ignore him. On the positive side, Miller is only 30 years old, which is pretty young for a heavyweight boxer. If he can get himself clean, and win that way for a few years, he might be able to climb back to this level.
Even then, his name will forever carry the stain of failed drug tests. It's hard to imagine him ever being the A-side in any negotiations, thus it's hard to quantify how much money he has cost himself in the long run. It's totally possible Miller realizes he cannot compete on a high level once he returns to the ring, and that this ordeal could wind up being the end of his boxing career.
Overall, it's a troubling and incredibly disappointing turn of events for a guy who could have been a star in the sport."

Increase The Odds That You Can Continue Working In Your Retirement Years,www.forbes.com,Steve Vernon,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevevernon/2019/04/20/increase-the-odds-that-you-can-continue-working-in-your-retirement-years/,"If working longer is part of your retirement plan, to make it a realistic plan, you need to take some smart steps to make it happen. The first two steps are to clarify the reasons why you might want to continue working and then investigate the many ways that you could work in your retirement years, as discussed in my prior posts. The third and final step is to increase the odds that you’ll be able to find work that meets your needs. Start by inventorying your relevant skills and experience. To help you get started on this task, here’s a simple three-part inventory of your earning abilities:
Specific job skills and credentials . What are the specific tasks you’ve completed over your career that might be useful to a potential employer? What skills did you learn that you can use in future jobs? What credentials, degrees, and certifications do you hold?
Your work experience . List all the jobs you’ve had and the relevant experience they’ve provided. For example, note where you’ve supervised other workers, managed groups of workers, interacted with the public, dealt with difficult situations, been a troubleshooter, been active with public speaking tasks, and so on. Your network of contacts . Over the years, you’ve met many people who might help you find work in your retirement years or can suggest where to look. Make a list that includes friends, neighbors, work colleagues, vendors, and customers. Kerry Hannon’s excellent book Getting the Job You Want After 50 for Dummies has an entire chapter devoted to this topic to help you create a more detailed inventory.
You’ll also need a smart plan to improve the odds that you can extend your earning years. Here’s one such plan from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies :
Stay healthy so you can continue working. Perform well at your current job. Keep your skills up to date. Network and meet new people. Scope out the employment market and opportunities available. Go back to school and learn new skills. Here are a few more steps to help you keep working:
Do what you can to make sure you’ll be physically or cognitively able to continue working at your current occupation. If you won’t be, then be prepared to retrain or assume less demanding work that will most likely be lower-paid. Look for ways to decrease your living expenses, such as cutting your housing or commuting expenses. A day may come when you’re no longer able to earn your current salary, so you’ll want to be prepared to afford your life at that point. Have a “Plan B” in case you get laid off or experience a health event. Don’t blow off planning for retirement and justify it by thinking you’ll just keep working at the same employer you’re at now. Learn how to squeeze the most from your financial resources, so you can afford to assume a lower-paying job if necessary and to plan for the day when you’re no longer able to work at all. My recent book Retirement Game-Changers: Strategies for a Healthy, Financially Secure, and Fulfilling Long Life contains more details on all the ideas discussed in this post .
To some people, it might seem unfair that many older people will need to continue working after a lifetime of punching the time clock, or, on the other hand, that it might be hard for them to find work. But consider the alternative: The average life expectancy in the U.S. increased by 30 years during the 20th century, an amazing accomplishment when you think about it. Because of that increase, we now have many, many more people today surviving to old age compared to 100 years ago.
If not for this significant achievement, many of us would be dead by now. That means we have a nice problem to solve: how to successfully afford to live a longer life. Somehow, we’ll collectively figure it out, and you will, too. It’s just going to take some planning by all of us to make it work, both collectively and as individuals."
"Just 15-Minutes To Find Cybercrime On YouTube, Medium, Reddit, GitHub and Telegram",www.forbes.com,Zak Doffman,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/04/20/just-15-minutes-to-find-cybercrime-on-youtube-medium-reddit-github-and-telegram/,"The dark web is a difficult place to navigate, it is unstructured and unqualified and counterparty risk goes with the territory. All of which has driven cybercriminals to the surface. ""Fraudsters are now hiding in plain sight across literally hundreds of social media networks and other digital platforms,"" according to Zack Allen, Director of Threat Operations at ZeroFox, a Maryland-based specialist in 'social media and digital protection'. And so I asked Allen what he could find online in just 15 minutes, in open-source research. And because Facebook was exposed last month for hosting dozens of groups of cybercriminals marketing stolen goods and services, I asked him to avoid Facebook, to see what else was out there. ""In just those 15 minutes,"" Allen told me, ""I was able to identify fraud scams across YouTube, Eventbrite, Medium, Reddit, GitHub and Telegram. And there were surprises even to us, around some of the stuff that we found and how quickly on these sites.""
Allen sent me screenshots from each of the sites he'd searched, promising 'high-quality cc/cvv dumps', 'user reviews', 'tutorial videos', 'dumps from USA, Asia, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, U.K., Canada, Australia', 'PayPal gift cards', 'ATM PINs'.
All hiding in plain sight.
ZeroFox The widening opportunity
There's a democratizing element to social media, a breaking down of boundaries, and that has transformed criminality and fraud just as it has everything else. And as ever with the internet, if you're just starting out on something, help is available. On Wednesday, Terbium Labs published a report into the ""t he how-to of digital crime preserved in guides and tutorials... widely available for sale on major dark web markets, alongside the sensitive data and financial details fraudsters need to carry out their schemes."" Once fraudsters have purchased stolen cards, often selected by specific region, network, or issuing bank, they can ""look for the best way to maximize profits without getting flagged by fraud controls... Fraudsters outline which sites ship worldwide, which are more likely to flag cards shipping to locations outside of the cardholder’s country, and tricks to ensure higher success rates.""
""Anyone with a TOR browser can get in there,"" Allen told me, ""but they can’t get to some of the more nefarious sites, the closed chat rooms, where people are selling cards,"" none of that matters, though, because sticking just to social media ""they can find instances of fraud well beyond the Facebook platform.""
Earlier this month, security research by Cisco Talos hit the headlines when it disclosed that "" Facebook is host to dozens of groups that serve as online marketplaces and exchanges for cybercriminals."" Talos compiled a list of 74 groups on Facebook where members advertised ""an array of questionable cyber dirty deeds"", including the sale of cards, credentials and hacking services. The Facebook groups had an extensive reach, with ""approximately 385,000 members,"" and they were not difficult to find, ""a simple search for groups containing keywords such as 'spam,' 'carding,' or 'CVV' will typically return multiple results.""
And if that isn't easy enough, according to Cisco Talos ""once one or more of these groups has been joined, Facebook's own algorithms will often suggest similar groups, making new criminal hangouts even easier to find.""
Not just Facebook
This is clearly not a Facebook issue, as shown by the 15-minute search. ""Financial fraud schemes are not at all unique to Facebook,"" Allen told me. ""They are simply a fact of life in the digital realm, just like they are in the physical one.""
ZeroFox And, according to Terbium Labs, just like the physical world ""fraud activity often follows the ebb and flow of the traditional economy; cybercriminals take advantage of holidays and peak spending periods to disguise their fraudulent purchases. While it might seem unusual for a cardholder to purchase several big-ticket items from an electronics store during the normal course of the year, the same pattern of spending on Black Friday may not trigger a fraud alert as readily. Fraudsters know this and use peak spending days to blend in with legitimate buyers.""
Facebook relies on users to report groups for illegal and illicit activities to curb any abuse."" Last year the company "" deleted almost 120 private discussion groups totaling more than 300,000 members who flagrantly promoted a host of illicit activities on the social media network’s platform,"" after the company was alerted by Brian Krebs. And yet, a few months later, ""Talos discovered a new set of groups, some having names remarkably similar, if not identical, to the groups reported on by Krebs.""
""Finding fraud in 15 minutes is easy,"" Allen told me, but this is not really the focus for ZeroFox. The company works on behalf of customer organizations, scouring the surface and deeper web for breaches and leaks, for reputational damage, and for fraud. ""What is not easy,"" Allen said, ""is for a company to monitor the entire digital world and find any new frauds that are directly relevant to them. It’s not just a simple Google search exercise - even an army of people just can’t keep up.""
Each of the sites referenced has been approached for comments on this story and the cybercrime hosted on their sites, anything received will be updated here.
ZeroFox ZeroFox generated almost 1.5 million fraud alerts for its customers in 2018. ""It’s one thing to be able to Google and find some stuff,"" Allen said, ""it’s a different thing to be able to process a big chunk of the internet and dark sources every day and pick out specifically what a particular company is interested in, whether they’re trying to protect brand or protect their customers or their organization from financial fraud. You’d have to have an army of people searching all day every day for this stuff to come up. You need sophisticated AI tools to do it. You find out these things in near real time and can take them down quickly.""
Industrial scale
The scale of the challenge was evidenced last month when Brian Krebs disclosed that Italian restaurant chain Buca di Beppo had likely breached "" two million credit and debit card numbers belonging to the company’s customers [which] were being sold in the cybercrime underground... Buca’s parent firm announced it had remediated a 10-month breach of its payment systems at dozens of restaurants, including some locations of its other brands such as Earl of Sandwich and Planet Hollywood.""
According to Allen, ""the next step is fixing these issues, working with social platforms or domain registrars to conduct takedowns,"" something they work with their customers to effect day to day. Quite how that level of proactivity can extend to broadscale financial fraud remains to be seen."
Today's Halifax House Price Report: What It Really Means,www.forbes.com,Gary Barker,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garybarker/2019/04/20/todays-halifax-house-price-report-what-it-really-means/,"For many in the property market, this is welcome news. After years of property prices drastically outpacing earnings, prospective homebuyers will be breathing a small sigh of relief. Affordability seems to be on the rise. Mortgages seem to be becoming cheaper.
But it would be wrong to celebrate prematurely.
Yes, Halifax’s report indicates the first signs of a turning tide. But unpicking the story a little more, things are slightly more complicated.
The two trends
First things first, it’s important to understand how this news came to be. In short, this latest report from Halifax is an inevitable result of two diverging trends.
On the one hand, UK wages have been rising much faster than expected – in fact, they’ve risen at the fastest rate since the financial crisis. Real pay growth, taking inflation into consideration, has recently edged up to 1.6% on the year, excluding bonuses.
This probably has something to do with workers’ bargaining power, which has gradually risen on the back of the lowest levels of unemployment in 40 years ; a record 32.7m people were in work in the three months to February, with most of the increase coming in the form of full-time employment.
On the other hand, house price growth is standing at a six-year low. Average house prices have increased by just 0.6% this year to February 2019, and have actually fallen by 3.8% in London.
The is probably related to a mixture of factors: stamp duty, minimal inflation in the pound, and the dreaded B-word are just a few examples.
In any case, combine these two movements, and we have today’s headline.
Examining things further
That might sound straightforward, but there’s a couple of interesting points to make here. The first is that there continues to be significant variations across the country.
For example, while the trend across the country indicates that the gulf between wages and prices is diminishing, London appears to be an exception , with average house prices increasing more than pay (£23,817) over the last five years.
Leafy London borough Richmond-upon-Thames is the biggest offender, with a gap between inflation and wages of £55,482.
This is, frankly, a little unexpected, because house price growth in the capital has been particularly slow – so one would naturally expect the opposite to be true.
London earnings, the Halifax report appears to suggest, aren’t performing as well as they should.
Affordability
The other point to make here is that, while the gap between wage growth and house price growth is apparently closing, affordability will undoubtedly remain a challenge for the foreseeable future.
ONS figures show that on average, full-time workers can expect to pay an estimated 7.8 times their annual workplace-based earnings on purchasing a home in England and Wales. In London, where house prices average at £620,000, this is a particular pain point.
Needless to say, none of this is going to change overnight. Remedying the UK’s chronic supply and demand problem is just about the only way to go about fixing things.
Affordability issues can’t be resolved with gradual wage growth alone.
Make no mistake, Halifax’s report is positive news for everyone in the market. But in the same breath, it’s important to note regional variances and the continued issues surrounding affordability."
Do We Really Need It? On The Excess Of Technology,www.forbes.com,Julian Vigo,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianvigo/2019/04/19/do-we-really-need-it-on-the-excess-of-technology/,"One of the banes of listicle journalism is the outright promotion of goods that we are told that we “must have.” Are you sick of being told about the ten or twenty “ must-have gadgets ” that you just “ can’t live without ”? Thankfully, due to limited time and finances, most of us are doing just fine, breathing and walking about planet earth without a foldable keyboard and miniature speaker . How do we do it? First, it is important to understand that most of the culture surrounding tech—to include writing on tech—has more to do with recommending good technology over less excellent to bad tech. From the birth of listicles , however, tech journalism has become inundated with content that pushes product, acting as a reference point for those of us who spend a significant amount of time researching tech. Where the marketplace, the hallway, the café and the gym were once the social milieu for exchanging ideas on burgeoning technology in the 1990s, today everyone is plugged into their tech devices, isolated within a hermetic bubble of sound reading up on tech news. Learning about new tech word-of-mouth is becoming as difficult as asking for directions when your smartphone battery has died. As most of us have experienced, people will walk right by you, even as you stand in full apologetic finger gesture left with the eery feeling of being invisible as you attempt to ask a stranger for information. Human interactions are becoming rarer today as technology grows and further divides us from real life interactions. Similarly, the culture of tech advice has migrated from the real cultural spaces of interaction to the journalistic sites of recommended purchases and tech news.
So how can consumers know that they will get any better sound quality or longer battery life from Apple’s AirPods than from an off-brand competitor? From over-ear headphones to in-ear devices , there are literally dozens of articles on each published daily leaving us caught between learning about new technology. From these articles, we must read further to then educate ourselves on the contiguous issues of safety, quality, durability, relevance, upgradability and so forth. We are told that social media is transforming the trading world even as social trading sites and algorithmic trading verge towards the destruction of older market analysis culture. New technology manifests a plethora of information which is not just telling us what we “need” but this information is being put forth by a cultural industry firmly established in telling us that we need something in the first place . If not this technology, then four seconds later there will be another technology that we “absolutely must have.”
Whenever I come across these sorts of articles that attempt to convince the reader that we would drop stone-cold dead without a certain tech object, the first thing I think is, “Do we really need it?” This is a simple enough question, but it is an important question which plays into the everyday of most of us—especially those of us with children who are learning about the world. Children learn the stark difference between “hungry” and “starving” and between “I need” and “I want” through parents and it is these lessons which we impart to children the differences between these feelings and desires. These same lessons could be easily translated into technology and consumer review sites—but the opposite is happening whereby the Saturday morning advertisements of brightly-colored cereals and toys for children have now be adapted for an adult audience as we are constantly being told what we “can’t live without” and the “ tech gadgets that will transform your life .”
From social media influencers to social media platforms, we are caught in a non-stop crossfire of recommendations of new-and-improved technology and apps that are mediated by the ever-changing parameters of speed and privacy. Certainly, privacy issues are driving much of the recent wave of software re-design that specifically sets out to protect privacy as app development companies like Retro Cube and Jumbo know too well. In fact, China’s WeChat platform is facing an exodus over privacy issues as other platforms like Apple’s Maps app is being redesigned with privacy as a central focus. Where privacy was once viewed as a technical feature is more and more being addressed as a cultural factor as people are more steadfast in wishing to maintain their privacy for more reasons than simply protecting bank information.
Aside from the ever-constant given of consumerism, what is driving our need to be constant consumers of tech must be discussed within a cultural framework just as much as from a purely technological perspective. As the expansion of software and hardware technology shows no sign of waning, we need to balance how we choose to update our technology against the greater resources of money and time."
Enterprise Bots And Automation Frees Up Employees - Now What?,www.forbes.com,Joe McKendrick,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2019/04/20/enterprise-bots-and-automation-frees-up-employees-now-what/,"The rise of enterprise bots -- ""digital workers"" that can take on employees' repetitive and routine tasks -- promise to help elevate affected employees to higher-level, more creative tasks. All good stuff, but as the bots save an hour here and an hour there, is it possible to track the value of these new hours? How will employees know what direction to take things as they are liberated from low-value tasks? These were among the questions explored in an executive roundtable hosted by Automation Anywhere at its recent New York conference . Enterprise bots are taking on a range of tasks, from organizing workflows to collecting data. However, ""automating a task through robotics is not someone's whole job,"" says Cay Gliebe, SVP of marketing and product management for OneSource Virtual. ""This is a fraction of what they do. It’s a task, not a digital worker. It's not this series of tasks that can take out definite blocks of hours.""
The move to higher-level activities as a result of automation ""doesn't happen by itself,"" agrees Douglas Williams, managing partner with Deloitte Robotics & Intelligent Automation. ""It's very easy to say we created a bunch of hours that were repurposed for a higher-value task,"" he says. ""Well, show me how you actually did that. What did you actually have to do to do that? You have to look at the fractional nature many of the tasks which you're automating. You have to couple it with not just value tracking, you have to couple it with core operational organizational task redesign.""
Gliebe recalls how at at her company, ""we had 80 ideas that floated up. They would save us an hour a month. It would save us an hour every couple of weeks. Another group would have an hour, and then another group would have an hour. The problem is, you can't aggregate that into a business case. It's about whittling away at these fractional things that starts to free the person up to do something else. But the question is, what is this something else that you even want them to do? And did they do that thing? Is this new thing that all of a sudden they are doing that brings a return to the business? You have to get at that to really be doing this the right way.""
The need to rearrange the roles of human versus digital workers points to the importance of human factors in automation decisions. The growth of jobs in automated settings is on an uncertain path, according to Neeti Mehta, SVP of brand strategy and culture for Automation Anywhere. ""We don't even know what jobs are going to exist i n the next five, 10, 15 years. We don’t even know the service industries are going to exist. All are going to change so much. We're going to innovate so much into it. How can you ready yourself for a career when you don’t know what the end is going to be?""
Preparing for a automation-rich career involves ""embracing the tools that are going to help you adjust, get there faster, be going to be ready for it,"" Mehta says. ""And the digital workforce, in my opinion, is one of those things that is an absolute must -- because it's going to get you there faster. It will get you there, no matter direction you go, you will use it. Whether it's in one industry or the other, whether it's in one job profile or the other, it’s a must have for the next wave of career development.""
There is also concern about over-inflated expectations that come with new technology approaches such as digital workers and robotic process automation. ""We find people tend to think it's easier than it is,"" says David Neely, managing director with KPMG. ""Many clients are surprised when they are first started down the journey. 'Hey, I was led to believe that I could build a bot in a day, and I'm just going to throw this switch and I can walk away from it.' There's a big risk of having missed expectations.""
Ultimately, the organizations that will succeed in tomorrow's economy are those that learn to leverage the power of automation in combination with human imagination for one purpose -- serving the customer. ""Can you imagine an organization not using computers today? It's as simple as that,"" Mehta says. ""As an entrepreneur and a businesswomen, what are you bringing to market? What are you bringing to it that your customers love and want? And how can you bring it to them better faster easier, or more cost-effectively? That allows you to innovate, it allows your customers to thrive. As a leader, you have to bring your organization with you to embrace these new technologies, or you will be left behind. It’s as simple as that."""
Can Facebook's 'Watch' Become An Effective Competitor To YouTube?,www.forbes.com,Trefis Team,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/08/15/can-facebooks-watch-become-an-effective-competitor-to-youtube/,"As it consistently pushes video content on its platform, Facebook recently launched a new subsection on its website for viewing video shows called “Watch”. This section will be rolled out on a pilot basis to select users in the U.S., and Facebook is looking to make it a go-to place for viewers to watch videos. While its platform already has a Video tab, Facebook is now looking to structure video content in the form of “shows,” or videos that follow certain themes or storylines. Further, the company will personalize watch lists for each user based on their likes and what their communities and/or friends are watching. Viewers will also be able to see comments, connect with friends and other viewers and become part of Facebook groups dedicated to a particular show. Facebook is looking to create a social experience around watching videos to engage its users better. “Watch” is also a platform for publishers to find an audience and build an engaged user base for their shows. While this new platform appears to be fairly similar to YouTube, which has its own strong user base of 1.3 billion, Facebook’s approach to attract users is a bit different from that of YouTube. Facebook is targeting users with personalized recommendations based on their network’s viewing history, an approach which could help the company convert its existing users into a strong video audience. Personalized Recommendations, Engaged Audience Could Be An Advantage
Facebook is relying on personalized recommendations and a “what friends are watching” feature, to create a watch list for its video users. YouTube, on the other hand, has a strong “search” feature given its large library of videos, and gives recommendations based on past watch history. However, Facebook does have a competitive edge in attracting users, since it already has a large engaged user base of more than 2 billion. Users who go to Facebook for social networking can be directed towards videos through personalized recommendations such as “a video you might like”. On the other hand, since YouTube is a video-only platform, it engages users only if they intend to watch videos. Facebook is looking to move its users towards videos as they browse through their News Feeds, converting its existing users into a video audience.
Video is likely to make up 82% of all internet traffic by 2021 according to a Cisco forecast. This has led to increased ad spend on social video, which is likely to be around $ 4 billion in 2017 , increasing consistently in the coming years. As Facebook’s News Feed platform gets crowded, the company needs to explore alternative ways to retain a greater share of the digital advertising market. A dedicated subsection for videos, which will lure users from its main platform, appears to be lucrative solution. The company already has a publisher program in place to attract content creators towards this platform. However, competition from YouTube will be strong, and Facebook’s ability to create engaging video content and hook its users to “Watch” will be critical in driving advertising revenues.

CIA Offers Proof Huawei Has Been Funded By China's Military And Intelligence,www.forbes.com,Zak Doffman,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/04/20/cia-offers-proof-huawei-has-been-funded-by-chinas-military-and-intelligence/,"In the battle between Washington and Huawei, there has long been the taunt from Shenzhen that U.S. officials have failed to produce any evidence of actual collusion between the telecom equipment giant and the Chinese state. Has that now changed? On Saturday, the Times reported that such evidence exists, it has just not been openly published. According to the newspaper's U.K. source, Huawei ""has received funding from branches of Beijing’s state security apparatus... American intelligence shown to Britain says that Huawei has taken money from the People’s Liberation Army, China’s National Security Commission and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence network.""
Earlier this month, Joy Tan, Huawei's chief global communicator, told me that "" the assumption that the Chinese government can potentially interfere in Huawei’s business operation is completely not true. Huawei is a private company. The Chinese government does not have any ownership or any interference in our business operations.""
The CIA has now apparently refuted this. If true, the equipment maker taking funding from the Chinese military and state security machine would explode every defense offered through this long-running campaign to protest their innocence.
The first substantive allegations?
It has always been clear that Washington expected a different level of collaboration from its closest 'Five Eyes' allies than its broader sets of friends, and the Times claims that ""the U.S. shared the claims with Britain and its other partners in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance — Australia, New Zealand and Canada — earlier this year.""
When I spoke with her, Tan insisted that "" China does not have any law to force any company or business to install a back door. Premier Li Keqiang said that openly several weeks ago, the Chinese government would never do that, make any company spy.""
But, self-evidently, funding from defense and intelligence agencies comes with strings attached. And so this latest news might explain the apparent change of heart by the U.K. The country was strongly expected to opt for a risk mitigation approach, accepting the realities of Huawei in its 5G infrastructure. But the annual report into Huawei's cybersecurity morphed from a risk mitigation strategy to claims that such an approach might not work long-term, surprising everyone, not least Huawei. The U.K.'s Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) Oversight Board said that it ""continued to identify concerning issues in Huawei’s approach to software development bringing significantly increased risk to U.K. operators.""
The implication was that the U.K.'s spy agency, who explained that they "" can only provide limited assurance that all risks to U.K. national security from Huawei’s involvement in the UK’s critical networks can be sufficiently mitigated long-term,"" would likely want the equipment prohibited or seriously limited. The country's networks, as elsewhere, do not. It will add months or years of delays to deployments and incur material overspend.
Last month, the U.S. Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence said in reference to the Huawei situation, ""w e are going to have to figure out a way in a 5G world that we’re able to manage the risks in a diverse network that includes technology that we can’t trust. You have to presume a dirty network.""
The implication was that U.S. intelligence had accepted that risk mitigation is the best they will get, and this looked to be confirmed with official news from Germany's telecoms regulator that the U.S. had accepted security testing as an alternative to a Huawei ban. It now seems that there are multiple layers of security envisaged depending on the country involved, and that will likely influence what intelligence is shared or withheld.
Huawei has always denied any claims of funding from Beijing or working to aid the objectives of China's state intelligence apparatus, and so this could be the most serious allegation yet leveled against the company. In response, a Huawei spokesperson told me by email that the company ""does not comment on unsubstantiated allegations backed up by zero evidence from anonymous sources.""
The U.K. prepares to decide
U.K. lawmakers, including Prime Minister Theresa May, are expected to debate Huawei at the country's National Security Council in the coming days. Senior politicians are split as to how best to proceed. There are senior politicians who want to go as far as an outright ban and others who have dismissed the concerns as rumor and gossip and take the 5G trade and innovation line.
According to the Times source, ""only the most senior U.K. officials are believed to have seen the intelligence, which the CIA awarded a strong but not cast-iron classification of certainty."" But the newspaper also reports a separate U.S. course as saying that there is a view within the U.S. intelligence community that ""the Chinese ministry of state security — its principal security and espionage organization — had approved government funding for Huawei.""
Only limited information will be made available to politicians, and so the timing of this news 'leaking' is helpful to those seeking sanctions. If the U.K. does follow the U.S. request to prohibit Huawei, that will mean a much more robust wall around Five Eyes intelligence sharing. It would also put a Huawei free zone at the heart of Europe, if not the EU, and it would likely set back U.K. 5G deployment plans and trigger additional costs running to billions of pounds.
But if Huawei is genuinely taking funding from the Chinese military, there will be no alternative. The U.K.'s view on the authenticity of the CIA material will become clear when we see the political direction the government elects to take."
Enjoying The Great City Of St. Petersburg-A Russian Gem,www.forbes.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/geraldeskenazi/2018/06/04/enjoying-the-great-city-of-st-petersburg-a-russian-gem/,"Credit: Gerald Eskenazi
Along A Canal In St. Petersburg
On my first day in St. Petersburg, a young man and his girlfriend, perfect strangers, searched their iPhone for an address I wanted, and then walked us there.
What did I know about St. Petersburg? Even though I had traveled the world, I had the sense of a dour, drab, dismal place. My one experience with Russia had been off a cruise ship that docked in the muddy Siberian port of Kamchatka during the spring thaw.
But when I decided to do Russia in style, I did it under the protective umbrella of Abercrombie & Kent, the travel specialists. And I realized I had waited much too long.
Virtually everyone I had ever met who had gone to St. Petersburg arrived by cruise ship or river cruise. Thus, the ubiquitous two nights, three days. But A&K (Abercrombie&kent.com) set us up for five nights, along with a private guide, and a daily driver.
It is alive. Its main street reminded me of my own New York City, people walking quickly, speaking different languages, students in groups laughing. And the buildings—so many landmarks. Credit: Shutterstock
Hermitage Museum at Night
Our A&K guide, Lenna, set the tone for the visit when she picked us up at the airport. “Did you notice some of the security people actually smiled?” she said. “I know what Americans believe. I spent time in the States.""
She dropped us off at our hotel, the Grand Hotel Europe, which A&K describes as “Russia’s finest.” Imagine that a cadre of bellman and security people hover near the front door, greeting people warmly with a “Good afternoon, nice to see you, welcome.” This was not my textbook Russia.
I had Googled Russia and “rubles” back home, and had learned that it was illegal for Russians to do business in dollars. But that first day, when we were on our own and walked to a nearby flea market, the English-speaking vendors asked, “Dollars? Euros? Pounds?” I think they took anything except Monopoly money. So a thought: bring along dollars, especially singles for tips, and lots of 5’s if you take cabs.
To be part of the rhythm of the city, you have to sleep in it. You don’t get this off a cruise ship. So we walked after breakfast—at our hotel, breakfast was more like a Hollywood fantasy: a pianist in a red dress, playing Gershwin and Cole Porter and Rodgers and Hart; a chef flipping omelets; four kinds of hot cereals at the buffet; eight kinds of bread, etc. Credit: Gerald Eskenazi
Dinner Show at Grand Hotel Europe
And we walked the city after dinner. We strolled the canals, took in the remarkable candy shops, even went into a supermarket or two. They’ll take Visa in the big shops and stores, but virtually no one, except at the hotel, takes American Express. And be prepared to pay cash at the smaller restaurants.
Speaking of food, every meal everywhere we ate was tasty—even at the coffee shops adjacent to museums and palaces. There is an 18 percent VAT, so when you leave a tip, you may want to base it on the cost of the meal without that surcharge.
And what about the museums? Yes, we knew about the Hermitage, and the Pushkin and the Peterhof. Still, nothing prepares you for the grandeur of these places.
I didn’t think it was possible, but the city ranks up there with our greatest trips—almost eclipsing India, and African safaris, and a tree house (where Bill Clinton slept) in the Amazon. Who knew?"
Video Marketing In 2018 Continues To Explode As Way To Reach Customers,www.forbes.com,TJ McCue,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/06/22/video-marketing-2018-trends-continues-to-explode-as-the-way-to-reach-customers/,"Marketing via video is the biggest way to reach people today. It is nearly unstoppable. Instagram, the photo sharing app phenom acquired by Facebook for X billion announced IGTV this week to add one hour “long form” video options to its platform. UPDATE: If you are looking to up your game in iPhone video creation and production, check out my 2019 post on Valuable iPhone Video Tips And Tricks You Need To Know .
The Instagram announcement comes as 40,000 people (my rough estimate based on 30,000-plus attended in 2017) converge in Anaheim this week to attend the popular VidCon (acquired by Viacom earlier this year). The annual event is a force of nature all on its own, started in 2010 by two other forces of nature; brothers, Hank Green and John Green, aka the VlogBrothers , creators of Crash Course (popular education site; approaching 8 million subscriber level popular), and book authors. The VidCon event testifies to the power and future of video as the event caters to fans, creators, and industry leaders come together, simply take a look at the sponsor list.
Video Marketing Trends & Statistics 2018
VidCon Screenshot by TJ McCue What does this have to do with Video Marketing for Business?
Everything. Video is the most ubiquitous marketing tool. Hate it. Love it. It doesn’t matter. No matter how many times, you wish that ad would go away before you can watch the brand new music video for God’s Plan (Drake), or how foolish you think video is as a medium. It is not going away anytime soon and it presents a rather enormous opportunity.
Video Marketing Trends 2018 If VidCon isn’t enough evidence, then check out some of these video marketing trends for 2018 and facts that may make your head spin (the last two should help you consider it as a means to connect with customers and prospects):
More than 500 million hours of videos are watched on YouTube each day More video content is uploaded in 30 days than the major US television networks have created in 30 years By 2021, a million minutes (17,000 hours) of video content will cross global IP networks every, single second Did you know that the average user spends 88% more time on a website with video? This fact alone should encourage you to consider adding video to your marketing. Viewers retain 95% of a message when they watch it in a video compared to 10% when reading it in text? It is rather obvious I am saying video in marketing is essential today. Most of us in business or marketing know this, but many are still sitting on the fence, not producing, not creating video. Partially, because it isn't easy to do and comes with a bit of a learning curve. It has a bit of fear factor to it. Many of us do not want to be on-camera. There are other options, of course, and many examples exist of product demos or tutorials where there is no person on-screen, just a voice. VidCon was clearly meant to address some of these challenges with its “Creator” track meant to help people get started with their own video shows and channels.
After writing, Top 10 Video Marketing Trends And Statistics Roundup 2017 , last fall and watching it get shared many times, I knew I had to start studying video again as a means to connect with customers, readers, and viewers. If Forbes would have let me, I would have recorded this post.
In fact, I am starting to test video again as a way to provide content to the maker, small urban manufacturers, small business owners, and marketing executives that I have as customers now. I am doing a series using Animoto (a super easy to use online service that I have used and reviewed elsewhere and to which I have recently been granted a short-term media pass). The service makes it easy to put together a polished, professional-looking video by assembling the parts -- from still photos to short video clips to various effects they have available (including music).
I’ll also use desktop video editing tools like TechSmith’s Camtasia ($249, or $99 if you have an older version to upgrade) and Cyberlink PowerDirector ($79). All of these have free trials. If you will spend just a small amount of time testing the video creation tools available today, you will find video is not nearly as challenging. [ Click Continue to read about how Chobani used video and Instagram successfully ]
Let me close with an example: Not too long ago, Chobani knocked Yoplait off its perch as head monarch of the Kingdom of Yogurt. One could argue that it’s simply because it tastes better—but that is obviously not the case (Yoplait tastes good, too). However, it is because of Chobani’s smart ad campaign, that they’ve pulled ahead.
Chobani cleverly partnered with Tasty to post some quick videos on Instagram on how you could make some tasty treats like smoothie or berry pops out of their yogurt. Tasty, is well renowned for its eye-catching and mouth-watering treats that are posted on Instagram, featuring bright colors, along with the recipes that are demonstrated in less than a minute. The short runtime helps keep my attention from wandering, and, as an added bonus, makes the recipe, no matter how intricate, look like it is easy and that a first-grader could make it. (Hint: They’re not). I tried making one of Tasty’s recipes, a delectable looking s’more cookie, and they turned out nothing more than ugly, gooey (but admittedly Tasty™), blobs. We did eat and enjoy them, nonetheless.
It doesn’t matter how hard or how long it takes to make these things in real life, though. All that matters is that Chobani got a well-known social media foodie channel to create some hip recipes for them, and then shoot them in favorable, attention-grabbing angles, which pushed them past their biggest competitor. While they also did some other advertising stuff (a technical term, to be sure), that was by far the most popular and successful one.
Again, video is not just important, it is an essential part of marketing for our modern age. And, whether you’re advertising yogurt, music, or the next big social media platform, it’s important to have a steady stream (pun intended) of video content. Just ask the Green brothers with VidCon or their super-popular channels, or ask Instagram why they added the new IGTV. You can't live without video in your marketing toolbox."

Trail Blazers Lose Game 3 As Issues From Regular Season Sweep Resurface,www.forbes.com,Mike Tokito,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miketokito/2019/04/20/trail-blazers-lose-game-3-as-issues-from-regular-season-sweep-resurface/,"The Portland Trail Blazers still sounded like a team that feels good about their chances to win their playoff series against the Oklahoma City after losing Game 3 120-108 Friday at Chesapeake Energy Arena. The Blazers, after all, still lead the series 2-1 going into Sunday’s Game 4, and they bounced back from a mediocre first half and a deficit that was as high as 16 to tie the game in the fourth quarter. “We’re going into Game 4 liking where we are,” Blazers point guard Damian Lillard said. “It was a competitive game, it got to the fourth quarter and we had a shot.”
Still, the Thunder recaptured some of the formula that they used to beat the Blazers four times in four games during the regular season.
The Thunder outshot the Blazers on 3-pointers, making 15 of 29 shots behind the arc. The Blazers were by no means terrible, shooting 12 for 31 on 3’s (38.9 percent). During the regular season, Portland was 23-6 when making 12 or more 3-pointers in a game, but Friday’s difference in shooting percentage mirrored that of the four regular season matchups, when Portland made 39 of 137 attempts on 3’s, compared to 43 makes by OKC on 27 fewer attempts, 110.
Jerami Grant, Terrance Ferguson and Russell Westbrook shot a combined 11 for 15 from 3-point range Friday, a huge turnaround from the first two games in the series, when they shot a combined 3 for 25 on 3’s.
“That was the big difference in the game,” Blazers coach Terry Stotts said.
Another issue that resurfaced from the regular season series Friday was fouls. The Blazers just could not defend without fouling, particularly on OKC forward Paul George, who scored 14 of his 22 points at the free-throw line, where he had 17 attempts. George shot just 3 for 16 from the field and 2 for 7 on 3-pointers.
Overall the Thunder shot 39 free throws, making 31, to the Blazers’ 18 makes on 24 attempts. OKC shot 28 and 23 free throws in the first two games.
“They got to the free-throw line too much, the free throw disparity was a big deal all game,” Stotts said.
OKC took advantage of 18 Portland turnovers, turning them into 18 points, right at the Thunder’s average for points off turnovers against the Blazers during the regular season.
The game had a strange flow, with a ragged first half after which the Blazers trailed 49-39. Portland had failed to score at least 40 points in the first half in just one game during the regular season.
The game turned into showcase for Lillard in the third quarter, when he scored 25 points and shot 8 for 11 from the field, 3 for 4 on 3-pointers and 6 for 6 on free throws.
“I knew I needed to be a little more aggressive so it didn’t get away from us early,” Lillard said.
The Blazers tied the game in the fourth, but faltered down the stretch, missing 6 of 7 shots late before Stotts subbed out his starter with 50.8 seconds left.
Lillard finished with 32 points, CJ McCollum added 21 points and Enes Kanter had 19 points for the Blazers, who still have not had a big game from their bench, which had become such a major part of their late drive to grab the No. 3 seed. No bench player has had a double-figure scoring game in the playoffs, and after scoring 20 points Friday, the bench is averaging 23.7 points in the playoffs after averaging 36 in the regular season.
Portland might need a bigger bench lift if OKC continues the strategy of sending multiple defenders at Lillard and McCollum, which worked particularly well in Friday’s first half, when the guards combined for 11 points and 4 for 13 shooting.
“It was clear from the beginning of the game that taking Dame and CJ out of pick-and-rolls was a priority,” Stotts said.
Lillard negated the tactic in the third quarter with a fierce individual effort in which not a single one of his eight field goals was assisted. But he’ll need more help if the Blazers are to get Game 4."
"Mirko Arbore: The Coolest Italian Designer You've Never Heard Of, And Why His Work Is Hot Right Now",www.forbes.com,Guy Martin,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/guymartin/2019/04/20/mirko-arbore-the-coolest-italian-designer-youve-never-heard-of-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-him/,"From Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea Palladio, whose influence on art and architecture cannot be overstated, to Ettore Sottsass (buildings, furniture), Carlo Alessi (appliances and kitchenware), and Vitale Bramani (Vibram soles), it's axiomatic that Italian artists, artisans, designers, inventors and architects have the twin gifts of the eye and the hand. They know form, they know function, and they know innately how to weld the two occasionally warring elements of production into useful, attractive things. Mirko Arbore, scion of the Bari-based Arbore family firm of architeture and design, has been grinding at the cutting edge of Italian interior design in New York, London, Paris, Riyadh, Doha, Marrakesh, and in his native country for years now, and is rocking through that confident, mature phase of a man hitting his commercial and aesthetic stride.
It's In Paris, But Not Necessarily French: An Arbore-designed Parisian hotel particulier. (Photo credit: Arbore)
Arbore & Partners ""It's about the client,"" he says from behind the wheel of his Ferrari, motoring from up to Lake Como after last week's design shows in Milan. ""It only matters that I am able to deliver something that expresses exactly his or her wishes, especially if they can't quite articulate them. Each job is the job of a tailor, custom made. A sarto , a tailor, fits to the body. I fit to the mind. But the work must look as if it just came to be.""
If You Can Make It There, You Can Make It Anywhere: An Arbore-designed apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York. (Photo Credit: Arbore)
Arbore & Partners Equally at home in New York or Paris – until 2007 the firm had offices in New York – Arbore has brought his 40-man team firmly into the 21st century by bringing his particular brand of spectacular, yet sleekly understated style to the Middle East, specifically to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to the Emirates, and to Qatar. A welcome figure in the royal recesses of Riyadh and Doha, itself quite a diplomatic feat, Arbore has designed palaces, retreats, apartments, and guest houses across the Middle East.

Arbore & Partners Along the way, much like his French competitor and colleague Philippe Starck, Arbore has done superyachts, sailboats, and in one extraordinary case, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Look, It's A Whale! Wait! It's A Dreamliner: The privately-owned Boeing 787 designed by Arbore. (Photo credit: Arbore)
Arbore & Partners ""He liked the orca, the killer whale, so, we gave it that sort of look,"" Arbore explains drily, as if waking up one morning to paint a Dreamliner as a whale were the most natural thing that he might do. ""One unusual thing about doing planes, even the big ones, yes, you can have the wood, but in a Dreamliner, it's all veneer. Behind those few millimeters of veneer is paper, because of the weight.""

Arbore & Partners More traditional are his domestic interiors and houses – as pictured here in Marrakesh, Doha, Knightsbridge, New York, and Paris – where Arbore fashions a heady mix of Middle Eastern and European influences, approximately, acres of good marble and fine Italian fabrics that bring an arresting mix of patterns to the surfaces, and the painterly, coquettish deployment of screens.
Superyachts Are Not Exempt From The Arbore Touch: A private Arbore-designed yacht. (Photo Credit: Arbore)
Arbore & Partners One might be in Doha or Marrakesh, but one could as easily be in 11th-century Venice, Byzantium, or in a luxury suite in Elon Musk's futuristic colony of Mars; Arbore's influences hark back to the Great Silk Road trade that came through the Adriatic and, significantly, to the origins of Islam. This level of cultural sophistication in an architectural waltz through history means that, in a cool and coolly curated Arbore interior, the palette may be subtle and restful, but the eye is only rarely coming to rest, being constantly enticed to decode the next pattern. Weaving together the very elements of construction -- stone, steel, wool, cotton, leather -- Arbore rooms are tapestries in themselves.
It's not a mystery, then, that Mirko Arbore has become the best-kept-yet-passed-along secret among his very well-heeled client base in Europe and the Middle East. What is a bit of a mystery is how the secret has been so well kept for so long."
Latest Listeria Is About Deli Meats And Cheeses,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/19/the-latest-listeria-is-about-deli-meats-and-cheeses/?ss=healthcare,"This is not just a bunch of baloney. It also isn't simply cheesy. According to a new warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , there is now a Listeria monocytogenes outbreak linked to deli-sliced meats and cheeses. As the CDC investigation notice from April 17 indicates , so far there have been eight reported cases from four different states (Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania). All eight people were admitted to the hospital. One person from Michigan has died. This outbreak has spanned several years, with six of the cases reported from November 2016 to February 2018 and two reported in early 2019.
The CDC and other health officials have been trying to figure out what the eight ate in common. Here's what they found after interviewing 6 of the people who had gotten ill. Five of them, ""reported eating products sliced at a deli counter, including meats and cheeses,"" according to the CDC notice. It wasn't just one type of product from one deli counter at a single location. Officials have not yet been able to isolate a single common source for all of those affected.
A Listeria infection is not a good thing to get. If someone asks you if your would like some listerosis, just say no. It is not the same thing as Listerine. I have already written for Forbes about how it can make you feel like poop and go poop in a diarrhea-sort of way. Even worse, in some cases, Listeria can invade your brain and the membranes around your brain, causing encephalitis or meningitis. These are also things that you definitely don't want to have, unless you like your life being threatened. Listeria infections can be particularly bad for pregnant women as well, leading to miscarriages, premature deliveries, stillbirths, and infections in the newborn.
Deli-sliced cheese are also a potential culprit behind this Listeria outbreak. (Photo: Getty Images)
Getty The CDC is not saying keep the deli away from your belly. You can still eat deli meats and cheese, assuming that they are not unusually smelly. However, take standard precautions and keep on the lookout for additional warning on the telly (or the radio or the Internet). Make sure that your deli cleans and sanitizes its slicers and all other equipment and areas that may touch the meats and cheeses. It's OK to ask your deli how they keep their slicers and equipment clean. If they push back, then you may want to go to a new deli.
If you are at higher risk for a Listeria infection, you may want to avoid deli meats or other similar cold cuts, regardless of whether there is an active Listeria outbreak. This would be the case if you are pregnant or your immune system is weakened from a medical condition or medications. You also want to be careful if you are a newborn or older than 65 years old. If you are a newborn and older than 65 years old, something may be wrong with you.
If you are at higher risk for a Listeria infection, but must eat deli meats or cheese, heat them first to at least 165°F to kill any possible Listeria . Of course, let the meat cool down a bit before eating it. Shoving steaming hot pastrami into your mouth could go very badly, very quickly."
India And Australia Vote With A Coal Clash Possible After The Twin Elections,www.forbes.com,msn.com,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2019/04/20/india-and-australia-vote-with-a-coal-clash-possible-after-the-twin-elections/,"India and Australia could both have new governments by the end of next month but they will almost certainly continue to share a common problem; how to manage the proposed $10 billion Carmichael coal mining project of India's Adani Group in the Australian State of Queensland. Elections in both countries are underway with campaigning in Australia ahead of a May 18 poll. The seven-stage Indian election ends a day after Australia votes, with counting scheduled for May 23.
The Carmichael mine, while not a campaign issue in India is certainly an issue in Australia where it is seen as a litmus test of the country's environmental policies and commitment to a low-carbon, if not a coal-free, future.
The proposed mining project is also seen as a test of Australia's willingness to embrace Indian investment and while that should not be a political hot potato it has become just that with India's High Commissioner (Ambassador) to Australia weighing into a debate with a request for fair treatment of Adani.

BLOOMBERG NEWS India's High Commissioner Intervenes
Ajay Gondane said in interview with Australia's national business newspaper, the Australian Financial Review (AFR), that the mine should be approved as soon as possible to ensure the strength of the ongoing trade relationship between the two countries.
While not a threat the fact that a senior Indian diplomat has voiced a strong opinion on an Australian domestic political issue is a sign of frustration in India that the Adani project appears to have been blocked by environmentalists and slow-moving government agencies.
Multiple layers of the approval process has seen the Carmichael project forced to win local, State and national government support. It has cleared most hurdles, winning Australian Government backing on April 9, just before the date for the national election was revealed.
The final approval now rests with the Queensland State Government which is yet to approve a management plan for a colony of endangered birds, the black-throated finch.

Getty While the issue with the birds could be genuine there is also concern that it's a convenient, but hard-to-prove problem which could become a long-term mine development block.
Australia's attitude towards coal, the country's second most valuable export after iron ore, has hardened in recent years with one political party, the Greens, campaigning for the abolition of all coal mining by the year 2030.
India, on the other hand, is a major consumer of coal and is keen to obtain supplies for electricity generation from Adani's proposed Carmichael mine.
Treat Carmichael Like Any Other Mine Proposal
Dr Gondane told the AFR that the Carmichael mine should be treated like any other new mine proposal.
""It is surprising to me that one particular mine is up in the media or public discourse because mines are being developed all over,"" he said.
""We would prefer that this particular project is offered bipartisan support because our relationship with the Australian Government is bipartisan. Labor (Australia's left-leaning political party) and the Liberal National Party (right leaning) support India and Australian engagement and both want it to be going to a higher level.""
Dr Gondone's diplomatic language is not echoed by everyone with some observers concerned that an anti-coal stance at some levels of government in Australia is becoming an anti-India position.
A Bellwether For Future Indian Investment
Jim Varghese, chairman of the India Australia Business Council, said in the same AFR report that no company in Australia's history had suffered such an unrelenting campaign to undermine and discredit it as Adani has.
""The Adani coal project is a bellwether project for more investment from India,"" Varghese said.
""If it does not go ahead because of political considerations, there will very likely be implications for trade between the two nations."""
Pilot And Mercury 13 Spaceflight Pioneer Jerrie Cobb Has Died,www.forbes.com,Kiona N. Smith,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2019/04/20/pilot-and-mercury-13-spaceflight-pioneer-jerrie-cobb-has-died/,"Geraldyn ""Jerrie"" Cobb, record-setting pilot and advocate for women in spaceflight, died on March 18, her family reported in an April 18 statement. Cobb was best known as a member of the Mercury 13, a group of female pilots selected to undergo the same battery of physical and psychological examinations as NASA's first batch of (exclusively male) astronaut candidates. Cobb scored in the top 2% of all candidates, including the Mercury 7 astronauts. The program wasn't NASA-sanctioned, but was the project of Randolph Lovelace, the flight surgeon who had led the development of NASA's medical requirements for astronauts (and sponsored in part by Jacqueline Cochran, the first woman to break the sound barrier). Lovelace suggested that women might be physiogically just as well suited, if not even better suited, to the rigors of spaceflight and microgravity compared to men.
Like Cobb, the other 24 women selected for Lovelace's program were all experienced, highly qualified civilian pilots. They called themselves the First Lady Astronaut Trainees, or FLATs, and 13 of them passed the first phase of tests. Three, including Cobb, went on to the second phase of tests, which were mostly psychological; several others had to back out at that point because family and work obligations kept them from travelling for the tests. The program ended suddenly in 1961, the same year Cobb became a consultant to NASA administrator James Webb on the possibility of women in space.

ASSOCIATED PRESS
When she joined the Mercury 13, Cobb had already logged over 7,000 hours and held the 1959 world record for nonstop long-distance flight, the 1959 world light-plane speed record, and the 1960 world altitude record for lightweight aircraft. She had been flying since the age of 12, and had earned her commercial license by the time she turned 18. She spent her early 20s crop dusting, patrolling pipelines, dropping showers of advertising leaflets on small towns to announce circuses, and instructing student pilots -- anything to keep herself in the air. From 1952 to 1955, she ferried military aircraft, from fighters to AT-6 trainers and flying boats to B-17 bombers, to militaries around the world.
But as qualified as she was, Cobb had never flown experimental military jets. At the time, NASA required its astronaut candidates to be military test pilot, and (with notable exceptions during World War II), that requirement may as well have said ""men only."" The U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School didn't accept its first female pilot until 1982.
After the end of the FLATs program, Cobb squared off against Mercury astronaut John Glenn before Congress. In her role as a NASA consultant, she testified the day before Glenn in a 1962 Congressional hearing on whether to accept female astronaut candidates. Cobb lost that particular fight, and Glenn's argument that ""the fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order"" helped set NASA policy on women until 1978.
Earthbound but never grounded, Cobb spent the next 20 years flying alone across the Andes Mountains and the Amazon rainforest, plotting new air routes across the inhospitable terrain and delivering food, medication, and other supplies to remote indigenous communities -- work that earned her a 1981 Nobel Peace Prize nomination. But the dream of space never fully left her mind. Cobb reportedly listened in via radio from a remote landing strip somewhere in the Amazon while Apollo 11 landed on the Moon in 1969.

ASSOCIATED PRESS She lived to see Valentina Tereshkova, Sally Ride, Mae Jemison, and 56 other women fly in space; she also lived to see Christa McAuliffe and Judith Resnik die alongside their crewmates in the 1986 loss of space shuttle Challenger, followed by Laurel Clark and Kalpana Chawla in the 2003 loss of space shuttle Columbia.
""I would give my life to fly in space,"" she told the Associated Press in a 1998 interview. NASA had just announced its plans to send Glenn back into space aboard the Space Shuttle to study the relationship between microgravity and aging, and Cobb (with backing from the National Organization of Women) lobbied for her own chance. She never got it.
Cobb was born on March 5, 1931 in Norman, Oklahoma to Lt. Col. William H. Cobb and Helena Butler Stone Cobb. She was 88 years old."

Science I write about science and nature, stargazing and eclipses. Tweet This Share to twitter Share to linkedin Charles Knife Canyon near Exmouth in Western Australia will see a short total solar eclipse in 2023. Getty Would you travel across the world and into the remote Outback of Australia to glimpse a total solar eclipse that will last for just 62 seconds?
Tens of thousands of eclipse-chasers from across the globe will do just that exactly four years from today on April 20, 2023, to see a rare 'hybrid' solar eclipse that just grazes the coast of Western Australia. Totality during the Great American Total Solar Eclipse from Lake of the Woods, Wyoming on Aug. 21, 2017 (Photo by Kiffer Creveling) Getty
What is a ‘hybrid’ solar eclipse?
""It's a combination of an annular solar eclipse and a total solar eclipse,” says Greg Quicke, a practical astronomer, author of ""Earth Turning Consciousness: An Exercise In Planetary Awareness"" , star of ABC TV's Stargazing Live with Professor Brian Cox, and owner of Astro Tours where he conducts stargazing tours in Broome, Western Australia. ""An annular solar eclipse is when the moon is a little bit too far away to cast a shadow all the way to the Earth, so from Earth we see a ring of sunlight around the moon – an annulus is simply a ring,"" he explains. The moon's central shadow is a cone, and during a total solar eclipse the tip of that cone touches Earth. However, during a hybrid it only touches the Earth for a short period, transitioning from an annular to a total, and back again, at two specific points. However, in 2023 both of those transition points are at sea. ""For all intents and purposes it's going to be a total solar eclipse from Australia,"" says Quicke.
That’s the science. Now for the travel. The moon's shadow just grazes Western Australia on April 20, 2023. An interactive Google Map can be accessed here . Xavier Jubier & Google Earth
Why travel to the 2023 eclipse?
Despite totality being very short, eclipse-chasers are lucky that the moon's umbral shadow just makes land at all. That happens only at Exmouth Peninsular in Western Australia, where at 11:29 a.m. just over a minute of totality will occur while the sun is high in the sky, very likely in clear skies. Exmouth Peninsula is about a 1,270 km drive north of Perth, and a 1,400km drive south from Broome, where Quicke is based. ""I'm pretty happy to travel!"" he says, recalling seeing totality in 2002. ""I can still feel the physical impact of that one,"" he says. ""At the moment of totality it was like my heart opened – there was a physical hugeness in my heart and I had to cry out loud. I was way in a wheat paddock with a small group of friends so it was OK to make a lot of noise, and I did. It was incredible.""

Where to watch the 2023 eclipse
""It's a desolate piece of country and I imagine it's going to be full,"" adds Quicke, though Exmouth's permanent population of 2,000 regularly swells to 10,000 in the tourist season, which kicks-off in April. So there are hotel rooms. However, near to Exmouth is Cape Range National Park, an area of remote coastal areas and golden beaches, with a lot of campsites and to-die-for eclipse-observing positions. ""I'll be camping – I'll just be taking my swag,” says Quicke. “I don't think any park rangers are going to bust people for camping – we'll all camp wherever we can.""

In Exmouth itself, good observing points include Exmouth Visitor Centre, Exmouth Airport (which might suit the fly-in, fly-out eclipse-chaser), Charles Knife Canyon for a higher lookout for watching the moon-shadow approach, and, fittingly, the Learmonth Solar Observatory, which monitors the Sun for solar flare activity (it's also home to a 10-inch telescope). There will also be boats out on the spectacular Ningaloo Reef. A whale shark in the crystal blue water of the Ningaloo Reef. Getty
Whale sharks will be waiting
All of this attention could be unfortunate for whale sharks. Each April-August the world's biggest fish (about 12 meters) ply the coast of Exmouth Peninsula. Since swimming with whale sharks is a bucket-list item, just as a total solar eclipse is, there could be significant pressure on the poor animals. Other activities popular with tourists in the area include scuba diving, snorkeling, glass-bottom boat tours, sea kayaking, incredible fishing (beach, reef or game), and four-wheel drive safaris.

Exotic Aussie alternatives
Exmouth is not quite the only place to watch the eclipse in Australia. Camping on the white sand beaches of the remote Muiron Islands in Ningaloo Marine Park, close to Exmouth, is an option. One for intrepid yacht-owners is the super-remote atoll-like coral reefs of Rowley Shoals Marine Park about 360 km west of Broome on the northwestern Australian coast, which will get 1 minute 10 seconds of totality.

A trip to Timor-Leste?
Australia isn't quite the only place to see the 2023 eclipse. The more intrepid might consider a trip to Timor-Leste, a country with great beaches and untouched coral reefs, but rough roads. About 40 miles north of Darwin, the 2023 eclipse's greatest point of duration occurs just off the coast of Timor-Leste, though the choice pick is the beach resort of Com on the eastern coast, which will receive an unbeatable 1 minute 16 seconds of totality at 13:18 p.m. local time. However, clouds are more likely up here. Sydney Harbour will see totality in 2028. Getty
2023 is just a warm-up
Starting with the 2023 eclipse, Australia will get a stunning five eclipses in 15 years, some shared with New Zealand. The next one is on July 22, 2028, when it crosses Australia from northwest to southeast. ""That's very hard country to get to and the best way to see that one will be in a boat off the Kimberley coast,"" says Quicke. Do that and a stunning 5 minutes 4 seconds of totality will be possible, though as this map shows , the moon's shadow also passes over the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Bungle Bungles of Purnululu National Park, and somewhere called Sydney (population 4.5 million), albeit 'only' for 3 minutes 44 seconds, as well as New Zealand's beautiful Milford Sound and extreme sports capital Queenstown. The UNESCO World Heritage Site Bungle Bungle ranges in the Purnululu National Park, Kimberley, Western Australia. Getty
If that's going to be a massive event, so will be a total solar eclipse in 2030 in South Australia, one in 2037 (when it will cross Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Byron Bay in Australia, and Lake Taupo in New Zealand) and a Boxing Day eclipse in 2038, which crosses … just north of Exmouth Peninsula.
No wonder they call Australia “the lucky country”.

Is China Conducting A Crackdown On Religion?,www.forbes.com,Ewelina U. Ochab,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2019/04/20/is-china-conducting-a-crackdown-on-religion/,"In recent months, the persecution of religious groups in China has been making headlines. The picture that these news stories create is one of China as a state that actively interferes with religion one way or another. This much is clear from the treatment of Muslim Uyghurs, Christians and other religious groups. The discrimination and persecution they have been subjected to have intensified in recent months to the level that it can no longer be ignored by the international community.
Chinese Catholics hold candles at a mass on Holy Saturday during Easter celebrations at the government-sanctioned West Beijing Catholic Church on April 15, 2017, in Beijing, China. China, an officially atheist country, places a number of restrictions on Christians, allowing the legal practice of the faith only at state-approved churches. The policy has driven an increasing number of Christians and Christian converts ""underground"" to congregations in private homes and other venues. (Photo credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)
Getty The Situation Of Muslims
Reports suggest that China is participating in the practice of forced conversion whereby Muslims are forced to “ eat pork and drink alcohol .” In a letter dated April 3, 2018, addressed to the US Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, representatives Marco Rubio and Chris Smith indicate that between 500,000 and a million people are or have been detained in re-education camps in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It alleges that this practice of re-education is the largest mass incarceration of a minority population in the world today. The letter states:
Thousands are being held for months at a time and subjected to political indoctrination sessions. Many have reportedly been detained for praying, wearing “Islamic” clothing, or having foreign connections, such as previous travel abroad or relatives living in another country. Reports have emerged of the deaths of detainees in these centers, including the death of a well-known Muslim religious scholar who may have been held in such a facility, and there are reports that torture and other human rights abuses are occurring in overcrowded centers secured by guard towers, barbed wire, and high walls.”
The Situation Of Christians
Christians have also been subjected to various methods of discrimination and persecution in China. The treatment complained of includes the closures of churches, the ban on the sale of bibles online, the removal of crosses and the arrest of priests and worshipers. Reportedly , there are plans to “contextualize” the Bible to make it more “culturally acceptable” and Christian preaching is to be adapted to include the core values of socialism.
Limiting Religious Freedom For All
This situation will only deteriorate. China recently revised its Religious Affairs Regulations. As a result, the right to freedom of religion or belief has suffered significant restriction. For example, the regulations state that citizens can enjoy freedom of religious belief but that no organization or individual may compel other citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion.
While the provisions appear not to have any practical implication upon the enjoyment of the right, the empirical reality suggests otherwise. The concept of “compelling” others may be abused to include scenarios where religious organizations provide humanitarians assistance, housing or other support and such support is considered to forcing others or compelling others to convert. Indeed, such an argument has been used as a means to persecute in other countries.
Another example of the recent deterioration is the requirement for religious groups to register with the relevant bodies. Similarly, building or using a place of worship must be registered as well. The process may take a very long time. Without such registration, any meeting of an already registered religious organization would be illegal and would trigger legal consequences, including a fine or even arrest. Furthermore, religious organizations cannot be run by foreigners. This prohibition also applies to foreign funding.
What Can Be Done?
The crackdown on religion in China is not invisible. Indeed, the state of religious freedom in China was a prominent topic during the recent Universal Periodic Review in November 2018. Some of the issues identified were that, for example,
Tibetan and Uighur children and children of Falun Gong practitioners seeking to exercise their right to freedom of religion and conscience had been arrested, detained and subjected to ill- treatment and torture and that Tibetan children’s ability and freedom to study and practice their religion was restricted by measures such as those imposed on Tibetan monasteries and nunneries placing them under close control and surveillance.”
In the course of two cycles of the UPR only, China received several recommendations concerning the right to freedom of religion or belief, most of which China accepted. However, the question is whether it matters?
The recommendations have yet to achieve anything. Changes will only be able to deliver on its promises when China establishes a national human rights institution to oversee the implementation of human rights. Furthermore, it cannot be forgotten that the other states and international actors play a part in establishing a dialogue with the Chinese government and advocate on behalf of the persecuted religious groups in China."

WannaCry Hero Marcus Hutchins Pleads Guilty To Creating Banking Malware,www.forbes.com,Davey Winder,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/04/20/wannacry-hero-marcus-hutchins-pleads-guilty-to-creating-banking-malware/,"Marcus Hutchins sits in front of his workstation during an interview in 2017. ASSOCIATED PRESS Marcus Hutchins, perhaps best known by his MalwareTech alias, has pleaded guilty to two criminal charges related to creating and distributing malware. In May 2017, Hutchins was hailed as a hero after playing a pivotal role in stopping the global spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack.
That heroic status was tarnished when, as he travelled home following the Black Hat and Def Con security conferences, Hutchins was arrested by the FBI at the Las Vegas McCarran International Airport. The charge shocked most everyone in the information security industry: that of creating the Kronos malware that stole the passwords of online banking customers. Hutchins was further charged, some ten months later, with creating another piece of malware known as UPAS Kit and working with a co-conspirator to market and sell both of them on the dark market.
Court documents obtained by ZDNet writer Catalin Cimpanu reveal that Hutchins could face ten years in prison having pleaded guilty to two of the ten counts against him: distributing Kronos and conspiracy to create and distribute malware.
In a short public statement posted online at his MalwareTech site, Hutchins says that ""I've pleaded guilty to two charges related to writing malware in the years prior to my career in security. I regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes.""
Hutchins also says that ""Having grown up, I've since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes. I will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks."" This is something that will resonate with many in the security industry, and no doubt polarize opinion as well. The employment of former ""black hat"" hackers to help protect networks and data is seen by some as an obvious positive, the poacher turned gamekeeper experience argument, while others maintain that those guilty of criminal hacking cannot be trusted in a ""white hat"" role.
I am firmly in the former camp as many of us have done things in our younger years that we wouldn't do now, and Hutchins has spent his time while awaiting trial in Los Angeles teaching others how to analyze malware. His actions during the WannaCry attack, when he spotted an unregistered domain in the ransomware code that he then registered himself that became a kill switch, without doubt saved many organizations from being infected. I'm not saying that he should not atone for his crimes, but I am equally certain that his actions as one of the world's most talented security researchers should be balanced against the mistakes he made earlier in life.

Taking A Spin At Russian Roulette,www.forbes.com,Muhammad Cohen,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/muhammadcohen/2019/04/20/taking-a-spin-at-russian-roulette/,"Primorsky in far eastern Russia wants to be the next big thing in Asian gaming. The region has received more than US$20 billion in government investment, from record setting bridges to the stunning Far Eastern Federal University campus that hosts the annual Eastern Economic Summit, a Vladimir Putin star turn that last September featured special guest leaders Shinzo Abe and Xi Jinping. Located 50 kilometers (31 miles) outside Vladivostok, a closed city under Soviet rule due to the Pacific fleet, now a gem of Russian tourism that borders on China with Korea and Japan short flights away, Primorsky Integrated Entertainment Zone has Tigre de Cristal open, and three more casinos in development. The Innovation Group’s Michael Vanaskie suggests the IEZ could become the next casino cluster on the East Asian map. When Tigre de Cristal debuted in 2015, majority owner Summit Ascent was controlled and chaired by Macau casino mogul Lawrence Ho , chairman and CEO of Melco Resorts and Melco International. Ho sold out in late 2017, reportedly to focus on obtaining a casino license in Japan . Hong Kong-listed Summit Ascent’s current largest shareholder Taiwan’s First Steamship is considering selling its shares .
Dominant Macau junket promoter Suncity Group’s Hong Kong-listed arm owns 3.29% of Summit Ascent, with Suncity Executive Director Andrew Lo holding a board seat. Suncity’s point player on overseas investments, Lo characterizes the stake as a play on an “undervalued” stock, while expanding Suncity’s destination menu for its high rolling clientele.
Tigre de Cristal casino hotel blazed Primorsky IEZ's gaming trail in 2015, when it was controlled by Lawrence Ho.
Muhammad Cohen Next up in Primorsky’s Integrated Entertainment Zone, NagaCorp’s US$350 million integrated resort on a scenic inlet. Hong Kong-listed NagaCorp owns NagaWorld, the wildly successful integrated resort in Phnom Penh that’s helped put the Cambodian capital on the regional tourist map, especially with Chinese leisure travelers. Master resort architect Paul Steelman , following his Naga2 extension, designed the Primorsky property. The resort is on track to be completed by the end of this year, according to NagaCorp’s annual report, potentially opening sometime early next year. Primorsky fits NagaCorp’s playbook as a low tax jurisdiction with a diverse customer base and untapped China market potential.
NagaCorp founder, controlling shareholder and CEO Chen Lip Keong outlines in an email the “E’s of success” for Primorsky. Foremost, there’s the “Eastern point of Russia,” within reach of “critical mass feeder markets” Japan, South Korea and China’s Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin provinces, with a combined population of 280 million and each with GDP in excess of US$200 billion. “This source of energy can be inexhaustible if the IEZ implementation is successfully carried out,” Chen says.
Add to that Vladivostok as a “European city in Asia” with historic heritage as well as novelty and a branch of Saint Petersburg’s renowned Mariinsky Theatre; “Environment, a little San Francisco” featuring hills, bays, blue ocean and dramatic bridges; “Ecology” with fresh air and unique wildlife on land, notably tigers, and sea; “Eating paradise” featuring seafood; and “Ease of entry” with relaxed visa requirements for 18 countries, including China.
Shambala is one of two Russian casino operators with resorts under construction in Primorsky IEZ.
Primorksy Krai Development Corporation Two Russian companies also have casino projects rising out the ground. Diamond Fortune announced in February it’s taken a Japanese partner for Imperial , a US$270 million project that aims to opens its first phase by September next year. The company has a second IEZ plot in the zone that it can develop if market conditions warrant.
Last July, casino operator Shambala announced that it was acquiring land for a US$125 million integrated resort , and it’s already started construction. Russia shuttered Shambala’s Azov City casino at the end of last year, closing that zone in a bid to boost gaming in Sochi, 692 kilometers (430 miles) to the south.
“Together with Tigre de Cristal, about 12 complexes are planned, including a hotel, a casino, restaurants, shopping areas and related tourist services,” Primorksy Krai Development Corporation Executive Director Igor Trofimov says. “To date, three sites remain free [in] the gambling zone, which we plan to commission this year and to work more closely on the development of the non-gaming sector and transport and engineering infrastructure.”
Without healthy relationships with the authorities–Chen’s E’s include “Encouragement” from the government to develop Russia’s far east –casinos rarely succeed anywhere."
3 Times Your Business Should Call In The Experts For Audits,www.forbes.com,Serenity Gibbons,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2019/04/20/3-times-your-business-should-call-in-the-experts-for-audits/,"Smart leaders know that they don’t know everything and, furthermore, that not all the information they need is institutional knowledge . That’s why they frequently rely on outside consultants to audit internal processes and develop strategies for meeting future objectives. As experts who specialize in an area that's important to your business — but outside your core business competencies — consultants can be a major boon to your business. For instance, focused assessments of your company’s ethics and compliance practices, conducted by experienced ethics consultants who aren’t influenced by internal politics, can help you strengthen company policies and protocols and avoid future regulatory trouble. Oftentimes, attempting to conduct this type of an evaluation yourself isn’t productive because you’re naturally hampered by internal biases and a disparity of knowledge among employees.
A third-party assessment, in contrast, is an independent review of your business operations, meaning the auditor’s evaluation is unbiased. Your staff may not feel comfortable questioning your policies as thoroughly or vigorously as a third party will.
Regardless of your industry or the size of your business, having a third party independently evaluate critical areas can make you more resilient and reveal opportunities that you might otherwise never see. With that in mind, here are three kinds of audits that are best left to a third party.
1. Cybersecurity vulnerability audits
A heightened emphasis on corporate cybersecurity in the wake of highly public data breaches and hacking attempts is causing many companies to realize that they’re probably vulnerable. A specialized cybersecurity auditing firm can take a holistic look at your network and IT processes and see things that your in-house IT staff or IT partner will likely miss.
Reverse engineering — or simply looking at a program from the outside in — can help reveal your system’s vulnerabilities. As Sergii Bratus, development coordinator of network security at Apriorit, explains , “Reverse engineering is the process of uncovering the principles behind a piece of hardware or software, including its architecture and internal structure. The question that drives reverse engineering is ‘How does it work?’” This technique enables software professionals to detect your system’s vulnerabilities and better understand the process for restoring core algorithms to guard against theft.
2. Financial statement and accounting audits
Having a third party review your books is always a good practice, and depending on the nature of your business, it may be required. Even if you fully trust your in-house finance team or personal accountant, a third-party evaluation team can check their work for errors, which could be costly if left undetected. Moreover, an outside accounting firm can help you spot internal abuses , such as employee embezzlement or fraud.
If you’re applying for a loan or raising capital, you’ll typically be required to provide lenders or investors with audited financial reports, and that auditor will need to be an independent third party. In an era of regulatory uncertainty, independent experts can help you navigate complex guidelines and anticipate changes that will affect your business in the future.
3. Third-party audits of your third-party vendors
A recent breach at Anthem Healthcare exposed the sensitive data of around 80 million people and will cost the organization untold amounts of money. As it turns out, the breach was the result of a vulnerability in the network of one of Anthem’s third-party vendors. Unfortunately, that doesn’t help Anthem much now. An alarming report from the Ponemon Institute found that most companies don’t believe their vendors’ network security policies are efficient, and 73 percent don’t believe a vendor will alert them of a security breach.
You can’t control the actions and risk attitudes of everyone around you, but you can control whom you do business with. Vet the security standards of vendors and partner firms, and work with them to implement collaborative security solutions that mitigate risk for all involved. Before signing up to work with a vendor, draft an agreement that discusses document storage and disposal, the right to audit, data management best practices, staff training on secure records handling, and similar topics. Use a third-party platform like SecurityScorecard to manage your vendor risk assessments, giving each vendor relationship a score.
You can’t create a completely risk-free business environment — that's against the spirit of entrepreneurship, after all — but you can ensure your internal processes (and those of your vendors) are solid. The key is asking the right people for help when you need it and not waiting till it’s too late.
Handled internally, auditing can be a nightmare. Here's what you should leave to others.

"To Become Worth Following, Look Outside Yourself",www.forbes.com,Rodger Dean Duncan,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2019/04/20/to-become-worth-following-look-outside-yourself/,"""If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader."" That Quote: , attributed to John Quincy Adams, captures the essence of good leadership development. Good leaders multiply themselves by sharing authority and mindfully building leadership capacity in others.
That’s the core message of The 100X Leader: How to Become Someone Worth Following by leadership experts Jeremie Kubicek and Steve Cockram.
In the first part of my conversation with Kubicek and Cockram, they highlighted specific “multiplier” behaviors and explained how the metaphor of the greenhouse helps leaders focus on their gardener roles. In this continuation of that conversation, the authors discuss subcultures and circles of influence.
Rodger Dean Duncan: Subculture is often recognized as the key to organizational change. What has been your experience in dealing with subcultures?
Steve Cockram : Leaders define culture; sub-leaders define subcultures.
If a certain leader is liberating those on their team then the atmosphere of that team is one of empowerment and opportunity. Conversely, if there’s a manager who tends to dominate those they lead then they are creating a culture of fear and manipulation. Ultimately those people want to be engaged, but instead will be compliant to do what it takes to keep their jobs and protect themselves and each other.
Duncan: You suggest that people change when they see what it’s like to be on the other side of themselves. How can a leader help someone who’s resisting a change answer the question “What’s in it for me?” for himself?
Jeremie Kubicek : We like to ask the questions, “What are you afraid of losing? What are you trying to hide? What are you trying to prove and to whom?”
Self-preservation usually leads to people’s losing what they are afraid of losing sooner. If someone is responsive and they trust a leader, they will tend to modify their behavior and change. However, if they don’t trust their leader then their self-preservation is like a wall that keeps people from truly being engaged.
""Scaling"" leadership is one of the leader's primary responsibilities.
Wiley Duncan: Let’s say you’re having lunch with a young professional. He’s happily married and the father of two or three young children. He has a good job, but no professional title that implies “leadership.” This young man asks how—in his current situation—he can work to become a 100X leader. What would you tell him?
Cockram : I would start with the concept of Intentional versus Accidental through the 5 Circles of Influence—Self, Family, Team, Organization and Community. I would encourage him to begin to know himself in order to lead himself in each circle.
This is the ""100"" part of the equation. He will need to work on getting himself 100% healthy—emotionally, relationally, etc. This means he must learn to understand his patterns and change his actions to become more intentional in the Self and Family circles. Practice there.
Then he can begin to lead his team. Even if he does not have a title, he can expand his leadership skills with intentionality and become someone that others want to follow, not have to follow. Eventually his boss, co-workers and others will want the kind of leadership skills he has. Then he can begin to multiply and apprentice others in this process.
In the end, a 100X Leader is someone who fights for the highest possible good of others and learns how to bring support and/or challenge consistently, while helping others overcome their issues and get to the next level. Anyone can do that by learning the tools and becoming intentional by making liberation a lifestyle."

Felicity Carter: What was your first fashion memory?
Jane Pendry: A long dress and floppy hat from BIBA in London when I was about 6 or 7 years old. It was a sort of Ikat print in peacock blue and yellow, with bell sleeves and a long tie-neck in a soft printed cotton. That dress was so beautiful and I would wear it today. The very wide-brimmed floppy hat was in colored straw. I had pleaded with my parents to receive something, anything from BIBA as a birthday present and I can still remember the utter joy of opening that box. BIBA was a total dreamland for a fashion-obsessed child – the store was totally art-deco inspired, dark and moody and the coolest thing ever. And the displays were so imaginative – you wanted everything. Barbara Hulaniki created the brand in the ’60s and she was the first person to ever do lifestyle retailing. It was all totally magical and seductive. They produced mini versions of grown-up clothes and my mother had lots of BIBA. I thought I was the bee’s knees!!! I was so happy to be my mother’s mini-me and above all, to be a BIBA girl, which was a thing. Apparently, Anna Wintour’s first job was being a salesgirl at BIBA.

Dovima Paris FC: How did your brand come about?
JP: After a career spent first as a fashion journalist at both WWD and Vogue, and then as a creative director designing accessories for Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy with both John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, and finally at Ralph Lauren, I started to feel that fashion was becoming uniquely about branding and not enough about the women wearing the clothes. Having worked for so long on accessories (must admit to having an enviable shoe closet) I wanted up-to-date, chic, distinctive, compliment-worthy but easy, wearable clothes - those “best friends” in your closet - that make you feel great and confident and that can be dialed up or down depending on what shoes, or jewelry, or bag or belt you put with it. I like my clothes to earn their keep in my closet and hoped that other women would feel as I did. Luckily I seemed to strike a cord, and because I like to think my clothes are fashionable without being gimmicky, my clients, happily keep coming back.
Dovima Paris campaign
Dovima Paris FC: What are the cornerstones of your brand?
JP: Making women look and feel fabulous and enjoy the experience of dressing, whilst also not having to fuss in the clothes. I learned from Monsieur Saint Laurent that style is about forgetting what you are wearing. Dovima Paris is a luxury brand for now in which I endeavor to combine traditional elements of Haute Couture with a very modern appreciation of today’s needs and values. I like pieces that have to been seen and touched and tried on, and that really function as well as being desirable. A small alteration to a skirt or sleeve length, to make it just right for the woman wearing it, can make something totally flattering and really wow. I know I love to receive a compliment about what I am wearing, and so figure that my clients are the same. It is also very important to me to have everything made in France, with manufacturers I trust and who train their workers and provide good, safe working conditions and pay a proper wage. The Couture houses I worked for gave me so much – it just feels right to help the industry here continue.
Dovima Paris campaign
Dovima Paris FC: How would you sum up the aesthetic of your label?
JP: Up-to-date, chic, simple but distinctive clothes with a really good flattering cut, great fabrics, sumptuous colors, lots of careful detailing, wonderful quality, ease of wear, no zippers, and only covered buttons - all the better for the jewelry and other accessories to stand out!
FC: Who is your customer?
JP: Mothers, daughters, grandmothers, sisters, friends...we all need round-the-clock great clothing.
Dovima Paris campaign
Dovima Paris FC: What's the favorite aspect of your job?
JP: Meeting and fitting my customers. It’s so delightful to see someone look fantastic in the clothes that you have designed. I have a personal relationship with my designs AND with my clients, who have helped me immensely towards understanding what they need, about their lives, plus they are super nice and fun and kind and helpful. I have learned so much from them and consider our clients our greatest achievement.
FC: Tell us about what you have coming up...
JP: There is a new capsule coming for The SIL, a website we work with who shares our vision of compliment worthy wearable clothes and we are planning an extension to the brand because the question I get asked more than any other by my customers is “How does this travel?”.

Linh Thai: I saw an opportunity to bring something that Vietnam is very good at to the rest of the world. Vietnam’s tailors are highly skilled and are capable of creating and sewing intricate designs. The gap I saw was custom-tailored fashion for the U.S. market, which is non-existent, and which we take for granted in Asia. I also wanted to leverage the increasing preference for online shopping, especially for busy professionals who do not have time to wander the malls and fitting rooms.
However, when it comes to online shopping, there is one major pain point: fit. Most online retailers experience a return rate of 50%. Ours is 1%. We’ve essentially removed the issue of fit from the equation entirely.
Around 90% of our customers are from outside of Vietnam, mainly in the U.S. and Australia. We also receive orders from other countries around the world as word-of-mouth continues to grow, over 10 by my last count. In business, people often talk about competitive advantage, but we prefer to look at the unfair advantage. What Rita Phil has is access to highly skilled seamstresses, direct access to quality local fabric manufacturers and customer service that is passionate about the company and our product. Our secret sauce is our ability to take the best of what the East and West have to offer and create a product that over-delivers. The Rita Phil team saves all cloth scraps to create teddy bears as part of their CSR initiative. These bears were given to a youth orphanage in Vietnam. Rita Phil
Rita Phil is an ethical, slow fashion business where all staff are paid a living wage. How do you differentiate yourself from your competitors?
Yes, we truly believe in slow fashion. And I think there is a large portion of the market that also wants the quality and attention to detail that comes with a handmade item. But slow fashion doesn’t necessarily mean that the customer has to wait longer. Nordstrom, one of the retailers in the U.S. known for its great customer service, promises delivery of its online goods in 10 days. Rita Phil is able to deliver bespoke slow fashion at the same speed as they do.
How do we differentiate ourselves? First, we create high-quality slow fashion pieces at fast fashion rates. Our team is able to do this by restructuring our production process to eliminate the standard production lines that exist in most factories. We offer better wages for highly experienced seamstresses who are able to create every item from start to finish. The change from a production-line to a production-team model ensures higher quality pieces made more efficiently. The Rita Phil production team works on bespoke skirts at their office in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
Second, we focus on custom pencil skirts because they are the new power look for professional women. Unfortunately for most women, pencil skirts are also very difficult to find the right fit—too loose and you look frumpy, too tight and you look like you’re headed to a bar. And the reason they’re so hard to fit is that they have to follow your figure, while not hugging too tight. Our solution uses a set of formulas that adjusts the curvature—in the hips, butt and thigh—to each individual woman’s measurements. And we use the data from prior customers to continuously update and improve these formulas.
Third, we are hyper-focused on the perfect fit. We believe this comes from a combination of many variables including measurements, body shape, proportions, personal fit preference and fabric selection. Most importantly, we offer one-on-one video chat consultations to enable the customer to truly feel the custom tailoring experience. One of our popular features is the Enhancing Seam, where we strategically change the curvature of the seam to make a woman’s butt seem larger, or smaller, depending on her preference. All of this has enabled us to achieve a 35% repeat purchase rate. The Rita Phil team holds one-to-one consultations with customers.
Let's talk about another 'skirt' that you wear. You are a Shark on Shark Tank Vietnam. What are some of the investment deals you’ve struck?
I think the startup community in Vietnam has really evolved over the past 10 years that I’ve been here. We have more experienced founders, a more robust funding environment and a culture that embraces entrepreneurialism. Vietnam startups are thinking regionally and globally from the start and creating products and services that have broad appeal.
Some of the deals that I’m really excited about: Cocolala: a company that sells coconuts that are easy to open without a knife or other special tool. The global demand for healthy all-natural products continues to grow, and what is more natural than coconut juice straight from the coconut. The investment we agreed on was VND 2 billion for 30%, which would be reduced to 15% after the company achieves certain milestones. Veritas Shoes: a company that produces custom men’s shoes. They have a technology that can scan a person’s foot with their phone and from that scan, they can produce a custom shoe. The investment was VND 4 billion for 36%. Student Life Care: a company that offers orientation and acclimation services for students who study abroad. Their system involves current students helping new students, thereby creating an ecosystem that helps new students adapt and provides current students with a part-time job that can bring in additional funds for their studies. The investment was $300,000 for 33%.
The investments are still in progress, and I expect that all deals should be closed within the next month. These investments will be part of VinGroup Ventures, the fund that I recently joined.
Tell us about your role as CEO of VinGroup Ventures?
VinGroup Ventures is the venture capital arm of VinGroup , which is the largest conglomerate in Vietnam. Our fund size is currently $100 million, and our average investments are between $5 and $10 million. Our mission is to help improve the lives of people in Vietnam.
VinGroup Ventures has a global mandate and we invest in companies that we can help with our ecosystem. Many people think of Vietnam as a place to get low-cost production or software development. Vietnam has 100 million people with strong consumerism habits, high literacy rate, who are curious and open to change. They forget that Vietnam has 100 million people with strong consumerism habits, a high literacy rate and a very young population who are curious and open to change. In addition to funding, we can help our investee companies grow their top line by opening our ecosystem to them and providing options for testing their products or even market entry efforts into Vietnam.
What lessons have you learned as a Shark?
Two words immediately come to mind when I think about my time on Shark Tank: inspiring and optimistic.
It is so inspiring to see the dedication that each team brings to their companies. People from all walks of life put their hearts and souls into their business. For some, being an entrepreneur was out of necessity, in order to make a living for their family. For others, this is a passion project. Whatever their motivation, most of them lack experience and mentorship, and yet they are still able to create growing businesses. That is really inspiring: that if you put your mind to something, you will achieve it.
The Asian region is poised to lead economic growth over the next 30 years, and I am very optimistic that Vietnam will be one of the countries leading this growth. Vietnamese people are optimistic and hardworking, and to me, those are the two critical characteristics needed for success.
What convinces you to invest in startups? Is it the story, the people, the profits or a combination?
It’s an intangible feeling that comes from a combination of all of the above. First and foremost, I have to believe that the entrepreneur really believes in what he or she is doing and that I can trust this person. Trust means that I 1) trust that they have the ability and resilience to continue to put in the effort through all the tough times, and 2) I trust that they are honest.
I also take into account the product and if they’ve found their market fit. If the company has created a product that has customers willing to hand over money, then that is also a good sign. However, there have been situations where I turned down an investment in a company that has strong traction, but where I didn’t feel like I could trust the founder.

French Tech Gives Aix-Marseille A Big Investment Boost,www.forbes.com,Alex Ledsom,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2019/04/20/french-tech-gives-aix-marseille-a-big-investment-boost/,"France is experiencing a surge in startup activity and this week, the south received a big boost for promoting its digital economy when the joint cities of Marseille and Aix-en-Provence became part of the French Tech movement.
Aix-en-Provence/ Marseille is rebuilding itself as a digital hub
Arthur Marshall / Unsplash French Tech is the banner given to support the French digital economy and the startups within it. It’s a national movement supported by President Macron which brings investors, startups, accelerators and promoters under the same logo, helping them to network and find and retain top talent (for example, French Tech is helping startups employ top talent from overseas by streamlining the application process to obtain work visas ). The big news is that Aix-Marseille joined a unique club to became one of just 12 French cities who have received French Tech accreditation on April 3rd, 2019, making it much more of an attractive investment prospect.
France in general is experiencing a huge surge in entrepreneurialism. French Tech are working hard to support the boom,
According to INSEE (Institute of National Statistics), business creation is hitting record highs: French entrepreneurs set up new companies last quarter at the fastest pace since 2010.
It’s a feeling that is being replicated in the south of the country. Aix-Marseille is aiming to become a hub for tech; with an international airport (albeit small), an international seaport, and the largest francophone university in the world (Aix-Marseille university has nearly 8,000 students enrolled in its courses). According to Invest In Provence, in the past 4 years, Marseille has doubled the number of underwater communication cables which connect it to the rest of the world, hoping to reach 18 cables in 2019. This has led to a huge increase in the number of data centres settling in the area (it has the most outside of Paris). Provence Promotion , which encourages inward investment to the region and supports local startups, has doubled the number of startup projects it supports since 2015, which now employ nearly 2,000 people.
French Tech is the umbrella for the entire French digital economy
Randall Bruder / Unsplash It’s a big boost for the image of the local economy which has been working hard to make itself attractive to new investors and startups. The region now has over 800 startups under its wing in the newly renamed Aix-Marseille French Tech Région Sud. Its president, Pascal Lorne, is working specifically to exploit the opportunities under the national ""Tech for Good"" strategy, which explores the ways in which digital technology can improve people’s quality of lives. By teaching inner city youth in Marseille how to code or by creating a regional hub for new African technology, Lorne aims to make the fused cities of Aix-en-Provence and Marseille a national capital for ""Tech for Good"". He states,
We are launching new technologies in the aim of living in a better world. The sun provides Provence with an image as a tourist location. But the sun also provides energy to change the way we innovate and live.
His aim is also to provide local startups with an international stage - recently, 25 local startups presented at CES in Las Vegas (one of the world’s largest consumer technology fairs), including BeeLife a high-tech hive startup based in Aix-en-Provence, which won the award for ‘Best Innovation’ and will begin mass commercialisation in summer 2019.
The coastline of Marseille
Matthieu da Cruz / Unsplash Local startups in Aix-en-Provence and Marseille increasingly have access to a number of organisations in a position to help them grow. Since the end of 2018, there are three new specialised accelerators which have set themselves up in a renovated Art Deco dockside building in the newly revamped port of Marseille - ZEBOX is the new accelerator from CMA CGM the local transport logistics giant (it is the fourth largest maritime transport company in the world), the M accelerator (established with government funding) and Obratori , the cosmetics incubator from French cosmetics giant L’Occitane . These are in addition to Kedge Business School in the centre of Marseille and accelerator, P Factory . All of them are located inside southern Europe's largest regeneration area, Euroméditerranée, which itself has recently launched its own WeSprint accelerator ."
Food Industry IPO Creates Latest China Billionaire Couple,www.forbes.com,Russell Flannery,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2019/04/20/food-industry-ipo-creates-latest-china-billionaire-couple/,"China, home to the world’s second-largest number of billionaires after the United States, added a new billionaire couple from the food industry this week. Another 10% gain, to 25.80 yuan, in the share price on Friday of Sichuan Teway Food Group left the 79% stake held by its chairman Deng Wen and his wife, vice chairman Tang Lu, worth $1.3 billion. Teway is a supplier of condiments for Chinese-style hotpot and other dishes.
Teway raised 560 million yuan, or $83.6 million, in a recent IPO priced at 13.46 per share to support manufacturing and marketing expansion. The company’s shares started trading at the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
Teway’s predecessor company was a collective food factory owned by a district government in the central Chinese city of Chengdu. In 1999, the then 31-year-old Deng paid 140,000 yuan for three company brands. Teway’s revenue and net profit rose by 32.6% and 44.7% last year to 1.4 billion yuan and 270 million yuan. Teway’s products are sold in 58,600 supermarkets and exported to the U.S., Canada and other markets.
China consumes more than 300 billion yuan—or $44.8 billion—of condiments annually, according to industry figures. Benefitting from huge local demand, favoring companies such as Foshan Haitian Flavouring have also enjoyed brisk growth in the country. Haitian’s chairman Pang Kang and four others associated with the company were members of 2018 Forbes China Rich List. (See related story here .)
Teway is headquartered in Chengdu, which ranked No. 6 on the Forbes China Best Cities for Business list in 2018.

"Despite Social Unrest, The Most Visited Country In The World Is Still A Great Investment Opportunity",www.forbes.com,Alex Ledsom,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2019/04/20/despite-social-unrest-the-most-visited-country-in-the-world-is-still-a-great-investment-opportunity/,"Latest figures show that France had another bumper tourist year in 2018 and still retains its title of the number one most visited country in the world, despite the widespread protests which have been taking place for almost six months. With 89 million tourists every year, France is an ideal spot for new tourist ventures - a perfect testing ground for new business ideas before expanding into the rest of Europe.
Mont St Michel is one of its attractions which make France such a sought-after tourist destination
Okamatsu Fujikawa / Unsplash France has what many other European countries would love to have. Although it isn’t the country with the most borders, it’s hexagonal shape shares eight borders with other European countries so it’s easy to get to (and to reach neighbouring markets); in practice, many people pass through France on their way elsewhere. France has an ideal climate for tourists (mild springs and autumns, and hot - but not too hot - summers) as well as a wealth of different geographical features to sell — beaches, mountains, lakes, etc. As Anthony Peregrine, the Telegraph’s Le Rosbif column writes ,
Of the 60 per cent of French people who go away on holiday, some 80 per cent stay within their own country. Could there be a better advert for the place as a vacation destination?
Many of these tourists head to Paris, which receives more visitors than any other city in the world, and an increasing amount from Asia, specifically China. 30 million people come to experience the ‘City of Lights’ each year and 15 million more people travel to EuroDisney , on the outskirts of Paris, Europe’s number one tourist attraction. The culinary traditions of France help its standing, as does its rural charm (80% of France is countryside).
The famous Arc de Triomphe attracts millions of visitors each year to Paris
Willian West / Unsplash France’s tourism didn’t appear to suffer much from the widespread social unrest during the past year; this weekend marks the 23rd weekend of protests against President Macron’s government by protesters wearing yellow high-visibility jackets (required by drivers in French law and called the “gilets jaunes” in French). The riots that happened on Parisian streets, notably on the famous boulevard Champs Elysées, took a small toll on tourist figures – INSEE, the French institute of statistics, reported a 5.3% drop in people staying in Parisian hotels during the month of December, when rioting was at its peak. Outside of Paris, however, there was only a 1% drop. INSEE reported that tourist figures did not seem to have been adversely affected by the strikes earlier in the year when trains and planes were brought to a halt every three days over a two-month period. France has an enviable system of public transport (another reason to invest here, strikes notwithstanding).
None of this seems to have dented the figures, which were still up over the entire year as a whole, fueled by an increase in tourists from Italy, Spain and Germany. INSEE called it it “une très belle saison” . As reported in the English-language French daily newspaper, The Local ,
The number of nights spent by people at French tourist accommodation, including hotels, campsites and youth hostels, rose to 438.2 million in 2018, up 9 million on 2017.
It is unlikely that figures will be dented by the disastrous fire at cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris this week (itself one of the biggest tourist draws in Paris). People have been keeping vigil and singing outside, which is a tourist attraction in its own right and the world will be watching as it rebuilds over the coming years.
Paris is visited by 30 million tourists each year
Pedro Lastra / Unsplash The only blip on the horizon is Brexit. Despite 19th century British writer Douglas William Jerrold statement on British-Franco relations,
The best thing I know between France and England is the sea,
British tourists love France and make up a substantial amount of its tourist revenue, anywhere from 12 million to 17 million visitors depending on whose statistics you believe. As Quote: d in The Local this week, Gerard Pisano , commercial director of the four-star Splendid hotel in Cannes (where many British tourists have flocked to for years) told AFP, that ""Brexit is the big unknown."" Businesses are fearful of the fall out, whether they import British items to sell or because they fear a drop in visitor numbers from across the Channel."
Negative Alpha: How Investors Can Stop Losing Money Unnecessarily,www.forbes.com,Brett Whysel,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettwhysel/2019/04/20/negative-alpha-how-investors-can-stop-losing-money-unnecessarily/,"Alpha is finance-geek speak for an investor’s skill that allows her to outperform an index , like the S&P 500, on a risk adjusted basis. At a recent behavioral finance conference , I sat on a panel that addressed the idea of behavioral alpha. Our moderator asked, “What is it and how do we get more of it?” I offered the observation that, in a sense, all alpha is behavioral. Whether you follow an algorithm (set of automatic rules) to select investments, decision rules, gut feeling or all three. It is a human who is making the trading decisions. (Even an algorithm is programmed by humans, with all their biases and skills.)
We know that most individual investors create negative alpha. Their returns lag indexes. Indeed, a notorious study by Fidelity found that the best performing individual accounts were those that the owner forgot about. Indeed, the average retail investor lags major indexes by several percentage points.
Investor returns in stocks and bonds have lagged indexes.
Data: “Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior, 2016,” DALBAR, Inc. www.dalbar.com Graphic: Author. At the behavioral finance panel, I argued that the now-classic behavioral economic concepts of cognitive biases and noise can help us understand why negative alpha happens and how to reduce it. We discussed how individual investors and professional traders alike have been known to hurt their results by:
Over-trading: we can be overconfident, too frequently adding and subtracting from investments, relying on an inflated sense of our ability to separate signal (information) from noise. We are programmed to see patterns (even where none exist), based on the availability in our memories of superficially similar situations, which may not be relevant. Over-trading hurts returns by causing us to miss opportunities while increasing trading costs. Indeed, these costs often exceed the value of any skill even a professional manager may have. Waiting too long to buy: we may also miss an ideal entry point and buy too late as a consequence of the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). Waiting too long to sell: we focus (“ anchor ”) on the purchase price of an investment and delay selling too long because our loss-aversion is just too intense (on the other hand, we sell our winners too soon). Of course, the purchase price is a sunk cost that ought to be ignored: trading decisions are generally about future performance. Noise refers to irrelevant environmental factors that affect our decisions, making them inconsistent and less accurate. Consider the famous study of the Israeli parole board that freed exactly zero prisoners, just before lunchtime, when the board was probably cranky. Also, we know that the market tends to be up on sunny days .
On the other hand, there’s research that suggests that the right kind of practice, deliberate practice , can improve our performance in many realms of decision-making. Deliberate practice describes a thoughtful and systematic process of acquiring a skill, usually with the help of a coach, who can give you objective, immediate and constructive feedback over a period of many, probably thousands of hours. It’s also important that the context of the decision is regular and predictable so that the learning is actually helpful. While the investment environment may have some regularities , these may be hard to find.
Beginning professional traders may be able to find a coach, and are supported by loads of information and analysis to help them. Individuals: not so much.
The most direct thing individuals can do to reduce their negative alpha, is to trade as little as possible, minimize costs and above all, keep it simple .
Everyone I have coached with their personal finances has not invested at all, as a result of inattention, procrastination, loss aversion and lack of financial education. For example, one client put her son’s college fund in a savings account for the past ten years, forgoing the chance to more than double her savings in a diversified portfolio. She just did not know how to get started and hadn’t made the time to learn. This lost opportunity is arguably a much more important source of negative alpha for most people.
In my experience, the first step is some basic financial education. This should include, at minimum, effective budgeting, investing alternatives and debt management. For people with high-cost debt, which means most Americans , paying this down should be a top priority, even before investing.
There are many apps that purport to help you save. Indeed, I built one of them . But I’ve learned that many, perhaps most people, need a human coach to get them started. Only then could an app be helpful to maintain good habits such as saving regularly and investing deliberately and at low-cost, while giving one’s biases and noise as little scope as possible to hurt our returns.
In sum, behavioral alpha is about building our skills and knowledge about both the financial markets and our own decision-making processes. The first job is to avoid the costly mistakes. Even if we can get lots of deliberate practice, data, analysis and support, it’s clearly very difficult to trade in a way to beat indexes, after fees and expenses. Certainly, addressing cognitive biases and noise is part of that process. We need to acquire basic financial literacy and keep our investing simple, boring and cheap enough to avoid the worst mistakes. For all of us, getting our behavioral alpha from very negative to close to zero, would be an enormous benefit."
"French Government's ""Secure"" WhatsApp Replacement Hacked In Just 90 Minutes",www.forbes.com,msn.com,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/04/20/french-governments-secure-whatsapp-replacement-hacked-in-just-90-minutes/,"The French government has been developing an instant messaging app called Tchap in order to secure government employee conversations. The launch on Wednesday saw Tchap heralded as a ""secure alternative to consumer applications such as WhatsApp or Telegram."" However, less than two hours later things weren't looking quite so secure it has to be said. Led by the Interministerial Directorate of the State Information and Communication System (DINSIC) with input from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Armed Forces, the Tchap project promised end-to-end encryption for messages which are stored on French servers with access strictly restricted to government officials. Yet within just 90 minutes of release, French security researcher Baptiste Robert had blown a great big hole through the supposedly super secure application.
Robert decided to take a look at Tchap but discovered that you needed to have an official French government email address ending in @gouv.fr or @elysee.fr in order to create an account. In a Medium posting under his alias of Elliot Alderson , Robert describes how he then performed a dynamic analysis of the open source code behind Tchap. By modifying the requestToken request required to validate account creation, Robert changed his email to fs0c131y@protonmail.com@presidence@elysee.fr and, in his own words ""Bingo! I received an email from Tchap, I was able to validate my account!"" This enabled the security researcher to log into Tchap as an Elysee employee and access the conversations in various ""rooms"" within the supposedly secure app.
The worrying thing is just how quickly Robert was able to accomplish all of this. He started to analyze the application at 9 a.m. and had created his account and was in by 10:15 a.m. An hour later and Robert had disclosed details of the vulnerability to the developers of the messaging protocol that Tchap is based upon. The developers of this Matrix protocol deployed a fix by 2 p.m. Tchap itself is a ""fork"" of an open source project called Riot which is based upon that Matrix protocol.
I contacted Robert earlier today and asked if he had any comment as to what all of this says about ANSSI oversight of the Tchap development? ""Anyone can make mistakes or miss a vulnerability"" Robert says, adding that as he doesn't ""know in detail what ANSSI did"" that he couldn't really comment further. Robert did have a telephone conversation with French government officials on the day that he disclosed the vulnerability within Tchap, but what was said is not known. However, given that Tchap is intended as being a more secure alternative to WhatsApp and Telegram for use by government employees and officials, the speed at which it was breached has to be of concern. After all, if an independent security researcher with a little spare time and a lot of professional curiosity could uncover such a gaping security hole in just 90 minutes then surely the French National Cybersecurity Agency should have been all over it like a cheap suit? Not least as the rationale behind Tchap is to maintain tighter control over communications security and to move government conversations away from what are perceived to be less secure third-party services such as WhatsApp or Telegram. By moving the government conversations onto internal French servers, the risk of potential foreign nation state surveillance was meant to be lowered.
In a statement published yesterday, the French government said that ""DINSIC listens to the experts"" and the vulnerability was ""corrected in a few hours."" It also confirmed that ""DINSIC will soon launch a bug bounty"" program to help detect any other potential security issues."
Early Impressions Of The Second Beta For 'Warhammer: Chaosbane',www.forbes.com,Kevin Murnane,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/04/20/early-impressions-of-the-second-warhammer-chaosbane-beta/,"The second beta for Warhammer: Chaosbane opened on Thursday and I found an hour to sit down with it Friday morning around 1:30 AM. The next thing I knew it was four o’clock and I had to force myself to shut it down and get some sleep. Chaosbane is more fun than I thought it would be. Chaosbane is an action RPG that developer Eko Software advertises as the first hack and slash game set in the Warhammer universe. It’s more Diablo than Path of Exile on the complexity scale. I prefer Exile ’s more involved character building and multiple interacting systems but there’s no denying the pleasure of playing a well-executed ARPG like Chaosbane .
The slayer and the archer in 'Warhammer: Chaosbane'
Credit: Warhammer: Chaosbane
Chaosbane has four character classes: a tanky soldier, high elf mage, wood elf archer and dwarf slayer. If you’re unfamiliar with the Warhammer universe, slayers are dwarves who feel the need to atone for some unforgivable transgression by seeking a glorious death in battle. Think an insane berserker with a mohawk who fights in his shorts with tattoos for protection and you’re in the right zip code.
I took the archer out for a spin on my first trial run. She’s a ranged combat specialist with a pet who depends on speed and mobility for defense. No surprises there. The surprise was how robust she is. She was never really challenged playing through 12 levels or so even though Chaosbane constantly throws hordes of enemies at you. Part of this is due to her Dryad pet which tanks aggressively and can be respawned almost instantly when it dies. In addition, Chaosbane gifts characters with an unlimited supply of health potions that refresh on a relatively short timer. The archer’s ability to avoid combat until the timer completes makes her virtually unkillable if you’re paying attention.
It may have been the character class I played, but at this stage of the game, combat is too easy. Chaosbane has 10 difficulty levels but only Very Easy, Easy, Normal and Hard are unlocked in the beta and Hard isn’t hard. The archer can stand next to her Dryad in the middle of a scrum, spam her area-of-effect skill, spin around fast-firing arrows blindly and survive almost unscathed. She feels overpowered. Of course, being able to play at higher difficulty levels would solve this problem and making healing potions a resource that must be husbanded carefully would also help.
She's hard to kill.
Credit: Warhammer: Chaosbane With one exception, Chaosbane ’s presentation is very good. The art nicely captures the Warhammer ethos, although I’d like to be able to zoom in from the overhead view to see environments and character models in more detail. The UI is well designed. A minimap in the upper right corner doesn’t intrude on gameplay and is set at the right zoom level for finding your way around dungeons. The game’s first quest hub does a good job of showing you where you need to go while also letting you easily see the places where you can go. The interface for accessing inventory, skills and whatnot takes a bit of getting used to but it's easy to use once you’ve grown accustomed to it. Thus far, I’ve enjoyed the ominous music.
The exception is the voice acting. Most of it is okay and some of it can be annoying. But when it’s bad, it’s really bad. An enemy NPC you capture early on is so atrocious I wanted to kill him to shut him up after he spoke his first sentence.
I haven’t been playing long enough to know if loot distributes well as you level. There’s certainly enough of it and right now everything gets replaced by something better fairly quickly. The low level of difficulty means that there’s no real need to examine new loot for better gear while on a mission.

Credit: Warhammer: Chaosbane The current beta runs until Wednesday April 24 at 4:00 AM EDT and is open to everyone who preorders any version of the game. Chaosbane is scheduled for release on PC, Xbox One and PS4 on June 4. I’m looking forward to playing the full game based on what I’ve seen thus far. Forget that. It’s true, but what I’m really looking forward to is getting back to the beta as soon as I finish this article."
"This Week In WWE Biz: Roman Reigns' Next Feud, The Undertaker's Contract, Ronda Rousey Return, More",www.forbes.com,Blake Oestriecher,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2019/04/20/this-week-in-wwe-biz-ronda-rousey-return-the-undertakers-contract-more/,"Forbes WWE's Plans For The Return Of Ronda Rousey
Even though one report suggests Ronda Rousey could be done with WWE forever , the company is optimistic that she will be back.
According to Fightful.com , ""WWE officials are hopeful that the UFC Hall Of Famer returns to the company either later this year or next year but Rousey has given WWE no clear indication of her next move.""
What's It Mean For WWE?
One of the biggest stories of 2019 will be whether or not Rousey decides to return to WWE.
Rousey hinted just this week that she would be trying to start a family soon (and ESPN may have confirmed that ), but WWE has reportedly penciled in Rousey vs. Becky Lynch for WrestleMania 36 next year. Throw in Rousey's recent injury and a wide variety of other factors, including SmackDown's move to FOX, and it will be interesting to see if Rousey comes back to WWE later this year, in time for WrestleMania 36 or not at all. Her departure actually comes at a very bad time for WWE, too.
With Nia Jax undergoing double knee surgery and a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the futures of Bayley and Sasha Banks, WWE has essentially been forced to push new talents, like Lacey Evans, to make up for her absence. Rest assured that WWE will do everything in its power to ensure that Rousey remains with the company until her contract expires in 2021 , but there are no guarantees one way or the other that she'll be back.
That means WWE must move forward with the pushes of stars like Evans as well as overlooked talents like Naomi and Ember Moon while Rousey is gone.

Big Update On The Undertaker's Contract Status
Credit: WWE.com
Credit: WWE.com What's The Deal?
The Undertaker has apparently inked a new deal with WWE.
After being removed from a scheduled Q&A appearance and being replaced by Mick Foley, the Wrestling Observer's Dave Meltzer (h/t SEScoops ) reports that Taker's removal was due to the stipulations in his new contract with WWE:
The Undertaker is 'gonna fulfill his commitments, but I don’t think he’s gonna do new ones because that’s the new deal he signed with WWE. WWE doesn’t want him doing it anymore.'”
The Undertaker, who thought he'd be done as a wrestler after Super Show-Down, was reportedly given ""an offer he couldn't refuse,"" but it was one that caused WWE to remove him from any non-WWE appearances. Foley explained the reasoning behind the cancellation on Facebook (h/t SEScoops ), adding:
Sometimes things happen, and no one’s at fault. I believe WWE was just doing what they felt was best to keep the mystique and aura surrounding the single greatest character in company history alive and well.
What's It Mean For WWE?
Vince McMahon was reportedly upset when ""The Deadman"" agreed to appear at the AEW-linked Starrcast pro wrestling convention earlier this year, and now, it appears that WWE's head honcho is looking to keep one of his biggest stars from going elsewhere.
WWE apparently had plans to use Taker at its next Saudi Arabia show, and though that may have changed after the date for the show also changed), it's been reported that Taker is wrestling at the Saudi Arabia event even after he missed WrestleMania because he will receive a considerably bigger payday for wrestling at the overseas spectacle than he would for working Mania. Taker's next match will reportedly take place in Saudi Arabia against Elias , but beyond that one-off match, there don't appear to be any long-term plans in place for him to wrestle again.
It seems that WWE isn't worried about booking The Undertaker to wrestle as much as it simply wants to protect the mystique of his character and ensure that he isn't making appearances at non-WWE events. Whether that results in Taker wrestling a few more matches this year remains to be seen, but for now, it wouldn't be wise to bet on him working any show beyond the next Saudi Arabia event, whenever that may be.

Concerning Injury News Regarding Daniel Bryan
Credit: WWE.com
Credit: WWE.com What's The Deal?
Daniel Bryan is injured, and WWE is keeping the extent of his injury under wraps.
According to PWInsider.com (h/t Wrestling Inc ), Bryan suffered an injury at WrestleMania 35 and WWE isn't offering many details about the former WWE Champion's status:
There's no official update on Daniel Bryan's status but word is that he is dealing with an injury coming out of the WrestleMania 35 loss to WWE Champion Kofi Kingston and the nature of his situation is being closely guarded, according to PWInsider. Bryan was not at RAW or SmackDown this week, and reportedly returned home last week after WrestleMania. He was not at SmackDown in Brooklyn last week and it was reported that he was to be examined by doctors, but there's no news on what they found.
What's It Mean For WWE?
Bryan has not been seen on WWE programming since his WrestleMania 35 match against Kofi Kingston, and there is reason to be concerned about his health coming out of the match.
Of course, WWE famously prevented Bryan from wrestling for three years due to his history of concussion issues, and it was just over a year ago that he was miraculously cleared to wrestle again. There is no official word as to whether or not Bryan is suffering from some sort of head injury, but the fact that WWE is being so secretive in regards to his status is not a good sign. Over the past six months, Bryan has been one of the most entertaining acts on WWE programming, and if he's out for an extended period, that would be a huge loss to SmackDown.
If fans are going to take the ""glass half full approach here,"" Bryan's absence should pave the way for other stars to rise up the card on the blue brand, with names like Lars Sullivan and Elias, in particular, standing to benefit from Bryan being gone. However, Bryan, despite now being one of WWE's top heels, has a passionate fan base that is surely wishing him well and cautiously optimistic that they will see him back in the near future.
The hope is that Bryan's injury is nothing serious and that he can get back to entertaining the masses within the next few weeks.

Expected First Feud For Roman Reigns On SmackDown
Credit: WWE.com
Credit: WWE.com What's The Deal?
Roman Reigns may now be on SmackDown, but he's expected to feud with a star he often crossed paths with on Raw.
According to PWInsider.com , ""The main event for the Smackdown show in Hungtinton, VW on 4/29 is Roman Reigns vs. Elias."" Reigns vs. Elias has been added to multiple upcoming live events as well, while Reigns vs. Randy Orton is also advertised for some upcoming shows.
What's It Mean For WWE?
The feud between Reigns and Elias was set up during this week's edition of SmackDown, and though that feud certainly doesn't feel fresh given that the two stars often crossed paths on Raw, it's not a bad way to start off their runs on the blue brand.
Reigns is clearly being positioned as the face of SmackDown, and due to Bryan's injury and Samoa Joe's expected departure, there is a gaping hole at the top of the heel side on Tuesday nights. One of the biggest problems with the booking of Elias on Raw was that he rarely had an actual feud and was mostly used in random segments, but that should change on SmackDown, which does a much better job of creating exciting and engaging storylines than Raw does.
Elias should be elevated by feuding with Reigns and being temporarily positioned as the top villain on SmackDown as the blue brand looks to build up other heels, including Lars Sullivan, on the new-look show. Look for Reigns, WWE's top full-time star, to gradually work his way up to the top of the card and eventually be positioned in the WWE title picture this summer, although a non-title feud with Orton could be quite intriguing as well.

What Else Is New?
Raw suffered a big drop of more than 250,000 viewers from last week's post-WrestleMania episode, averaging 2.665 million viewers for the Superstar Shakeup. That number is not a surprise, but it is also a colossal disappointment for what is typically one of WWE's most highly anticipated episodes of the year. On the flip side, SmackDown had a minimal increase of 20,000 viewers for an average of 2.219 million. Much of the credit for that can probably go to WWE advertising Vince McMahon's announcement of the ""biggest acquisition in SmackDown Live history."" Sami Zayn said that he signed a new, three-year contract with WWE last year prior to injury, which means he will likely be solidified as an upper midcard for the foreseeable future. Indeed, he is in the early stages of a big push on Raw. Sheamus is currently injured with what is believed to be a concussion , and while there is no word on the seriousness of his injury, it looks like WWE is temporarily aligning his tag team partner Cesaro with Rusev and Shinsuke Nakamura during his hiatus. Shinsuke Nakamura, whose WWE contract reportedly expires later this year, will apparently be staying with the company , and though it's unclear if he's signed a new deal, it's imperative that WWE re-signs him and avoids letting him go elsewhere as the competition for talent heats up. Dean Ambrose is still advertised for two more WWE live events as well as Sunday's WWE Network special ""The Shield's Final Chapter,"" even though the expectation is that he will be leaving the company ASAP. These will likely be the last shows he works for the company. Sasha Banks, who reportedly tried to quit WWE last week, has been granted a leave of absence to ""figure things out,"" and at this point, it isn't a certainty that she will ever return to the company. WWE is apparently hopeful that she will be back for next month's Money in the Bank pay-per-view, even though both she and Bayley were apparently upset about splitting up in the Superstar Shakeup. The Miz was moved to Raw in order to better promote Miz and Mrs . No surprise there. John Cena may join the cast of the sequel to Suicide Squad , which would be one of his biggest roles yet and likely would keep him away from WWE for the foreseeable future. Ironically enough, Batista apparently already turned down the same role because he was too busy. After missing this week's TV tapings due to illness, Samoa Joe will be moved to RAW as well. That's a necessary move given that Finn Balor, WWE's other midcard titleholder, is now on SmackDown. Joe is expected to continue his feud with Braun Strowman on the red brand. Bobby Lashley could take a brief hiatus from WWE following SummerSlam in order to fight one last time in MMA. He is still under contract with Bellator, but it remains to be seen if WWE will let him leave to fight elsewhere. WWE is optimistic that Beth Phoenix will work more dates for WWE moving forward , and while it isn't certain if Phoenix will ink a new deal with the company, she'd be a welcome addition to a women's division that is really lacking depth at the moment, particularly on Raw. Luke Harper requested his release from WWE after six years with the company, and while it isn't completely clear if that release has been granted, the former Wyatt Family member would be a hot commodity on the indies if he's let out of his contract, which doesn't expire until November . WWE plans on pushing Seth Rollins as ""The Beast Slayer"" going forward , a possible indication that his feud with Brock Lesnar may continue. WWE's newly signed developmental talents reportedly make between $50,000 and $150,000 per year , with the average salary coming in at around $80,000. Although that number is likely much lower than what main roster superstars make, there are also significantly fewer travel expenses for NXT stars.

Welcome to the Wonderful Land of OZ,www.forbes.com,Brad Thomas,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradthomas/2019/04/20/welcome-to-the-wonderful-land-of-oz/,"If I was redesigning a new Monopoly game, I would include a set of spaces called Opportunity Zones. This new type of property could be extremely valuable, even more so than Boardwalk and Park Place. Who knows. Perhaps there will be a version someday that includes that feature. It’s not that ridiculous an idea considering how Congress created its own Opportunity Zone Funds category in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Abbreviated to OZs, they’re meant to encourage long-term investments in low-income urban and rural communities nationwide.
These opportunities provide a tax incentive for investors to reinvest their unrealized capital gains. Which means they’re worth paying attention to.
At first, admittedly, the laws surrounding them were ambiguous and confusing. While the notion of investing in distressed communities in return for substantial tax breaks seemed attractive, the original blueprint lacked clarity. So most people saw the big picture as more of a high-roller’s crapshoot.
But that might be changing now.
A few weeks ago, I was a keynote speaker in Dallas, where the resounding theme was that OZs will spark the U.S. economy and provide a catalyst for job creation. According to Jack Sullivan with Emergent Development Group and the developing Airacobra OZ Fund, they’re “the greatest tax benefit offered by our government in my career.""
He added that, “ The time to invest in OZ Funds is now. "" That’s because the law's benefits clearly diminish over time. Due to a forced recognition in the 2026 tax year, there’s an initial investment window between now and the end of 2019.
Earlier this week, the government released a second set of guidance that will help form consensus on the optimal investment types and structures within the law. President Trump, for one, said that the tax had been lowered ""all the way down to a very big, fat, beautiful… zero."" And Tyler Smith of the Parker Poe law firm told me that:
As lawyers, accountants, and others hasten to digest and implement the some-150 pages of new guidance, the emerging theme is that… federal regulators seem to truly want the OZ program to work.
So here’s what you need to know.
What Makes OZ Funds Tick
Because real estate investments have fixed upsides with developed values that generate ""ordinary income,"" real estate is not optimally tax-advantaged under the OZ law.
However, an early-stage venture equity investment sees nearly all of its value generation at disposition – a 100% capital gain – which has a much greater upside potential than a typical real estate deal.
Since the OZ law is, foundationally speaking, a ""place-based"" program, real estate will be a part of any optimized OZ Fund. Yet, according to Sullivan, “a portfolio that includes pairing the early stage VC and real estate models to create a handful of location-specific campuses which enable emergent ecosystems to foster long-term growth, community benefit, and economic returns seems to embody the ideal OZ law model.”
There are approximately 8,700 opportunity zone neighborhoods across the country. They qualify based on census data and a nomination from a state’s governor that proves there’s a need for economic investment in a low-income area. The pipeline for OZ opportunities is massive.
According to Stefan Schimenes, CEO of InvestReal :
My team is speaking with developers across the country every day. From traditional projects such as multi-family and office buildings, to the more unique offering of a pistachio farm, we are seeing a variety of OZ options available to suit the different needs of investors.
InvestReal is a data-driven real estate marketplace that connects investors with developers looking to raise capital for OZ projects. The company was launched in response to the overwhelming need to simplify the process of bringing these two parties together.
Stay Tuned
Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson spearheaded the initiative, together with President Trump. This opportunistic tax incentive allows investors to pay less in capital gains taxes for seven years (starting this year) if they make a long-term investment in qualified neighborhoods and then hold it for 10 years.
The hope is that businesses will develop and stay in these neighborhoods, providing employment opportunities and services as they do. So far, there’s definitely promise since, according to Carson, businesses have already invested over $25 billion into opportunity zones.
These funds’ incredible tax benefits have incentivized a flurry of new real estate investors. Keep in mind, however, that the majority of them don’t have pre-existing relationships with developers; and the ones that do have relationships might not find OZ projects within their network.
This brings us back to InvestReal.
In addition to providing a worthwhile marketplace, InvestReal’s platform also has a data component that utilizes proprietary algorithms and predictive analytics to offer users insightful trends about any metro area, zip code, or OZ in the country. Investors can research locations with a robust menu of metrics and indicators at their fingertips, and rank OZs based on their investment strategy; while developers can use the analytics as third-party validation for their offerings.
InvestReal has a lot of shovel-ready projects that can qualify as OZ investments already, and now that the new set of regs are out, investors that have capital gains already have a place to find projects.
In my REIT domain, I anticipate that a number of crowd-funding products are going to be launched, providing individual investors with expanded means to generate diversification and wealth creation.
More specifically, over the next few years, public REITs could become excellent buyers for opportunity zones as I expect these ventures to scale considerably, possibly reaching $1 trillion in market capitalization over the next 10 years.
Now that’s an opportunity worth talking about.
I am the author of The Trump Factor and I also serve on the campaign advisory board for President Donald J. Trump."
Dewar's Double Double Series: Is The Ultimate In Smoothness,www.forbes.com,Joseph V Micallef,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2019/04/20/dewars-double-double-series-unveils-its-4-stage-ageing-process/,"John Dewar & Sons Ltd was founded in 1846. Originally, like many of his early competitors, John Dewar operated a small wine and spirits shop that specialized in blending its own proprietary whisky blend. When he died in 1880, the firm was taken over by his sons, John and Thomas, who transformed it into a global brand. In 1886, John Dewar’s whisky won its first medal for blended whisky at the Edinburgh Exhibition. The first of what would be more than 500 medals to follow. Five years later Dewar, inadvertently, pulled off the marketing coup of the century. Andrew Carnegie, the American steel magnate, had a small keg of Dewar’s whisky sent to President Benjamin Harrison in order to chide him for not supporting homegrown American products like bourbon. The resulting publicity led to a quintupling of American sales of his blended whisky.
With a solid foothold in the British market, and his American sales booming, in 1892 Thomas Dewar embarked on his “ramble round the globe.” His one man, two-year sales mission visited 26 countries, resulting in the appointment of 32 agents and a worldwide export network. His success earned him a Royal Warrant from Queen Victoria. The company has received warrants from every British monarch since.
Thomas Dewar was an iconic character, famous as an inveterate storyteller, and for his pithy epithets. His all-time favorite was the oft Quote: d remark that, “There are lots of people out there trying to find new ways to make mistakes.” One of his favorite stories described how during his travels through “dry” counties in the southern US he once asked about the availability of whisky. He was advised none was available but that he could try the local anti-cholera medicine.
The medicine turned out to be a bottle of Dewar’s, still with the original label on one side, and a new label advertising it as anti-cholera medicine on the opposite side. Dewar was fond of reporting that he took his anti-cholera medicine as instructed three times a day and not once did he come down with cholera while traveling through the US.
In 1899, Dewar unveiled White Label, still the company’s flagship whisky more than a century later. To guarantee a supply of malt it also acquired Aberfeldy, Aultmore, Macduff (since closed), Craigellachie and Royal Brackla. The distilleries eventually became part of the Distillers Co. The group, after many mergers and acquisitions, would eventually morph into spirits giant Diageo.
In 1998, Dewar’s and its associated distilleries were sold to Bacardi. Dewar’s White Label was the best-selling blended whisky in the US, with sales of over a million nine-liter cases in 2017, and ranks eighth overall worldwide with sales of 2.7 million cases.
One of the company’s early innovations was the practice of marrying whiskies, by region of origin, for six months or more before blending them into the final expression and aging it for another six months or so. The process, developed by A J Cameron, Dewar’s first master blender, was described as “double aging,” and was credited by the company with making its whisky particularly smooth and giving it a consistent “it never varies” character.
The company has now announced a new four-stage aging process, termed a “double double.” It was developed by its current master blender, Stephanie Macleod and is designed to further enhance the brand’s legendary smoothness. The four-step process begins with the conventional aging of malt and grain whiskies in separate oak casks. The grain whiskies are then blended together and allowed to marry while they are being aged for a second time in neutral (or exhausted) oak casks. The malt whiskies undergo an identical process.
In the third step, the grain and malt whiskies are mixed together into the final blend and then aged again for a third time in neutral oak casks. They typical aging during the second and third steps is usually for six months, although the final decision is left to the discretion of the master blender. Following the third stage, the blended whisky undergoes a fourth and final finishing in sherry casks for up to a year. The process creates an exceptionally smooth and complex whisky.
Dewar's Whisky Maturing at the Aberfeldy Distillery
Recently Dewar’s announced the release of the first three whiskies in its new Double Double series. The range features a 21 YO, 27 YO and a 32 YO blended whisky, which has been finished in a variety of sherry casks. The whisky is non-chill filtered and no artificial coloring has been used. The series is only available, for now, at travel retail outlets and are packaged in 500 ml bottles.
Dewar’s Double Double Series, 21 YO, 46% ABV, 500 ml, $90
The 21 YO is finished in a cask that previously held Oloroso sherry. The color is a rich golden amber. On the nose, there are notes of honey, along with some ripe apple and hints of golden raisin, stone and tropical fruit, along with a little bit of licorice and marzipan. There are spice notes of cinnamon, pepper and a little nutmeg.
On the palate, the whisky is smooth and rich, with a pronounced palate weight and viscosity. There are sweet honey and caramel notes, along with hints of peach and apricot, as well as a little sweet marzipan, followed by a little cinnamon and a pronounced pepperiness that steadily builds. The finish is medium length, smooth with sweet caramel notes, and a pronounced pepperiness.
Dewar’s Double Double Series, 27 YO, 46% ABV, 500 ml, $160
The 27 YO is finished in a Palo Cortado sherry cask. Palo Cortado is an unusual form of sherry that undergoes an initial aging under flor, like a fino or amontillado, but inexplicably loses its veil of flor and starts to age oxidatively like an Oloroso. The result is a sherry that can have the weight and richness of Oloroso, but still retains the crispness and dryness of a fino or an amontillado. The color is a bright gold. On the nose, there are aromas of mint, golden raisin and ripe peach, as well as some cinnamon and slight vanilla notes. There are also aromas of new saddle leather, along with very slight hints of smoke.
On the palate, the whisky is smooth with a pronounced viscosity and palate weight. There are sweet honey notes, along with crème caramel and some caramel, a bit of lemon zest, and a hint of ripe peach and tropical fruit. There are also vanilla and cinnamon notes, along with slight hints of smoke. As the whisky opens up a pronounced cooked oatmeal note also emerges.
The finish is medium length, featuring sweet stone and tropical fruit and a persistent licorice note, along with some cinnamon and peppery elements.
Dewar’s Double Double Series, 32 YO, 46% ABV 500 ml, $250
The 32 YO is finished in Pedro Ximenez casks. Pedro Ximenez is a very sweet, syrupy sherry that is made by raisinating the grapes before they are vinified. The color is a dark gold. On the nose, there is a pronounced waxy aroma, along with notes of baked apple, stone fruit, fig and golden raisin. There are notes of saddle leather, along with vanilla, cinnamon and clove notes, as well as a bit of mint and smoke. There is also a cooked cereal note that gradually emerges as the whisky opens up.
On the palate, there are dried figs and sweet golden raisins, along with notes of caramel, stone fruit and licorice. There are additional notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and a little clove, along with some pepper. Like its siblings, this is a thick, viscous whisky with a smooth texture and a pronounced palate weight. The finish is medium length, featuring notes of caramel, tropical spices and pepper and a hint of licorice.
These are excellent sipping whiskies. They are exceptionally creamy and smooth with a nuanced palate that features pronounced fruitiness and tropical spice. The different sherry cask finishes add an element of complexity and helps to differentiate the whiskies from each other, although their common DNA is unmistakable.
Looking for a cheaper alternative that still reflects many of the same characteristics of Dewar’s Double Double series? Consider the Dewar’s White Label core range. It consists of White Label and the Dewar’s 12, 15, 18 and 25 YO expressions. All of these expressions are a blend of malt and grain whiskies that have been matured in either ex-bourbon or sherry casks.
The Dewer's Core Range of Blended Whiskies
Dewar’s White Label, NAs, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $20
This is the original expression that is the foundation of Dewar’s whisky empire. The expression has undoubtedly changed since it was first formulated in 1899. It is blended from 40 different single malts and grain whiskies. The color is a pale yellow. On the nose, the whisky is honey sweet with floral notes, along with elements of apple and cooked cereal. The whisky is spirity, with a bit of alcohol harshness on the nose.
On the palate, there are sweet honey notes, cooked cereal and notes of apple and a bit of pear, as well as peach and lemon zest. Aberfeldy is the core malt in the Dewar range, both the core range and the new Double Double series, and gives both series a common denominator of aroma and flavor.
The finish is very short. This is a young spirit, although there is enough creaminess on the palate and enough sweet fruit notes to be interesting. This is a whisky that works equally well on the rocks and in cocktails.
Dewar’s The Ancestor, 12 YO, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $29
This is a similar blend to the White Label, but with a bit more age. The color is a light gold. On the nose, it has a creamy character. There are notes of lemon zest, along with notes of stone fruit. There is an herbaceous note—a bit of licorice and cut grass. There is also some vanilla and some cinnamon spice. There is still a bit of noticeable spirity alcohol on the nose, although less than in White Label.
On the palate, there is stone fruit, principally peach, along with notes of salted caramel and citrus zest, and also some lingering cooked cereal notes as the whisky opens up. The finish is still short, featuring some peach, cooked cereal and pastry notes and a hint of bitterness. There is still a bit of alcohol burn. This whisky is better on the rocks or in a cocktail as the addition of a little water makes it sweeter and rounder and emphasizes its creamy character.
Dewar’s The Monarch, 15 YO, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $42
This is a slightly older version than the 12 YO, and also consists of a blend of 40 different grain and malt whiskies. Historically, the 15 YO had an element of 27 YO Aberfeldy at its core, although it is not clear if that is still the case. The color is a bright, polished copper. On the nose, it offers floral aromas, along with notes of sweet honey, cooked cereal, stone fruit and some oak and a hint of smoke. There is just a hint of alcohol burn, otherwise the alcohol is well integrated.
On the palate, it is smooth and creamy. There are the characteristic notes of peach, sweet honey and cooked cereal that are typical of Dewar’s, along with some vanilla and cinnamon. The finish is a little longer, with peach and vanilla notes and some pepperiness that builds toward the end. Another versatile whisky that is excellent both on the rocks and in a cocktail.
Dewar’s The Vintage, 18 YO, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $66
The color is a bright gold. On the nose, there is the characteristic creaminess of Dewar’s, along with notes of peach, orange zest and a bit of cherry. There are herbaceous notes, but these are drier, more dry heather and hay than cut grass, than in the younger expressions, along with the characteristic sweet honey notes of Dewar’s and some vanilla and cinnamon.
On the palate, there are sweet honey and salted caramel notes, along with candied orange zest, mint, peach and some cooked cereal. The whisky is smooth, creamy, almost buttery, with a more noticeable palate weight than the other expressions. There are tropical spice notes of cinnamon and all-spice, along with some ginger pepperiness. The finish is long, creamy smooth, with a touch of sweetness, tropical spices and a hint of oak and smoke. This is an excellent sipping whisky and very versatile. Although if you prefer your whisky on the rocks, the 12 YO and 15 YO will probably do as well and are considerably cheaper.
Dewar’s The Signature, 25 YO, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $239
This is the top expression in the Dewar’s core range. It is also the most recent addition. It replaced the NAS Signature and utilizes some of the oldest whiskies available at Dewar’s. The final marrying of the blended whiskies takes place in casks that were previously used to mature Royal Brackla. Although Aberfeldy is considered the core malt in the Dewar’s range, Royal Brackla has also historically played a prominent role. The color is a deep yellow gold.
On the nose, it has the characteristic Dewar’s profile of sweet honey and caramel, along with notes of baked apple, stone fruit and some tropical fruit. The sherry cask influence is more evident here, likely the result of using first fill casks, than in the previous expressions. There are additional, layered notes of raisin, fig and prune—what are typically referred to as fruitcake or Christmas pudding notes. There is also that distinctive saddle leather element, which is often found in ultra-aged whiskies, along with vanilla and cinnamon notes.
On the palate, the whisky is smooth and creamy. There are sweet honey notes, along with some salted caramel and baked apple and pear. There are additional notes of peach, as well as some dried tropical fruit notes of mango and pineapple and a bit of fresh melon. There are also some milk chocolate notes, along with vanilla and cinnamon, also some clove and allspice. Additionally, there are some licorice elements and a bit of ginger. A pronounced cooked cereal flavor emerges as the whisky opens up.
The finish is long, smooth and creamy. It is dry, notwithstanding the sweet note on the palate, and is marked by fruitiness that gives way to a long lingering finish of wood spice and a bit of oak and smoke.
This is a superb whisky. It offers nuanced complexity wrapped up in a smooth, creamy character with a lingering finish. Like its 18 YO sibling, it is excellent as a sipping whisky, but on the rocks or in a cocktail, the younger, cheaper expressions will probably do just as well.

'Mortal Kombat 11' Release Date And 5 Things You Should Know Before You Buy The Game,www.forbes.com,Brian Mazique,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/04/20/mortal-kombat-11-release-date-and-5-things-you-should-know-before-you-buy-the-game/,"It's almost time. Mortal Kombat 11 is set to hit retailers on Tuesday, April 23 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC and Nintendo Switch. The pre-release hype has been almost entirely positive, and my own experience with the beta has me eagerly awaiting the retail version.
That said, there are a couple of points of concern mixed in with the final pertinent details ahead of the release. Here are the five things you should know before you buy the game.
Pre-Order Details
There are three versions of MK11 available for the PS4 and Xbox One. Pre-ordering the standard or premium edition gets you access to Shao Kahn, and it also gave fans a way to play the beta. The premium edition also includes the Kombat Pack. This is likely to include early access to DLC characters as well.
Lastly, the Kombat Edition comes with the game, the steel box, a Scorpion mask, and some special packaging. It is a Gamestop exclusive and retails for $299. As collector's editions go, this one isn't too bad. The Scorpion Mask is a heck of a collector item.
That said, it's still a little troubling that these publishers offer collector's editions without the season pass options.

I watched Game Informer's interview with Senior Systems Designer Derek Kirtzic, and there was a number of interesting tidbits that came from the conversation. You can see the full interview here:
One of the things Kirtzic mentioned was NetheRealm's commitment to supporting MK11 post-launch for longer than any other title in the studio's history. There are a few takeaways from that note. There is a serious commitment to MK11 having a noteworthy eSports presence. The Pro Kombat League is already under construction and set to commence shortly after launch on May 24 in Chicago:
Two, we could see a healthy amount of DLC for the game, and lastly, it might be a long while before we see the next version. Frankly, I'm fine with all three of those possibilities. If MK11 is as complete of an experience as it appears, there won't be a problem.
There Doesn't Appear to Be a Hulking-Style Character
One issue that was brought to my attention as I discussed the game during an episode of my podcast, @MeBro, was the lack of a hulking-style character. Originally, I thought Geras would fill that role, but in further examining his fighting style, I don't think that's the case.
If you're unfamiliar with what I'm referring to, I'll share the example given by my co-host and Marvel Comics artist Nelson Blake II. He said, ""imagine Street Fighter without Zangief or Injustice without Bane, and that's what it appears we're getting with MK11 at launch.""
Something tells me there is a character coming as DLC that fits that style. The developers at NetheRealm are too smart for this not to have been planned.
There Will Be Easter Eggs in The Krypt
According to Kirtzic, there will be a number of homages to older MK games in the Krypt, but there will not be any unlockable characters in that aspect of the game. That might be a little disappointing to some fans.
Nintendo Switch Version is a Port Out
While MK11 will be released for the Switch, I have some concerns about how it will match up to the PS4 and Xbox One version. Kirtzic mentioned during the interview that the Switch version is a port and that it wasn't handled in the Chicago studios. That's something to consider if that is the version you were planning on buying.
Stay tuned for a full review of the game at or near the official launch."
Kenyan Tycoon Jimnah Mbaru Offloads 50 Million Britam Shares Worth $4.4 Million,www.forbes.com,Mfonobong Nsehe,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2019/04/20/kenyan-tycoon-jimnah-mbaru-sells-50-million-britam-shares-worth-4-4-million/,"Woman counting Kenyan shillings Getty Kenyan businessman Jimnah Mbaru has sold off 50 million shares he owns in Britam Holding, one of Kenya’s largest insurers, to Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (Swiss Re).
According to a recent filing by Britam, Mbaru sold the shares in a private transaction to the Swiss insurer. The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, but the shares are worth at least $4.4 million going by the current share price of 8.8 cents at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). It is a deal that consolidates the Swiss insurer’s position as one of the largest shareholders in the Kenyan insurer with a 15.79% stake. Last June, Swiss Re acquired a 13.81% stake in the company from local businessman Peter Munga for a reported $48 million.
Over the last year, Britam’s founding shareholders have ceded control of the company to institutional shareholders. Swiss Re, International Finance Corporation (IFC) and private equity firm Africinvest now hold a combined 40.79% stake in Britam compared to the 39.2% equity held by the Kenyan founding shareholders who include business tycoons Jimnah Mbaru, Peter Munga, Benson Wairegi and James Mwangi. While Swiss Re now owns 15.72% of Britam, Africinvest and IFC own 16.2% and 8.8% respectively.
One Jimnah Mbaru, 71, is regarded as the doyen of Investment Banking in Kenya and is chairman of Dyer & Blair, a Kenyan firm that engages in regional investment banking, securities, investment management, and other financial services.
Britam, which is traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and has a market capitalization of close to $300 million, is Kenya’s largest life insurance company and controls over a fifth of the market.

Next Year’s 4/20 Celebrations In California Will Look A Lot More Legal,www.forbes.com,Samar Marwan,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/samarmarwan/2019/04/20/this-is-what-the-future-of-420-will-look-like-for-california/,"Next to the lemonade and gyros, California festival goers will soon be able to buy legal pot—a potential sales bonanza for local dispensaries and a boost to state tax revenues. But they’ll have to wait until next year’s 4/20, the informal holiday for cannabis enthusiasts, to buy weed outdoors. In September, former Governor Jerry Brown signed into law AB 2020, which allows event producers to obtain a license from the local Office of Cannabis to sell marijuana from licensed distributors at outdoor events. The law means that at large music festivals such as Indio’s Coachella and San Francisco’s Outside Lands, adults over the age of 21 will be able to purchase legal cannabis to smoke on-site. According to San Francisco-based cannabis delivery service Eaze, the day marked its second highest day of sales last year , after Green Wednesday (the day before Thanksgiving).
The state bill allowing cannabis dispensaries at outdoor events was spurred by public health problems. Last year, several festivity-goers during San Francisco’s April 20 celebrations were taken to the hospital for overdose due to cannabis laced with fentanyl sold through the illicit market, according to local news reports.
This incident is what San Francisco District Supervisor Rafael Mandelman says led to a push to pass Assembly Bill 2020 at the local level. The bill didn’t pass in time for event producers to apply for the permit for Saturday's festivities, they will be able to do so next year. “When you are purchasing a cannabis product you’re not purchasing it from a kid selling it out of a backpack, you’re purchasing it from a booth from an operator known to sell safe products,” said Mandelman.
California collected $345 million in tax revenue from recreational cannabis, short of the $1 billion analysts had predicted for 2018. The largest cannabis market in the U.S. hit major road bumps including licensing challenges, regulation shifts and changes to lab testing and packaging requirements, which impacted the supply chain.
While the government won’t get a cut from sales at events, local jurisdictions and the state can expect more tax revenue from licensed dispensaries selling at events. The supervisor says the main goal of the law is to give attendees access to legal lab tested cannabis in an effort to steer business away from illicit dealers. Other California counties could use this opportunity as a way to add revenues from events, Coachella, which hosts one of the largest music festivals in North America, grossed $114.6 million in 2017.

2014 AFP Being able to have a physical presence at events is vital for cannabis companies trying to market their brand since they are essentially locked out of key digital marketing avenues. Google lists marijuana in their ban on ads “for substances that alter mental state for the purpose of recreation or otherwise induce ‘highs"". On social media, many cannabis-related accounts have been shut down sometimes more than once with Facebook and Instagram’s guidelines prohibi t the promotion of cannabis for sale.
Starting in March, only recurring well-established events qualify for licenses, with the expansion to all event applicants starting in January 2020.
For an event like Outside Lands, one of San Francisco’s largest multi-day music festivals held in Golden Gate Park, event producers would be required to get a flurry of permits but will be authorized by the city’s Recreation & Parks Department to waive an otherwise applicable ban on smoking in the park.
In San Francisco, permits for events with 500 attendees or fewer will cost $500 and events with 2,500 people or more will go up to $3,000 —around the same cost as Denver's special event license, which is a flat $1,000 processing fee. The fees are meant to cover the cost of processing the application, but Mandelman says there are potential revenue opportunities for the city with taxation. “I think over time there’s an opportunity to have more cannabis events to develop what is essentially an interesting economic and cultural space.”"
Anora: The Smart Glove Helping The Blind,www.forbes.com,Rebecca Banovic,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccabanovic/2019/04/20/anora-the-smart-glove-helping-the-blind/,"Nikola Krstic , a graduate from the Electrical Engineering School in Belgrade, has created a smart glove prototype called Anora- that helps the blind and visually impaired move unaided without a service dog or white cane. The glove is equipped with ultrasonic sensors that explore the surroundings: it provides vibrotactile feedback on the position of the closest obstacles in range and lets users know by a vibrating motor and voice app. The Anora smart glove has many different multi-functions.
Spatial Orientation - The user will be able to detect the distance from objects through the use of haptic technology in the glove.
Colour Recognition - Through a click of a button, the glove will be able to say aloud the colour of the object the user has in their hand.
Detection of light intensity - The user can be told whether they are in a room present with light, and at the same time, whether the light is natural or artificial.
The glove will be able to say the date and time to the user.
Panic Button - If the user is lost, through a combination of buttons, the glove will be able to send the location via text message to a guardian or friend, whose contact details are stored in the app connected to the glove.
Recognition of money - One of the most sought-after functions, the glove is able to say the value of the notes and change the user holds in their hand.
The glove also has a small camera installed, which provides information on the emotions of the person the user is talking to.
Most recently, Mr Krstic has signed a co-operation contract, which will enable further development, promotion and implementation of the Anora smart glove domestically in Serbia. Easy Tech and the ‘Alliance of the Blind' Serbia, signed a co-operation agreement on the 10th of April. The signed agreement means a collaboration that will result in a large number of blind people being able to try the innovative product. The contract was signed at the Science Technology Park in Belgrade, by Nikola Krstić and Milan Stošić, the president of the ‘Alliance of the Blind'.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , it is globally estimated that 1.3 billion people live with some form of distance or near vision impairment. Approximately, 36 million people are blind, 188.5 million have mild vision impairment, 217 million have moderate to severe vision impairment.
Thus far, the Anora smart glove has been tested on 30 blind individuals in Serbia- and the reception has been positive.
""Generally, all the functions of the glove are of use to blind people. They say they like it. Also, they have not had the opportunity to use a device of this kind before,"" says Mr Krstic
""Of course, alongside the positive reviews, there are objections and suggestions as to which functions need to be added, changed and how. But, all of this is extremely useful information to us because we are going to make a device that is tailored to their needs.""
There has been research and explorations into a smart glove for the blind, but many of them are a single function. Anora is the first multi-functional smart glove.
Last year, the Anora smart glove was the winner of ‘Sarajevo Unlimited'- the largest regional forum for innovation, entrepreneurship and technology in the region of south-eastern Europe.
However, Mr Krstic is positive and would like to see the Anora smart glove develop and expand beyond Serbia and the Balkans.
""Over the next few months, we will be focusing on the development of the final version of the smart glove. We will focus on three elements: material selection, glove design, manufacture of electronics and software. Once we have finished with those three elements, we will have an ""almost-finished"" product that will go through a final round of testing. If the final product is adequate- we will finally be ready to come out onto the market."""
Housing Will Weaken Further In 2019 And 2020,www.forbes.com,Bill Conerly,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2019/04/20/housing-will-weaken-further-in-2019-and-2020/,"Strong home price appreciation last year led many to wonder if housing was unsustainably strong. I thought not and in November 2018 wrote Housing Forecast: Not A Bubble In 2019 . This update shows that housing will continue to soften, though not quite so much as previously expected. The most important factor determining housing construction and pricing is the underlying demographics. Housing is mostly built to accommodate new residents; just a little new construction replaces demolished or abandoned housing. My first gauge of the housing market is construction relative to population growth. The accompanying chart shows how many housing units were started per 100 new residents. New residents come from births in excess of deaths, plus net foreign immigration. The population data include estimates of illegal immigration, though there’s obviously some uncertainty there.
Housing starts per 100 new residents
Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Census Bureau This ratio shows we are in the ballpark of building just the right amount of new housing, single family homes plus apartment units. This is a low-fidelity measure, ignoring factors such as mobile homes shipments, demolitions, and houses abandoned in rural counties as people migrate to cities. Nonetheless, it gets us in the ballpark of whether we are grossly overbuilding or underbuilding.
Key to this chart is the slow population growth of recent years. The United States population growth last year was the lowest percentage increase since 1937. Many people in the lumber business think of 1.5 million housing starts as normal, but that was back when population growth was much faster. Today, 1.1 million is a normal year, and we built 1.2 million housing units in 2018, though with a downward trend in the second half.
U.S. Population Growth
Dr. Bill Conery based on data from U.S. Census Bureau The other benchmarks for current conditions that I watch are housing vacancy rates . They are running about normal for both owned (owner-occupied if not vacant) and rental properties. The quarterly data from the Census Bureau don’t align perfectly with other data sources, but they do indicate gross disparities from normal.
U.S. housing vacancy rates
Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Census Bureau To dig deeper into current conditions I look at home prices, measured by the Federal Housing Finance Administration . Home prices have increased in a fairly narrow range averaging about six percent, though the latest data point is quite low. I also watch the price of newly constructed houses and see that homebuilders are moving down-market.
U.S. home price appreciation
Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency The cause of recent weakness is most likely mortgage interest rate increases. From September 2017 through November 2018, the interest rate on 30-year mortgages increased from 3.8% to 4.9%. Sales of existing homes dropped sharply, with about a one-month time lag. Sales of newly-built single-family houses peaked just after mortgage rates started rising, then dropped sharply in the following months, hitting bottom in December 2018. Mortgage rates obviously affect the affordability of a house, but the changes in mortgage rates also affected expectations of future affordability. Homebuilders moved quickly to avoid the worst sting of the higher rates, then returned to the market at the first signs of rates easing.
U.S. mortgage interest rate
Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from Federal Reserve The income part of the homebuying equation has been steadily improving. Disposable income has increased by four to five percent over the past few years, driven by increases in employment and even greater increases in wage rates.
U.S. disposable income growth
Dr. Bill Conerly based on data from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Looking forward, the demographic trends won’t change much, unless the United States suddenly lets in a great many more immigrants. That seems unlikely, even if President Trump is not re-elected in 2020.
Interest rates have dropped every month since November 2018. Part of this is a global drop in long-term interest rates, and a secondary factor is the recent Federal Reserve policy shift, which involves both short-term rates as well as the Fed’s large portfolio of long-term securities. I expect rates to be level for a few months and then to rise again, as the Fed sees more signs of inflation in the economy.
Household income growth should continue to be strong. Weakness in employment would most likely be driven by labor shortages rather than soft demand. The labor shortage will continue to drive up wage rates, boosting total income.
Rolling these factors together, we are currently close to a reasonable range for housing construction, but a little bit high. The slight oversupply will put downward pressure on price appreciation. If I am right that inflation will accelerate—and be warned that this is now a minority view—then higher interest rates will dampen demand. Combining weaker demand with a little too much supply, and home price appreciation will slow. A major price decline is unlikely, but don’t expect to make easy money simply owning a house.
As I talk to people about the economy, I hear a range of opinions. The gloomy old men see housing as overpriced and younger people too profligate to be able to afford to purchase a home. The real estate professionals panic at the thought that mortgage rates could rise over five percent, as if we haven’t survived much worse. And investors don’t understand that the economy is not the same as the stock market. A good solution to the inherent biases that we humans have is to slow down, roll through the fundamental factors, and ignore headlines as much as possible.v"
What Is The Number One Killer Of People Ages 5 to 29?,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/20/what-is-the-number-one-killer-of-people-ages-5-to-29/,"What is the ninth leading cause of death overall globally? (Photo: Getty Images) Getty It is the leading cause of death among children and young adults around the world. It is the ninth leading cause of death overall globally. It resulted in about 1.35 million people dying in 2016 alone. It will probably become the seventh leading killer worldwide by 2030.
If you are currently a member of Generation Z, this is what you are at greatest risk of dying from: road traffic injuries. That's because according to the 2018 Global Status on Road Safety from the World Health Organization (WHO) , such injuries constitute the number one killer of those who are five to 29 years old. That's why Bloomberg Philanthropies started its Initiative for Global Road Safety to address the road safety problem.
Unless you are Aquaman or live in a very remote location, you probably regularly deal with road traffic in some way. Even if you are five years old and don't have a real car or a driver's license yet (by the way, you shouldn't have either), you still have to worry about this major global problem. Pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists comprise over half of all traffic-related deaths. Breaking it down further, 26% of all road traffic deaths were pedestrians and cyclists, 28% were drivers of two- or three-wheeled vehicles, 29% were car occupants, and 17% were ""unidentified road users."" Add to the deaths, the up to 50 million who survive road traffic accidents but suffer injuries each year.
Although getting run over by a pig or a cow is probably no picnic, the rise in road traffic injuries is certainly connected to the rise in automobile and other individual motorized vehicle usage around the world. Contrary to what you may see on the Flintstones, cars really have only been around for less than a century-and-a-half. But the growth in the number of motorized vehicles over a relatively short period of time has been remarkable. As the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates, in just a three-year period, 2010 to 2013, the number of registered vehicles around the world increased by 16%. It can be challenging to measure the total number of motorized vehicles since many vehicles may go unregistered and that's not counting the DeLoreans that are time traveling. But there are estimates that over 1.2 billion cars are out there.
The trouble is the rise and spread of such vehicles have been so rapid that many of the existing surrounding systems haven't been able to keep pace. Or in many cases, the wrong systems were in place in the first place. This is true all around the world, but especially in many low- and middle-income countries. To address these systems, Bloomberg Philanthropies' Initiative for Global Road Safety first looked at what may be contributing to these problems and how best to address them. This included collecting and analyzing lots of data on road safety. As Kelly Henning, MD , who leads the Bloomberg Philanthropies' Public Health program, explained, ""Down to the city level, all the work that we do is data driven. This meant increasing the surveillance that is occurring and the strength of data.""
Sarah Whitehead of Vital Strategies, an implementing partner of the Initiative, added, ""In many places, there isn't a data use culture. There are many gaps in data, and some like the police may tightly hold the relevant data. It is important to get higher quality data."" When he was Mayor of New York City Mayor, billionaire philanthropist Mike Bloomberg oversaw many road safety changes. (Photo: Courtesy of Bloomberg Philanthropies) Courtesy of Bloomberg Philanthropies
Former New York City Mayor and founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies Mike Bloomberg said, ""Over the last decade, we’ve invested $259 million to implement solutions that are proven to prevent road deaths and injuries such as wearing helmets and seat-belts, reducing speeding and drinking and driving, redesigning city streets, and advocating for safer vehicles."" Bloomberg Philanthropies and their partners have been focusing on the following five categories of interventions to try to curb road traffic injuries:
1. Changing driving and riding behaviors.
These interventions aim to reduce the behaviors that make driving for everyone, including those not driving, far more risky. One is driving while impaired. Traditionally, the most common culprit has been alcohol. If you don't understand how alcohol may affect your thinking, your reasoning, your reaction times, your muscle coordination and thus your driving ability, put down your beer and your driver's license and step away from the car. You don't even have to be anywhere near the legal limits of blood alcohol levels to have problems driving. As the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) relays , 2017 saw 1,837 people killed where drivers had blood alcohol levels that were below the legal limit (that is, between 0.01 to 0.07 g/dL).
There is no question that alcohol-impaired driving remains a major problem. Just take a look at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for some stark statistics for the U.S. alone : ""Every day, 29 people in the United States die in motor vehicle crashes that involve an alcohol-impaired driver. This is one death every 50 minutes. The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion."" Certainly, alcohol is not the only thing that can cloud your mind. With marijuana use increasing, driving while under the influence of marijuana is certainly a growing concern, pun intended. Then there are opioids. A study of two-vehicle crashes published in JAMA Network Open found that drivers who had tested positive for prescription opioids were 2.18 times more likely to have initiated the car crash.
Another risky behavior is not wearing seat belts. A seat belt is potentially more comfortable to wear (and safer) than a tight thong or a pair of skinny pants. Yet, according to the NHTSA , nearly ten percent of Americans (or 27.5 million people) still don't wear their seat belts. This despite the findings that buckling up can prevent fatal injuries by 45% to 65%
A third example of a risky behavior is speed. Not the movie or the drug (although you should not take speed or watch the movie and drive), but driving fast. Per the NHTSA , driving over the posted speed limits contributed to 26% of all traffic deaths in the U.S. in 2017.
A final example is not wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle. Without a helmet, the only thing that's protecting your head is your hair, which no matter how big it is will not be enough to prevent fatal head injuries.
2. Improving infrastructure.
These interventions recognize the fact that streets, sidewalks, and everything around them form complex systems that can either protect people or put them at risk, depending on how they are designed. For example, narrowing streets and the turning radii around corners can prevent cars from speeding and widening sidewalks and adding safer crosswalks can give pedestrians more protection. Changes that have occurred under the Bloomberg Initiative have i ncluded constructing a 300-meter pedestrian walkway close to a school in Accra, Ghana, and nearly doubling the total extent of safe bike lanes and establishing the first slow-speed zone (with raised pedestrian crossings and curb extensions) in Fortaleza, Brazil. If you want to see other ways that roads, sidewalks, and the spaces around both can be designed to facilitate safety, take a look at the Global Street Design Guide , written by the Global Designing Cities Initiative (GDCI) and the National Association of City Transportation (NACTO) . Skye Duncan, Director of the GDCI, walked through a lot of the different ways that design principles are being implemented in different cities around the world and explained how the ""behaviors of both drivers and pedestrians are affected greatly by the design around them."" Duncan added, ""The guide can serve as a blueprint to help undo the design that has occurred in many locations. This will help protect people and make locations much more accessible to everyone.""
Bloomberg is a believer in such design changes. When he was Mayor of New York City, between 2007 and 2013, his administration's Department of Transportation redesigned 137 street corridors and 113 intersections, which helped create 180 more acres of safe space for cyclists and pedestrians. Janette Sadik-Khan , who is currently the Permanent Chair of the GDCI Initiative, a principal at Bloomberg Associates, and an author of the book Streetfight: Handbook for an Urban Revolution , had helped implement a number of road safety design initiatives when she had run New York City Department of Transportation in Mayor Bloomberg's administration. It is probably no coincidence that traffic deaths in New York City fell by 45% from 2001 to 2017 and that traffic fatalities fell by 34% where the Department of Transportation had made major engineering changes. Sadik-Khan explained that ""there shouldn't be an auto-centric approach to designing streets. Streets and sidewalks are also about moving people.""
3. Adding and augmenting sustainable urban support.
Robert Frost once spoke of taking the road less traveled by and how that made all the difference. He probably wasn't talking about road safety, but fewer cars traveling on the road will naturally lead to a lower risk of accidents. Therefore, part of the work of the Bloomberg Initiative has been trying to further develop alternatives to cars and motorbikes. This includes augmenting mass transit systems, bike routes, and walking infrastructures.
4. Establishing more rigorous vehicle standards.
Around the world, cars can be like clothes, varying substantially in design and in some cases leaving you really exposed. While there are established safety standard in countries like the U.S., Japan, and Germany, many low- and middle-income countries may have little or no regulatory standards for vehicles. The Bloomberg Initiative has been pushing for greater safety standard in a number of different cities. For example, in Accra, Ghana, efforts helped remove over 200 defective motorbikes from the road.
5. Strengthening policies and regulations .
Henning said that ""There is a need for the right policies and regulations, as well as strong police enforcement as people have to understand the consequences of behavior. Governments need to buy into road safety and have the political will to reduce fatalities."" Examples of changes that have occurred under the Bloomberg Initiative are new provisions in Shanghai, China, on seat-belt use for all vehicle occupants, child restraint-use and helmet use, greater enforcement of helmet use and red light laws in Accra, Ghana, and training of city officials and traffic police in road safety practices in Mumbai, India.
A big part of the Bloomberg Initiative has been bringing more attention to this global killer. If you were to ask people what is the leading cause of death among children and young adults around the world, you may get other answers, ranging from drugs to Thanos. That's why Vital Strategies has been putting together campaigns to increase awareness such as this video on speeding for Bangkok, Thailand:
And this video on drunk driving for São Paulo, Brazil:
Pretty powerful stuff, even if you don't understand Portuguese.
Yes, road traffic injuries are a leading killer. But as Bloomberg said, ""The good news is we know the interventions that could prevent many of them."" In other words, the roads to reducing deaths are there. We just have to take them. Bruce Y.

"'Game Of Thrones' Season 8, Episode 2 Preview: The Night King Cometh",www.forbes.com,Erik Kain,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/04/20/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-2-preview-the-night-king-cometh/,"Game of Thrones kicked things off last week with a season premiere that was largely about various characters giving one another looks. Sansa giving Daenerys an icy stare. The dragon eyeing Jon as he tried to get it on with his queen. Jaime and Bran gazing at one another, Jaime's face a mixture of concern and regret; Bran as implaccable as ever. Sam staring at the Mother of Dragons as she told him how she killed his father and brother. So many looks. Not so much action. I thought it was a very good episode that, like virtually every other Game Of Thrones season premiere, started off slow, setting the stage for the episodes to come. Of course, with just five more episodes, I can understand why many fans felt things moved a little slowly, and precious time was wasted with Jon and Dany galavanting about on their (starving) dragons for no good reason.
I suspect things will begin to heat up in episode 2, at least judging by the trailer and the new images HBO has released. First, let's watch the trailer:
Lions And Dragons And Wolves, Oh My!
The blurb for this episode is: "" The battle at Winterfell is approaching. Jaime is confronted with the consequences of the past. A tense interaction between Sansa and Daenerys follows.""
Two things appear to be happening in this preview trailer. First, we have Jaime presenting himself before Sansa and Daenerys, likely begging for forgiveness and offering up his sword. We don't hear from any of the Starks, though they have plenty of their own problems with the Kingslayer, but Daenerys is rather fearsome.
""When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father,"" she says, ""and all the things we would do to that man."" Jaime looks as though he's going to be sick.
Brienne will likely vouch for Jaime. So will Tyrion.
They should, in any case. Jaime has turned a new leaf since the days of tossing young boys from towers and incestuous liaisons. Not only has he lost his hand and found his honor, like Cersei he's lost all his children. He's no longer the boy he was when he killed the Mad King Aerys--and the king he killed, Dany's father, was a psychopath hellbent on burning down King's Landing and everyone in it--and he's no longer the commander of the King's Guard, doing his father's bidding.
But he may drive yet another wedge between our various heroes.
His sister seems to be doing just that, given Tyrion's plan to turn her over to the light side of the Force.
""He never should have trusted Cersei,"" Daenerys says at one point, though she could be speaking about any number of people. Ned Stark? Tyrion? Jaime? Probably Jaime, since Dany went along with Tyrion's stupid plan, which is what Sansa would be referring to.
""You never should have, either,"" Sansa snipes back. Point, Sansa. Sansa is getting all the points with her crisp scoldings of the Starks' new allies.
Skip ahead to the forges and dark corridors of Winterfell.
""Death. It's got many faces,"" Arya says, still totally brainwashed by the Faceless Men of Braavos. ""I look forward to seeing this one."" Is she referring to the Night King? To someone she plans on killing? I'm not really sure.
""How long do we have?"" Jon asks, while speaking with Tormund Giantsbane out in the courtyard. We get flashes of various characters. Grey Worm and Missandei kissing. Jorah Mormont on a horse, looking worried. Catapults and riders.
""Before the sun comes up tomorrow,"" Tormund replies. I guess that's when the Night King will arrive. My guess is he'll show up at Winterfell at the end of the episode, and then episode 3 will be the massive Battle of Winterfell, apparently the longest battle ever shot for television or film.
Alright, let's look at the photos HBO released for this episode.
Grim Business, War
Jon and Arya
Credit: HBO Here Arya and Jon seem to be making plans, perhaps, or discussing how to defend Winterfell. Something of that sort. I believe Sam is in on the conversation:
Jon and Sam
Credit: HBO In fact, there appear to be many shots of people standing around talking with one another in the castle:
Sansa
Credit: HBO Here's Sansa thinking up another vicious barb.
Lady Mormont
Credit: HBO And here's the young Lady Mormont laying down another truth bomb. I wonder, will she and Jorah ever talk about stuff? They're related, after all. Seems they have a lot to talk about.
Jaime
Credit: HBO No doubt, the young Bear is saying something about how Jaime should be strung up and hanged. Many will want that. I suspect cooler heads will prevail. They'll have Jaime shaking in his boots first, however. I wonder if he'll have the courage to tell Dany the truth about her father. A truth she should already know by now.
Hey, does anybody miss Ser Barristan Selmy? I sure do.
Varys, Dany and Jorah
Credit: HBO Here's the Dragon Queen and her advisors, probably telling Sam once again that she murdered his father and brother in cold blood. I mean, she'd already taken them prisoner. The very most basic rules of war require a conquering army to treat prisoners with some decorum. A trial for war crimes. A dark cell until they can be ransomed by their families. Perhaps some hard labor. Not dragonfire simply because they won't immediately abandon their queen and bend the knee.
Dany really is a very bad person when you think about it. I'm . . . not a fan.
Tyrion
Credit: HBO Tyrion is probably thinking about Sansa's last sick burn. Yes, he was once very clever. I think perhaps he's drank away a few too many little grey cells. Now he can't say ""That's what I do. I drink and I know things."" Now all he can say is ""I drink and make terrible plans that led directly to the Night King breaking down the Wall.""
Bran looks awfully serious.
Credit: HBO I'm really looking forward to all things Jaime Lannister in this coming episode, but it's his interaction with Bran that most excites me. What will they talk about? ""Hi, Bran, so...been doing much climbing lately?"" ""Haha, very funny, Jaime, how's your sword arm these days?""
Actually, I'm not quite sure they will interact. Perhaps Bran will just give him a good long stare and Jaime will retreat. We'll see.
Bran at the Weirwood
Credit: HBO I want a weirwood to sit next to while contemplating the universe. Perhaps Bran will do a little three-eye-ravening and show us some stuff from the past, or peer out and see the Night King's army approaching. We need lots of Bran vs the Night King magic this season.
Gilly
Credit: HBO Hey look, it's Gilly! Gilly is the person who is actually responsible for figuring out who Jon's real parents are. At least to an extent. She's the one who reads the story of ""Prince Ragger"" and his annulled marriage. At the time Same hardly paid her any heed at all. Not bad for a girl from Craster's Keep who never learned to read or write until Sam started teaching her. Not bad at all.
Sam, Gilly and Little Sam
Credit: HBO Now that's one cute family. But all these civilians should be fleeing south. Only fighters and strategic advisers and anyone who is absolutely essential to the war effort should remain. Everyone else should be braving a quick march to warming climes.
Grey Worm and Missandei
Credit: HBO Well, we see this attractive couple kissing in the trailer and they have their own pretty serious looking interaction going on here. I suppose Grey Worm is getting ready for battle, and Missandei is understandably worried. I think . . . I think things will not go well for Grey Worm. Or maybe for Missandei. For this ill-fated couple, at least, things are looking grim.
Davos
Credit: HBO At least one person in Castle Winterfell remembers to eat. Here's Davos ladling himself some soup. Or at least I like to think that's what's going on. Davos is one of the more tragic figures in Game of Thrones. He lost all his sons in the Battle of the Blackwater. He lost the king he adored to the Red Witch, Melisandre. And he lost the princess Shireen who was burned at the stake by her power-hungry father. Literally the worst episode of Game of Thrones, I don't even like to think about it.
And that's all folks!
I predict that while we will get some action toward the end of the episode, this one will be a lot like the last. Lots of dialogue, lots of characters rubbing one another the wrong way, lots of meaningful looks. And I'm fine with that. If Episode 3 really is a huge mega-battle of the most epic of proportions, well, I'm ready for more verbal jousting beforehand.
Absent these shots is Cersei and her retinue. No Mountain, no Qyburn, no Euron Greyjoy. Nor do we see the other Greyjoys, Yara and Theon. It's likely all of them will show up in the episode, but it's possible that this one will be entirely focused on the north. I'd bet on the former over the latter.
We may also get to see what Arya's new weapon is. I'm curious, though I hope it isn't too gimmicky. And, of course, Jon will have to tell Daenerys about their . . . relationship. He's too honest to withhold it from her, and she'd be too pushy once she noticed something was wrong to let him keep silent even if he wanted to. Will she be angry? Will she not believe him?
What do you think will happen in Episode 2? Let me know on Twitter or Facebook . After this one we have just four more episodes. Which is crazy if you ask me. This show should be going on at least another two seasons. C'est la vie.

Who Got Rich This Week: Nike’s Phil Knight Scores $254 Million After Tiger Woods Wins The Masters,www.forbes.com,Hayley C. Cuccinello,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/04/20/who-got-rich-this-week-nikes-phil-knight-scores-254-million-after-tiger-woods-wins-the-masters/,"Nike has stood by Tiger Woods through thick and thin. The sneaker giant has sponsored Woods since 1996, standing by the golfer through sex scandals, a DUI arrest and injuries. Now Nike is basking in “The Tiger Effect” as Woods scored a surprising victory at 2019 Masters Championship this past Sunday. Nike stock increased 4.9% in the week through April 18, boosting its market cap to $140.2 billion, up from $117 billion at the start of 2019. Woods’ victory at the Masters was also lucrative for Nike founder Phil Knight , who owns 20% of the Oregon-based company. Knight’s fortune rose by $254 million to a total of $35.7 billion. The 81-year-old billionaire retired in 2016 after 52 years, and his 45-year-old son Travis, who runs animation studio LAIKA, has sat on the board since 2015.
As for Woods, his prize is a mere $2.07 million, a drop in the bucket compared to his estimated net worth of $800 million . But the golfer has always made most of his millions off the links: more than 90% of his $1.5 billion in lifetime earnings is from endorsements, personal appearances and golf course design work.
Minutes after Woods’ Masters victory — his first in 14 years — Nike released a celebratory ad that highlighted his career and ended with a clip of a young Woods saying he would beat Jack Nicklaus. Woods is only one Masters win away from beating The Golden Bear’s record. ""It's crazy to think a 43-year-old who has experienced every high and every low and has just won his 15th major is chasing the same dream as a 3-year-old,"" the Nike spot said.
Nike’s stock has been swayed by its star clients before. In February, Nike’s market value fell $1.1 billion after Duke basketball phenom Zion Williamson broke his Nike sneaker less than one minute into a game against rival University of North Carolina.
Nike is Tiger Woods’ largest sponsor, but other sports stocks benefited from The Tiger Effect. Share price for Callaway Golf increased by 2.9% while stock for Acushnet Holdings — the owner of Titleist — surged by 7.5%."
Facebook's Privacy Seems To Be Traveling Away,www.forbes.com,Joe Gray,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joegray/2019/04/20/facebooks-privacy-seems-to-be-traveling-away/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Cybersecurity I write about Cyber Security and the impact it has on business. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin In this Jan. 9, 2019 photo, media and guests mingle before a tour of Facebook's new 130,000-square-foot offices, which occupy the top three floors of a 10-story Cambridge, Mass. building. The space gives the company room to triple its current local staff of more than 200. The Silicon Valley company, created by Mark Zuckerberg when he was two subway stops away at Harvard University, opened its first Boston office five years ago. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola) ASSOCIATED PRESS Regarding Facebook, there is no shortage of controversy or concerns facing their users. Whether it be a privacy breach from data misuse , Instagram passwords being compromised or the Cambridge Analytica data collection activities. Facebook has had its share of media attention from excessive permissions or not being upfront about new Terms of Service agreements.
Fast forward and it is brought to my attention that Facebook was advertising ""Traveling Friends"" to users of the mobile app. I stopped using the mobile app a few months ago after researching the permissions and data collection practices in favor of using a mobile browser that does not allow the same data collection. So I decided to reinstall the app on iOS (Apple iPhone) to see if I could recreate the condition. I searched for ""Traveling Friends"" and found some pages that appeared to be attempting to convince users that it was legitimate. I decided to try to find it via the ""Nearby Friends"" feature. There it is.
To be completely transparent, I also had to enable location services and to be able to see all ""Traveling Friends,"" I had to give the app permission to always collect location information. I would not normally enable such a feature out of an abundance of caution. I understand that by having a Facebook account, one cannot attain full anonymity or privacy just as it is impossible to attain even if one avoids social media altogether. From my experience in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), I have found that it is easier to manage one's online presence by having accounts and exercising sound techniques in access controls, app permissions and the data input into the social media platform. Blurred Screenshot of Facebook Nearby Friends screen . Joe Gray
Regarding the vulnerability feature that is being discussed here, when navigating to ""Nearby Friends"" via the iOS mobile app, I was prompted to change the location services setting. Once that is changed, I was able to see that 4 of my friends were traveling. I searched the Facebook Newsroom for an announcement on the vulnerability feature, which I was unsuccessful in finding anything. I noted where the 4 friends live and where they were listed. As observed in the screenshot below, all 4 people are 100 more miles away and presumably have location services turned on and set to ""always."" Blurred Screenshot of my ""Traveling Friends"" on Facebook. Joe Gray
I blurred out the listed distance because that could be used to compromise my precise location. One friend is from my hometown and was in a nearby big city 150 miles away. I reached out to another friend and they were 100 miles away with their lover. I looked up the locations of the other two friends and they were one and three states away from ""home"" respectively. So, it appears as if a user has nearby friends turned on and is more than 100 miles from the location listed as home on their profile, then they will show up. I have some upcoming travel so I will test in a controlled manner on the trip.
Regarding the privacy implications, this is something that could affect many people's operations security (OPSEC) if enabled with location services. In an abuse case scenario, this could implicate an employee who falsely claims to be sick while actually on a recreational trip (if they are Facebook friends with any colleagues). Alternatively, this could give up locations of law enforcement or military when conducting operations outside 100 miles. This also gives unscrupulous people who are on a user's friends list the information that would assist them in knowing no one is home and that it may be easier to rob that home.
To protect oneself and your location, I recommend not enabling location services at all. If you do not have a necessity to use the application or have an interest in enhanced security, do not even use the mobile app, log in via a web browser. If you have a reason to enable location services, change the app's setting to ""only when using the app."" If possible, enable location services via the phone (not the app) only when using them. This will prevent any changes to the default configuration during app updates. Using social media can be fun, rewarding or exciting but if misused or used without all the information, it can be quite the opposite.

"Terence Crawford Vs. Amir Khan Preview, Odds; Jarrell Miller's Drug Test Costs: Boxing Biz",www.forbes.com,Josh Katzowitz,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshkatzowitz/2019/04/20/terence-crawford-vs-amir-khan-preview-odds-jarrell-miller-drug-test-costs-boxing-biz/,"After Vasiliy Lomachenko took care of Anthony Crolla in dominating fashion last week, the other boxer who many consider to be the best in the world gets his chance to wow boxing fans. That’d be big-time betting favorite Terence Crawford, who faces a fascinating test in Amir Khan on ESPN PPV that begins at 9 p.m. ET. Lomachenko was impressive. Now, it’s Crawford’s turn to match him.
“The Crawford-Khan showdown is a very interesting matchup of two elite fighters,” Top Rank chairman Bob Arum said. “Khan, when fighting at welterweight, is as good as there is, but he is fighting the division’s best fighter and a pound-for-pound great. It will be an entertaining and competitive fight.”
There are plenty of reasons to watch Crawford—who is a -1600 favorite, meaning you’d have to bet $1,600 to win a measly $100—face Khan. Here are three of them.
1) You should never pass up a chance to watch Crawford: Though he’s a genial, laid-back personality outside of the ring, Crawford (34-0, 25 KOs) can be downright mean when he begins to fight. And he seems to get better each time he steps between the ropes. After dominating the junior welterweight division, knocking out Julius Indongo in 2017 to become the undisputed champion, Crawford’s ascent to welterweight has gone well. He stopped Jeff Horn and Jose Benavidez Jr., and it wouldn’t be a shock to see him knock out Khan. “I am on a high level right now, and the way I beat people makes it seem like they don't belong in the ring with me,” Crawford said. “Against Khan, I will show everyone again why I'm the best fighter in the world.”
2) Khan is determined to score the biggest victory of his career: Though he’s certainly had some good wins in his career—notably against Marco Antonio Barrera and Marcos Maidana—he’s also been blasted by the top opponents he’s faced. Khan (33-4, 20 KOs) got brutally knocked out by Canelo Alvarez at 154 pounds and stopped by Danny Garcia at 140. Crawford is just as good, if not better, than both of those opponents. Though there have always been rampant questions about the quality of Khan’s chin, he thinks he can be a tough opponent for Crawford. “I'm not going to be giving all that weight away when I fight Crawford,” he said. “When I fought Canelo, he was a much bigger man. This is a fairer fight in terms of weight. I am confident I can win this fight because he has never fought anyone like me. I have power, speed, and movement, and he has certainly never fought a welterweight like me. I've grown into my weight. I'm not just another number on Crawford's record.”
3) Will Crawford get the chance at the biggest money fight of all?: Originally, Crawford was supposed to fight Luis Collazo. Instead, we get Khan, which is certainly an upgrade. But people really want to see Crawford fight Errol Spence. It’s a tough fight to negotiate because Spence fights for Premier Boxing Champions and Crawford competes for Top Rank. Neither promoter is all that fond of the other. But at some point, fans might demand to see Crawford vs. Spence. First, though, Crawford has to beat Khan. “If Crawford is talking about maybe that fight happening and overlooking me,” Khan said, “it’s going to be a big shock.”
Jarrell Miller has lost his chance to face Anthony Joshua. (Photo by John Walton/PA Images via Getty Images)
Getty The loss of “Big Baby” riches: With Jarrell “Big Baby” Miller testing positive for multiple substances in multiple different drug tests, his chances of facing Anthony Joshua are over for now. And it’s going to cost him a bunch of money.
As reported by ESPN , Miller—who was supposed to meet Joshua for the heavyweight championship in June—would have made a career-high guarantee of $4.875 million with more money to be earned on the backside after the Sky Sports PPV receipts in the U.K. were tallied (the fight would have been televised by DAZN in the U.S.). Others estimate that Miller will end up losing about $6.5 million total without the Joshua fight.
Meanwhile, assuming he lost to Joshua (Miller was a +650 underdog), Miller would have earned a combined $3 million for his next two fights on DAZN. His biggest purse before the Joshua fight was an estimated $500,000 vs. Bogdan Dinu last November."
A Reason To Celebrate 4/20: Recreational Cannabis Now Legal In Ten States And DC,www.forbes.com,Lea Lane,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2019/04/20/a-reason-to-celebrate-420-recreational-cannabis-now-legal-in-ten-states-and-dc/,"Smoking marijuana can now be a legal part of your travels in several states. Getty In this post-Mueller-report atmosphere, it's a relief for many adult travelers to know that you can now legally celebrate 4/20 or any day with recreational weed in Washington D.C and 10 states. (And in 33 states marijuana is okay for medicinal purposes.) So depending where you travel in the U.S., you can actually enjoy a legal ""weedcation.""
Yes, the recreational use of cannabis is legal in Alaska , California , Colorado , Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan , Nevada , Oregon , Vermont , and Washington , the District of Columbia , the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam . Another 14 states plus the U.S. Virgin Islands have decriminalized.
Commercial distribution of cannabis is allowed in all jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized, except Vermont and the District of Columbia. But things do remain a bit confusing and dicey, especially when you travel. Be advised: The drug remains illegal under U.S. federal law , and the Justice Department periodically signals a crackdown on the business . State and local laws vary with regards to both the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana, and it's the responsibility of both travelers and hosts to ensure that all of their activities are consistent with relevant laws.
Yes, in more than half the US states you can pick pot up from a dispensary and bring it to your lodging in your car – legally, with a few restrictions. But even if you’re traveling from one legal state to another bordering legal state (like from Washington to Oregon or California to Nevada), it’s still federally illegal to bring your stash with you, and may even be considered federal drug trafficking. Growth of the legal marijuana industry keeps growing beyond expectations; customers in North America will spend nearly $23 billion by 2021, projects the ArcView Group , a cannabis-focused research and investment firm.
Will the number states where pot is accepted increase? A HuffPost/YouGov poll showed that 55 percent of Americans favor legalizing marijuana both nationally and in their own states. National support for legalization at the federal level hit a record 64 percent in a Gallup survey from October 2017 , including among a majority of Republicans. And the trend keeps rising.
Legal marijuana sales in the U.S. hit $6 billion in 2016, with tax revenue in Colorado and Washington, the states that have had legal cannabis markets for the longest, now bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, according to an analysis by the Marijuana Policy Project .
In the future you may be able to cross state lines with a small stash as easily as bringing along a bottle of pinot noir. But not yet ! Be sure you understand the law, are careful and cautious -- and then enjoy yourselves where it's legal. Private venues still have rules you'll have to follow (including no-smoking in general) and to be sure you may need to research more on your own.
That said, here is a guide of some of the best places in the U.S. to celebrate April 20.
I've also compiled a listing of a few weed-friendly lodgings, ranging from luxury cottages and mountain retreats to quirky BandBs and downtown hotels. Check out Bud and Breakfast and organizations such as potguide.com for places to stay and for special tours with fellow enthusiasts, any day."
"In Medicare-For-All Debate, Insurers Bet They're Loved More Than Bernie",www.forbes.com,Bruce Japsen,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/04/20/in-medicare-for-all-debate-insurers-bet-theyre-loved-more-than-bernie/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Healthcare I write about healthcare business and policy Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin BETHLEHEM, PA - APRIL 15: Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) participates in a FOX News Town Hall at SteelStacks on April 15, 2019 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Sanders is running for president in a crowded field of Getty Images Health insurance executives are increasingly betting that Americans like private coverage more than health benefits that would only be administered by the government given public statements by CEOs and information pushed by their lobbyists.
As presidential hopeful U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and some Democrats push a single payer version of Medicare for All that would replace the private healthcare system, health insurers are countering with more aggressive responses, touting their worth to U.S. consumers and patients. Insurers are touting their businesses and noting Americans are buying what they have to offer backed by polls and surveys saying consumers are satisfied.
Take UnitedHealth Group’s CEO, who led off the company’s 80-minute first quarter earnings call this past week talking for several minutes about the benefits of the private insurer’s role working with the government in administering U.S. healthcare benefits.
“The best system is one which is informed, engaged and aligned, where people, their doctors and the private and public sectors work together to improve or sustain individual health, while improving the performance of health systems – for everyone,” UnitedHealth Group CEO David Wichmann said.
And other health insurance CEOs are also speaking out, talking about the expense of Medicare for All and doubting whether it will even happen given how entrenched the private sector is. More than 20 million Americans are now enrolled in private Medicare Advantage plans and most U.S. Medicaid beneficiaries get coverage from a private insurer that contracts with states, reports show.
On the day Centene CEO Michael Neidorff announced the proposed acquisition of WellCare Health plans, he talked about a 10-year cost of Medicare for All of more than $25 trillion and touted insurer efforts to expand benefits in partnership with the government. “We cannot afford it,” Neidorff said on a conference call March 27.
Centene, which already provides coverage for 2 million individually insured Americans under the Affordable Care Act, administers Medicaid benefits and would have an expanded role in Medicare Advantage once the WellCare Health Plan deal closes.
“We have to look at the practical, the political and everything I saw said: This is a great transaction,” Neidorff said. “It put two great companies together in a very meaningful way serving a lot of audiences that you can never do enough to serve.”
Both politicians and health insurers tout studies and polls showing people like both Medicare for All and private coverage.
America’s Health Insurance Plans, which lobbies for most large health insurers including Centene, Cigna and Anthem, released a survey last year showing more than 70% of Americans “satisfied” with their “employer-provided health coverage.”
Meanwhile, other research published by independent organizations shows Americans tend to be satisfied with their private and employer coverage but that could be waning a bit.
The Kaiser Family Foundation, which has monthly tracking polls and other surveys rating the public’s perception of health coverage, showed 83% of Americans rated their employer-based coverage as “excellent” or “good” and 17% said it was ""not so good"" or ""poor,"" in a 2016 survey. In 2010, 92% said their employer coverage was ""excellent"" or ""good"" and just 7% said it was ""not so good"" or ""poor.""
""Overall, a majority of these individuals rate their coverage favorably, but we did find a slight decrease in favorability from 2010 to 2016,"" says Ashley Kirzinger , associate director of Kaiser's polling team. Bruce Japsen Senior Contributor

Berkshire Utilities' Next Big Utility Bite,www.forbes.com,Roger Conrad,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/04/20/berkshire-utilities-next-big-utility-bite/,"I’ve personally owned Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/B) long enough to build up unrealized gains five times my initial investment. That hardly makes me unique. Nor do my concerns about the next act for this investment company/conglomerate, now at $516 billion in market capitalization. One road ahead would be to keep investing massive free cash flows ($22.8 billion last year) in well-run businesses at good prices. Management may also tie its disparate units more closely by finding new ways to work together, or they could double down on some and sell others. Also, though Mr. Buffett owns 37.34 percent of the ""A"" shares, activist investors are no doubt salivating about getting their hooks in eventually.
Whatever happens to Berkshire Hathaway will have huge consequences not just for shareholders, but for the industries it operates in as well. One of them is electricity.
Compared to Berkshire’s signature insurance business, electricity is almost an afterthought. Including its natural gas pipelines, the Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) unit contributed only 8 percent of last year’s revenue.
Those sales were a great deal more significant in comparison to other utilities. In fact, BHE’s revenue was higher in 2018 than NextEra Energy ’s (NEE) and nearly 1.5 times Dominion Energy ’s (D). The only US peers with higher sales were Duke Energy (DUK) and Exelon Corp (EXC).
Buffett started his utility empire building in the mid-1990s, acquiring over extended MidAmerican Energy. He took advantage of the post-Enron utility sector meltdown of 2001-02 to enter the natural gas pipeline business with a high priced loan to Williams Companies (WMB).
Troubled but asset rich PacifiCorp was the next major coup in 2005, extending holdings to the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains. NV Energy in December 2013 added western scale at a price many shareholders thought too low. And the next year, BHE added Canadian power distribution company AltaLink at a discount.
BHE now serves 4.9 million retail customers, generates 29 gigawatts of power and transports 8.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day over 16,400 miles of regulated pipeline. It also controls power distribution companies in the United Kingdom. All revenues are regulated or locked in under long-term contracts.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Buffett commented that utilities were a ""good business"" but should never be a ""great"" one. That was a response to the short-lived growth rates many power companies were then posting. But the statement explains much about the timing of Berkshire’s utility acquisitions since.
Mainly, the company has arguably never overpaid. That discipline was demonstrated once again last year, when Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) outbid it for Oncor, the electricity distribution and transmission assets of the former Texas Utilities. The winner got a good price, but only because Berkshire refused to be drawn into protracted bidding that would have eliminated any valuation advantage of buying these assets out of bankruptcy.
Berkshire’s Texas bid and its participation at the past few Edison Electric Institute Financial Conferences, however, also demonstrate undimmed interest in ultimately buying more of this ""good"" business.
Part of that zeal is no doubt due to the utility sector’s decades-long focus on core competencies and strengthening balance sheets. That’s a stark contrast to the 1990s when managements did a lot of things Mr. Buffett didn’t like, from taking on new debt to mimicking Enron’s bravado about disrupting a century-old industry. And he’s well aware of the investment opportunity in American electricity’s ongoing shift away from coal.
High utility stock valuations are one deterrent to a new Berkshire shopping spree. The Dow Jones Utility Average sells for 20.6 times trailing 12 months earnings, the highest level since the late 2000 peak. And the most recent utility merger to close was Centerpoint Energy (NYSE: CNP) paying nearly 30 times earnings for Vectren, a utility with volatile construction operations and a low single digit growth rate.
IdaCorp Inc (NYSE: IDA) would seem to be an ideal addition for BHE. Customer growth of 2.3 percent was among the highest in the US last year. The regulatory environment is reliably positive and the hydro-focused fuel mix is very low cost. There’s also an opportunity to drive earnings higher by replacing aging coal facilities with a mix of solar, wind and natural gas, as Berkshire is doing elsewhere.
As for regulatory approval, BHE’s PacifiCorp unit already has extensive operations in Idaho that are contiguous to IdaCorp’s. That means experience dealing with key regulatory players in the state and a great case for cost synergies as well.
Idacorp, however, won’t go cheap selling at 22 times expected 2019 earnings, near its highest valuation in history. Moreover, if Berkshire’s goal is to buy a compatible, well-run company that would really move the profit meter for its power and gas utility business, Dominion Energy would be a far more attractive target.
Sure there’s some nuclear exposure. But the Virginia-based company has been reliably growing revenue in three of BHE’s key areas of interest: Regulated electric utilities, contracted natural gas pipelines and renewable energy, including solar and electric vehicles.
Buying would bring BHE to the Southeast US, an area where regulation has been every bit as positive as the Midwest and Rocky Mountain states, and customer growth faster. And there’s already overlapping territory as well, particularly in Utah where Dominion owns a gas distribution utility and pipelines.
This may be a bigger deal than Berkshire’s looking for now. But for investors, Dominion has the two essential qualities for any takeover bet. First, it operates high quality businesses that will reliably and robustly grow shareholder wealth without a takeover. Second, the stock trades at a marked discount to the typical utility.
Bottom line is investors are likely to win with Dominion, whether Berkshire bites or not. The same can’t be said for the couple dozen utilities that are already priced for high premium takeovers, and are therefore at risk to crashing and burning if they don’t happen."

According to Linkedin, the company has 30 employees with a growth rate on the employee count of 52% in the last 12 months. Sites like Owler estimate its revenue to be $3.4 million annually.
Chef Big Shake
Showcasing his famous shrimp burgers on Shark Tank didn’t land Chef Big Shake an offer. It did create a mountain of interest in his work and cooking. His episode of Shark Tank has now been aired 100 times. That turned into appearances on QVC, Martha Stewart Radio, Man Versus Food, CBS Sunday Mornings and Access Hollywood.
According to Mark Cuban , the company went from $200K to over $6 million in sales in one year alone. They have now three locations up and running. This company is one of Cuban‘s regrets from all the companies that pitched him on the show.
Ring
Known as ‘Doorbot’ when it appeared on Shark Tank. The Shark’s weren’t excited enough to make the founder an appealing enough offer to participate in this startup. It is now one of their biggest mistakes.
Ring has not only raised over $200 million from top-shelf investors like Richard Branson, DFJ Growth, Qualcomm, Kleiner Perkins, and Goldman Sachs, it was bought by Amazon for between $1 billion to $2 billion.
Founder Jamie is now appearing on Shark Tank as an investor himself.
Hammer & Nails
Hammer & Nails is the man cave where guys go to get groomed and pampered. Since getting turned down on the show, Hammer & Nails has become incredibly popular, with a growing franchise and prime locations from San Jose to Portland to Owings Mills, to Miami, Laguna Niguel, Hollywood, and Brooklyn.
Since the show aired, the founder raised the required $200K investment from angel investors and sold 183 franchise licenses . According to Linkedin, there are 20 employees supporting its day to day operation with 17 active locations.
Eco Nuts
Eco Nuts hit the Shark Tank with organic laundry detergent. Turned down for a 50% stake for $175,000, the brand which has expanded to a whole menu of conscious products is valued at close to $1 million. They’ve now been featured on Forbes, in the New York Time, MSNBC, Fox, USA Today, Huffington Post, CBS and Inc.
Xero Shoes
Despite already having over $800,000 in sales, the sharks turned down this startup on TV. That hasn’t stopped these founders. They’ve gone on to an estimated valuation of nearly $30 million. Xero now has a full range of boots, shoes and sandals and ship globally.
The company ended up raising $1 million via crowdfunding. They were projecting sales of $5.1 million in 2017 and $12.2 million in 2018.
Coffee Meets Bagel
The Kang sisters turned down Mark Cuban’s offer to buy the company for $30 million. They got no other offers. Since then Coffee Meets Bagel has raised $23 million across four funding rounds. Crunchbase reports that the dating startup has been growing at a rate of almost a quarter million downloads per month. According to Linkedin, the company has 65 employees.
Copa Di Vino
This startup’s founder appeared on Shark Tank twice. After the appearance on the show, sales skyrocketed from $500K to more than $12 million, and you’ve probably passed its iconic shaped packaging in one if the 13,000 plus retail locations it is featured at today. According to Linkedin, the company has 31 employees.
The current revenue of the company is estimated to be $67 million.
Bouqs
Premium flower delivery service Bouqs is known for its farm fresh, sustainable flowers. Since Shark Tank, it has raised $43 million, through a Series C round. The Tank’s Robert Herjavec has since participated alongside other notable VCs.
Owler estimates the company to be doing $38 million in annual revenue and according to Linkedin, they have 85 employees.
Proof Eyewear
Sustainable eyewear startup Proof has gone on to sell its expanding line since its appearance on Shark Tank. According to the Idaho Statesman , the startup is doing millions in sales and remains debt free.
After the episode aired, the company tripled its sales according to an interview with the founder. In 2016 they were projecting $1.6 million in sales with presence in 600 stores in the U.S. and 200 other stores across 200 countries.
5 Quick Takeaways from Life After Shark Tank
1. It Can Take a Lot of Rejections to Get Funded
Entrepreneurs shouldn’t take it hard that they are turned down by a tiny panel of investors like on these TV shows. Some of the best startups have had to cope with hundreds of investor rejections before raising millions and selling their companies for over a billion dollars. You just won't see that success unless you can walk from rejection to rejection without losing your confidence.
I have the pleasure of interviewing some of the most successful entrepreneurs on the DealMakers Podcast. I recently had the pleasure of interviewing Josh Hix from Plated. They appeared on the show and did receive an investment from Mark Cuban. However, Plated got over 200 investor rejections outside of the show before they were acquired for $300 million ( listen to the full podcast episode here ).
2. Many Startups do Just Fine without Outside Funding
The tips from the sharks and attention can be just as, if not far more valuable than the funding they could offer. There can be advantages to raising money. Some types of ventures really need it. Racing to scale and being able to buy up market share can make all the difference. Yet, sooner or later businesses do need to be profitable. That can actually be a lot easier if you have a profitable business model early on. Then you can choose to bootstrap of have the ability to negotiate funding terms from a power position.
3. It Is All About Storytelling
The entrepreneurs that end up receiving funding are those that have been able to master the art of storytelling so that investors get it. This is mainly done by having a pitch deck that captures the essence of the business and where things are heading. For a winning deck, take a look at the pitch deck template created by Silicon Valley legend, Peter Thiel ( see it here ) that I recently covered. Thiel was the first angel investor in Facebook with a $500K check that turned into more than $1 billion in cash. Moreover, I also provided a commentary on a pitch deck from an Uber competitor that has raised over $400M ( see it here ).
4. Not Everyone Will See the Opportunity
Not even super smart, very experienced investors with influence over the outcome will always see the opportunity and value. That doesn’t mean it is a bad business or idea. Keep going.
5. There is No Such Thing as Bad Press
There can be really bad press which can be expensive for brands to fix. Yet, the vast majority of the time, even things like being slammed on Shark Tank aren’t nearly as damaging as you think. There are two things which startups need the most - visibility and credibility. So, it’s worth putting yourself out there, even if it’s uncomfortable and you don’t know what reception you’ll get.
Of course, there are great benefits of getting funded on TV shows like Shark Tank. Yet, funded on TV or not, there are plenty of perks from this type of visibility and validation.

This Educator Made A Documentary About Teachers Turning Toward Entrepreneurship,www.forbes.com,Robyn D. Shulman,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robynshulman/2019/04/20/this-educator-made-a-documentary-about-teachers-turning-toward-entrepreneurship/,"More teachers are building side hustles today than any other time in history. With the gig economy and lack of enough financial means to pay their bills, many educators are renting out their homes for Airbnb, driving for Uber or Lyft and taking on second jobs. Also, many teachers are taking a chance and moving into the world of entrepreneurship. National attention covering the trickling down effect of teachers' salaries across the nation couldn’t come at a more critical time.
According to a paper by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), shared on NEA Today , public school educators are paid less than comparable workers, and this gap has reached an all-time high.
And, when you adjust this salary for inflation, researchers found that teachers, compared to other college graduates, are paid nearly $350 less per week.
Working in education
I've worked in education for many years. I know how challenging it can be to make ends meet, and I've seen teachers leave the classroom after only one year of teaching. Many educators leave the profession for financial reasons, stress, school violence, never-ending work, and a lack of administrative support. It can be difficult to move from the classroom into the corporate world or to find the financial support teachers need when building a business.
However, many teachers are changing their paths and moving into entrepreneurship, or what many call ""edupreneurship.""
Teachers as entrepreneurs
I had a chance to chat with Dr. Will Deyamport III, who recently created a film about this topic. The documentary is entitled The Edupreneur.
In this interview, which has been edited and condensed, we talk about the documentary, the reasons behind the film, and how we can remove the stigma surrounding educators who make money outside of the classroom.
Robyn Shulman: What is your definition of an edupreneur?
Dr. Will Deyamport III : An edupreneur is an educator who doesn't focus on the transaction of trading goods and services solely for monetary gain.
However, these educators focus on the transformation and the impact their work has on teachers and students.
Shulman: Can you tell me about your background in education and your work?
Deyamport III: I am not a traditionally trained K-12 classroom teacher. I left undergrad as a Provisionally Certified Family Life Educator. As a result, I’ve developed a transformation-based approach to working with teachers in reimagining the learning experiences of their students.
Shulman: What do you do?
Deyamport III: I make it a point to coach up teachers so they get clear a vision on what they do best, what they want to accomplish, and how a specific tool or software program can be implemented to ignite student learning.
Currently, I am an Instructional Technologist with a K-12 school district. I am also a part-time educational consultant, podcaster, webinar host, and I have written for Schoology Exchange , TechEdge magazine , EdSurge , iNACOL , and District Administration Magazine .
You can now add a documentary filmmaker to what I do.
Shulman: Can you tell me about the movie?
Deyamport III: The Edupreneur is a documentary film that takes you on a journey into the successes and challenges of some of the most recognized names in K-12 education consulting. The interviews feature eight edupreneurs who discuss their lives and careers as educators and entrepreneurs.
Shulman: Why did you make the documentary?
Deyamport III: I had to make this documentary. It was the story that had to be told. There are still so many teachers who give so much of themselves, their time, and content away for free.
Many teachers are also committed to edtech companies as ambassadors, and provide their content as well as their expertise. They don’t get paid for their work.
Various teachers write books, present at conferences, and deliver courses with the mission to positively impact the lives of kids.
Shulman: What would you like to tell those who don't believe teachers should get paid for their work outside of the classroom?
Deyamport III: For those educators who think we shouldn’t sell lesson plans or be compensated for our genius, I want them to know that they can both monetize their skillset and be in alignment with why they chose to become a teacher. I want our colleagues to know that making money from our talent isn’t a bad thing or a betrayal.
Shulman: Who is the intended audience for the documentary?
Deyamport III: This movie is for any educator who is curious about becoming a consultant or building a business. The film is also for educators who have written books and haven’t seen any traction. It is also meant for teachers who have just started their journey into edupreneurship.
Shulman: What is the goal of the movie?
Deyamport III: The goal of the film is to encourage more educators to become edupreneurs. I hope this documentary sparks a meaningful conversation on what it means to be an edupreneur. I want teachers to get comfortable with the idea of monetizing their talents. I want teachers to hear from those in the game, and to learn from others who devote their lives to improving the lives of students.
Shulman: And, most importantly?
Deyamport III: They can make money and still do work that aligns with why they became a teacher.
Also, I want the audience to understand the work that it takes to be a consistently paid consultant. This documentary can give new edupreneurs the information they need, and the push to get started.
Shulman: There seems to be a stigma around getting paid for one’s work when you're in education. Why do you think this is the case? How can we change this thought-process?
Deyamport III: I believe the corporatization of public education and the influence of wealthy outsiders have left a bad taste. There’s so much money coming in and various people who tout the next big fix for public education.
However, nobody is listening to teachers in the classroom.
Shulman: Where is the disconnect?
Deyamport III: We’re a giving group of individuals who continuously share lesson plans, resources, and consumables with other educators all of the time. It’s in our nature to seek to be of assistance without seeking a monetary reward. Nobody becomes an educator, on any level, looking to get rich.
Shulman: Do you think a teacher's mindset is creating a barrier to entrepreneurship?
Deyamport III: Yes, I believe this mindset is a significant contributor when it comes to teachers making money. Colleagues are turned off by the idea of fellow educators selling content or delivering services for pay.
Shulman: How can we change this narrative?
Deyamport III: We’re not going to change the minds of those educators who are against teachers becoming educational consultants or entrepreneurs. I always say that you can’t sell water to someone who isn’t thirsty. That said, there has to be a conversation happening around the mindset of what money is and the purpose of it. Also, we need to open people’s eyes to the reality that we all have contributions to make in educating our children.
For some of us, we create our most significant contributions outside of the school system.
Shulman: Can you tell me about the edupreneurs in the movie? What do they do?
Deyamport III: Yes, the movie focuses on the lives of different educators and entrepreneurs. Below is a list of those who participated in the film.
Angela Maiers is a public speaker and the Founder of Choose2Matter, which has evolved into a movement that supports parents, educators, and employees around the world. Maiers shares her story to uplift, inspire, and encourage others to embrace the greatness that is within themselves. Her work focuses on the genius in all of us.
Tom Murray is a best-selling author, speaker, and the Director of Innovation for Future Ready Schools. Murray is a former school administrator whose work as an edupreneur focuses on creating a new paradigm for teaching, learning, and leadership.
Abbey Futrell is an Assistant Superintendent and speaker. Her experience as a teacher and administrator shows through her speaking engagements and workshops. She talks about how technology can be the catalyst to reinvigorate teaching and learning.
Catlin Tucker is a best-selling author, blogger, and keynote speaker. She is also a Blended Learning Coach, international trainer and educational consultant. She is the go-to practitioner for blended learning. Her work focuses on shifting how we think about student agency and teaching and learning through the lens of blended learning.
Dr. Ai Zhang is a professor, speaker, and host of the Facebook Live show, Classroom Without Walls . Her show boasts some of the world’s authorities as it relates to digital marketing, personal branding, and using technology to expand what is possible with teaching and learning. Dr. Ai also teaches PR courses at a university.
Dr. Robyn Jackson is an author, speaker, and the Founder and CEO of Mindsteps, Inc. She is a former administrator who has built a business that supports school leaders and instructional coaches in raising rigor in classroom instruction. Dr. Jackson also provides actionable steps regarding how school leaders can assist teachers in becoming master teachers.
Eric Sheninger is an author, speaker, blogger, and a Senior Fellow at The International Center for Leadership in Education (ICLE). Eric is a former school administrator who has written six books and is a sought after speaker. His work focuses on digital leadership and transformation. He answers the question: How do we lead and learn in a digital age?
Jeff Bradbury is a podcaster, blogger, speaker, and educational consultant. He works with teachers in understanding the power of podcasting in the classroom. He also works with teachers on how they can develop their personal brands.
Shulman: Each edupreneur gave different pieces of advice. What advice stood out to you as highly relevant to those who want to get into the entrepreneurship world and why?
Deyamport III: Dr. Ai talked about how taking action gave her clarity and confidence. This topic resonates with me because many people put off doing something because they are waiting for the right time, the right equipment or the right situation. The only way to see if something is going to work is to do it.
Dr. Jackson talked about the need for edupreneurs to create their own businesses. This initiative is crucial because we need more information readily available for those educators who want to become edupreneurs.
Catlin Tucker talked about being authentic and sticking to her lane. It’s important for her work to have meaning while she must remain true to herself first.
This idea is critical because a lot of people try to do too much. Niching down isn’t giving something up. In fact, it’s going to open up many doors.
Shulman: Where are most educators learning how to build businesses?
Deyamport III: Currently, the majority of us are getting our information on best practices from business leaders and entrepreneurs outside of public education. However, they don’t know our industry, curriculum and development, or the nuances of being a classroom teacher.
We need a language of creating, conducting, and growing a business by educators for educators.
Shulman: What was your favorite part about making the movie?
Deyamport III: I was able to interview some amazing educators who shared personal details about themselves, their work, and the struggles they have balancing work and family. I feel privileged because they felt comfortable enough with me to be open and honest. It was truly energizing and inspiring to engage the participants in a topic that is so taboo for many of our colleagues.
Shulman: What are some of the most critical lessons you learned while putting the movie together?
Deyamport III: Here are my top lessons:
Find your lane and work it. I have been advised for years to write. For example, as much as I write articles for edtech publications, I know I don’t have a book in me. Find your passion. Video and podcasting work for me. I am happy to have the opportunity to interview others and to share their insights with my audience. Partner with people you believe in and who believe in you. For example, Dr. Sarah Thomas, Founder and CEO of EduMatch and EduMatch Publishing believed in me enough to work with me on this project. The work never stops. Now that the documentary is out, we are continually working on marketing the documentary. Putting out your book, your course, or workbook is the beginning. There’s so much work to do to get your product in the hands of paying consumers. Shulman: If you could share some words of wisdom regarding the concept of edupreneurship, what three things would you tell other teachers who might want to build a business?
Deyamport III: I would share the following information with other educators:
Pick a niche to carve out- a space for you to own. Don’t try to be everything to everyone. Know what you do well and what you want to accomplish with the work. Learn the business side of running a business. There’s so much to learn when it comes to business-incorporation, taxes, bookkeeping, marketing, invoicing, contracts, generating leads, personal branding, and building a sustainable business model. Don’t chase the money. Getting paid is essential, but you have to get in the game for the right reasons. For me, the right reason should be the transformation you would like to see within schools. Shulman: Where can we watch the documentary and follow your work?
Deyamport III: The documentary is now live on Vimeo . The documentary is informative and gives viewers the real scoop into what it takes to be a successful edupreneur. If you’re having serious thoughts about monetizing your talents, watching The Edupreneur is a significant first step in you pursuing edupreneurship.
Shulman: And, where can we follow your work?
Deyamport III: I am on Twitter as @iamDrWill and you can listen to my podcast, The Dr. Will Show Podcast, at Simplecast or on iTunes ."

Here's How I'm Investing In Tech (Hint: It's Not Google),www.forbes.com,Michael Foster,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2019/04/20/heres-how-im-investing-in-tech-hint-its-not-google/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Investing I write on high yield assets that deliver a reliable income stream. Share to facebook Share to linkedin Getty If you’re watching tech stocks grind higher every day, you’ve probably been just a little tempted to jump in.
… or should you wait? After all, the high-flying tech space—particularly fan faves like Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL) , a.k.a. Alphabet—has to pull back sometime, right?
The short answer is yes, there are plenty more gains ahead for tech—especially if you’re investing over the long haul—making now a great time to buy.
A 9% Dividend From Google (for real)
But we’re not going to “buy direct” and hope for more upside, like your S&P 500-focused friends are likely doing. Instead we’re going to sign up for nearly 9% in cash upfront, through two little-known tech funds that both pay massive dividends today.
And while we’re enjoying those sturdy payouts, we’ll be lined up for big gains as FAANG roars higher.
We’ll do it through two closed-end funds (CEFs) that invest in every FAANG stock. These two funds have fallen under the radar, but their big tech holdings (and one particularly crafty management team) are what’s driving those massive 8.8% dividends.
Let’s move on to our first FAANG income play now.
FAANG Dividend Pick No. 1
Our first CEF is the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities Fund (ETV) , whose 8.8% yield is just part of the story. ETV has pretty much matched the S&P 500’s return since its inception, but thanks to its massive dividend (which crushes the pathetic 1.8% yield on the average S&P 500 stock), investors got a big slice of this profit in cash!
ETV doesn’t depend just on FAANG to fund its payouts, though. Its tech-heavy portfolio also has some healthcare and big-cap consumer names to add some diversification
Here’s another plus of investing in ETV: the fund’s management sells call options on the portfolio, which both generates extra income for investors (fueling that big payout) and delivers some downside protection for the share price. The fund’s long-term track record—matching the market while fending off downturn after downturn—proves it.
Because of ETV’s strong track record, the fund typically trades at a premium to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio), and its premium has been climbing higher recently as more and more investors buy into this high-yielding tech fund.
FAANG Dividend Pick No. 2
Our other fund with FAANG holdings is the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Strategy Fund (EXD) , which also yields 8.8% and has a very similar portfolio—but it’s much more focused on FAANG
With EXD, you’re getting 42.7% of the fund in FAANG stocks, making it a more confident bet on FAANG’s future. Plus, EXD is trading at a 7.3% discount to NAV, which makes this fund an incredible steal—you can actually get FAANG stocks for less than you’d get if you bought them outright on the market.
Market Ignores This Massive Shift—for Now
There’s a reason for that discount, though—EXD doesn’t have much of a track record. While its long-term return is a pitiful 9% total since its 2010 inception, that doesn’t bother me. EXD has two new managers, Michael Allison and Thomas Seto, who just took up the reins this year. They have aggressively changed the fund’s portfolio and are clearly looking to revamp the fund after years of crummy underperformance.
EXD’s past has nothing to do with its future, and that’s something investors aren’t paying enough attention to.
In February, Eaton Vance announced that the fund will invest in S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 stocks as management sees appropriate. This is a complete change from its former focus on short-term bonds, which the fund has completely abandoned as a strategy.
If you still aren’t sure, this should clinch it: Allison and Seto are the fund managers who have been managing ETV for years, giving it the big income stream and market-matching returns we just looked at above. It’s only a matter of time before they work the same dividend magic on EXD.

Oak & Eden: A Craft Producer Pushs The Boundaries Of Whiskey Innovation,www.forbes.com,Joseph V Micallef,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2019/04/20/oak-eden-a-craft-producer-pushs-the-boundaries-of-whiskey-innovation/,"Finishing refers to the practice of maturing a spirit, for short periods of time, in a cask that previously held other liquids. The process allows whiskey makers to add additional layers of flavor to a whiskey. The practice started with the Scotch whisky industry. The technique has become quite common in Scotland and is being adopted by other whiskey producers around the world. It has even been used by other spirit producers, ranging from rum to brandy to tequila. The US whiskey industry was late in adopting this practice but has now accepted it enthusiastically. In addition, the US spirits industry has also experimented with ways of enhancing particular flavor profiles by using different toasting techniques on the barrels. Maker’s Mark and the Independent Stave Company, in particular, have led the way in experimenting with different toasting methods and the use of additional staves in a barrel and assessing their impact on flavor.
Enter the Sanctified Spirits Company, a Texas based startup, which is experimenting with putting a spiral of wood in each bottle of its bourbon and rye whiskey. Normally, the finishing of a spirit occurs prior to bottling. Once a spirit is bottled it remains static. In reality, a spirit will change over time, even if it is bottled in glass, but the changes are so small and take such a long time to manifest themselves that for all practical purposes it is unchanging.
The company uses spirals made from American white oak, but has also experimented with spirals made from different kinds of wood, including maple, French oak, cherry or ash. The spiral, called a spire, is approximately five inches long. The tight spiral offers a large surface area for the whiskey to interact with the wood. According to Joseph (Joe) Giildenzopf, the company’s CEO and co-founder, the effect of the spire is exhausted after six weeks or so in a bottle.
Sanctified Spirits whiskey and rye are bottled under the Oak & Eden brand. To date, four expressions have been released. A bourbon that is bottled with a toasted oak spire. A rye that is bottled with a charred oak spire and another rye, termed Rye and Rumba, which is bottled with a spire that has been soaked in rum. A fourth recently released expression, Bourbon and Vine, is a bourbon that is bottled with a spire made from French oak that has been soaked in Cabernet Sauvignon produced from Texas grown grapes. Is this a legitimate innovation or a marketing gimmick?
First of all, both the bourbon and the rye began as conventional spirits. According to Giildenzopf the company sources most of its spirit from MGP in Indiana. The bourbon is produced from a mash bill of 60% corn, 36% rye and 4% malted barley, while the rye is produced from a mash bill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley. Once distilled the new make spirit, or white dog, is matured for approximately two years in barrels of #3 charred American white oak.
Per Giildenzopf:
Our business plan is quite simple. We curate, blend, finish and sell exceptional whiskey. We are sourcing, or as we proudly say, “curating.” We purchase our whiskeys from their native states of distillation. Most is coming from MGP in Indiana, but not all. We move barreled whiskey from Indiana (and other native sources) once the whiskey has reached full age, and not before. We only move it when we are ready to bottle it. We do not age whiskey in Texas. We have found the environment to be too extreme and difficult to manage.
How do we assess the impact of the spire on the whiskey in the bottle? According to Giildenzopf:
We are not introducing a wood-spirit interaction without intention. On the contrary. We are intentionally introducing wood to whiskey with the complete and full intent to produce change. Change for the better. We stand behind our products, our process and the outcome produced. Finally, the long-term effect of making the whiskey smoother over time is not accidental, but intentional.
Since the influence of the spire is exhausted after six weeks, does the spire provide an additional six weeks of maturation in addition to further flavoring the whiskey? The trick is how to translate this into conventional maturation. One way is to look at the ratio of the surface area of the wood to the amount of liquid being matured. It has long been recognized that the higher the ratio of wood to spirit, the faster the whiskey will mature, and the more flavor will be extracted from the wood. Whiskey matured in a conventional bourbon barrel of 53 gallons/200 liters will mature slower than whiskey aged in a 10 gallon/35-liter cask.
The Spire Used To Impart More Flavor to Whisky in a Bottle
Photo, courtesy Sanctified Spirits A 53-gallon barrel of whiskey holds approximately 200,000 ml of spirit. The surface area of the inside of the barrel is 6,535 square inches. That means the ratio of wood to spirit is 30 ml for each square inch of wood. I estimate that the spire has a surface area of approximately 38 square inches. In a 750-ml bottle that works out to about 20 ml of spirit for each square inch of wood surface area. That’s roughly the same ratio that you would get from maturing whiskey in a 10-gallon barrel. So, one way of looking at this process would be to say that from a maturation standpoint, it has the same impact on the maturing whiskey as giving it an additional six weeks of aging in a 10-gallon cask.
Of course, the comparison isn’t an exact one. Whiskey maturing in a cask is undergoing four separate processes. Compounds are being extracted from the wood. Liquid is evaporating, changing the proportions of water and alcohol and disproportionately concentrating certain congeners or flavoring compounds while dissipating others. Oxygen is seeping into the barrel and reacting with some of the compounds in the whiskey, both existing ones and new ones that have been extracted from the wood. In addition, there may be chemical reactions occurring between compounds in the whiskey that may create new congeners.
Presumably in a sealed bottle you are not getting any evaporation nor are you getting oxygen seeping in and oxidizing some of the compounds in the whiskey, so the comparison is not exactly the same as additional cask aging. You are, however, getting additional extraction from the wood spire and you may be getting additional reactions between some of the compounds in the whiskey. Moreover, the spire continues to have an effect on the smoothness of the whiskey even after the flavoring components are exhausted.
It’s hard to model. Maturation is more of an art than a science. We are not entirely sure of what reactions take place in a maturing whiskey and what catalyzes them. The spire does offer one significant advantage, however. It is a lot easier to make a spire out of a piece of exotic wood than it is to fashion a 10-gallon barrel out of it. In that case, the spire is an important innovation in finishing whiskey. The fact that it also has an impact on maturation is a bonus.
Joseph (Joe) Giildenzopf, Sanctified Spirits' CEO and co-founder
Photo, courtesy Sanctified Spirits More importantly, is there a difference in the flavor and aroma profile of Oak & Eden’s whiskeys before and after they have been treated with the spire? Sanctified Spirit graciously sent me samples of their whiskey both before and after they had been treated with the oak spire in order to allow me to make a comparison. The tasting notes and conclusions are below.
Oak & Eden, Bourbon & Spire, Toasted Oak, 45% ABV, 750 ml, $40
The color is a medium amber. On the nose, there are sweet honey notes, along with vanilla some wood spice and a little caramel. It has the cooked corn sweetness typical of a bourbon and the cinnamon and nutmeg spice contributed by the rye. On the palate, it is smooth, at least for a two-year-old bourbon, with notes of sweet caramel accompanied by some dried fruit notes and toasted oak. The finish is long, with a bit of alcohol burn and some bitter notes that nicely complement the lingering sweetness.
The bourbon sample that did not receive the spire is lighter in color. On the nose, the aroma seems less intense and the alcohol is more noticeable. On the palate, the whiskey appears less flavorful, the alcohol burn more pronounced and the finish is shorter.
Oak & Eden, Rye & Spire, Charred Oak, 45% ABV, 750 ml, $40
The color is a bright amber with flecks of gold. On the nose, there is a distinctive cinnamon note, some dried floral aromas and a bit of a waxy element, along with a hint of caramel. On the palate, the whiskey is smooth, with creamy caramel notes, along with some cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg. There is a bit of alcohol burn. The finish is medium to long, with a lingering sweetness and a bitter note that fades quickly.
The rye sample that did not receive the spire was lighter in color. The aroma was less pronounced. While the wood spices were still evident, the sample was a little more herbaceous. There was also a pronounced black pepper aroma as the whiskey opened up. On the palate, it was flavorful, although less so than the spire treated sample, sweet with a medium length finish and just a hint of bitterness at the end accompanied by a lingering sweetness. Here too, the alcohol burn was more pronounced.
Oak & Eden, Rye & Rumba, Rum Soaked Oak, 45% ABV, 750 ml, $50
The color is a light gold. On the nose, there are sweet honey notes accompanied by hints of tropical fruit, vanilla and a bit of oak. On the palate, there is a notable candied sweetness, along with caramel and dried stone and tropical, fruit notes and vanilla. The finish is medium length, accompanied by a noticeable pepperiness that builds quickly then fades, some slight bitter notes and a lingering sweetness.
The sample that did not receive the spire was, surprisingly, darker. On the nose, it was less aromatic and a little more herbaceous, although it still had a distinctive sweet honey note. On the palate, it was less smooth, with a more noticeable alcohol burn and a shorter finish, although it still exhibited a lingering sweetness and the pepperiness was more persistent.
So, legitimate innovation or marketing gimmick? There is no question that the untreated whiskeys are different than the ones that were treated with a spire. The treated or “spire finished” whiskeys were noticeably smoother and more flavorful. Giildenzopf stresses that the intent of the company is to use the spire to impart more flavor to the whiskey and not as a substitute or as a proxy for additional aging. That may be true, and the spire certainly adds more flavor, but an unintended consequence is that it also mimics the effects of additional aging. Anytime you have wood to spirit interactions you are mimicking the effects of additional maturation even if that is not the producer’s intention.
Moreover, as Giildenzopf notes, even though the flavoring element in the wood is exhausted after six weeks, the spire continues to have an effect on the spirit in the bottle making it smoother with the passage of time.
I think this is a legitimate innovation and one to get excited about, even though I’m not usually the excitable type. As a finishing technique, the spire offers a lot more flexibility for finishing whiskeys and dramatically expands the options for different finishes beyond the usual approach of barrels that previously held another liquid.
It also begs the question of whether the company should sell spires independently of its whiskey. After all, you may have a favorite bourbon or rye that might benefit from the “spire treatment.” Additionally, should the company package additional spires with its whiskeys to allow its customers to make the whiskeys even smoother or flavorful and to shape the whiskeys to their tastes?
I intend to revisit these whiskeys in six months and see if and how they have changed. So, stay tuned. In the meantime, if you are intrigued by this innovation, and it is certainly that, then go out and get a bottle of one or two expressions and see for yourself.

'Destiny 2' Players Are Not Going To Want To Hear That These Exotics Should Be Nerfed,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/20/destiny-2-players-are-not-going-to-want-to-hear-that-these-exotics-should-be-nerfed/,"Oh god what have I done? I put “Destiny” and “nerf” in the same headline without a “don’t” or “shouldn’t.” I know I’m asking for trouble, but The Revelry paired with me finally farming The Reckoning in earnest has put this in perspective. I think there are a number of exotics that need to be nerfed in Destiny 2 . Not really nerfed, even, but fundamentally changed. There is a class of exotic armor that is almost always dramatically outperforming everything else, so much so that entire activities hinge around these items to the point where you feel like you can rarely run anything as an alternative.
I’m talking about exotics that return super to you…while using super.
There are a number of these in the game, some old, some new, some recently buffed. Right now, we have:
Skull of Dire Ahamkara (Warlock) – Returns super on Nova Bomb kills Phoenix Protocol (Warlock) – Return super on kills and assists inside Well of Radiance Orpheus Rigs (Hunter) – Returns super on Nightstalker tether with larger enemies counting for more Shards of Galanor (Hunter) – Returns super on kills and hits with Blade Barrage
Destiny 2
Bungie Shards was recently nerfed a little bit to offer more super return on boss hits rather than mass kills, but that’s about it. Skull is easily the worst offender as you can blow through waves of any enemies in any PvE activity, and also Gambit, while auto-recharging your super almost every time, or at least getting it 80-90% of the way barring a total biff. Orpheus has been mandatory in activities like EP and most raids for a while now, and now that’s true in the Verdant Forest and The Reckoning as well. Phoenix Protocol was a must back when Blind Well was actually hard, and now for the The Reckoning it’s essential.
I fundamentally do not think this is good exotic design because it actually reduces the overall fun of the game, as it limits the scope of certain activities and hampers build creativity because often in PvE, using anything other than these is “suboptimal,” and the exotic super regen alone can be the difference between victory and defeat whether you’re pushing for high wave clears of the Forest or trying to get past the Reckoning Bridge or attempting to clear waves in Escalation Protocol.
I prefer the idea of exotics that are strong without designing them to be constantly refilling themselves. It is just goofy that I can throw five Nova Bombs in a row with minimal effort depending on the activity. No other super or exotic can compete with that. No group of enemies can withstand that. It’s just not good design.
I think you can make strong exotics without causing them to be absolutely mandatory because of the instant-super regen. Off the top of my head, changes to these four would include:
Skull of Dire Ahamkara (Warlock) – Doubles the amount of void projectiles in Nova Bomb Phoenix Protocol (Warlock) – Severely burns and weakens enemies inside Orpheus Rigs (Hunter) – Doubles the radius of tether and can tether through walls Shards of Galanor (Hunter) – Blade Barrage now throws out knives in a complete circle
Destiny 2
Bungie Stuff that’s strong but is not just “using this super gets you more super.” I don’t think that’s good. There’s a difference between this kind of super and something like Crown of Tempests or Doom Fang Pauldron that asks you to kill enemies to extend your super, rather than just getting it all back instantly, which I would say is a strong, but not broken concept.
I would prefer to see these exotics changed into something else entire to mix up the metagame rather than just nerfed to give back less super more often like we’ve seen with Shards. Again, I know calling for any nerfs or changes to popular items is enough to get the Destiny hornet’s nest buzzing, but I am tired of these few items dominating so many PvE activities because their base concept is so irresistible and useful. I think other exotics should be buffed too to make them more attractive, sure, but “unlimited supers” is fundamentally just a bad concept and should be saved for things like Mayhem.

Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' Lifts To No. 1 In The U.K.,www.forbes.com,Hugh McIntyre,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/04/20/lil-nas-xs-old-town-road-lifts-to-no-1-in-the-u-k/,"After vaulting up the singles ranking last week and missing the throne by just one spot , rising hip-hop talent Lil Nas X finally claims the highest spot on the U.K. songs chart with his breakout smash. The musician’s unmissable single “Old Town Road” steps up just one spot on the U.K. chart, becoming the latest No. 1 hit in the country. Incredibly, the song has only spent three frames inside the top 40, as it went from No. 39 to No. 2 to No. 1, completing one of the fastest climbs to the top for a song that didn’t debut within the top 10. This week, the cut moved 80,000 equivalent units in the U.K., which was easily enough to give it the coveted title.
“Old Town Road” benefits from viral success, intense media coverage, as well as a high-profile remix that features American country musician Billy Ray Cyrus, who stepped in and helped take the tune to another level.
While he hasn’t announced anything yet, it’s assumed that “Old Town Road” will serve as the lead single from Lil Nas X’s debut full-length, which he is likely working on now, especially since the cut has become an international phenomenon.
“Old Town Road” finally ends the lengthy run at the top of Lewis Capaldi’s “Someone You Loved,” which ruled the singles listing for seven consecutive turns. During that time, it blocked a handful of popular songs from earning a spin at No. 1, including Calvin Harris and Rag’N’Bone Man’s “Giant” and Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy.”

A Customer Experience Lesson Learned From Supporting A Team At The Lower End Of The Premier League,www.forbes.com,Adrian Swinscoe,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianswinscoe/2019/04/20/a-customer-experience-lesson-learned-from-supporting-a-team-at-the-lower-end-of-the-premier-league/,"I’m a fan of Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club and, currently, we are playing our second season in the English Premier League (EPL) , one of the most competitive football (soccer) leagues in the world. This season started pretty well and, at the end of December, we were in a good position to comfortably secure another season in the Premier League.
However, since then, we have experienced a slump in form and have seen ourselves edge closer and closer to the relegation places towards the bottom end of the league.
Brighton and Hove football stadium with poppies in foreground
Getty This situation has become even more acute in the last couple of weeks as we have lost a couple of crucial games at home and those defeats have really put us on the brink of relegation.
But, let me be clear: I know who we are.
I don’t have delusions of grandeur about my team. I know that we are scrappers and not in the league of teams like Liverpool or Man City etc.
The thing that has been the most galling about the last two home defeats, however, was the manner of our defeats.
We were beaten without even uttering a whimper of protest on the playing field. We were beaten by teams that we should be competing and winning against.
During those games we seemed to be devoid of ideas, heart, passion, responsibility and commitment. When put under pressure we seemed to suffer a crisis of confidence and we just capitulated.
As a fan, that is just not acceptable. Every fan that I have spoken to would like to see us show, at the very minimum, some fight and, if we are to go down, then we would rather go down fighting and, thus, with a bit of pride.
The reality is is that this is the rollercoaster of what it means to be a fan of a smaller team in a top league.
Personally, I hope we turn it around in the next few games and we survive for another season in the Premier League.
But, despite my travails as an Albion fan, I believe, there is a lesson here for all companies trying to deliver a great experience for their customers.
When people make choices about brands or companies to do business with they don’t always choose the biggest and the best.
People make choices for many different reasons. They choose based on price, quality, location, size, fit, identity, values, approach etc etc.
Whoever they choose and for whatever reason, fans or customers want to see their chosen brand and team fight for their patronage, fight for themselves, fight to be the best that they can be.
This is particularly true when things go wrong or don’t go as planned.
But, it is this fight that we show when things do go wrong that goes a long way towards earning our trust and our loyalty."
"If You're Traveling Somewhere, You Might Need This Before You Go",www.forbes.com,Christopher Elliott,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2019/04/20/visitors-insurance-traveling-before-you-go/,"The soaring cost of medical care in the United States has created an emerging cottage industry for visitors insurance. Whether you're traveling to America -- or to any country with high healthcare costs -- you might need this relatively new type of coverage. The average American spends $10,348 per year on healthcare, according to the latest numbers from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services . That's $3.3 trillion a year, or about 18% of the Gross Domestic Product. Only Switzerland and Norway come close to that kind of spending .
Understandably, visitors to the United States are shocked when they visit a doctor or hospital. A visit to the emergency room could push them into bankruptcy.
Getty
Getty ""Simply put, visitors insurance is another name for travel medical insurance,"" says Rajeev Shrivastava, CEO of VisitorsCoverage , an Insurtech company that sells travel insurance. ""The term is most commonly used for visitors traveling to the United States who need medical coverage in the event of a medical emergency.""
But the term ""visitors insurance"" can also apply more generally to anyone traveling abroad. So if you're headed to Europe this summer, you might be asking yourself what visitors insurance is and whether you need it. And if you do, where should you buy your coverage?
The two types of visitors coverage
""Visitors insurance typically includes travel medical plans which focus on protection for medical expenses that could occur while traveling in the U.S, due to the fact that medical care in the U.S. is often expensive compared to other countries throughout the world,"" explains Justin Tysdal, CEO of Seven Corners , a travel insurance site that sells visitors insurance.
Visitors coverage comes in two flavors. The first is scheduled benefit plan, which typically costs less up front but requires that you absorb more of the medical expense cost later if you need to claim. A scheduled benefit plan places a cap on for each service you may need.
""For example, if you were charged $100 for a physician visit, and the plan contained a $65 limit per visit, then the most the plan would pay is $65, and you would be responsible for the remaining $35 if you had already met your deductible and paid your coinsurance if applicable,"" explains Tysdal.
The second type of visitors coverage is the comprehensive plan, which doesn't contain fixed payment limits for each type of medical treatment. Instead, you select a medical maximum amount of coverage, and any covered expenses are paid out of that amount after you have paid your deductible and any coinsurance. Many comprehensive plans have a provider network that travelers can use to locate doctors and medical facilities close to their location. That’s another reason comprehensive plans are becoming more popular.
By the way, if you're visiting the U.S. from abroad and considering a comprehensive plan, you need to select the option for travel including the United States when you request a quote. Pricing is typically a little higher for coverage in the U.S. than outside the country. You don't need visitors insurance if you live in the United States and are traveling domestically.
Do you need visitors insurance?
If you think you don't need visitors insurance, think again. As I noted earlier, the term ""visitors insurance"" doesn't just apply to international visitors coming to America. It's for anyone making an international trip. In other words, if you're headed somewhere out of the country for vacation, maybe you should consider visitors insurance.
""Visitors insurance is always recommended for international travel,"" says Shrivastava of VisitorsCoverage.com.
Indeed, some countries such as Cuba and the Schengen region -- the 26 European states that have officially abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their borders -- require certain citizens to have a visitors insurance policy to gain entry.
So how do you know if you need visitors insurance?
Just in case. When you are traveling to another country, there are always uncertainties. You'll want to be protected against any unforeseen medical emergencies that may occur during your travels. If your trip needs to be insured. Just as every traveler is unique, so is every international trip. It is important to research your destination before you travel and take into account any risks that may be associated with the location or your planned activities while you are abroad. When you're visiting a country where medical costs are high. America has some of the highest medical costs in the world, so visitors to the U.S. would want to make sure their policy included a high policy maximum. VisitorsCoverage.com recommends coverage of as much as $2 million or more. But if you are traveling to a country where medical costs aren’t as high, you likely won’t need as high a policy maximum. U.S. citizens on Medicare. With very few exceptions, Medicare provides zero coverage outside the U.S. Run your risk assessment. For example, if you're traveling to Africa for a safari, there are health risks such as malaria. Safaris often take place in remote areas, so you may need coverage for medical evacuation. If you're participating in a high-risk activity, you may need extra coverage in case you're injured. That can all add up to the need for visitors coverage.
Where to buy visitors insurance
You can buy visitors insurance from several reputable sources. They include:
Directly from a specialist. You can purchase a policy directly from companies such as VisitorsCoverage , which specializes in selling policies to U.S. immigrants and visitors. Other visitors insurance companies include G1G , INF Visitor Care , and InsuBuy .
By shopping on an insurance site. Travel insurance sites such as Seven Corners and Squaremouth sell a variety of policies, both for visitors to the U.S. and for Americans going overseas.
Through your travel agent. A trusted travel advisor is always a good person to consult before a trip. Often agents know the best policies and can advise you on what kinds of coverage you need -- and don't need. To find a good agent, check out the agent finder on the American Society of Travel Advisors' site.
But do you really need visitors coverage?
Whether you're headed to the United States or leaving, you might still be wondering whether visitors insurance is right for you. Maybe you checked out one of the sites and thought the price of coverage was too high. Or maybe you read the list of reasons for buying insurance and said to yourself, ""It'll never happen to me.""
My consumer advocacy organization , which specializes in helping travelers, receives hundreds of requests a week from travelers, many of whom fell ill while they were abroad. In about 90 percent of those cases, a reliable travel insurance policy could have helped -- and may, as a matter of fact, have eliminated the problem entirely.
Travel insurance and visitors coverage is far from perfect. Not every claim is honored by an insurance company. Also, many policies exclude pre-existing medical conditions, pregnancy, childbirth, and preventive care, among other things. You have to read all the fine print in your policy to make sure you're covered.
But if you need to ask the question, ""Do I need visitors coverage?"" the answer is probably ""yes."""
3 Networking Myths That Hold You Back From Connecting With People,www.forbes.com,Shelcy V. Joseph,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelcyvjoseph/2019/04/20/3-networking-myths-that-hold-you-back-from-connecting-with-people/,"Meeting people is already a challenge, and the misconceptions about networking make it even more difficult. Here are the most common ones: a. It happens in a fixed environment
b. It requires small talk and forced smiles
c. I have nothing to contribute to someone
Let us address each one.
MYTH: It happens in a fixed environment
TRUTH: Networking can happen anywhere
Real networking can happen anywhere (on the subway, at the gym, even on the streets etc.) Even though there are common social settings where it takes place (conferences, office happy hours etc.), when it comes down to it, networking isn't limited to these prescriptive environments since it's about talking to people and making a genuine connection. Broaden your perspective and realize that every day offers opportunities to meet and connect with someone. That lady who was smiling with you during yoga? How about starting a conversation with her after class? The group of students discussing a book you've read at the library? Maybe you can contribute your thoughts too? Make the most out of the random encounter.
MYTH: It requires small talk and forced smiles
TRUTH: Successful networking is based on authenticity
Chances are, if your interaction with someone involves forced smiles and small talk, you will not connect on a deep level. True networking is about being yourself when talking to someone and building on potential shared interests. Sure, there may be some uncomfortable moments at the beginning, but those will quickly give way to frank conversations where you will get to know each other. If you see networking as just another item on your to-do list, an ordeal where you have to put on a show, you can probably save yourself some time and just go where you feel comfortable. Ultimately, the relationships you will go on to develop will be based on the level of authenticity you choose to share.
MYTH: I have nothing of value to give to someone
TRUTH: You'd be surprised the many ways in which you can help someone
Your favorite author is coming to your city and needs help promoting the event? Spread the word at your local coffee shop, on your social networks, and get your friends to tag along. If you successfully bring more people to the event, that is one way you will have added value to their lives. Never underestimate how much you can contribute to a relationship. Networking isn't a one-way street. Both parties have something to bring to the table and are sharing it with each other. So the next time you're tempted to not even give a conversation with someone you admire a shot, do it. Whether you tell them something they didn't know or help them solve a problem, you have the potential to add value to someone's life in many different ways."
Once Upon A Time We Had To Convince People To Share Their Thoughts,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/20/once-upon-a-time-we-had-to-convince-people-to-share-their-thoughts/,"In our modern social-drenched world where we are raised to unquestionably share our every thought with the entire planet, it can be hard to imagine there was once a time when technology companies had to convince people why they would want to share their thoughts with others, even when those others were merely friends and family, rather than strangers on the other side of the globe. In fact, it can be hard to remember that it was less than a decade ago that Facebook began transitioning its users towards sharing their private thoughts more widely, marking the beginning of the end of our societal concern about privacy. Yet, looking back, it is interesting to contemplate a world in which we had to be taught to want to have our voices heard. One of the best ways to understand how society has arrived where it is today is to look back through history to how previous generations understood key societal norms and the inflection points at which those norms changed.
The interplay of technology and society can offer a particularly powerful glimpse into how societies have internalized the changes brought about by technological advances.
Indeed, many of the societal phenomena we associate as uniquely tied to the rise of social media were exactly those grappled with by society half a century ago with the rise of television.
For example, upon receiving a circa-1966 General Electric M8010 reel-to-reel personal tape recorder some years ago, I was most struck not by the device itself, but by the colorful and friendly guidebook that accompanied it. Separate from its more technical user manual that outlined how to operate the device, this guidebook’s purpose was to evangelize the then-novel idea of sharing voice messages with others.
Among its suggestions were recording a baby’s first words, children’s birthday parties, lectures, favorite music and voice messages for those far away. Parents leaving voice messages for their children with the evening’s instructions and spouses leaving loving messages for each other to come home to.
Yet, perhaps most intriguing was its suggestion of recording a voice message to a distant loved one that could be mailed to them to play on their own machine to hear those sentiments expressed in a familiar voice with all its attendant emotion that mere written words would struggle to express.
In fact, in its marketing literature of the time, GE pitched the idea of parents recording voice messages to send to their children serving in the military in faraway places.
It is fascinating to think that just half a century ago, companies were having to explain to the public why they might want to record their voices to share with friends and family rather than simply write a letter.
The ephemeral nature of daily life at the time is starkly apparent in these advertisements. In today’s smartphone-saturated world, a child born today might not be surprised to find when it grows up that its parents photographed every single day of its existence on planet earth since birth. It is hard to imagine today that for those whose parents were born a generation ago, the only record of their early childhood may be a singular shoebox full of photographs, with videos and audio recordings being rarities, if they existed at all. The idea that a parent could record their child’s major developmental milestones beyond mere photographs was a novel concept.
In a world in which we can summon any movie or song on demand, it can be hard to imagine a world in which movies would disappear from existence when they left the theater, music was once exclusively played live for the radio and even society’s most monumental events were ephemeral experiences.
Take a 1970 advertisement for a home video recorder titled “Videotape history as it happens!” The advertisement opens with the line “If you had owned the ROBERTS ‘1000’ VTR last July 20th, you would have videotaped man’s first moon landing … a permanent record of this fantastic achievement to replay for your children and your children’s children.”
While film recorders, especially 16mm cameras, had long been used for home movies, they were still limited by the write-once nature of film and the requirement to have the film developed afterwards. In contrast, the idea of being able to simply record television live in one’s own living room and play it back immediately afterwards was a relatively novel concept at the time for the average public.
The advertisement’s mention of the ephemeral moon landing is particularly poignant in that for audiences of the era, they could never again watch the moon landing except for periodic rebroadcasts by the television networks. Today, one can find any number of reposts of the moon landing for free on YouTube and watch again and again and again on demand.
In fact, the selection by major television networks of what movies to rebroadcast, especially around the holiday seasons, was a driving factor in what became our national culture.
Putting this all together, as we think about how to internalize today’s share-everything social media culture, it is worth reflecting upon the fact that the idea of sharing our likenesses with the world is a relatively novel concept that just half a century ago required concerted evangelizing by technology companies to convince a skeptical public. Sharing is not the natural order of the universe, meaning our present artificial construct is not predestined and thus its malleable nature may be shaped by future technological developments.
In the end, just as society was gradually nudged towards increasing sharing half a century ago, it is entirely possible that technology could gradually nudge society back from the brink of today’s oversharing. Unless, of course, it is simply too late to save humanity."

Mazda's Diesel Challenge Points To Future Autonomous Certification Difficulties,www.forbes.com,Sam Abuelsamid,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2019/04/20/mazdas-diesel-challenge-points-to-future-autonomous-certification-difficulties/,"This week Mazda finally released its long-awaited diesel CX-5 crossover into the U.S. market. The actual wisdom of selling this product in 2019 is the topic of an entirely different discussion. However, some of the reasons why it took so long before Mazda could put it on sale here may provide some interesting lessons for companies in the coming automated driving space. I had the opportunity to sit down with Ichiro Hirose, senior managing executive officer for powertrain development at Mazda during the 2019 New York Auto Show. Mazda has been working to bring its diesel technology to the U.S. market for most of the past decade and actually got emissions certification from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) more than a year ago.
It has long been tougher to sell diesels here in America compared to other markets as a result of strict limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides. Nonetheless, German automakers seemed to have found a way to make their vehicles comply. Or so it seemed.
Then came dieselgate in September 2015 and everything changed for manufacturers selling diesel engined vehicles. Volkswagen was caught cheating on a massive scale by detecting the difference between when emissions tests were being run or the vehicle was being driven on the road. In the latter instance VW was effectively turning off much of the diesel emission control system while driving on the road.
Regulators decided they couldn’t allow that to ever happen again. In Europe, the new World Light-duty Test Protocol (WLTP) was implemented in 2018 with the addition of a real driving emissions (RDE) component. Here, the U.S. the EPA implemented new procedures aimed at reducing the chance of both deliberate and accidental issues in calculating emissions and fuel consumption.
However, the EPA isn’t the only arbiter of what cars are clean enough to ply our roads. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has the final say on what vehicles are sold in our most populous state and it also stepped up its enforcement efforts. This is where Mazda ran into a road block. CARB has decreed that new vehicles must not exceed emissions thresholds at any time in regular use.Sounds perfectly reasonable, right?
As ever, the devil is in the details, or in this case the absence of details. Hirose-san explained that much of the past year involved extensive interaction between Mazda and CARB to make sure that the automaker understood everything the regulator wanted. Until now, emissions testing was a pretty straightforward process. Coast down tests were run to measure road and aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. The vehicle was then put a dynamometer in the lab and the corresponding load numbers were entered in the control system. After driving through several standard test cycles, the emissions and fuel consumption were tallied up.
Unfortunately, the driving in the real world is rarely so repeatable. Temperature, humidity and traffic conditions change all the time. The terrain and speeds also have a huge impact. Rather the five standard test cycles used by EPA, the possibilities are quite literally limitless outside of the lab.
The challenge comes down to how much test coverage is needed to be confident that the system will never exceed the legal threshold? You could test daily for decades and still not hit every point. Ultimately, Mazda and CARB came to a mutual understanding and it got approval to sell the CX-5.
Compared to the challenge of validating that an automated driving system is truly safe and robust, real world emissions are positively trivial. And yet this is the challenge every manufacturer and regulatory agency around the world will face in the coming years.
A Rand Corporation study estimated that it would take 11 billion miles of road testing to have sufficient confidence in the safety of AVs. All of the companies in this business have accumulated perhaps 20 million miles in total since Google’s development program began in earnest a decade ago.
Not all miles are created equal when it comes to testing automated driving. Hundreds of miles of cruising up interstate 5 through California’s central valley don’t even begin to compare to the challenges of covering 1.8 miles from the Jacob Javits center to my hotel after the interview with Hirose-san. That short trek across mid-town Manhattan took more than 40 minutes and involved several near misses with cabs.
Today, we have no standards yet for how to objectively evaluate the performance of AVs (and I don’t count the effectively useless California disengagement reports). Each manufacturer has its own internal metrics, none of which are openly published and regulators don’t really have a clue yet what they should be doing. Organizations like SAE International are trying to coordinate efforts to developing testing standards, but ensuring sufficient coverage to prove safety while minimizing the risk that companies will game the system as Volkswagen did will be extremely challenging."

'The Division 2' Restarts Its 'PvE Dark Zone' Debate With The Arrival Of 515 Gear,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/20/the-division-2-restarts-its-pve-dark-zone-debate-with-the-arrival-of-515-gear/,"I thought we would be having this conversation again at some point after The Division 2’s launch , but I didn’t think it would be this soon, or for this reason. Massive recently introduced 515 Gearscore gear, over the current cap of 500, to drop in the Dark Zone. While 515 gear will join it when the raid arrives, many players are upset that they are being forced to travel to the DZ as the only place to farm this gear as it’s something that doesn’t interest them, at least not in its current form.
This has resparked a very old debate, one from the early days of The Division 1 , where there’s an idea that there should be a PvE version of the Dark Zone free from Rogues and gank squads, so people can explore and farm these areas without being bothered by other players when they have no interest in PvP.
The counterpoint to this is that removing PvP and Rogue would destroy the entire concept of the mode, and people just need to “get good” if they want to survive in what is supposed to be the most harrowing zone on the map. This is roughly the position that Massive has taken as well, as despite all the requests for a PvE Dark Zone in The Division 1 , that never happened.
The Division 2
Massive Instead, what we saw was kind of alternative for PvP-focused players rather than the thing PvE players wanted. That’s how we have Conflict, a dedicated PvP experience which improves PvP play for those who were tired of trying to kill enemies in the Dark Zone who didn’t want to fight at all and just wanted to run and be left alone. But the PvPvE element of the Dark Zone remains, and now some people are getting annoyed by it once more.
It may not surprise you to learn that I am on the side of “yes, the Dark Zone would benefit from a PvE option.” I don’t think you need to remove the PvPvE mode that currently exists for the game. Those that like that aspect can still play it, but offering a PvE version has too many upsides to ignore. I know plenty of players that have not even done so much as the intro quest for the Dark Zone because they remembered how much they disliked it in The Division 1 . I did the intro quest and got up to level 10 or 15 or so in the DZ, but I haven’t been back since for the same reasons. I have no real interest in fighting other players, be it well-geared adversaries or easily killable noobs. I have no interest in farming for loot only to end up losing it because of ganks or other mishaps. And so I farm activities that are more reliable, won’t pit me against other players and don’t have the risk of losing anything. But I would love to explore an additional 25-30% of the map in the Dark Zone areas with a PvE version of the DZ, because otherwise it’s just wasted space to me. This was also true of the first game where the DZ was even larger and kept getting larger with future updates.
There is always a hardcore contingent of Dark Zone players who push back on all this, but I am genuinely unsure of what they’d lose if PvE was just an option for the Dark Zone. Players who like the current Dark Zone could still queue up for that version. To me, this is more about denying players zones and loot they haven’t “earned” because they can’t stand the heat of the “real” Dark Zone which is stupid gatekeeping I don’t respect or appreciate.
The Division 2
Massive I have no way of checking this, so far as I can tell, but I am willing to bet that as vocal as the hardcore Dark Zone community is, the DZ has a fraction of the players of the larger PvE world, and probably only a fraction of those actively want to be there and would care if there was a PvP option. I think there’s a reason that Massive put 515 gear in the Dark Zone, because they’re trying to lure people to actually play it. Right now, tons and tons of people are avoiding it completely because it’s much easier to queue up for missions or bounties or strongholds with a more straightforward path to loot, working with other players rather than against them. And if they do want to fight other people? That’s what Conflict is for, and that too comes with no risk of surprise attacks and lost loot.
The Dark Zone has always been Massive’s pet project, the concept that was supposed to make The Division stand out compared to its competition. And yet it has always remained my least favorite aspect of the game, and that has not changed in the sequel. If we didn’t see a PvE Dark Zone in all the years of The Division 1 doubt we’ll see one now, but I think it’s a bad path forward for Massive to try and simply bribe people to play the DZ when clearly something is gone wrong if they have to do that in the first place.

The Road To Redemption For 'Anthem' Should Be What 'No Man's Sky' Has Done,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/20/the-road-to-redemption-for-anthem-should-be-what-no-mans-sky-has-done/,"Right now if you talk to the Anthem community, or what’s left of it , there are two main schools of thought. Either the idea that the game is dead, that it’s the new Mass Effect Andromeda and nothing can save it, or that in order to fix it they need to go full Final Fantasy: Realm Reborn and apologize for the original product and do a total and complete reboot of the entire thing. I do not believe that EA or BioWare has given up on Anthem the way they did with Andromeda so early. BioWare is hiring more positions to bolster work on Anthem and we’ve heard nothing concrete about EA’s wrath about the game or drastic steps like shuttering work on it.
Similarly, I do not think it is realistic or necessary for Anthem to go Realm Reborn and essentially start over. Given how troubled production was on Anthem, a complete re-do is certainly not going to be in the cards, and there is actually a lot of good stuff at Anthem ’s core that would be a waste to throw out completely.
Rather, I’m a fan of the third option, the No Man’s Sky .
No Man’s Sky has gone from being an industry joke to one of the most impressive comeback stories in the industry. The original game launched half-formed and full of broken promises, but what did Hello Games do? What do they continue to do? They put their heads down and offered not just patches and fixes, but a series of large, free updates that have slowly transformed the game into what players wanted it to be in the first place, whether that’s unique planets and discoveries, multiplayer, new vehicles and quests and all other manner of additions.
No Man's Sky
Hello Games To me, this is what Anthem needs. BioWare has been accused of going “radio silent” lately, but honestly, I don’t think that’s the worst thing in the world. I think the game should throw its clearly-not-on-schedule roadmaps out the window, have BioWare put their heads down, fix what’s currently broken and then come out with substantive updates in larger chunks to bring players back.
This is what No Man’s Sky has done and it’s panned out. They never sold the updates as DLC, they never put in microtransactions, they simply made the game better and more people bought it. That’s it. And now people are holding up Hello Games as a paragon of hard work and determination, rather than the dev who botched that space game launch.
In the short term, there are obvious things Anthem could do like increase the Legendary drop rate and guarantee Legendaries on certainly weekly milestones. I also think the more drastic step of temporarily killing the cosmetic store and simply inserting its stock, armor and all, into the game as actual loot as a sign of goodwill. That may seem ludicrous to profit-focused EA, but something that drastic might be necessary at this point for community morale. When things are “fixed,” perhaps you return to selling microtransactions, but doing it now just feels…bad, when there’s so much wrong with the game.
Anthem
BioWare Longer term, we need to see meatier updates rather than slow trickles. A new stronghold here, new support items there, a couple new weapons, a weekend long catalclysm, or whatever that ends up being. Those might be good, sure, but it’s like feeding someone one pea at a time when all they want is steak and potatoes. Both technically provide nutrients, but one is a decidedly more enjoyable experience than the other.
If you asked me years ago if I ever thought No Man’s Sky would be where it is now, I would have said no, and I would have been wrong. As such, I am not willing to say that Anthem is doomed, as we could see a similar path forward. And yet there are additional complications in this situation with the game being larger, more expensive, harder to work with (via Frostbite) and with EA management breathing down BioWare’s neck, and also BioWare’s well-documented internal leadership issues. All that may mean this can’t happen, but it’s too soon to say that for sure.

Box Office: 'Captain Marvel' And 'Shazam!' Both Got A Boost From 'Avengers: Endgame',www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/20/box-office-shazam-captain-marvel-avengers-endgame-wonder-woman-black-panther-dc-films-mcu/,"It looks like the general excitement for Avengers: Endgame is giving a boost to both Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel Shazam . First, the MCU flick, which earned $3.1 million on Friday (+43%) to bring its domestic cume to a whopping $394.2 million. Counting for a presumably frontloaded weekend (Friday was Good Friday and this Sunday is Easter Sunday), we can expect a $9.1 million (+6%) weekend to push the Brie Larson flick just over the $400 million domestic milestone. We’ll have overseas updates tomorrow, but this boost means that the $150 million sci-fi prequel should have no problem topping $1.1 billion by the time it exits theaters. So, yes, the boost in weekday grosses, partially due to folks taking in one last viewing as part of their pre- Endgame MCU marathons, continued over the holiday weekend. It opened earlier and was playing on just 1,930 theaters this time last year, but Black Panther dropped a mere 14.6% on this weekend in 2018, as it too benefited from excitement over the upcoming Avengers super-duper cross-over flick. Of note, the Chadwick Boseman drama went on to earn an additional $16.4 million after Avengers: Infinity War opened last summer. Heck, the film dropped just 4% on the weekend that Avengers 3 snagged a $258 million Fri-Sun domestic debut.
Black Panther earned 2.3% of its money after Avengers: Infinity War opened in theaters. Should Captain Marvel play likewise (and that number may be higher), then we’re probably looking at a final domestic total of $417 million, just above Wonder Woman ($412.5 million in 2017) and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom ($416 million last summer). Educated speculation aside, I have no idea what the MCU schedule is for next year since they have kept mum thus far about plans after Spider-Man: Far From Home . But they may want to consider having a pre-summer MCU flick opening right before the big summer kick-off flick as a matter of course.
Captain Marvel is very upset that more of you haven't seen 'Short Term 12' or 'Sugar.'
Walt Disney and Marvel Not to be outdone, Shazam! was the top holdover movie on Friday. The DC Films flick, based on a character who was initially called Captain Marvel (it’s a long story), grossed $6.155 million. That’s 3% below last Friday’s $6.347 million gross and gives the $90 million-budgeted Warner Bros./New Line flick a $110.15 million 15-day cume. Even presuming frontloading, we could be looking at a $16 million Fri-Sun frame. That would be a drop of just 35%, which would give it the smallest third-weekend drop for a live-action comic book superhero movie since Wonder Woman (-29% in 2017) and the second-lowest such drop since Blade in 1998 .
If Shazam! falls just 35% this weekend, it’ll be the eighth-smallest third-weekend-drop for any big comic book and/or superhero movie over the last 32 years, behind only Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (+15% in 2018), Wonder Woman (-29% in 2017), The Matrix (-20% in 1999), Blade (whose third weekend was Labor Day in 1998), The Crow (whose third weekend was Memorial Day in 1994), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (-28% in 1991), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (-25% in 1990) and Robocop (-26% in 1987). That may not mean anything in the long run, but it took me too long to look that up (even Batman dipped 36% in weekend three) for me not to share it.
Shazam! should have $120 million by Sunday night, which (presuming it doesn’t get clobbered by Avengers: Endgame ) positions the film for an over/under $155 million domestic finish. I’d argue that WB’s own Detective Pikachu is a more significant “threat” to Shazam! than the MCU mega-movie. Rampage (whose third weekend fell on Avengers: Infinity War ’s debut frame) earned 29.8% of its $101.028 million domestic cume after Avengers 3 opened. If Shazam! performs likewise, then we could be looking at a $181 million cume. That’s not realistic, but we’ll see if the quadruple-play of Shazam! , Curse of La Llorona , Detective Pikachu and Godzilla: King of the Monsters proves mutually beneficial"
New AI Fashion Mass Customization Software Is Poised To Make Billions With Over 32 Million Choices,www.forbes.com,Western Bonime,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/westernbonime/2019/04/20/new-ai-fashion-mass-customization-software-is-poised-to-make-billions-with-over-32-million-choices/,"Outfit on Couturme customer made with their software Couturme We've been waiting a long time for this, a company that can offer consumers the convenience of Stitchfix door delivery fashions with the individual design and custom tailoring of bespoke and couture. COUTURME, a San Francisco start-up has managed to succeed where so many other custom fit software and bio measurement companies have struggled. Like Stitch Fix, Couturme starts with a style questionnaire, but then takes the process all the way through production, offering both speed and nearly infinite design options. With over 32 million possibilities and near perfect fit based on thousands of customer interactions, customers can create nearly any design they want with near perfect fit. No other company has accomplish this so completely. COUTURME’S secret is patent-pending CAD software.
How it works: Step 1. Fill out a short questionnaire with your AI stylist assistant. Step2. Survey a number of styles selected based on your answers. Step 3. Re-design. Change the neckline, sleeve length, skirt length, or even change the waistline positioning to create an entirely different design. Step 4. Give your AI tailor your measurements. Don’t worry, COUTURME’S tailor doesn’t judge. Step 5. A perfectly fitting pattern in minutes. Step 6. Your pattern is sent to a factory where it is made in the fabrics you selected. Step 7. Your design is flown back to you. Red Carpet in Couturme created design Couturme
Why this promises to be so big. Over 74 Million American women do not fit standard sizes. This leads to large numbers of returns, overproduction and waste, not to mention frustration and poor self-esteem. Already the company has thousands of customers who have used the software to create designs for special occasions like the red carpet and with selections of not just dresses but also blazers, pants and blouses, women can create entire wardrobes with perfect fit. Other companies have tried large, expensive scanners to create better fits but this requires women to come in person to stores and then only helps them select better fits from clothes that have already been produced. Other custom fit software companies offer so few design options that they fail to entice today’s fashion savvy consumers. Customizing a Couturme design and inputting measurements for a custom pattern Couturme
The company launched 3 months ago during W19 Y Combinator batch, one of the most prestigious accelerator programs in the world, that takes only 1.5% of 11,000+ companies that apply twice a year. Since launch, the sales have been compounding 11% week over week and co-founders Yulia Raquel and Don Straub see a potential for COUTURME to become an online marketplace for infinite custom fashion as large as Amazon, processing billions of dollars of sales, while fulfilling on their goal of a sustainable future.
Why has COUTURME succeeded so beautifully where so many other customization, biometrics and sizing platforms have struggled? Many of those companies are started by designers who don't understand the tech or business side, or were started by tech and business people who don't understand fashion. As a result, they've struggled to engage customers who want the latest fashions. Not the case here. Yuliya Raquel, CEO and co-founder, knows fashion and fit, and she understands the manufacturing challenges retail companies face. Before COUTURME, she founded and ran a direct to consumer women’s plus size clothing brand, IGIGI which sold millions of dollars online. Couturme has a great balance of engineers, design and business people behind it and with 32 million options, they can offer today's discerning customers real fashions that are on trend. Yuliya and her co-founder Don Straub built a team of 2 PhD’s and 7 Engineers five years ago to begin creating the software and have put their lives on hold to work tirelessly day and night to make it perfect.
For them, it’s important to offer real value. “This is not just a sizing app, or a design tool,” says Yuliya. “We see our technology as having the potential to solve fashion’s sustainability problems. With the click of a button, consumers can wear anything they want on demand, perfectly fitted to them. And with the automation of the entire fashion design process, consumers can receive their clothes in a short period of time at a minimal cost to the brand. A couple of companies have taken the lead by offering customization of some items on their website, but a large percentage of fashion companies are still reliant on the old traditional method of garment design and pattern development. Thus having to place gigantic production orders.” Knowing what I do about how much of today’s fashion ends up in landfill, walking into a department store and seeing a sea of coats makes me feel physically ill. So do shopping apps. No offense to the bright and passionate minds risking it all to do what they believe in and create them, but we are at an existential as well as a global climate crisis. We don’t need MORE ways to shop. What we need are FEWER.“We’ve created bespoke for everyone. Now that we have the software, it’s become clear that it has real potential to solve the fashion industry’s sustainability issue,” says Yuliya. Couturme's software is perfect for plus sizes Couturme
The idea started while Yuliya was running IGIGI. She became aware of the massive challenges individuals face in having their clothes custom designed and manufactured to fit their unique bodies and style preferences. “I just couldn’t stand the fact that so many women who wanted to have custom bespoke fashion couldn’t because of huge design and product development costs and large minimums required for production,” she says, “so I began looking for a solution. Let’s say you are going to attend a wedding and want to wear a unique design to express your individual style and personality so you don’t look like anyone else. You can’t find anything that fits you, but to hire a fashion designer and a seamstress is going to cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Today most fashion brands can’t offer bespoke design due to enormous complexities and the extensive costs to design fashion and generate made-to-fit patterns. Alternatively, going to a local atelier is equally expensive and out of reach for those on a budget. With COUTURME, any woman can get bespoke fashion to fit her body, style and budget, starting at $199. That's a price that many more women can afford. "" Small selection of wedding gowns customers can choose and customize on Couturme Couturme
In addition bespoke sportswear separates, COUTURME has created designs for the bridal wear market. They recognize this as an area where women on a budget often struggle with sizing and style the most. With COUTURME, women can choose from a plethora of wedding gown styles and buy a bespoke gown from $700-$1500. “This is thousands less than a typical couture gown and delivered many months faster” says Yuliya. Yuliya and her team are working towards adding even more unique features to the software. “We understand not everyone knows how to design or even how to style themselves. We plan to add influencers, designers, and stylists to provide guidance for our customers. We want people to feel confident in their choices and we want to avoid the waste that happens when people design without knowledge and end up with something they don’t like which then goes into the dumpster.”
Just how big of an impact does this make on the environment? Mass production leads to 10-25% of textiles leftover from cutting thousands of units at the same time. Moreover, as brands reduce quality and production costs to stay afloat, 15 million tons of used textile waste gets generated in the USA by consumers of fast fashion alone. Overproduction is another issue. Take H&M for example, which burned $4.3B of leftover stock last year (Saturday Evening Post). They are not alone, as all the ready-to-wear brands and manufacturers have to dispose of millions of units of unsold or returned inventory somewhere. This causes devastating immediate and long-term impact on the environment through toxins released into the air.
Even more advantages exist for retail with COUTURME. Removing the need for large orders would reduce the economic strain of high rents on large spaces, or open up room for retailers to offer more experiences and events. Today the companies that are staving off the so called “retail apocalypse” are doing so by creating fun interactive and communal experiences for consumers where they can relax, share and connect.
""We are excited by the endless possibilities for B2C as well as B2B,"" says Yuliya. ""We know our system has the potential to completely disrupt the fashion industry."" Those interested in learning more can email the company at yuliya@couturme.com

Getty On Saturday, the UFC visits St. Petersburg, Russia, for the first time when it presents UFC Fight Night 149 from Yubileyniy Arena. The main event of the card features a matchup between veteran heavyweight competitors, Alistair Overeem and Aleksei Oleinik.
Overeem and Oleinik have combined for 131 MMA fights. A shockingly high number of those contests have ended in stoppage victories. Throughout his career, Overeem, who has held titles with DREAM and Strikeforce and fought for the UFC belt, has won 39 fights by stoppage (22 knockouts, 17 submissions), while Oleinik has won 53 contests by stoppage (eight knockouts, 45 submissions). Oleinik is the only fighter to have won a UFC bout by way of Ezekiel choke. He’s used that rare submission hold to win two of his UFC outings.
Overeem ended a two-fight losing skid in November when he knocked out Sergey Pavlovich in the first round. Oleinik is on a two-fight winning streak heading into this contest. Oleinik won both of those bouts by submission, earning “Performance of the Night” bonuses for each of those wins. All six of his UFC victories have come by way of stoppage.
In the co-main event, rising lightweight star, Islam Makhachev returns to action for the first time since July 2018. Makhachev, a teammate of UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, is on a four-fight winning streak. He’s earned first-round stoppage victories in his two most recent outings. Makhachev welcomes the Arman Tsarukyan to the UFC. Tsarukyan is on a 12-fight winning streak.
Also appearing on the main card is Antonina Shevchenko, the older sister of women’s flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko. Shevchenko faces Roxanne Modafferi in St. Petersburg.

America Should Stop Supporting The Lavish Life Of Pakistan's Rich,www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/04/20/america-should-stop-supporting-the-lavish-life-of-pakistans-rich/,"America should stop providing aid to Pakistan, which ends up supporting the country’s rich and powerful. It should let China and Saudi Arabia do it. Providing financial aid to poor countries around the world makes a great deal of sense for America, both on humanitarian and geopolitical grounds.The trouble is that in some cases, American foreign aid ends up supporting the lifestyles of the elite rather than the lives of the poor. Pakistan is a case in point. For decades, Washington has been very generous to that South Asian nation , according to Akbar Zaidi, a Karachi-based political economist and Columbia University Visiting Scholar. It helped the country deal with chronic debt crisis.
 “Washington support is often reflected in its endorsement of Pakistan’s applications for aid from international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,” says Zaidi. “It helps to have the United States as an ally when it comes to seeking assistance from multilateral sources.”

Like back in December 2001, when Washington brokered a $12 billion IMF debt relief package for Islamabad, in exchange f or support to fight Islamic militancy in the region. So w hy Pakistan is running into debt problems that require foreign aid to solve them? Because the country’s elite is refusing to pay its fair share of taxes, according to Zaidi. “These problems are perennial—it would be incorrect to call them a “crisis”—largely because of the Pakistani elite’s ability to avoid taxing itself,” says Zaidi. “Instead, successive governments have preferred to leverage Islamic militancy, ignoring the risks of doing so) while relying on financial aid from outside countries with geopolitical interests in the region from international financial institutions.” The Pakistani elite , he continues, “ frightens foreigners into proving funds to stabilize the country against a self-created, false threat of extremists taking over a nuclear state.” Meanwhile, foreign aid allows the country’s elite to live a lavish life. “This is a classic moral hazard problem: the luxury of always being bailed out has allowed the Pakistani elite to live with great impunity. Beyond responsibility in cocoons of lavish unaccountability. They feel little need to undertake structural reforms of the economy and institutions that would result in a fairer, more just, and more equitable form of government and representation.” Instead, they prefer London, New York, and Dubai more than they do Karachi -- when it comes to investing and partying with their money, that is. That’s according to the former director of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for Pakistan , Marc-André Franche. “You cannot have an elite that takes advantage of very cheap and uneducated labour when it comes to making money, and when it is time to party is found in London ; when it’s time to buy things, in Dubai; and when it’s time to buy property it invests in Dubai or Europe or New York. The elite needs to decide do they want a country or not,” Franche stated in an interview with the Business Recorder. All good reasons why America should let China and Saudi Arabia, Pakistan’s new allies, support the lifestyle of their rich and powerful.

I never should schedule an early class, just not a good idea. Maybe if I had packs of OLO Sublingual strips on hand I could fine tune my day. You see will find in your quest to create a cadence to your day sometimes goes into a rabbit hole. The inter-webs have a way of doing that, no matter how focused. Enter the OLO Sublingual strips. They take the detail oriented experience and encapsulate the arduous task of sourcing, purchasing, (finding out your dispensary doesn't have what you want), and settling for something that just doesn't do it for you?
Chill

To experience a curated experience is one of the excelsior experiences that you can benefit from. As I described above, your memories of less than well manufactured edibles may have clouded your better judgement in the past. But all those awful experiences are best forgotten now. OLO is micro-dosed and made with the utmost care from the best raw materials that money can buy. You don't have to worry about having too good of a time, eroding into most of your night not having a good time. With OLO this worry is in the rear view mirror and disappearing very quickly. Listen up! Less is more. You don't need to clear that bong tube to have a deeply introspective experience! It's essential to be able to function during the day. Sure you can alternate your experience with your favorite flower, but that is a different article for another 4/20 day. OLO seeks to make your cannabis regiment as precise and pinpoint accurate as possible. They have a number of different sublinguals, from Active, to Focus, then Chill being my favorite one for the end of the day. I think for writing I'm looking for focus, without that feeling that I want to slip into Instagram mode and go off into that direction for an hour or more. For that rationality I'd have picked the OLO sublingual named Social. That one makes me want to go to a party and greet every single person there with a huge smile on my face. No longer am I forced to go outside and smoke a joint to face a crowd. I'm no longer a drinker-sure I enjoy a beer or some wine, but my days drinking hard liquor are OVER. OLO type products are the perfect thing for me. I can slip the little sheet under my tongue where it seeps into my body, bypassing my liver. OK, so I'm not a doctor, never wanted to be one but should you wonder how it works, I'd point my browser to the OLO site and they will be more than capable to explain the reasoning behind this experience.
OLO Foil
Courtesy: OLO Experience Notes:
Active. It took no longer than a few minutes for my mind to synchronize with my body. Not that I own a bicycle, but yesterday being bicycle day, I felt the pull of wanting to move my bones a bit more. So I did, at least in my mind.
Focus. Focus is the perfect slice of getting the job done the first time. Focus brings you deep thought and getting it all done. How they do it, I'll never know. It's the perfect thing instead of an after- dinner cocktail.
OLO Social
Courtesy: OLO Chill. We all know the In the Couch terminology. But wouldn't it be nice to rest without being destroyed? Chill is for those times when you just spent the last four hours coming out of the Holland Tunnel. Now it's time to chill.
Social. We're all done chilling. It's time to get busy and engaged. If I didn't know better, I'd think this menu was geared to having the most wonderful conversation with someone not yet met. And feeling great about it tomorrow! No hangover!
This experience was micro-dosed. That means 5mg per easy to dissolve strip. This is the perfect dose. Some will scoff, I'm cool with that. Everyone is different. I learned that by having my cannabis DNA tested and evaluated. I learned that my budtender, although well-meaning, really has no idea what I need for any experience. Only their own. So OLO has taken away that surprise of whoa, versus peaceful calm and relaxation, I wanted to know about it. If you are in California, please give OLO a try. And if you are like myself, over fifty (shh!), you'll know exactly why OLO is so brilliant. No one has to know your business. You may have grown up with the stigma of smoking cannabis in public. I experience it every day, my state is still illegal for recreational cannabis. So OLO makes perfect sense. Small dose, non-confrontational, and rapid-acting with precise dosage. That got my vote. They come in two speeds. 10mg and 5mg. I like the 5's. You may prefer more. Start with less. Like spicy Thai food. Start at one star. Work your way up from there. Common Sense. Happy 4/20.

'The Division 2': How To Get The Nemesis Exotic Sniper Rifle,www.forbes.com,Dave Thier,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/04/20/the-division-2-how-to-get-the-nemesis-sniper-rifle/,"It's official: The Division 2 has what seems to b its first truly OP weapon. The Nemesis Sniper Rifle is making waves as a high-DPS brute that has a way of making even the signature weapons superfluous. Nemesis has a special talent that marks an enemy as your ""nemesis"", increasing damage against them 5% a second for up to 50%, which can combine with other damage boosters to do more than 1.5m in a headshot, shredding bosses for those with the requisite aim. Whether or not it needs a nerf is a matter for another piece, but for right now we're concerned about how to get it. The Nemesis Sniper Rifle requires a series of components and a blueprint to unlock. This might not seem like a lot, but the real trick is that you get the components in invaded missions, which rotate each week.
The first thing you need to do is clear the Tidal Basin stronghold a single time at World Tier 4. Then you've got to clear invaded missions until it's unlocked again for its second run. This is where you're going to start.
Relatively early in this run-through, you'll encounter a building to the right of a gate that has a satellite dish on top. Go in and you'll find a Black Tusk Keycard on one of the bunk-beds: don't worry, this is The Division and items are pretty clearly signposted once you're near them.
Here's a good video that shows off the locations:
That keycard will unlock a secret door on the left-hand side of the cargo hold of the Black Tusk hovercraft, later in the mission. The game will ask you to go right, and you'll go left. You'll open a door with a keypad in it, and inside you'll find a weapons crate. Open that crate to find the Adrestia SR1 Sniper Rifle. This isn't the weapon!
Those that are familiar with mythology will know that Adrestia is associated with Nemesis in a mixed up world of ancient stories where certain characters overlap with others. So that's the true identity of this sniper rifle, but you'll need to do some work to get it. Start by dismantling that to get a Marksman Rifle Scope called the Tally, which will send you on your way.
After this, you'll need to defeat the bosses of the other invaded strongholds: Klutz, Shorty and Prime, from the Captiol Building, Roosevelt Island and District Union Area. The problem here is that you can only clear one invaded stronghold a week, and they'll rotate. So you won't be able to grind this all out immediately: you'll need to wait for the strongholds you need to become unlocked. You'll need to kill Klutz, Shorty and Prime to get all of those components.
Once you've got all the components, you'll need the blueprint. This comes from the Grand Washington Hotel, where you need to kill Puck for the blueprint: you might need to do this more than once.
With all the components and the blueprint in hand, you've just got to go to your workbench and make the thing. Congratulations, you've got a boss-destroying exotic so long as you can land your shots."
Data Driven Parenting,www.forbes.com,Adam Ozimek,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2019/04/20/data-driven-parenting/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Raising a baby is hard enough, I am learning, but all of the bad and uninformed advice out there makes it so much harder. Thankfully, parents who wish to actually know what is known have Emily Oster. My wife and I took extreme comfort in reading Emily's ""Expecting Better"", which is an economist's guide to pregnancy. Her newest , ""Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool"", is no less essential. In my household, she is the all-knowing Aunt we have never met. Parenting would be a lot more stressful without these books.
It might seem surprising at first pass that anyone, even an economist such as myself, would care to read a whole book of advice from an economist on parenting. But as you learn from both Cribsheet and Expecting Better, knowing what the evidence ""says"" about issues of safety, nutrition, behavior, and health in general are not about reading a study, or even a few studies, or even all the studies, and summarizing the results. Causality is very, very hard and what these books do at their core is walk you through how a world class empiricist assesses medical research for causality.
If causality is not your thing and this sounds like a boring exercise only economists can understand and enjoy, you should reconsider. My wife has never read a book by an economist, and she is as big a fan of Emily as I am. This is in large part because Emily's gifts are not limited to teasing out causality from messy research, but also explaining it an easy to digest way that makes causality actually intuitive.
What the reader also learns from these books is the limits of empiricism. Emily does not shy away from topics where the evidence is far from conclusive, nor does she stretch the results to derive conclusiveness when it isn't there. Instead, you learn how to weigh risks when the evidence is weak. The importance of preferences is also central. This is not a book of thou musts, but a book about how weigh to the welfare of the entire family, parents included, under varying levels of uncertainty about costs and benefits. These are all reasons why, with apologies to the medical doctors out there, an economist had to write this.
One last thing I will note, which reveals me either as hopelessly biased on these books or intensely sincere about what I've written. In November 2018, my wife and I were struggling to figure out whether to do ""cry it out"" with our baby. ""If only Emily Oster had a book on early parenting as well!"" we wished. Then I looked at Amazon and saw Cribsheet was coming out in April, 2019. For the first time ever, perhaps me being an economist who writes on the internet could be useful to my family. ""Ask her for a review copy"" my wife implored, and so I did.
So you tell me. Does the fact that we selfishly asked for (and received) a review copy for our own private benefit mean I can't fairly review this book, or does it reveal how essential Emily's parenting advice is? You decide. Adam Ozimek Contributor I’m an economist at Moody's Analytics, where I cover labor markets and other aspects of the U.S. economy.

Box Office: 'Curse Of La Llorona' Tops Good Friday With Great $12 Million,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/20/box-office-curse-of-lallorona-conjuring-annabelle-breakthrough-walt-disney-fox-penguins/,"The Curse of La Llorona easily topped the box office on Friday, earning $11.8 million. That includes $2.75 million in Thursday preview grosses and is above the $9.9 million opening day of Pet Semetary and the $9.1 million opening day of New Line’s Lights Out from three summers ago. This positions the New Line chiller for over/under $28 million over its Fri-Sun debut. Yes, we’re expecting frontloading due to Good Friday boosting the opening day figures, but most kids are out of school on Monday and tomorrow is Easter, so we’ll see how that helps or hurts the R-rated religious horror flick. Considering this flick cost just $9 million to produce, I’m guessing that Warner Bros. isn’t sweating the weekend multiplier. This opening won’t be big enough for Warner Bros. to retroactively include it in the Conjuring Universe, but it’s still a strong opening for an R-rated horror film that is entirely about dead children. The decision to keep it apart from the ongoing Conjuring franchise is an amusing, if understandable, one. And as someone who rolled my eyes as folks debated whether Life might be a Venom prequel (it was not) or whether A Quiet Place should’ve been a Cloverfield movie (it earned more than every Cloverfield movie combined), I can respect New Line’s insistence that The Curse of La Llorona does not “count” as a Conjuring film. However, having seen the film, it’s a “walks like a duck/quacks like a duck” scenario.
Never mind that it has the same producers, the same 1970’s period-piece settings, the same “R-rated but not gore-drenched” mentality and the same “Catholic dogma is accepted as outright fact” mentality. Never mind that it 104% takes place in the world of the Conjuring movies, including a cameo from Tony Amendola as Father Perez shown briefly with Annabelle. Never mind that it contains at least one new character (a Raymond Cruz’s drolly cynical freelance ghostbuster) who I would love to see in another movie. I can theorize that had the reviews out of its SXSW premiere been more positive WB and friends might have been more willing to “count it,” although I will argue that (by default) it’s better than The Nun and Annabelle .
Okay, so it’s not as gothically stylish as The Nun , but it is more narratively and visually coherent and it has a semblance of a human interest story that the first Conjuring prequel and the most recent Conjuring prequel lacked. Oh, and because the movie is mostly set within a Hispanic American community which generally believes in ghosts and goblins, we don’t get a bunch of “Egad, nobody believes me!” scenes. It’s not a “good” movie, but Michael Chaves directs the hell out of it and in that sense, this works as a resume flick for his next gig, directing The Conjuring 3 . Anyway, I guess you can sell it as “If you loved The Conjuring , then you’ll tolerate The Curse of La Llorona !”
The previous Conjuring movies had multipliers between 2.33x ( Annabelle: Creation ) and 2.45x ( Annabelle ) so there may not be much wiggle room. The caveat is the whole “Good Friday/Easter Sunday” thing, but it’s certainly the right weekend for a religiously-inclined fright fest. It could go either way, as Hispanic Americans are major demographics for religious horror movies. Despite (all due respect) a white leading actress (a game Linda Cardellini), white writers and a white guy directing, this chiller, based on a famous Mexican folk tale, is going to play as intended to the demographic in question. Now bring on Annabelle Comes Home , which is essentially being sold as an Avengers -level (or at least Civil War -ish) crossover event for the cinematic universe. Place your bets.
In a weird coincidence, Walt Disney and 20th Century Fox (now part of Disney) released new movies on the same day. Fox 2000’s faith-based drama Breakthrough opened on Wednesday alongside Disneynature’s Penguins . Breakthrough , about a young boy who makes a miraculous recovery after falling into an icy lake, earned $3.811 million on Friday, setting the stage for a $10.9 million weekend and $14.441 million Wed-Sun debut. The film received an A from CinemaScore and will hopefully be about as leggy as Miracles from Heaven . That Sony/Affirm release (which also opened on the Wednesday of Easter weekend) earned $61.705 million in 2016 from an $18.369 million five-day debut. A similar run would give the $14 million-budgeted DeVon Franklin-produced melodrama a perfectly-okay $48 million finish.
Disneynature’s Penguins opened on Wednesday but hasn’t really gained traction, even by the dwindling standards of Disney’s nature documentary brand. The Ed Helms-narrated documentary earned $901,000 on Friday for a three-day cume of $1.853 million. That positions the (admittedly “for the love of the game”) offering for a $2.471 million Fri-Sun frame and a $3.423 million Wed-Sun debut in 1,815 theaters. At this rate, the film will end up somewhere between $6 million and $9 million domestic. This will play well on Disney+ alongside the deluge of acquired National Geographic content. This remains an “everybody can come” family tradition for us, even if my oldest has grown out of it and my youngest is now old enough to see other kid-friendly stuff in theaters."
Cameras Construct Reality Rather Than Capture Truth,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/20/cameras-construct-reality-rather-than-capture-truth/,"We live in a society today that is saturated with cameras. From government-owned surveillance camera networks to privately-owned store and home security cameras to the literally billions of cellphone and standalone cameras standing ready to capture the world at a moment’s notice, the modern world is blanketed with digital eyes. This all-encompassing recording network was supposed to ensure that we could see everything happening everywhere. Ordinary citizens could experience spontaneous events as they happen through the eyes of its participants and witnesses, eliminating biased narratives and gatekeepers to understand the “truth” about what really happened. Governments could similarly watch every square inch of their nations to prevent crime and terrorism. With more cameras than citizens, why do governments still find themselves unable to catch criminals and why do we as a society still struggle to define the “truth” about what really happened in major societal events? One of the greatest falsehoods about photography and videography that we as a society perpetuate is that cameras capture “truth.”
This could not be further from the truth.
Cameras are not societal capturing devices that somehow absorb the space around them and recreate it.
Cameras are much like any form of art: they construct reality rather than capture it.
A photographer decides where to point their camera and the framing to use. The same scene can yield many very different stories depending on how each photographer decided to capture it.
In one famous pair of war images, one country’s press ran the photograph of a child’s toy in the kitchen of her home, covered with her blood from the airstrike by the opposing side that killed her. The image portrayed the very real civilian cost of war being borne by that country. In contrast, the other country’s press carried a photograph of the same kitchen, from the same vantage point, but pointing in the opposite direction, showing that the house had been turned into a militant bomb factory – the rest of the kitchen filled with IEDs, weapons and the remains of heavily armed militants that had been preparing a major terrorist attack, with no external indication of the home-turned-military-base that there had been a child present.
Images do not capture “truth,” they merely construct one possible reality and narrative.
The filters and color adjustments to an image can have a tremendous effect on how it makes us feel. An image of a city street that has been darkened, its colors stripped of their saturation and its shadows deepened, can relay an ominous narrative. The same image that has been brightened, its colors saturated to neon purity and its shadows lifted away, can relay a story of a bright and optimistic outcome.
Most importantly, photographers decide when to capture their images, while videographers decide the precise starting and stopping points for their video to bear witness to a scene.
Why is it in a world awash with cameras we still disagree on what happened in major events?
Whether a police shooting or a group of children on a school outing confronted by two separate groups of aggressive adults, the images and video that emerge from a contested situation will often tell very different stories about what took place.
Initial visual evidence will typically be the most incendiary, portraying a side of the confrontation that can only possibly indicate one single terrible underlying cause. Over time, the vast array of perspectives between those two narratives will emerge, as other images and videos muddy the waters and fill in the gaps between the two polar opposite realities. What at first glance seemed a cut and dried story based on irrefutable visual evidence suddenly becomes a complex scene of interpretation in which any number of possible stories may be supported.
The problem is that social media rewards the former, while drawing our attention away from the latter. In the aftermath of any major event, it is the initial incendiary imagery that goes viral and dominates our societal conversation, while our attention turns away to the next big story long before the remaining imagery emerges that tells a far more nuanced story.
Therein lies the great challenge in our visual world: we believe that photographs don’t “lie” and that “data” captures irrefutable “truth."" In turn, social media ensures our attention moves on before we are exposed to other perspectives.
Just as a spreadsheet of numbers can be used to support any conclusion if properly filtered, so too can photos and videos support any possible interpretation of an event.
Putting this all together, perhaps the most important lesson we as a society have yet to learn is that as social media becomes increasingly multimedia, there is the temptation to equate visual renditions with “photographic proof.” The truth is that we don’t witness events through photographs. We witness one possible constructed reality of those events through the eyes of individuals telling stories and portraying their own narrative and interpretation of what they see. Just as written descriptions don't represent an exclusive reality, neither does the visual world.
In the end, our camera-saturated world was supposed to bring us closer to one single universal ""truth."" In reality, it has only driven us apart to our many different ""truths,"" while social media has ensured we remain safely within our filter bubbles, rarely exposed to the other side."

From a financial standpoint, the promotion is poised to have its biggest year in history—its first of many—on the strength of a pair of billion-dollar television deals with Fox and NBCUniversal.
Profits will only continue to rise under the current business-friendly (not to mention McMahon-friendly ) Donald Trump administration with its lowered corporate tax rates. WWE is in Year Two of a lucrative, albeit controversial, partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that netted the company an estimated $40 to $45 million in 2018.
WWE is printing money and will be for quite some time. But, unfortunately, money can't buy harmony.

With so many roster spots, so few main event spots, so much ambition and so many thriving independent and international wrestling promotions, WWE has been met with an onslaught of reported sabbaticals , public requests for release , private requests for release and even unrest within Vince McMahon's inner circle .
Both employee and independent contractor morale appear to be reaching tumultuous levels and have become prevalent enough to warrant commentary and criticism from the likes of Drew McIntyre and Chris Jericho .
March 8, 2019 — PWInsider reported Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson turned down new contracts with WWE. They were last seen taking part in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania 35.
April 8, 2019— After canceling an appearance on The Wendy Williams Show at the last minute, Sasha Banks posted a cryptic statement on Twitter.

How to Banish Burnout at Work,www.forbes.com,William Arruda,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2019/04/20/how-to-banish-burnout-at-work/,"Feeling unduly stressed by your job? You’re in the majority. According to research from Deloitte , more than three-quarters of people are in the same burnout boat. U nless you ’re able to swing an early retirement , you need to combat your anxiety before it eats you alive. Stress in the modern workplace
We’ve all seen the burnout memes: people with their faces plopped onto their keyboard or sobbing in the bathroom stall. Yet burnout isn’t always so obvious. Some workers withdraw; others become belligerent, sleep too much, or walk around like zombies. No matter what behaviors they exhibit, they all share one thing in common: a desire not to step foot in the workplace one more day —a feeling that will cast a cloud over all the positive personal brand traits you ’ve worked so hard to develop .
A study by researchers from the University of Zaragoza and the Federal University of São Paulo found that employees who have burnout fall into three categories: lack of development, overload, and neglect. Maybe you’re unchallenged at your gruelingly dull job , or you’re taking on too many pressure-laden responsibilities. Or y our burnout may be linked to a boss who ignores your needs, leaving you too lost or resentful to pipe up.
Sound familiar? Whether your stress began recently or you’ve been dragging yourself through each day for months, you need to reverse this trend . Without intervention, you will continue to feel overwhelmed, and it will eventually interfere with your career goals and personal ambitions. The great thing is, seemingly small strategies can have a big impact on your daily well-being.
While quitting your job and starting over might be the first thing on your mind on your worst days, try to rethink how your daily habits can contribute to your wellness at work before you make any life-altering plans. The following four tactics are rooted in mindfulness and should serve to prevent regular face-on-keyboard episodes.
1. Cut your stress.
We all expect stress to play a part in our lives, but that doesn’t mean it should have a starring role. Limit the effects of anxiety by reducing the number of stressors in your life . When possible, try to renegotiate unreasonable deadlines. Take all your vacation time every year, and don’t worry if that means asking for some help. You may even discuss the possibility of working fewer than 40 hours a week in the office or having a late-start day.
In Denmark, 37 hours of work per week is par for the course, and the Scandinavian country consistently ranks high on the World Happiness Report . Speaking of bliss, try the five-minute Happiness Workout , available on an app. Regardless of what’s on your plate, a mindfulness exercise presents you with a powerful tool to take back your time, energy, and mind space.
2. Rethink your fuel.
Step away from the donuts. Put down that sugary Frappuc c ino. Those treats will only make your burnout worse. Instead, move to a healthier diet filled with nutritional choices. Nature Nate’s Honey Co. recommends snacking on nuts and seeds to boost your vitamin B intake , which helps convert food into energy—vital when you’re stuck at the office and feeling drowsy.
Want comfort? Think protein-rich soups and stews instead of carb-heavy mac and cheese. Crave flavor? Ditch the sour cream and onion potato chips for veggies like jicama accompanied by a low-fat, fresh herb-infused dip. Even if you’re deep in a diet overhaul, incorporate omega-3 fatty acids into meal plans for a mood boost. And pop grains like flaxseed meal from Bob’s Red Mill into baked goods such as cookie dough bites for a protein jolt.
3. Give it a rest.
Guilty of burning the candle at both ends? You’re not doing your brain a favor. Most adults do best on seven to nine hours of sleep per night . Solid rest allows your mind to cycle in and out of REM sleep several times. When you wake, you’ll feel refreshed and alert, which will help you deal with all those unexpected issues life throws your way.
Having trouble getting the recommended dose? Schedule bedtime on your calendar, or use an app to remind you to hit the sack. Once you get that notification, be diligent about setting your phone on silent and resisting the temptation to scan emails or social media. That screen time isn’t good for your stress levels or your ability to drift off. The Calmcast stress reduction app from the stress coach features audio “sleeping pills” like Slumber Party and Bedtime Cleanse that lull you to sleep.
4. Practice the art of declining.
It’s the hardest short word in the English language to say: “No.” Chances are strong that if you’re burning out, you haven’t used it much recently. Though it can be terrifying to tell your boss you can’t tackle an additional project , and it might feel painful to turn away a lucrative side gig, sometimes it’s the most powerful way to reverse your stress.
The first time you say no, you may get pushback. It will pass. Eventually, you’ll start seeing how transformative it can be to show others that you value your time. If a project absolutely has to be completed by you and only you, negotiate the deadline, scheduling it for a time frame that won ’t bury you in multiple commitments. In many cases, they’ll follow suit and stop demanding so much of you. Just make sure you turn down additional duties selectively rather than pushing away opportunities willy-nilly. When something new comes your way, determine whether it fits within your professional boundaries and will help you amplify your personal brand , and then answer accordingly.
When you see signs of burnout, it ’s a signal that you need to make some simple changes. Learn daily coping mechanisms now to stop burnout in its tracks.

Bank Of America Beats The $15 Minimum Wage Movement,www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/04/20/bank-of-america-beats-the-15-minimum-wage-movement/,"Bank of America is jumping ahead of the $15 minimum wage movement. Beginning May 1 st , it will hike its minimum wage to $17, and to $20 by 2021. Other big banks like JPMorgan Chase have already announced plans to hike the minimum wage to $18. As of 2017, Bank of America was the fourth largest employer in the banking sector in the US, with more than 142,000 employees.

Several things. One of them is a tight labor market that has companies competing for a smaller pool of qualified employees. “ In recent months we've seen Target, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others all indicate they're willing to pay a $15 an hour minimum wage as the price to hire good workers from a steadily shrinking labor pool,” says Jeff Yastine, Senior Equities Analyst at BanyanHill Publishing . “So it’s not surprising that Bank of America would as well. In fact, given the need for bank workers with strong math ability and other specialized skills, it’s more surprising that the bank didn't commit to paying $15 a year or two earlier.” Then there are the layoffs and the bad rap banks have with the millennial generation, according to Yastine. “Given the number of layoffs in past years as banks closed branches, and the overall ‘bad rep’ that banks have in general with millennials, my prediction is that BofA and other institutions may find themselves playing catchup, and upping wages still further, in order to attract the necessary people to offset retirements from baby boomers,” he adds. And there’s the rising profitability of big banks, following a string of interest rises by the Federal Reserve, which boosted the “interest rate spread.” That’s the difference between what banks receive on the interest they charge borrowers and the interest they pay depositors. This week, Bank of America reported strong financial results -- as did JPMorgan Bank last week. Both banks cited the favorable interest rate environment as the driver of profitability.

Koyfin “ The Bank itself is doing pretty well from a balance sheet perspective and also wanted to reinvest into their business, outside from the common stock buy-back we've seen from the bigger companies,” says Jordan Awoye, Managing Partner at Awoye Capital. Lastly, there’s a public ploy issue by celebrity executives to reform capitalism w ith the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, “calling out its competition to raise its minimum wage in his annual shareholder letter,” adds Awoye. “From the public's eye, Bank of America is part of this push to tip the scale for the employee market, which ultimately can be amazing PR for the bank.” Awoye sees these wage hikes as being positive for banks and for labor as a whole. “ Slowly but surely , this will start to change the minimum wage landscape,” he adds . “As more and more employers raise their wage levels to keep up with the changes that are happening, the wages for the industry's ground level position will increase across the board.” Provided, of course, that the economy continues to grow for years to come, defying historical norms.

Bulls Seem Sold On Jim Boylen As Long-Term Answer At Head Coach,www.forbes.com,Jason Patt,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonpatt/2019/04/20/bulls-seem-sold-on-jim-boylen-as-long-term-answer-at-head-coach/,"There's a sizable disconnect between the Chicago Bulls and their fan base when it comes to head coach Jim Boylen. While Boylen has come under fire from the fans for poor results and crazy Quote: s to the media, among other things, the Bulls view Boylen as a terrific teacher and motivator whose passion for the game makes him the right head coach for the franchise moving forward: ""The thing that excites me about our head coach is his passion. He has a plan in place for all of our players to get better in the offseason."" - John Paxson
— Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) April 11, 2019
When the Bulls fired Fred Hoiberg and replaced him with Boylen in early December, they didn't even bother with an interim tag. That was a clear sign Chicago was planning on giving Boylen a chance beyond the 2018-19 season. Later in the season, Boylen got a slight raise for 2018-19 and 2019-20, which was part formality but also another hint of what was to come.
There was some speculation that Hoiberg getting a new job at Nebraska may lead to the Bulls doing a full coaching search this summer because of the money freed up, but John Paxson made it clear at the end-of-season press conference that Boylen is their man. And not only is Boylen their man for next season, but it looks like he's going to get a long-term extension.
It’s a game of inches — and dollars. Get the latest sports news and analysis of valuations, signings and hirings, once a week in your inbox, from the Forbes SportsMoney Playbook newsletter. Sign up here .
Paxson called an extension ""very possible"" at the presser, and Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times soon reported a three-year deal was being discussed and could be finalized soon. The Bulls denied the repor t and K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reported no specifics had been discussed, but the expectation is something will happen in the near future:
And while sources indicated no specific contract details have been discussed, those talks will occur “sooner rather than later.” A two- or three-year extension with a team option is the norm in such situations, and both sides envision smooth negotiations.
It's somewhat understandable to not want to have a lame-duck coach, but from the outside, giving Boylen a long-term deal doesn't make much sense. The Bulls went 17-41 under Boylen with long stretches of abysmal play on both sides of the ball and a host of embarrassing defeats even when the team was mostly healthy, including the historic 56-point loss to the Boston Celtics that nearly resulted in a player mutiny because of Boylen's antics.
Opposing players took notice of what happened. Multiple guys clowned the Bulls over the incident and Boylen's hard-charging ways , and a recent player poll in The Athletic had Boylen finishing as No. 2 among coaches they'd least like to play for. Boylen also had several run-ins with opposing coaches that didn't reflect well on his professionalism. And, of course, there were all the goofy, cliché-filled Quote: s to the media.
But while many on the outside view Boylen as a laughingstock, the Bulls love what he's doing with the team in their building, per Johnson:
“I envision Jim being our coach here and us committing to him,” Paxson said at his season-ending news conference at the Advocate Center. “In our estimation, he has done terrific things as far as establishing what we want in this building and with this organization, especially on the practice floor, how to carry yourself and how to work.
“I can tell you this: Jim had a (Thursday) meeting with our players, probably about a half-hour. It was spot-on about expectations. I’ve been sitting in on some player end-of-season meetings, and I can tell you that the thing that excites me about our direction with our head coach is his passion and his care level for our players and this organization. He wants our players to get better. He has a plan in place for all of them in order to do so this offseason, and that’s very encouraging.
“Given the summer and given the opportunity to go into training camp next year with his own beliefs and philosophy will be an advantage for us.”
Like it or not, Boylen is going to be head coach of the Chicago Bulls next season, and perhaps years to come unless things bomb again. There was some clear progress on the court in February, and he seemed to improve his relationship with his players as the year went on, namely Zach LaVine after a rocky start.
But there's still plenty of reason to question this decision as the Bulls yet again fail to conduct a real coaching search. Paxson and Boylen are two peas in a pod as old-school guys, and Pax might just be going with the ""easy"" choice because he's comfortable with it and fully approves of Boylen's no-nonsense methods. President and COO Michael Reinsdorf has also lauded Boylen , and it's pretty clear the coach has worked hard to ingratiate himself with management.
Jim Boylen could very well wind up having success as head coach of the Bulls, but he still has a lot of proving to do to a healthy amount of rightful skeptics. And if this fails spectacularly, there needs to be accountability in management for this process."
Spirit Airlines Edges Out Delta Air Lines As Most On-Time Air Carrier So Far In 2019,www.forbes.com,Grant Martin,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/grantmartin/2019/04/20/spirit-airlines-edges-out-delta-air-lines-as-most-on-time-air-carrier-so-far-in-2019/,"New data published by the Department of Transportation last week revealed that so far in 2019, Spirit Airlines is the most on-time carrier within the contiguous 48 states. Spirit Airlines, the low cost carrier based in Miramar, Flordia has been fighting Delta Air Lines in a monthly, tit-for-tat a battle to see which carrier can deliver the most flights on time. In January, Spirit delivered 82.9% of its flights on time while Delta hit 82.7%. February, the most recent month reported in April's Air Travel Consumer Report, saw Delta move ahead of Spirit to deliver 81.6% of flights on time while Spirit fell to 77.7%. On average through the year, however, Spirit is still ahead of Delta 80.5% to 80.4%.
The number one carrier for each month (and most months) was Hawaiian Airlines, a carrier based out of Honolulu that is rarely affected by weather delays.
On-time performance as measured by the Department of Transportation is a matter of both operational efficiency and pride for U.S. carriers. High marks in on-time performance means that the carrier is turning around airplanes cleanly and minimizing delays, which is perhaps the most important part of the equation. But there's also a lot of marketing value in having a high on-time performance statistic: when passengers see that an airline is running on time, they feel more comfortable about booking business with that carrier.
Perhaps in part because of that marketing value, Spirit Air Lines has been prioritizing on-time performance over the last year. The Department of Transportation's report on 2018 in full showed that Spirit had pulled ahead of American and United, two of its legacy competitors, while it was hot on the tail of Delta Air Lines. Based on January and February data, it now looks like the two carriers are almost tied in terms of performance.
This isn't to say that American and United aren't trying to improve on-time performance, each just has a different approach. Over the last few years, American Airlines has prioritized a ""D0"" policy that aims to push aircraft away from gates at exactly zero minutes to departure, regardless of external influences. Unfortunately, that effort has been hampered by the sheer size of American's fleet, integration issues with US Airways and the number of hubs at the carrier that are prone to weather events. Until recently, United also had a similar policy, but that's starting to change. In March, that carrier started to flexibly hold flights at some airports in a tradeoff between on time performance and passenger satisfaction; eventually, that experiment may end up driving down the carrier's overall statistic measured by the Department of Transportation.
Spirit, for its part, has the benefit of working with a relatively smaller fleet compared to the big three legacy carriers and a network of hubs that are less prone to weather events (including the notable absence of a massive New York City presence). Those factors will help propel Spirit to the top of the on-time performance leaderboard – and if the carrier is careful, it may just overtake Delta in 2019's rankings."
"Khalid Owns Nine Spots On The Hot 100 This Week, Marking The Best Frame Of His Career",www.forbes.com,Hugh McIntyre,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/04/20/khalid-owns-nine-spots-on-the-hot-100-this-week-marking-the-best-frame-of-his-career/,"As his sophomore album rules the Billboard 200 , Khalid also dominates the Hot 100 singles chart with more hits than anyone else on the important tally. In fact, this week has turned out to be the best in an already stellar career for the R&B musician, as he controls more real estate at one time than ever before. This week, Khalid’s name appears in nine slots on the Hot 100, a feat reserved for only the most popular figures, and typically only when they drop new albums. While he may not be sitting atop the all-genre songs ranking, owning nine spots is very impressive, especially since only a few are debuts, meaning the rest have been performing well for some time now.
Leading the way is Khalid’s current single “Better,” which this frame bolts into the top 10 . While the song isn’t his first appearance inside the highest tier on the Hot 100 (it’s his fourth, actually), it is his first to reach the region unaccompanied by another artist.
Four recent hits all come next, with “Eastside,” which is powered by super-producer Benny Blanco and which features Halsey, settling at No. 14. Following that former top 10 smash is recent single “Talk” at No. 18, “My Bad” at No. 55 and “Saturday Nights” with Kane Brown just two rungs down. “Talk” was originally released as a single from Khalid’s 2018 EP Suncity (though it’s featured on his new full-length as well), as was the solo version of “Saturday Nights.” The new take, which features country talent Kane Brown, is present on the current chart-topping album Free Spirit , which also counts “My Bad” as a promotional cut.
A quartet of debuts round out his nine appearances on the Hot 100 this week, meaning more than half of his current charting singles have already spent some time on the listing at some point. “Outta My Head,” which credits John Mayer as a featured act, is new at No. 58 (just one step behind “Saturday Nights”). Another collab, “Don’t Pretend,” this time with an act named SAFE, begins at No. 84. Two fellow Free Spirit album cuts, “Bad Luck” and “Right Back,” enter at Nos. 87 and 93, respectively.

Spurs' Early Postseason Success Points Young Future In Right Direction,www.forbes.com,Rob Wolkenbrod,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robwolkenbrod/2019/04/20/spurs-early-postseason-success-points-young-future-in-right-direction/,"""How will the San Antonio Spurs thrive after the Big 3 and Kawhi Leonard?"" was realistic. Hall of Fame players were around for most of head coach Gregg Popovich's tenure, and long-term success seemed in question unless the Spurs could rebuild from within, again. Well, three games into this postseason series against the Denver Nuggets — the first real test for the Afterlife Spurs — the Silver and Black have proven on a national stage that they did it again.
LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan were acquired from outside the organization, so it's not a full draft-and-develop rebuild. The same with Rudy Gay in 2017. They are also the team's top three scorers and age 29 and up; however, they have not held the postseason spotlight.
Derrick White was the little-known guard from Colorado , who the Spurs selected at the bottom of the first round in 2017. They placed him in the G League for most of 2017-18, so by this season, he was an unknown name in a smaller basketball market.
Now, three games into San Antonio's series with the Denver Nuggets, White has 23 points per game on 69 percent shooting. He has yet to shoot below 63 percent in any game this series. The 36 points in Game 3 were also a career-high after topping out at 26 points in the regular season.
Maybe it comes down to the opponent alone, but White's national breakout has the Spurs' future shining bright. They have a healthy, young backcourt player to handle one position and succeed the outgoing Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker, with the ability to impact both ends of the court and return the Silver and Black to the defensive glory of their championship era.
More of a complementary piece to the playoff run, Bryn Forbes has seven three-pointers in three playoff games. He became part of the outside shooting — at 42.6 percent — that brought this from one of the NBA's worst shooting teams in 2017-18 to the top squad in three-point percentage for 2018-19.
Forbes' opportunity arose upon opportunity. Dejounte Murray was expected to take over as the point guard on opening night, until a torn ACL in the preseason shattered his season. White and Lonnie Walker IV suffered injuries around the same time, which forced the Michigan State product into the starting lineup for 81 of 82 games, something he did just 12 times in his first full year.
That is not to leave Murray out, either. He should still garner a top backcourt role upon return, but White's emergence and Walker's inevitable playing-time rise should reduce that on-court time somewhat, especially after a major injury that will see him off the court for a full year.
The final young pieces to the puzzle are Jakob Poeltl and Davis Bertans — big men who don't possess top roles but make enough impact on the game. Poeltl might not put up dominant numbers, but he lets Popovich use two big-man lineups and use that seven-foot frame to block the hoop. Bertans is a stretch four, who's under contract through 2019-20 and shoots 42 percent from behind the arc, although his role in the playoffs has been small.
Still, the Spurs have pieces to look forward to, all of which were drafted and developed, signed as a free agent in Forbes' case or traded for like Poeltl. They will need more down the road, as Aldridge ages, DeRozan's contract runs and even Gay's impending free agency, but developing this new era is off to a positive start, and if it can lead to greater success this postseason, their future will only shine brighter."

($6 million Friday/$16 million weekend/$120 million 17-day total) and Captain Marvel ($3.1 million Friday/$9 million weekend/$400 million domestic total), Universal/Comcast’s Little earned $3.323 million (-46%) on its second Friday. That positions the Will Packer-produced comedy for an $8.539 million (-45%) weekend and $29.46 million ten-day total. Barring a fluke, Tina Gordon’s Marsai Martin/Regina Hall/Issa Rae comedy will earn around $47 million by the time it leaves theaters or about 2.35x its $20 million budget. Unless it does absolutely nothing overseas, it should be in break-even territory by the time it arrives in post-theatrical. Walt Disney’s Dumbo earned $2.44 million (-41%) on its fourth Friday for a likely $6.99 million (-26%) fourth weekend and $101.4 million 24-day domestic cume. This one is still a big miss, and now there’s more pressure on Aladdin than there otherwise would have been even as Avengers: Endgame prepares to crush all comers. Paramount/Viacom’s Pet Semetary earned $1.756 million (-40%) on Friday for a likely $4.564 million (-53%) third weekend and $49.3 million 17-day cume. It’s doing fine, as it’s a $21 million-budgeted, R-rated horror flick about dead kids and dead animals, but it’s certainly no breakout smash.
Jordan Peele’s Us is absolutely a breakout smash, even if it may not catch up to A Quiet Place ’s $189 million domestic finish (#CanThisFranchiseBeSaved?). The $20 million, R-rated original earned $1.785 million (-41%) on Friday for a likely $4.343 million (-36%) fifth weekend and a $170.525 million domestic cume. It should be past the $176 million cume of Get Out within the next two weeks, and (barring a miracle elsewhere) it will probably be the year’s biggest wholly original live-action flick. That will make said distinction a horror movie for the third year in a row.
Laika’s Missing Link earned $1.433 million (-44%) on Friday for a likely $4.227 million (-29%) weekend and $12.834 million ten-day total. This is still a massive disappointment for the Annapurna/UA release and for the Laika brand in general. Let’s hope Travis Knight funnels his Six Billion Dollar Man paycheck into the next Laika flick. Millennium and Lionsgate’s Hellboy reboot earned $1.323 million (-73%) on Friday, setting the stage for a miserable $3.69 million (-69.4%) second weekend and $19.48 million ten-day total. If that holds, it’ll be the fifth-biggest second-weekend drop ever for a “big” comic book superhero flick.
After will earn $2.604 million (-57%) in weekend two to give the YA romantic drama a meh $10.54 million ten-day cume. Doing better in that department is CBS Films and Lionsgate’s Five Feet Apart , which will earn $758,000 (-51%) in its sixth weekend for a $45.21 million domestic cume. Unplanned will have $17.3 million after 24 days while The Best of Enemies will have just $9.545 million after its third weekend. It’s no Green Book , which will now sit with $85 million domestic after 23 weekends in theaters. How to Train Your Dragon 3 will have $159 million by tomorrow."
Zoom IPO: What Can Entrepreneurs Learn From The Mega Success?,www.forbes.com,Tom Taulli,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2019/04/20/zoom-ipo-what-can-entrepreneurs-learn-from-the-mega-success/,"While much of the attention for IPOs this year has been on high-profile operators like Slack, Lyft, Uber and Pinterest, the standout deal has so far been Zoom . Last week the company launched its offering and the stock rocketed by 72% on its first day of trading, putting the market cap at nearly $16 billion. Now Zoom is among one of the most valuable cloud companies in the world. All this is the vision of Eric Yuan, the company's founder and CEO.
Here's a backgrounder: While attending college in China during the 1980s, he majored in Computer Science because he admired tech entrepreneurs like Bill Gates. By 1997, Eric came to America – after much difficulties with the immigration system – and joined the engineering team at WebEx. It proved fortuitous as the company would revolutionize the conferencing market.
Then by 2007, WebEx sold out to Cisco and unfortunately, the innovation started to lag. Eric tried to push for change but he was mostly rebuffed. In 2011 he started Zoom, raising a seed round from a variety of angels.
As should be no surprise, Eric was fairly unconventional in his strategy -- that is, by the standards of Silicon Valley. For example, he did not spend lavishly (the original offices were quite modest) and there was little emphasis on sales and marketing.
All in all, the formula has been spot on. As of today, Zoom is growing at 100%+ and is profitable. There are also 50,000 corporate customers and 344 of them pay over $100,000 a year.
OK then, what are the takeaways for entrepreneurs? What are the lessons here that can help with your own venture? Well, let’s take a look:
Customer First : Eric is obsessed with making the best product possible. Keep in mind that he worked on the Zoom platform for two years before it was launched. He would also personally answer questions from customers and reached out to every customer that cancelled.
The bottom line: Zoom has a Net Promoter Score (NPS) over 70.
“Zoom succeeded when so many others didn't,” said Roy Raanani, who is the co-founder and CEO of Chorus.ai . “When Eric started the business, he knew the video conferencing industry intimately and understood that existing products didn't meet user needs. He had a vision that everyone should ‘Meet Happy' and focused on creating a simple product experience that ‘Just Works,’ hiring a great team that focused on executing the fundamentals right, and putting customer and employee happiness at the center of Zoom's culture.”
Viral : Conferencing is inherently viral and allows for the creation of network effects that can make it tough for competitors to attack. Granted, this is not easy to pull off but Eric’s focus on creating a strong product has been critical.
The Zoom S-1 notes : “Our rapid adoption is driven by a virtuous cycle of positive user experiences. Individuals typically begin using our platform when a colleague or associate invites them to a Zoom meeting. When attendees experience our platform and realize the benefits, they often become paying customers to unlock additional functionality.”
Big Market, Big Problem : When Eric founded Zoom, there was lots of skepticism. Wasn’t the market already won? How could he battle against rivals like Microsoft, Google, WebEx and GoToMeeting?
But like any entrepreneur, Eric was convinced of his vision. He understood that there was much that could be done in the industry, which was not investing enough in new technologies.
“The Cardinal rule for any startup: Solve a really big problem and solve it well,” said Jamie Sutherland, who is the founder and CEO of Sonix . “Zoom did this. While there was lots of rhetoric around the idea that video conferencing had been solved, the reality was that it wasn’t really solved well. Everyone...literally every human I knew had pains with video conferencing. And when it doesn't work, it is a huge pain. So, couple that with an enormous global market, and you've got a huge opportunity.”

"In Medicare-For-All Debate, Insurers Bet They're Loved More Than Bernie",www.forbes.com,Bruce Japsen,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/04/20/in-medicare-for-all-debate-insurers-bet-theyre-loved-more-than-bernie/?ss=healthcare,"Health insurance executives are increasingly betting that Americans like private coverage more than health benefits that would only be administered by the government given public statements by CEOs and information pushed by their lobbyists. As presidential hopeful U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and some Democrats push a single payer version of Medicare for All that would replace the private healthcare system, health insurers are countering with more aggressive responses, touting their worth to U.S. consumers and patients. Insurers are touting their businesses and noting Americans are buying what they have to offer backed by polls and surveys saying consumers are satisfied.
Take UnitedHealth Group’s CEO, who led off the company’s 80-minute first quarter earnings call this past week talking for several minutes about the benefits of the private insurer’s role working with the government in administering U.S. healthcare benefits.
“The best system is one which is informed, engaged and aligned, where people, their doctors and the private and public sectors work together to improve or sustain individual health, while improving the performance of health systems – for everyone,” UnitedHealth Group CEO David Wichmann said.
And other health insurance CEOs are also speaking out, talking about the expense of Medicare for All and doubting whether it will even happen given how entrenched the private sector is. More than 20 million Americans are now enrolled in private Medicare Advantage plans and most U.S. Medicaid beneficiaries get coverage from a private insurer that contracts with states, reports show.
On the day Centene CEO Michael Neidorff announced the proposed acquisition of WellCare Health plans, he talked about a 10-year cost of Medicare for All of more than $25 trillion and touted insurer efforts to expand benefits in partnership with the government. “We cannot afford it,” Neidorff said on a conference call March 27.
Centene, which already provides coverage for 2 million individually insured Americans under the Affordable Care Act, administers Medicaid benefits and would have an expanded role in Medicare Advantage once the WellCare Health Plan deal closes.
“We have to look at the practical, the political and everything I saw said: This is a great transaction,” Neidorff said. “It put two great companies together in a very meaningful way serving a lot of audiences that you can never do enough to serve.”
Both politicians and health insurers tout studies and polls showing people like both Medicare for All and private coverage.
America’s Health Insurance Plans, which lobbies for most large health insurers including Centene, Cigna and Anthem, released a survey last year showing more than 70% of Americans “satisfied” with their “employer-provided health coverage.”
Meanwhile, other research published by independent organizations shows Americans tend to be satisfied with their private and employer coverage but that could be waning a bit.
The Kaiser Family Foundation, which has monthly tracking polls and other surveys rating the public’s perception of health coverage, showed 83% of Americans rated their employer-based coverage as “excellent” or “good” and 17% said it was ""not so good"" or ""poor,"" in a 2016 survey. In 2010, 92% said their employer coverage was ""excellent"" or ""good"" and just 7% said it was ""not so good"" or ""poor.""
""Overall, a majority of these individuals rate their coverage favorably, but we did find a slight decrease in favorability from 2010 to 2016,"" says Ashley Kirzinger , associate director of Kaiser's polling team."
What Is The Number One Killer Of People Ages 5 to 29?,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/20/what-is-the-number-one-killer-of-people-ages-5-to-29/?ss=healthcare,"It is the leading cause of death among children and young adults around the world. It is the ninth leading cause of death overall globally. It resulted in about 1.35 million people dying in 2016 alone. It will probably become the seventh leading killer worldwide by 2030. If you are currently a member of Generation Z, this is what you are at greatest risk of dying from: road traffic injuries. That's because according to the 2018 Global Status on Road Safety from the World Health Organization (WHO) , such injuries constitute the number one killer of those who are five to 29 years old. That's why Bloomberg Philanthropies started its Initiative for Global Road Safety to address the road safety problem.
Unless you are Aquaman or live in a very remote location, you probably regularly deal with road traffic in some way. Even if you are five years old and don't have a real car or a driver's license yet (by the way, you shouldn't have either), you still have to worry about this major global problem. Pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists comprise over half of all traffic-related deaths. Breaking it down further, 26% of all road traffic deaths were pedestrians and cyclists, 28% were drivers of two- or three-wheeled vehicles, 29% were car occupants, and 17% were ""unidentified road users."" Add to the deaths, the up to 50 million who survive road traffic accidents but suffer injuries each year.
Although getting run over by a pig or a cow is probably no picnic, the rise in road traffic injuries is certainly connected to the rise in automobile and other individual motorized vehicle usage around the world. Contrary to what you may see on the Flintstones, cars really have only been around for less than a century-and-a-half. But the growth in the number of motorized vehicles over a relatively short period of time has been remarkable. As the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates, in just a three-year period, 2010 to 2013, the number of registered vehicles around the world increased by 16%. It can be challenging to measure the total number of motorized vehicles since many vehicles may go unregistered and that's not counting the DeLoreans that are time traveling. But there are estimates that over 1.2 billion cars are out there.
The trouble is the rise and spread of such vehicles have been so rapid that many of the existing surrounding systems haven't been able to keep pace. Or in many cases, the wrong systems were in place in the first place. This is true all around the world, but especially in many low- and middle-income countries. To address these systems, Bloomberg Philanthropies' Initiative for Global Road Safety first looked at what may be contributing to these problems and how best to address them. This included collecting and analyzing lots of data on road safety. As Kelly Henning, MD , who leads the Bloomberg Philanthropies' Public Health program, explained, ""Down to the city level, all the work that we do is data driven. This meant increasing the surveillance that is occurring and the strength of data.""
Sarah Whitehead of Vital Strategies, an implementing partner of the Initiative, added, ""In many places, there isn't a data use culture. There are many gaps in data, and some like the police may tightly hold the relevant data. It is important to get higher quality data.""

Courtesy of Bloomberg Philanthropies Former New York City Mayor and founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies Mike Bloomberg said, ""Over the last decade, we’ve invested $259 million to implement solutions that are proven to prevent road deaths and injuries such as wearing helmets and seat-belts, reducing speeding and drinking and driving, redesigning city streets, and advocating for safer vehicles."" Bloomberg Philanthropies and their partners have been focusing on the following five categories of interventions to try to curb road traffic injuries:
1. Changing driving and riding behaviors.
These interventions aim to reduce the behaviors that make driving for everyone, including those not driving, far more risky. One is driving while impaired. Traditionally, the most common culprit has been alcohol. If you don't understand how alcohol may affect your thinking, your reasoning, your reaction times, your muscle coordination and thus your driving ability, put down your beer and your driver's license and step away from the car. You don't even have to be anywhere near the legal limits of blood alcohol levels to have problems driving. As the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) relays , 2017 saw 1,837 people killed where drivers had blood alcohol levels that were below the legal limit (that is, between 0.01 to 0.07 g/dL).
There is no question that alcohol-impaired driving remains a major problem. Just take a look at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for some stark statistics for the U.S. alone : ""Every day, 29 people in the United States die in motor vehicle crashes that involve an alcohol-impaired driver. This is one death every 50 minutes. The annual cost of alcohol-related crashes totals more than $44 billion."" Certainly, alcohol is not the only thing that can cloud your mind. With marijuana use increasing, driving while under the influence of marijuana is certainly a growing concern, pun intended. Then there are opioids. A study of two-vehicle crashes published in JAMA Network Open found that drivers who had tested positive for prescription opioids were 2.18 times more likely to have initiated the car crash.
Another risky behavior is not wearing seat belts. A seat belt is potentially more comfortable to wear (and safer) than a tight thong or a pair of skinny pants. Yet, according to the NHTSA , nearly ten percent of Americans (or 27.5 million people) still don't wear their seat belts. This despite the findings that buckling up can prevent fatal injuries by 45% to 65%
A third example of a risky behavior is speed. Not the movie or the drug (although you should not take speed or watch the movie and drive), but driving fast. Per the NHTSA , driving over the posted speed limits contributed to 26% of all traffic deaths in the U.S. in 2017.
A final example is not wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle. Without a helmet, the only thing that's protecting your head is your hair, which no matter how big it is will not be enough to prevent fatal head injuries.
2. Improving infrastructure.
These interventions recognize the fact that streets, sidewalks, and everything around them form complex systems that can either protect people or put them at risk, depending on how they are designed. For example, narrowing streets and the turning radii around corners can prevent cars from speeding and widening sidewalks and adding safer crosswalks can give pedestrians more protection. Changes that have occurred under the Bloomberg Initiative have i ncluded constructing a 300-meter pedestrian walkway close to a school in Accra, Ghana, and nearly doubling the total extent of safe bike lanes and establishing the first slow-speed zone (with raised pedestrian crossings and curb extensions) in Fortaleza, Brazil. If you want to see other ways that roads, sidewalks, and the spaces around both can be designed to facilitate safety, take a look at the Global Street Design Guide , written by the Global Designing Cities Initiative (GDCI) and the National Association of City Transportation (NACTO) . Skye Duncan, Director of the GDCI, walked through a lot of the different ways that design principles are being implemented in different cities around the world and explained how the ""behaviors of both drivers and pedestrians are affected greatly by the design around them."" Duncan added, ""The guide can serve as a blueprint to help undo the design that has occurred in many locations. This will help protect people and make locations much more accessible to everyone.""
Bloomberg is a believer in such design changes. When he was Mayor of New York City, between 2007 and 2013, his administration's Department of Transportation redesigned 137 street corridors and 113 intersections, which helped create 180 more acres of safe space for cyclists and pedestrians. Janette Sadik-Khan , who is currently the Permanent Chair of the GDCI Initiative, a principal at Bloomberg Associates, and an author of the book Streetfight: Handbook for an Urban Revolution , had helped implement a number of road safety design initiatives when she had run New York City Department of Transportation in Mayor Bloomberg's administration. It is probably no coincidence that traffic deaths in New York City fell by 45% from 2001 to 2017 and that traffic fatalities fell by 34% where the Department of Transportation had made major engineering changes. Sadik-Khan explained that ""there shouldn't be an auto-centric approach to designing streets. Streets and sidewalks are also about moving people.""
3. Adding and augmenting sustainable urban support.
Robert Frost once spoke of taking the road less traveled by and how that made all the difference. He probably wasn't talking about road safety, but fewer cars traveling on the road will naturally lead to a lower risk of accidents. Therefore, part of the work of the Bloomberg Initiative has been trying to further develop alternatives to cars and motorbikes. This includes augmenting mass transit systems, bike routes, and walking infrastructures.
4. Establishing more rigorous vehicle standards.
Around the world, cars can be like clothes, varying substantially in design and in some cases leaving you really exposed. While there are established safety standard in countries like the U.S., Japan, and Germany, many low- and middle-income countries may have little or no regulatory standards for vehicles. The Bloomberg Initiative has been pushing for greater safety standard in a number of different cities. For example, in Accra, Ghana, efforts helped remove over 200 defective motorbikes from the road.
5. Strengthening policies and regulations .
Henning said that ""There is a need for the right policies and regulations, as well as strong police enforcement as people have to understand the consequences of behavior. Governments need to buy into road safety and have the political will to reduce fatalities."" Examples of changes that have occurred under the Bloomberg Initiative are new provisions in Shanghai, China, on seat-belt use for all vehicle occupants, child restraint-use and helmet use, greater enforcement of helmet use and red light laws in Accra, Ghana, and training of city officials and traffic police in road safety practices in Mumbai, India.
A big part of the Bloomberg Initiative has been bringing more attention to this global killer. If you were to ask people what is the leading cause of death among children and young adults around the world, you may get other answers, ranging from drugs to Thanos. That's why Vital Strategies has been putting together campaigns to increase awareness such as this video on speeding for Bangkok, Thailand:
And this video on drunk driving for São Paulo, Brazil:
Pretty powerful stuff, even if you don't understand Portuguese.
Yes, road traffic injuries are a leading killer. But as Bloomberg said, ""The good news is we know the interventions that could prevent many of them."" In other words, the roads to reducing deaths are there. We just have to take them."
Anora: The Smart Glove Helping The Blind,www.forbes.com,Rebecca Banovic,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccabanovic/2019/04/20/anora-the-smart-glove-helping-the-blind/?ss=healthcare,"Nikola Krstic , a graduate from the Electrical Engineering School in Belgrade, has created a smart glove prototype called Anora- that helps the blind and visually impaired move unaided without a service dog or white cane. The glove is equipped with ultrasonic sensors that explore the surroundings: it provides vibrotactile feedback on the position of the closest obstacles in range and lets users know by a vibrating motor and voice app. The Anora smart glove has many different multi-functions.
Spatial Orientation - The user will be able to detect the distance from objects through the use of haptic technology in the glove.
Colour Recognition - Through a click of a button, the glove will be able to say aloud the colour of the object the user has in their hand.
Detection of light intensity - The user can be told whether they are in a room present with light, and at the same time, whether the light is natural or artificial.
The glove will be able to say the date and time to the user.
Panic Button - If the user is lost, through a combination of buttons, the glove will be able to send the location via text message to a guardian or friend, whose contact details are stored in the app connected to the glove.
Recognition of money - One of the most sought-after functions, the glove is able to say the value of the notes and change the user holds in their hand.
The glove also has a small camera installed, which provides information on the emotions of the person the user is talking to.
Most recently, Mr Krstic has signed a co-operation contract, which will enable further development, promotion and implementation of the Anora smart glove domestically in Serbia. Easy Tech and the ‘Alliance of the Blind' Serbia, signed a co-operation agreement on the 10th of April. The signed agreement means a collaboration that will result in a large number of blind people being able to try the innovative product. The contract was signed at the Science Technology Park in Belgrade, by Nikola Krstić and Milan Stošić, the president of the ‘Alliance of the Blind'.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , it is globally estimated that 1.3 billion people live with some form of distance or near vision impairment. Approximately, 36 million people are blind, 188.5 million have mild vision impairment, 217 million have moderate to severe vision impairment.
Thus far, the Anora smart glove has been tested on 30 blind individuals in Serbia- and the reception has been positive.
""Generally, all the functions of the glove are of use to blind people. They say they like it. Also, they have not had the opportunity to use a device of this kind before,"" says Mr Krstic
""Of course, alongside the positive reviews, there are objections and suggestions as to which functions need to be added, changed and how. But, all of this is extremely useful information to us because we are going to make a device that is tailored to their needs.""
There has been research and explorations into a smart glove for the blind, but many of them are a single function. Anora is the first multi-functional smart glove.
Last year, the Anora smart glove was the winner of ‘Sarajevo Unlimited'- the largest regional forum for innovation, entrepreneurship and technology in the region of south-eastern Europe.
However, Mr Krstic is positive and would like to see the Anora smart glove develop and expand beyond Serbia and the Balkans.
""Over the next few months, we will be focusing on the development of the final version of the smart glove. We will focus on three elements: material selection, glove design, manufacture of electronics and software. Once we have finished with those three elements, we will have an ""almost-finished"" product that will go through a final round of testing. If the final product is adequate- we will finally be ready to come out onto the market."""
WannaCry Hero Marcus Hutchins Pleads Guilty To Creating Banking Malware,www.forbes.com,Davey Winder,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/04/20/wannacry-hero-marcus-hutchins-pleads-guilty-to-creating-banking-malware/?ss=healthcare,"Marcus Hutchins, perhaps best known by his MalwareTech alias, has pleaded guilty to two criminal charges related to creating and distributing malware. In May 2017, Hutchins was hailed as a hero after playing a pivotal role in stopping the global spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack. That heroic status was tarnished when, as he travelled home following the Black Hat and Def Con security conferences, Hutchins was arrested by the FBI at the Las Vegas McCarran International Airport. The charge shocked most everyone in the information security industry: that of creating the Kronos malware that stole the passwords of online banking customers. Hutchins was further charged, some ten months later, with creating another piece of malware known as UPAS Kit and working with a co-conspirator to market and sell both of them on the dark market.
Court documents obtained by ZDNet writer Catalin Cimpanu reveal that Hutchins could face ten years in prison having pleaded guilty to two of the ten counts against him: distributing Kronos and conspiracy to create and distribute malware.
In a short public statement posted online at his MalwareTech site, Hutchins says that ""I've pleaded guilty to two charges related to writing malware in the years prior to my career in security. I regret these actions and accept full responsibility for my mistakes.""
Hutchins also says that ""Having grown up, I've since been using the same skills that I misused several years ago for constructive purposes. I will continue to devote my time to keeping people safe from malware attacks."" This is something that will resonate with many in the security industry, and no doubt polarize opinion as well. The employment of former ""black hat"" hackers to help protect networks and data is seen by some as an obvious positive, the poacher turned gamekeeper experience argument, while others maintain that those guilty of criminal hacking cannot be trusted in a ""white hat"" role.
I am firmly in the former camp as many of us have done things in our younger years that we wouldn't do now, and Hutchins has spent his time while awaiting trial in Los Angeles teaching others how to analyze malware. His actions during the WannaCry attack, when he spotted an unregistered domain in the ransomware code that he then registered himself that became a kill switch, without doubt saved many organizations from being infected. I'm not saying that he should not atone for his crimes, but I am equally certain that his actions as one of the world's most talented security researchers should be balanced against the mistakes he made earlier in life."
