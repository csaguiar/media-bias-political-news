"UPDATE - US Envoy Volker Says Russia Using RT, Sputnik to Influence Situation in Ukraine",www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/update-us-envoy-volker-says-russia-using-rt-587129.html,"UPDATE - US Envoy Volker Says Russia Using RT, Sputnik To Influence Situation In Ukraine Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) 22 hours ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 09:20 PM
MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker said on Friday that Russia was using RT broadcaster and Sputnik news agency as tools to influence the situation in Ukraine , which held the first round of the presidential election last week.
Volker was asked by PBS NewsHour's correspondent Nick Schifrin about Russian President Vladimir Putin potentially ""testing"" Ukrainian presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy or ""using this moment as a way to somehow change the status quo"" in Ukraine .
""I think we can assume, based on Russia 's behavior up to now, that they will continue to test whoever is the president of Ukraine . They � they have invaded. They have taken territory. They keep the fighting going. You see all kinds of propaganda, RT, Sputnik, cyberattacks. The whole � the whole toolbox is on display in Ukraine ,"" Volker said.
Answering a question on whether Russia was ""manipulating"" the Ukrainian election , the US envoy claimed ""they're trying to.""
""At the same time, it's very hard to mess with people's own sense of their own interests. And I'm not sure they had an impact in the first round. I'm not sure they will have an impact in the second round,"" Volker said.
Ukraine's incumbent President Petro Poroshenko came second in the first round of the presidential election with nearly 16 percent, while Zelenskiy secured over 30 percent of the vote . They will face each other in the runoff on April 21.
The conflict in Ukraine broke out in 2014 when two eastern regions refused to recognize a drastic power change in Kiev and took up arms against the central government in the wake of Crimea's secession and reunion with Russia . Ukraine and Western powers accused Russia of stirring the conflict and meddling in eastern Ukraine , a claim rejected by Moscow , which says it has no part in its neighbor's domestic conflict.
In recent years, the struggle against the Russian media has become a common topic in the West. In November 2016 , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on ""EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties"" which stated that the Russian authorities were allegedly employing a wide range of tools and instruments, including Sputnik and RT, ""to challenge democratic values"" and ""divide Europe .""
Commenting on the resolution , Russian President Vladimir Putin said it proved that Western democracy was failing, but expressed hope that common sense would prevail and Russian media outlets would be able to work abroad without restrictions.
Apart from that, Western politicians have repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in foreign elections. Moscow has refuted all allegations as baseless. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Pelosi Accused of Deploying 'Most Dishonest Argument' Against Medicare for All,www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/04/05/pelosi-accused-deploying-most-dishonest-argument-against-medicare-all?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=socialnetwork,"The Speaker was also slammed for echoing insurance industry talking points against single-payer
by Jake Johnson, staff writer 0 Comments Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks during her weekly news conference at the U.S. Capitol April 4, 2019 in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came under fire from single-payer proponents Thursday after she deployed what one healthcare policy expert described as ""probably the most dishonest argument in the entire Medicare for All debate.""
""People who love their employer-based insurance do not get to hold on to it in our current system. Instead, they lose that insurance constantly, all the time. It is a complete nightmare.""
—Matt Bruenig, People's Policy Project
In an interview with the Washington Post , the Democratic leader said she is ""agnostic"" on Medicare for All and claimed, ""A lot of people love having their employer-based insurance and the Affordable Care Act gave them better benefits.""
Matt Bruenig, founder of the left-wing think tank People's Policy Project, argued in a blog post that Pelosi's statement ""implies that, under our current health insurance system, people who like their employer-based insurance can hold on to it.""
""This then is contrasted with a Medicare for All transition where people will lose their employer-based insurance as part of being shifted over to an excellent government plan,"" Bruenig wrote. ""But the truth is that people who love their employer-based insurance do not get to hold on to it in our current system. Instead, they lose that insurance constantly, all the time, over and over again. It is a complete nightmare.""
To illustrate his point, Bruenig highlighted a University of Michigan study showing that among Michiganders ""who had employer-sponsored insurance in 2014, only 72 percent were continuously enrolled in that insurance for the next 12 months.
""This means that 28 percent of people on an employer plan were not on that same plan one year later,"" Bruenig noted.
People Lose Their Employer-Sponsored Insurance Constantly
https://t.co/PI4EwRuIDk pic.twitter.com/2JiBhhuHeV
— Matt Bruenig (@MattBruenig) April 5, 2019
""Critics of Medicare for All are right to point out that losing your insurance sucks,"" Bruenig concluded. ""But the only way to stop that from happening to people is to create a seamless system where people do not constantly churn on and off of insurance. Medicare for All offers that. Our current system offers the exact opposite. If you like losing your insurance all the time, then our current healthcare system is the right one for you.""
All On Medicare—a pro-Medicare for All Twitter account—slammed Pelosi's remarks, accusing the Democratic leader of parroting insurance industry talking points:
Jesus Christ, @SpeakerPelosi -- why not just let a lobbyist from @AHIPCoverage be Speaker? You literally say the same things! https://t.co/lbGe3xPX6E pic.twitter.com/DIxPRQXWR2
— All On Medicare (@AllOnMedicare) April 5, 2019
The Speaker's alternative to the Medicare for All legislation co-sponsored by over 100 members of her caucus is a bill to strengthen the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which she introduced last week .
""We all share the value of healthcare for all Americans—quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans,"" Pelosi told the Post . ""What is the path to that? I think it's the Affordable Care Act, and if that leads to Medicare for All, that may be the path.""
The nation's largest nurses union was among those who expressed disagreement with the Speaker's incrementalist approach.
In a statement last week, National Nurses United president Zenei Cortez, RN, said Pelosi's plan would ""only put a Band-Aid on a broken healthcare system.""
""National Nurses United, along with our allies, will continue to build the grassroots movement for genuine healthcare justice and push to pass Medicare for All,"" Cortez concluded.

United Nations, United States, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The UN Security Council will meet Wednesday at Washington 's request to discuss the worsening humanitarian crisis in Venezuela , diplomats said.
The United States requested the meeting on Thursday amid growing alarm over the impact of a political standoff in Venezuela on families and children.
An internal UN report seen by AFP last week said seven million people -- about 24 percent of Venezuela 's population -- are in need of humanitarian aid, lacking access to food and medical care.
President Nicolas Maduro has blamed US sanctions for Venezuela 's economic problems but opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has declared himself interim leader, says government corruption and mismanagement are at fault.
Guaido is recognized by the United States and about 50 other governments.
The meeting to be held in open session is scheduled for around 11 am (1500 GMT)."

Washington, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :President Donald Trump on Friday greeted news of strong jobs growth with a fresh call on the US central bank to cut interest rates and resume economic stimulus.
""I personally think the Fed should drop rates, I think they really slowed us down,"" he told reporters. ""There's no inflation."" The Labor Department reported Friday that job growth had returned to normal, adding 196,000 net new positions after a frighteningly weak result in February .
Trump is not alone in criticizing the central bank , which bumped its benchmark lending rates up by a quarter of a percentage point in December despite signs the economy was slowing.
Policymakers have since cut their forecasts for 2019 to zero rate hikes and repeatedly announced they will be ""patient"" before deciding to raise rates again.
Trump however said this was not enough and called for the Fed not only to cut rates but to re-start its post-financial crisis ""quantitative easing"" program of buying bonds to add liquidity to the economy.
""You would see a rocket ship. Despite that, we're doing very well,"" he said.
The US economy grew by about three percent in 2018 and is expected to fare better than other advanced economies this year, growing by another two percent, according to recent forecasts from the Fed and the International Monetary Fund.
Trump's public pressure on the Fed breaks with recent norms according to which the White House has refrained from commenting on monetary policy.
He has also recently tapped loyalists with unconventional profiles to fill two vacancies on the Fed's board, perhaps giving his views greater weight in policy decisions.
Stephen Moore, 59, a former economic adviser to Trump 's presidential campaign known for highly criticized views on monetary policy, also faces uncomfortable questions from lawmakers concerning unpaid income taxes and penalties.
Herman Cain, 73, whose name Trump announced Thursday, once led a pizzeria chain and has served on the board of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank .
He dropped out of the 2012 race for the Republican Party's nomination for that year's presidential elections following accusations of sexual harassment, which he denied."

The Afghanistan Cricket Board announced Gulbadin Naib would skipper the one-day side, Rashid Khan the Twenty20 team and Rahmat Shah the Test squad.
Naib replaces Asghar Afghan , and board chairman Azizullah Fazli said the changes were a ""long time investment and to compete in a better way"".
But less than two months before the start of the World Cup in England and Wales , the move was criticized on social media by some players.
Former captain Mohammad Nabi tweeted the decision was ""ill timed with World Cup just round the corner"", saying the team had ""gelled really well under Asghar"".
""Being a senior member of the side and having seen the rise of Afghanistan Cricket , I don't think it is the right time to change the captain,"" said Nabi, who led Afghanistan in their first World Cup campaign four years ago.
Rashid Khan, the new Twenty20 skipper also sounded off.
""With all the respect to the Selection Committee, I strongly disagree with the decision as it is irresponsible & bias,"" he tweeted.
""As we have @cricketworldcup in front of us, Captain #MAsgharAfghan should remain as our team Captain."" Afghanistan plays Australia in their opening match of the World Cup in Bristol on June 1.

Other groups involved in the case include ActionAid Netherlands , Both Ends, Fossielvrij NL, Greenpeace NL and Young Friends of the Earth NL.
In a summary of the 250-page document handed over to Shell, the groups said that under Dutch law Shell was unlawfully endangering peoples' lives by not acting to prevent global warming.
""Internal and external documents show that Shell has known about climate change at least since the 1950s and has been aware of its large-scale and serious consequences at least since 1986,"" it said.
""Although Shell knew, it has not taken any serious steps to minimise its share in climate change,"" the document added.
- 'Expose Shell' - Cox said that unlike previous cases which sought financial compensation for the effects of climate change, this one involves asking the judge to order Shell to ensure its activities have zero percent carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.
Shell is responsible for 1.7 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions between 1988-2015, according to a peer-reviewed study of the 100 most polluting companies released two years ago.
It is also among five oil and gas majors that have spent more than $1 billion on lobbying against climate legislation since the Paris deal.
Shell's plans for tackling climate change are ""not consistent with the Paris goals"", said Harjeet Singh, who heads up global climate activities at ActionAid.
""We need to expose Shell on this and in fact what it has been doing all this while is hiding and distorting facts and lobbying against climate policy,"" Singh told AFP.
Climate change is a pressing issue in the Netherlands , where at least a third of the country lies below sea level.
The Dutch government was ordered by a court last year to slash greenhouse gases by at least 25 percent by 2020 , following a legal challenge by another environmental group.
Thousands of Dutch students have rallied in Amsterdam and The Hague in recent weeks, urging the government to take action, with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte meeting the group's leaders."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov said Friday that a meeting with his Armenian counterpart, Zohrab Mnatsakanyan, might be held in Moscow soon.
Mammadyarov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Moscow earlier on Friday. The Azerbaijani foreign minister arrived in Russia to attend the Commonwealth of Independent States' (CIS) Foreign Ministers Council session.
""Our meeting with Sergey Viktorovich [Lavrov] was wonderful, as always. We discussed not only bilateral relations, but also conflict resolution . I think that in the very near future, we have already agreed that a meeting of the foreign ministers and the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group will be announced. I think that Sergey Viktorovich will also participate,"" Mammadyarov said and noted that the next meeting on the Nagorno-Karabakh problem would ""most likely"" be held in Moscow .
Nagorno-Karabakh, a landlocked region in the South Caucasus with a predominantly Armenian population, proclaimed independence in 1991, which was followed by a bloody three-year war between Armenia and Azerbaijan . The region is officially viewed as an Azerbaijani territory. The pressure in the area continues, resulting in occasional violence. The latest escalation of tensions in the region happened in April 2016 .
The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, which is co-chaired by Russia , the United States and France , was created back in 1992 to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
In late March , Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev held his first official meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in the Austrian capital of Vienna to discuss the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Both sides commended the talks."

CAIRO (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, told UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday that he would continue fighting against the militants controlling Tripoli until the full liberation of the city, the LNA reported.
Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN Special Representative for Libya Ghassan Salame arrived at Haftar's headquarters in the city of Ar Rajma, located in the east of Libya .
""The commander-in-chief, Marshal Khalifa Haftar, told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that he would continue fighting until he freed Tripoli from militant groups that the city's residents are fed up with,"" the LNA said in a statement.
As a result of years-long civil conflict, there is no single central government in Libya , and the country's eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers. The Tobruk-based parliament , elected in 2014 and backed by the LNA, governs the east of Libya , while the UN-supported interim Government of National Accord (GNA) controls Libya 's western parts from Tripoli .

US Lawmakers Urge Trump Not to Veto Yemen War Resolution - Letter,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/us-lawmakers-urge-trump-not-to-veto-yemen-war-587100.html,"US Lawmakers Urge Trump Not To Veto Yemen War Resolution - Letter Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) 23 hours ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 08:56 PM
WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) A bipartisan group of US lawmakers in a letter to US President Donald Trump on Friday urged him to sign a joint resolution supported by Congress to end the United States ' involvement in the war in Yemen .
The White House in a notice on March 13 warned that Trump would veto the resolution , arguing that the measure would negatively affect bilateral relations with countries in the region and seeks to override the president's constitutional powers.
""As a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers, we respectfully ask you to sign into law Senate Joint Resolution 7, which invokes the War Powers Act of 1973 to end unauthorized US military participation in the Saudi-led coalition's armed conflict against Yemen 's Houthi forces, initiated in 2015 by the Obama Administration,"" Congressman Ro Khanna, Senator Mike Lee and seven other lawmakers said in the letter.
On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed the Yemen war resolution by a 247-175 vote after it was approved by the Senate last month.
In their letter on Friday, the lawmakers said Trump 's support for the measure could influence the Saudi-led coalition to end the conflict. The representatives also requested a meeting with Trump to further discuss the legislation as soon as possible.
Since 2015 , the United States has provided members of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen with military assistance such as intelligence sharing, logistics support and, until recently, aerial refueling. The Trump administration has come under fire for authorizing military aid to Saudi Arabia despite US bans on such assistance if recipients are guilty of serious human rights abuses and war crimes.
A UN human rights report released last year attributed most of the 16,000 civilian deaths to Saudi-led coalition airstrikes on targets such as hospitals, schools and open-air markets . UN experts also concluded that war crimes have been committed by all parties involved in the conflict.
Yemen has been engulfed in a violent conflict between the government headed by President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Shiite Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah, backed by army units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
The Saudi-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes against the Houthis at Hadi's request since March 2015 . The fighting in Yemen has resulted in one of the world 's most acute humanitarian crises, with about 22 million people in need of some form of humanitarian assistance or protection, according to the United Nations .

Five pivotal moments behind Brexit chaos,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/five-pivotal-moments-behind-brexit-chaos-587097.html,"Five Pivotal Moments Behind Brexit Chaos Sumaira FH 23 hours ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 08:56 PM
London, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Britain's decision to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union three years ago has ended up in political chaos that few could have predicted then.
Here are five pivotal moments that led to this: - January 23, 2013 - Then prime minister David Cameron promises a referendum on EU membership -- if the Conservatives win the next general election in 2015 .
According to EU Council President Donald Tusk, the Tory leader calculated that the next election would likely result in another power-sharing deal with the pro-EU Liberal Democrats , and he could dodge the pledge.
But Cameron instead wins a surprise outright majority and goes on to hold the referendum in 2016 .
- September 12, 2015 - A lifelong eurosceptic from the far left of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn becomes the improbable winner of his party's leadership election thanks to a surge in grassroots support from younger members.
The issue of leaving or staying in the EU is highly divisive among Labour voters and Corbyn's campaigning for Remain in the 2016 poll is lukewarm.
- March 29, 2017 - Under enormous political pressure to kickstart its departure following the referendum, the British government formally notifies the EU of its intention to leave, starting a two-year countdown to Brexit .
But critics said it did so too early and should have first built a consensus in Britain -- particularly in parliament -- over what kind of future relationship it wants with the bloc.
Early on, Prime Minister Theresa May sets out rigid red lines -- leaving the customs union and ending free movement -- which shape the negotiation.
- June 8, 2017 - In perhaps the biggest miscalculation of all , May calls a snap general election and loses her party's parliamentary majority after a lacklustre campaign.
This forces her into a deal with Northern Ireland 's hardline Democratic Unionist Party -- just as the issue of the Irish border emerges as the main point of contention in negotiations with the EU.
- January 29, March 12, March 29 -May refuses to change course as Brexit hardliners in her party reject the deal she struck with the EU three times in the hope of a better offer from Brussels or a ""no-deal"" break with the EU.
The gamble ends up delaying Brexit and raising the possibility of closer future economic ties with the EU, as May belatedly reaches out to opposition Labour MPs for help passing her agreement . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

The actor -- who plays Jaime Lannister in the global phenomenon -- also portrays Rico, a worn-out police officer assigned to the team that tracked Omar El-Hussein after he killed two people in separate attacks.
""The film is based on real events surrounding the terrorist attack on the Krudttonden Cultural Centre and the Copenhagen synagogue in February 2015 ,"" SF Studios said in a statement.
El-Hussein, 22, a Dane of Palestinian origin, claimed allegiance to the Islamic State group before he fired an assault rifle at the cultural centre during a debate on religion and freedom of expression.
Documentary film director Finn Norgaard, 55, died in the attack .
El-Hussein then killed 37-year-old Dan Uzan who was standing guard at the synagogue as a bar mitzvah took place inside on February 14.
A few hours later the attacker was killed during a shootout with police .
""I think it is important to tell this story while we still remember it, we owe it to the victims,"" director Ole Christian Madsen told the Danish weekly Weekendavisen.
""Globally, events are happening faster and faster. I think it is the right time"" to start talking about the event , he said.

Frankfurt am Main, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : German car behemoth Volkswagen said Friday it had secured 10 years' worth of lithium for electric car batteries from Chinese manufacturer Ganfeng, ensuring supply of a key ingredient for the vital components.
The two firms ""signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on long-term lithium supplies for battery cells,"" VW said in a statement, although it did not reveal the financial terms of the deal.
"" Volkswagen is thus already securing a significant share of its lithium requirement,"" the Wolfsburg-based group added.
With harsh EU emissions limits set to bite from next year and toughen further by 2030, the sprawling 12-brand company plans some 70 new electric models by 2028.
As it emerges from the shadow of its painful ""dieselgate"" emissions cheating scandal , VW aims to sell around 22 million electric cars over the coming decade to escape fines from Brussels .
But the new electric offensive is pushing the limits of battery production.
World demand for lithium is constantly growing as car companies join makers of smartphones and other electronic gadgets in clamouring for supply of the element.
Each smartphone battery contain three grammes of lithium, a laptop around 30 grammes and an electric car battery more than 20 kilogrammes."

Sports minister Giancarlo Giorgetti submitted a letter to the International Olympic Committee providing "" all the guarantees, signed by Giuseppe Conte's government "", the Olympic body said.
The head of the IOC evaluation commission, Octavian Morariu, on Thursday described the joint bid by Italy 's financial capital and Dolomites ski resort Cortina D'Ampezzo as ""very, very positive"".
The financial guarantee reportedly amount to 415 million Euros ($465 million ).
Under the bid figure skating, hockey and short-track speedskating would be held in Milan , with sliding sports and curling in Cortina; and speedskating, biathlon and Nordic sports would take place at Val di Fiemme, in Trentino.
The alpine skiing events would be in Bormio for the men and Cortina for women while the opening ceremony would be at the San Siro football stadium, with the closing ceremony at Verona 's Arena, a large Roman amphitheatre.
Darkening clouds gathering over Italy 's economy, but Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who has strongly backed the bid, said the government had the necessary funds.
""There is commitment, willing from the government , the cities and the regions... Italy can be the window on the world . So as a native of Milan and an Italian, I am proud of this bid,"" said Salvini.
"" All the data and all the studies of the costs and the profits show that the expenditure incurred to guarantee security and public order at the Games will be largely covered by the profits generated for the country,"" he added.
The only city in competition with the Italian bid is Stockholm .
The vote to chose the host city will be made in Lausanne on June 24. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

New York, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Wall Street stocks rose modestly early Friday as a solid March US jobs report eased fears over slowing growth and the risk of recession.
About 10 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 26,411.25, up 0.1 percent.
The broad-based S&P 500 also gained 0.1 percent to 2,883.14, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0. 2 percent to 7,909.52.
The Labor Department reported that the US added 196,000 net new positions for the month, well above expectations, while the jobless rate held steady at 3.8 percent.
Wall Street greeted the solid improvement in hiring after a weak February report, as well as a moderation in wage inflation that should discourage the Federal Reserve from shifting to a more hawkish posture on interest rates, said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare."

Not surprisingly, there’s something they forgot to mention about what Trump said: Now that guests on cable news networks and a presidential candidate are referring to these remarks as new, think it’s important to point out they were made in May 2018, not yesterday. Also, as Snopes pointed out then, Trump was referring to MS-13 members https://t.co/LOeAdRd3wx https://t.co/rqPiaa8dks
— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) April 6, 2019 This tweet is going viral and it's not correct. Trump was not talking about asylum speakers at the time (this clip is from last May).

Trump’s “animals” remark was in reference to MS-13 gang members, but many didn’t want to hear that part. Respectful disagree. We *shouldn't* just dropping things down the memory hole. Even if he did mean MS-13, it's awful even to mean it about criminals—that kind of thinking can lead to police overreach and brutality. Police have confused asylum-seekers for gang members.

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) US President Donald Trump on Friday said the Federal Reserve should lower US interest rates and adopt a policy of quantitative easing to accelerate the economy's growth.
""I personally think the Fed should drop rates. I think they really slowed us down. There's no inflation. I would say in terms quantitative tightening, it should actually be now quantitative easing. ... I think they should drop rates and they should get rid of quantitative tightening, you would see a rocket ship. Despite that we are doing very well,"" Trump told reporters before departing the White House for California, where he will visit the US-Mexico border .
On Thursday, Trump called the Federal Reserve's actions ""unnecessary and destructive."" The president last week said that the US economy as well as global markets would be much higher and better off if the Fed had not raised interest rates.
The US central bank increased the interest rate four times last year and projected that more hikes were to come in 2019 .
On March 20, the Fed announced that it will maintain the US interest rate at the 2.25-2.5 percent range and indicated that no changes are expected for the rest of the year."

ROME (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The balance of the entire Mediterranean region is at stake in Libya , and efforts should be made to ensure the situation in the country does not worsen, Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Friday, adding that a military solution to the nation's crisis will only have a destructive effect.
Tensions are on the rise in the North African nation after the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, moved toward the country's west and started clashing with rival forces just south of the capital Tripoli . On Friday the LNA again started advancing on the capital.
""I am worried about Libya . I get constant updates from special services and intelligence. We need to throw water on the fire and not gasoline. I do not [support] anyone who, out of economic and commercial interests, campaigns for a military solution [in Libya] that would be destructive,"" Salvini told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 interior ministers' meeting in Paris , as broadcast on his Facebook page.
The high-ranking Italian minister noted that an armed solution and use of troops did not serve to solve the problem. He added that he also had held a bilateral meeting with US State Department officials, who said that they were trusting Italy to maintain stability of the region.
""The balance of the entire Mediterranean is at stake [in Libya], as there are problems in Algeria that can spread, I emphasize that economic and commercial interests of individual countries should not conflict with a peaceful solution to the crisis ... We hope that no one is playing with fire ,"" Salvini concluded.
Libya is currently divided into two parts � the internationally recognized Government of National Accord headed by Fayez Sarraj in the capital of Tripoli and a parallel administration allied to Haftar in the east of the country. During a UN-organized meeting in March both Sarraj and Haftar agreed to hold a general election this spring. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Washington, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :US job creation came back to life in March , possibly assuaging recession fears and allowing Donald Trump a sigh of relief.
Government data released Friday showed a hiring surge in healthcare, bars and restaurants, while unemployment held steady and worker wages continued to climb.
The return to healthy job creation at the close of the third quarter followed wild results at the start of the year, including an anemic February when employers added just 33,000 net new positions, the slowest in 17 months.
The world 's largest economy added 196,000 net new positions for March , well above expectations, while the jobless rate held steady at 3.8 percent, according to the Labor Department.
The broad consensus among economists is that the US economy is slowing as the boost from recent tax cuts and fiscal stimulus fades. But President Trump 's administration has forecast that 2019 will be another banner year for growth.
Shortly after the numbers were released, Trump delighted in the news.
""Our country is doing unbelievably well,"" he said.
Average hourly wages rose four cents for the month, putting them up 3.2 percent over March of last year, more than twice the pace of consumer inflation over the same period -- but down from February 's 3.4 percent, which had been the highest in a decade but which may have been distorted by weather effects.
This gives workers purchasing power and suggests they will continue to spend despite surprising recent dips in retail sales and consumption.
- A dark spot - Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the numbers were good but ""not a game changer."" ""Normal service is restored, after a couple of wild swings,"" he wrote in a note to clients.
A dark spot, however, was hiring among manufacturers, a sector hard-hit by Trump 's trade war with China . Automakers shed 6,300 jobs . Retailers also gave up nearly 12,000 workers. This was offset by gains in architecture, engineering and management services.
The labor force also shrank as more than 220,000 people stopped looking for work, driving the participation rate down two tenths of a percentage point to 63 percent -- a level around which it has stubbornly fluctuated for much of the past two years.
After steadily tightening interest rates last year, much to Trump 's chagrin, the Federal Reserve now forecasts it will not raise rates at all this year, taking note of slowing economic activity in the United States and globally.
However, economists say even a slower pace of growth is enough to continue driving unemployment downward at a time when employers already complain they are desperate to find capable workers.
As wages rise as a result of falling unemployment, inflation may soon follow, leaving central bankers little choice but to continue pushing their benchmark lending rates higher.
Yet, in his remarks to reporters on Friday, Trump called on the Fed to cut interest rates and resume its post-financial crisis bond-buying stimulus program, saying inflation was negligible.
""The data don't give the Fed reason to start tightening again soon but they don't support the case for easing either,"" Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics wrote in an analytical note on the March employment numbers.

Dire future etched in the past: CO2 at 3-million year-old levels,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/dire-future-etched-in-the-past-co2-at-3-mill-587076.html,"Dire Future Etched In The Past: CO2 At 3-million Year-old Levels Muhammad Irfan 24 hours ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 08:40 PM
Paris, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Planet-warming carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere -- at its highest level in three million years -- is poised to lock in dramatic temperature and sea level rises over a timescale of centuries, scientists warned this week.
The last time that CO2 hit 400 parts per million (ppm) Greenland was ice free and trees grew at the edge of Antactica.
It was long thought that today's greenhouse gas levels were no greater than those 800,000 years ago, during a period of cyclical planetary warming and cooling that would have likely continued but for manmade emissions.
But analyses of ice cores and ocean sediments in the coldest place on Earth have now revealed that 400 ppm was last surpassed three million years ago during the Late Pliocene, when temperatures were several degrees Celsius higher, and oceans at least 15 metres deeper.
At the same time, state-of-the-art climate modelling by experts at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) have correlated directly with the CO2 levels found in these Antarctic samples.
""The Late Pliocene is relatively close to us in terms of CO2 levels,"" Matteo Willeit, PIK member and lead study author, told AFP.
""Our models suggest that there were no glacial cycles -- there were no big ice sheets in the northern hemisphere. CO2 was too high and the climate was too warm to allow big ice sheets to grow."" Nations in 2015 struck the landmark Paris deal on climate change, promising to curb greenhouse gas emissions and limit temperature rises to ""well below"" 2 Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit).
Yet 2017 saw emissions levels unsurpassed in human history, and climate experts warn that time has all but run out to drastically slash fossil fuel use and avert runaway global warming.
- Seas 15-20 metres higher - Scientists gathered this week in London for a conference on the Pliocene epoch, and highlighted the lessons to be learned today embedded in its ancient ice and sediment samples.
""The headline news is that temperatures were 3-4 degrees higher globally than they are today, and sea levels were 15-20 metres (50-65 feet) higher,"" Martin Siegert, professor of geoscience at Imperial College London , told reporters.
With just 1C of warming so far, Earth is already dealing with floods, droughts and superstorms made worse by rising seas.
Siegert said that 400 ppm didn't mean that the severity of Pliocene sea-level rises was imminent. But unless humans figure a way to suck CO2 out of the air on a massive scale, severe impacts are inevitable, sooner or later.
""There's a lag,"" he explained. ""If you turn on the oven at home and set it to 200C, it doesn't reach that (level) immediately. It's the same for climate."" Siegert said glaciologists, based on current CO2 concentrations, expect between 50 centimetres and one metre of sea-level rise this century .
""It would be difficult for it to be much more than that because it takes time to melt,"" he added.
""But it doesn't stop at 2100 -- it keeps going."" - Rocketing pace of CO2 - In October , the world 's leading climate scientists concluded that greenhouse gas emissions must peak within 12 years to keep the Paris goals in reach.
But despite these and earlier warnings, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use, construction, aviation and agribusiness continue to rise.
""If we stay at 400 ppm, we stay on the course to a Pliocene-like climate,"" said Tina van De Flierdt, a professor of isotope geochemistry at Imperial.
She warned that under similar conditions to the present day, the Pliocene saw the disappearance of the Greenland ice sheet -- which today holds enough frozen water to raise sea levels by some seven metres worldwide.
""The West Antarctica ice sheet holds about 5 metres -- that was probably gone,"" she added.
As is happening today, Earth's poles warmed far quicker than the rest of the planet during the Pliocene, earlier research has shown, including a study in Nature Climate Change.
During earlier periods, Earth has seen sustained concentrations of carbon dioxide was even higher than 400 ppm, but it took millions of years for those increases to occur.
Manmade greenhouse gas emissions, on the other hand, have boosted CO2 levels by more than 40 percent in a little over 150 years.
- 'A crazy experiment' - At 412 ppm and rising, experts said temperature rises of 3-4C are likely now locked in.
So what happened to Earth the last time CO2 was so prevalent? It was captured in the trees, plants, animals and minerals alive at the time and buried underground when they died .
""And what we've been doing for the last 150 years is digging it all up and putting it back into the atmosphere,"" said Siegert.
""It's like a crazy experiment: 'Let's take that CO2 that took 100 million years to be sequestrated and put it back -- instantly, on a geological timescale -- in the atmosphere and see what happens'"". Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

London, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Theresa May asked the European Union on Friday to delay Britain's departure until June 30 while Brussels suggested that it might be best to postpone the split for up to a year.
The competing visions of how to unwind Britain's 46-year involvement in the European project will be hashed out again at an EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday and EU leaders have already reacted sceptically to May 's request.
The current Brexit deadline of April 12 has already been pushed back once from March 29 because of the UK parliament 's repeated failure to back the deal May signed with the other 27 EU leaders in December .
May's formal request to EU Council president Donald Tusk said Britain thinks the delay ""should end on June 30 2019 "" -- the same date she asked for and was refused at the last EU summit last month.
""If the parties are able to ratify (the withdrawal agreement ) this date, the government proposes that the period should be terminated earlier,"" May wrote in a letter released by Downing Street.
A senior EU official said that Tusk's own idea for a ""flexible"" 12-month extension ""will be presented to member states today"".
But a source in French President Emmanuel Macron's office said it was ""premature"" to consider the request without ""a clear plan"" from May about what she intended to do with the extra time.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass said May still had ""many questions"" to clarify.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte -- seen as one of May 's closer European allies -- also said the letter ""doesn't answer"" important concerns.
- 'Political cover' - May said Britain would start preparing for European Parliament elections in case it is still a member of the bloc when they begin on May 23.
The idea is deeply unpopular with Britons who voted to quit the EU and chart their own future in a 2016 referendum whose arguments are still being waged to this day.
Political analysts in London said May probably knew that her new deadline will be rejected because EU leaders do not think she can get her deal through parliament any time soon.
May is under intense pressure from the right wing of her Conservative Party to pull Britain out of the bloc as soon as possible -- with or without a deal.
""I think that Theresa May is looking for political cover because she is asking for an extension she knows she can't get,"" said King's College European politics professor Anand Menon She wants Brussels to ""force her to do something else so that at least she won't get accused of selling out."" The first response from leading Conservative eurosceptics to the idea was very critical.
""If a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible,"" Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg tweeted.
- 'Fight to save Brexit ' - The other 27 EU nations must give unanimous backing to any deadline extension.
Some EU leaders fear that Britain's participation in the European Parliament vote will help boost the standing of anti-EU parties due to their popularity among Brexit-backing Britons.
UK far-right leader Nigel Farage called on his supporters Friday to vote for his Brexit Party in the European election .
""The fightback to save Brexit has begun,"" Farage tweeted.
- Unlikely breakthrough - May 's team is currently negotiating with leaders from the main opposition Labour Party in a bid to find a compromise that can pass parliament in the coming days.
Downing Street on Friday called the talks ""constructive and an ongoing process"".
May's letter said the talks' failure would likely see the two parties jointly produce several options that would be put up for a series of parliamentary votes.
Labour is pushing May to accept a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the bloc that includes its participation in a customs union.
May had previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States .
But analysts said it was not in Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's political interests to help get May 's agreement over the line.
""If they come to an agreement , that's quite dangerous for him,"" University of Nottingham political history professor Seven Fielding said.
""I would be surprised if he doesn't walk away."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

PARIS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) On the anniversaries of two suspected chemical attacks in Syria , London , Paris and Washington again blamed the Syrian government for attacking its citizens and warned it against repeats.
""Two years on from the horrific chemical weapons attacks that took place in Khan Sheikhoun, and almost one year since the attack in Douma , we the United States , United Kingdom and France warn against, and remain firm in our resolve to respond appropriately to, any use of chemical weapons,"" the joint statement read.
The three stated that the Syrian government 's history of ""repeatedly using chemical weapons against its own people cannot be disputed, and we remain determined to hold it accountable for indiscriminately killing innocent men, women and children with these heinous weapons.""
They said Damascus had been shielded from being held accountable, but vowed there would be no impunity for those who use, seek to use, or protect those who use chemical weapons.
An investigation and identification team of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will now work to identify the perpetrators of the said attacks, which is an important step in ensuring accountability, the trio added.
""The United States , the United Kingdom , and France reaffirm their strong resolve to work jointly in achieving this practical goal ... The [President Bashar] Assad regime must not repeat the use of chemical weapons in Syria . There should be no doubt as to our determination to act strongly and swiftly should the Assad regime use these weapons again in the future,"" they concluded.
The allies used claims of chemical attacks in Khan Sheikhoun, Douma and Eastern Ghuta to justify missile strikes on Syria last year, without waiting for an independent probe. The Syrian government denies its role in the attacks. An OPCW report published last March suggested that chlorine was likely used in Eastern Ghuta but stopped short of apportioning the blame. The Russian Foreign Ministry argues that claims of chemical attacks by troops loyal to Damascus are meant to shield local militants and justify attacks on the government .

The conversion of Abby Johnson -- from one of the youngest Planned Parenthood clinic directors in America to pro-life leader -- sounds like the kind story line that would never make its way into the movie theater. But it has. ""Unplanned"" debuted in 1,059 theaters on March 29 and grossed $6.1 million on its opening weekend, double the commercial expectations. It received an A-plus CinemaScore from audiences. It has been expanded to 1,700 sites and is captivating millions with its heart-wrenching portrayal of the reality of abortion and the organization that champions the atrocity.
Johnson estimates she was personally responsible for overseeing 22,000 abortions at her clinic in Bryan, Texas, during her Planned Parenthood career. She had two of her own. This is her story, necessarily rated R because of its honest depiction of what transpires inside the Planned Parenthood clinic. The opening scene depicts the moment of conversion. Abby, who serves in a management capacity, is asked to assist with an ultrasound abortion of a 13-week-old baby. She watches -- and the viewer watches very real footage -- as the unborn baby resists, moving desperately to avoid the suction tube. It swooshes into the cylinder of death, exiting into a bucket with blood and pieces of human tissue. The womb is now empty. Abby Johnson falls apart.
We go to the start of the story, with her two abortions, her unlikely marriage into a strongly pro-life family and her rise of the ranks of her local Planned Parenthood outlet. She knows she has made it when director Cheryl ceremoniously invites her to come into the ""P.O.C"" room -- the clinic's sanctum sanctorum, open only to the chosen few. When a nurse asks if Abby knows what ""P.O.C."" stands for, she offers the euphemism ""products of conception."" Her colleague sardonically provides the correct answer: ""pieces of children."" Abby and Cheryl approach the table containing the body parts of countless babies. Little feet. Little hands. Little heads. The parts of every aborted child must be accounted for so they can be sure nothing is left inside the womb. View Cartoon
Unsurprisingly, ""Unplanned"" has received the same opprobrium from the cultural elites as last year's pro-life movie ""Gosnell."" A half dozen major music labels refused to license their tunes for the movie, including Disney, Universal Music and Sony/ATV. Cable TV networks refused to run ads for the movie -- USA, Lifetime, HGTV, the Travel Channel, the Cooking Channel, the Food Network ... even the Hallmark Channel!
The movie was trashed on TBS. Unfunny radical feminist Samantha Bee bizarrely claimed the movie was ""mostly made up"" and mocked it for suggesting that taking on the nation's largest and most powerful abortion conglomerate is scary.
Bee tried to suggest that Johnson couldn't possibly turn her heroes into monsters: ""No matter where you go, no matter where you hide, I will give you health care!"" Ripping babies apart is ""health care.""
Even social media giants were hostile. On the opening weekend, the movie's Twitter account was suspended for a time, which Twitter claimed was a mistake, as if anyone believes that line any longer. Then fans of the movie couldn't successfully follow the account. Twitter has a nasty habit of blocking pro-life material as ""inflammatory.""
Newspapers refused to review the movie. The New York Times reviewed 12 new movies on debut day, but not ""Unplanned."" This included a review of ""Diane"" (released in only three theaters nationwide), a liberal documentary on former Trump strategist Steve Bannon called ""The Brink"" (in four theaters) and the French Canadian teen comedy ""Slut in a Good Way"" (in seven theaters). Recommended No, President Trump Did Not Refer To Asylum Seekers As Animals. And The Mainstream Media Should Know This Timothy Meads
The Washington Post had no review from its own critics in the ""Weekend"" section but directed readers to its Common Sense Media page for parents, where those outside critics said the film was inappropriate for children under 17. This camp thinks abortion is appropriate for teenage girls but a movie about abortion is not.
Maybe this near silence is for the best, since one of the few film reviewers, Frank Scheck of the Hollywood Reporter, thought he was being witty when he explained, ""There have been films that treated Nazi doctors conducting evil experiments in concentration camps more sympathetically.""
Scheck somehow can't absorb the fact that there is evil in Planned Parenthood, that it is a big business making a profit from exterminating more than 300,000 unborn babies a year.
Abby Johnson came to understand it and devoted her life to fighting the horror of abortion from that moment forward.
Her babies are in paradise, dancing with delight. "

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Russia has won a dispute with Ukraine in the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the transit of goods from Ukraine via Russia , the Ministry of Economic Development said Friday.
Russia imposed restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods through its territory in January 2016 in response to the establishment of a free trade zone between Ukraine and the European Union .
""The WTO dispute settlement body's arbitration group has found unreasonable Ukraine 's claim against Russia in a dispute over the restriction of the transit of goods from Ukraine through the Russian territory,"" the ministry's press service said in a statement.
The WTO arbitration panel backed Russia 's position, recognizing that the political situation in Ukraine back in 2014 created significant threats to its national security. Having taken this fact into consideration, the body did not recognize restrictions for transit as a violation.
""Based on the results of the consideration of the claims by Ukraine , the arbitration group has concluded that all the contested measures have been taken by Russia to protect the essential interests of its security in emergency situations in international relations,"" the statement said.
The Russian January 2016 decree suspended international transit of goods from Ukraine to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan via Russia . Since then, the transit of goods from Ukraine via Russia to these counties has to be carried out only from the neighboring Belarus . The transit is subjected to tough monitoring, including via the Russian-developed space-based satellite navigation system GLONASS.
Responding to the measures, Kiev sent to the WTO a request for consultations with Moscow in September 2016 . A year later, Ukraine filed a lawsuit dubbed ""measures concerning traffic in transit"" against its neighbor. Kiev claimed the restrictions violated the WTO rules and caused the country economic damage."

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) US President Donald Trump on Friday said that Mexico stepped up its game over the last couple of days to stop illegal migration and drug trafficking after Washington threatened to close the southern border and impose a 25 percent tariff on car imports from the country.
"" Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days. They are apprehending everybody. Yesterday, they apprehended 1,400 people. The day before it was 1,000. If they apprehend people at their southern border , where they don't have to walk through that's a big home run. We can handle it from there. It's really good. ... It's never happened like that in 35 years,"" Trump told reporters before departing the White House for a border visit in California.
The president called on Congress to take action by abolishing several US immigration policies, including catch and release, chain migration, visa lottery and the whole asylum system.
On Thursday, Trump said that Mexico is facing a potential 25 percent tariff on its car imports to the United States if it does not do enough to stop illegal migration and drug trafficking.
Earlier on Thursday, the president said he would give Mexico a one-year warning to stop drug trafficking and illegal migration before the United States imposes tariffs.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Wednesday that Mexico had chosen to follow the strategy of not responding to US statements related to the influx of migrants passing through Mexican territory. Ebrard suggested that Trump 's recent statements were related to the US 2020 presidential election .
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that neither Washington nor Mexico City would benefit from a closure of the border .
According to Mexico 's Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 76,000 migrants were detained after trying to get into the United States in February , while in March the figure was expected to increase to 100,000 people. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) A Moscow court ruled on Friday to fine Twitter 3,000 rubles ($45) for not informing the Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor on the localization of databases containing Russian users' personal information in the country, a Sputnik correspondent reported from the courtroom.
Since 2015 , companies who have Russian citizens' personal data in their databases, must keep those databases in Russia . In December , Roskomnadzor filed an administrative offense report against Twitter and Facebook , because neither of them had submitted any formal reason for failing to comply with this regulation. After neither of the two companies responded, the communication agency began administrative proceedings against the US companies in late January .
""The company Twitter will be fined in the amount of 3,000 rubles,"" the judge said in the ruling.
The case against Facebook has been postponed until April 12 because no one from the company appeared in court for the hearing .
The maximum administrative fine for this type of violation is 5,000 rubles.
According to the Russian law on personal data, if companies fail to comply with the obligation to install databases in Russia , beyond fines, the companies may risk being blocked within the country. In 2016 , the professional networking site LinkedIn came under fire due to its lack of databases in Russia and was blocked from operating in the country. Meanwhile, companies like Apple , Google , Uber and eBay have already transferred their user data to Russia . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
