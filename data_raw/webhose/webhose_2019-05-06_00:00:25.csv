Obama: Progressives have 'a certain kind of rigidity' that leads them to form circular firing squads,hotair.com,John Sexton,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/04/06/obama-progressives-u-s-tendency-form-circular-firing-squad-purity/,"Obama: Progressives have ‘a certain kind of rigidity’ that leads them to form circular firing squads John Sexton Posted at 8:31 pm on April 6, 2019 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Former President Obama spoke at an event in Berlin hosted by the Obama Foundation Saturday. After a brief speech, Obama took questions. The first question came from an organizer in Ireland who wanted to know how he could “show the value in compromise and the beauty in consensus.” This question prompted an answer that went on for about ten minutes. Near the end of his answer, Obama warned that progressives have a tendency to form “circular firing squads.”
“One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States, maybe it’s true here as well, is a certain kind of rigidity where we say ‘Uh! I’m sorry this is how it’s going to be,'” Obama said. He continued, “Then we start sometimes creating what’s called a circular firing squad where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues. When that happens, typically, the overall effort and movement weakens.
“So I think whether you are speaking as a citizen or as a political leader or as an organizer…you have to recognize that the way we’ve structured democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you. And that, by definition, means you are not going to get 100 percent of what you want.”
Obama didn’t name any names but what he’s saying here certainly applies to what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been doing both with her Green New Deal (in which everything must all be done at once) and her DCCC blacklist which Jazz wrote about earlier today. In fact, AOC is the perfect example of a far-left politician who would rather form a circular firing squad than seek compromise. And, honestly, that’s fine with me.
AOC may be the it-girl of the freshman class, but a lot of the other Dems who came in with her last year are more conservative than she is and only won because they weren’t far left extremists. If she wants to blow them all up, it’s not going to work out the way she expects. So bring on the circular firing squads!
Here’s Obama making the point above: "

The Most & Least 'Stressed-Out' States | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-02/most-least-stressed-out-states,"Across the US, suicide rates, drug overdoses and other ""deaths of despair"" are soaring - and recently contributed to the third-straight year of life-expectancy decline. Meanwhile, millennials, saddled with debt and suffering with a paucity of marketable skills, are putting off parenthood and homeownership as they toil away in expensive urban centers, surrendering more than half of their monthly income to rent and debt service.
With the outlook on the future of American society as grim as it has ever been (thanks to widening economic inequality, the dire warnings of climate alarmists, and the erosion of confidence in American institutions, among other reasons), it shouldn't come as a surprise that Americans - particularly young Americans - are extremely stressed out.
Though stress can be an amorphous concept, researchers at WalletHub have tried to quantify stress-level trends across the US, incorporating data from average hours worked per week to personal bankruptcy rate to share of adults getting adequate sleep and using these data to assign a score to individual states.
Their study turned up an interesting result: It showed that states in the Deep South tended to be the most stressed, followed by expensive coastal states like New York and California, with the sleepy Midwest and plain states bringing up the rear.
Here's a breakdown of the highest and lowest scoring states in each category analyzed:

(photo credit: ELIE POSNER / ISRAEL MUSEUM)
Julian Rosefeldt - ‘Manifesto’ In this powerful exhibition, visual artist Julian Rosefeldt recruited actress Cate Blanchett to create a contemporary interpretation of some of the most compelling 20th-century manifestos. Rosefeldt captivates his audience by means of enthralling monologues on the backdrop of diverse settings and personae, all performed by Blanchett, and adapted the furious, ideological writings to modernity to examine how they stood the test of time. Rosefeldt created his multi-screen Manifesto in 2015 and toured the world with it ever since, showcasing it in more than 20 locations. According to MutualArt , an Israel-based global art data platform, the German-born artist is not only known for his vivid and elaborate installation films, but also for his photography. His Soap Sample VI is currently being auctioned at Christie’s Online for an estimated £4,000. In 2013, Rosefeldt’s Stunned Man (Trilogy of Failure II) – a 30-minute loop film questioning mundane, everyday life – was sold at Christie’s Amsterdam “Post-War & Contemporary Art” for a respectable $11,783. Julian Rosefeldt – Manifesto Nathan Cummings Building for Modern and Contemporary Art The Israel Museum, Jerusalem Hiroshi Sugimoto One of the most unique and prominent contemporary photography artists, Hiroshi Sugimoto, makes his Israel debut with this breathtaking exhibition. Sugimoto’s style and technique create artworks that transcend the reality the lens proposes and invites the observer to be drawn into a two-dimensional image until one begins to recognize life and movement in the apparent stills. The Japanese artist employs uncompromising minimalism in his mostly black and white photographs, whose subjects range from nature and wildlife to architecture and portraits. The same minimalism was used to design this exhibition space – which was planned by Sugimoto himself – and creates a sense of being part of one of Sugimoto’s photographs. The untitled exhibition is a collection of Sugimoto’s best works from the beginning of his career to date and is divided into five distinct categories, each representing different subjects and styles.Sugimoto’s talent is corroborated by his incredible success at auctions worldwide. Being featured regularly at the most prestigious auction houses, such as Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips, the yearly revenue of Sugimoto’s works ranks in the millions, according to MutualArt’s data. In 2007, a series of photographs capturing the horizon between different seas and the sky was sold for a whopping $1,888,000 USD. Hiroshi Sugimoto November 15, 2018-June 08, 2019 Lily & Yoel Moshe Elstein Multi-Purpose Gallery Herta and Paul Amir Building Tel Aviv Museum of Art ‘Keeping at Distance’: On Intimacy in Contemporary Painting This carefully curated group exhibition at the Petach Tikva Museum of Art focuses on the birth process of artworks and the relationship the artist develops with his creation along the way. The exhibition gathers 17 different Israeli artists – some more established, some at the beginning of their career – who use different media to express their inspiration. Curator Liza Gershuni expresses the thread connecting the seemingly unrelated art as the “intimate, latent, at times highly specific yet always basic experience of being-in-this-world.”While normally, the artist takes backstage once he finishes his piece of art, Keeping at Distance puts him back in the spotlight and at the center of the cultural experience. The observer’s view is shifted from interpreting what is seen, to experiencing the process the artist undergoes in his journey to completion and the many emotions and processes that come with it. Ultimately, the exhibition builds a story around a thought-through idea and brilliantly incorporates fine art into the narrative. Keeping at Distance: On Intimacy in Contemporary Painting Curator: Liza Gershuni Petach Tikva Museum of Art Ilit Azoulay –‘Regarding Silences’ Regarding Silences is the product of some 8 years of research and artistic work by Ilit Azoulay. Azoulay uses her camera to “listen” to the lenses’ visuals, searching for the reality beyond plain sight. While Azoulay’s objective is similar to Sugimoto’s, the creations are completely different. Azoulay’s work results in surreal composite images, combining thousands of photographs into one, paying attention to every detail in the final product. In Regarding Silences, Azoulay documented the renovation of a structure in Zichron Ya’acov in northern Israel – today known as the Elma Arts Complex Luxury Hotel –, and uncovered the deep and traumatic past of what once served as an interrogation camp for Israeli prisoners-of-war soldiers following the Yom Kippur War. The artworks reflect this process in a carefully designed exhibition space that includes a fully green-painted room to immerse the audience in the surrealistic experience of these soldiers. Azoulay’s talent has earned her international acclaim, ranking first in MoMa’s “New Photography 2015” list, and selling her creations for 5-digit sums at the best auction houses in the world. MutualArt registered two of her works auctioned at $12,000 and $16,000 by Tiroche in January of this year. Ilit Azoulay – Regarding Silences The Center for Contemporary Art, Tel Aviv Micha Ullman –‘Semi-Detached’ Semi-Detached is part of a group exhibition at the Herzliya Museum termed Scene of Events. Nine solo exhibitions present daily realities in ways that they’re not usually thought about, creating a different perspective on subjects we are faced with on a regular basis.Micha Ullman, in Semi-Detached, recreated a blueprint of his residential home by means of red hamra sand. Shaping it in ways that the audience understands what “rooms” it finds itself in, Ullman provokes a thought-process that necessarily leads to the questioning of urbanization, the individual’s role in it and the incessant drive of modernity.The exhibition does not portray art, but is the art itself. The vulnerability of the installation, which is not reinforced or protected, demands the visitors’ utmost care and attention, further invoking questions one might fail to notice in his daily routine.

Trump warns of 'traffic' and 'commercial' delays at U.S.-Mexico border,www.politico.com,QUINT FORGEY,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/06/trump-mexico-border-immigration-1260171,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump warned Saturday of “traffic & commercial delays” along the southern border as a result of the administration’s decision earlier this week to ramp up the number of immigration officers processing Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico.
“We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Border’s specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States,” the president wrote on Twitter . Story Continued Below
“This will cause traffic & commercial delays until such time as Mexico is able to use … it’s [sic] powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S., and removing them back to their country of origin,” Trump continued . “Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous & massive migration, we will be focusing on Border Security, not Ports of Entry.”
In another post , the president implored congressional Democrats to join with Republican lawmakers and legislate fixes to “the horrible, costly and foolish loopholes” in U.S. immigration statutes.
“Once that happens, all will be smooth,” Trump tweeted. “We can NEVER allow Open Borders!” Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning — in your inbox.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday directed Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to hasten the “temporary reassignment of personnel and resources from across the agency to address the influx of migrants.” She also announced plans to require that greater numbers of non-Mexican asylum-seekers stay in Mexico while they wait for their cases to be resolved.
Trump on Thursday retreated from his earlier threat to shut down the southern border, saying he would first impose auto tariffs on Mexico in an attempt to curb the rate of illegal drugs entering the U.S.
“Before we close the border, we‘ll put the tariffs on the cars,“ the president told reporters in the Oval Office. “I don‘t think we‘ll ever have to close the border.“"

Kanye and his unabashed support for Trump deftly defended against the liberal OUTRAGE!!! machine by…ummm, Bret Easton Ellis ?
Instead of getting outraged, they should have realized that a figure like Trump would seem appealing to him: brash, a gangster, his own man whether you liked him or loathed him, a loner, transparent, a truth teller not to be taken literally, flawed, contradictory, a rebel, awful for some or wonderful for others but certainly not vanilla or middle-of-the-road, incapable as a bureaucrat but skillful as a disruptor. This was also, of course, what a lot of other people I knew liked about Trump in the summer of 2018.
The media became derisive and speculated that Kanye had to be on drugs to say anything of the sort. He’s destroying his career! How could a black man like Trump? Anyone but an idiot could tell what Kanye was trying to say, however garbled and clumsy it was, but given the bias infecting everything in 2018, the press worried that he was having “delusional episodes” and probably needed to be treated for drug abuse. The consensus, in postmortem editorials everywhere, was that he would never have a career again after the slavery comment and the Trump tweets. It was all over for Kanye.
Except for the fact that, true to their ignorant prejudice, the Trumpers they reflexively blow off as “racist” are perfectly willing to flout Hollywood-shitlib assumptions and offer their welcoming support to Kanye for daring to exit the Lefty plantation and choosing a different path for himself.
And then Ellis makes the Tinseltown rubble bounce .
I MET up with Kanye during the week those controversies were exploding across social media. Kanye reached out because he was interested in resurrecting a TV project we had discussed in 2015, which he was now considering as a film. I promptly rearranged my schedule and made the drive out to his Calabasas compound, flittingly apprehensive that I might be meeting, as the media kept reiterating, a man who’d lost his mind.
After being ushered in by security, I was brought into a room where he was multi-tasking: assembling the movie team, overseeing his fashion line, rehearsing new material. In the five years I’d casually known him, I’d never seen him so attentive and focused and happy. This was Kanye at his most lucid, and this afternoon confirmed for me that he was, in fact, sane: his own man, no apologies, not some drugged-out freak gibbering on Twitter. People simply needed to acknowledge — not approve or to embrace — that here was someone who saw the world in his own way and not according to how other people thought he should see it. What Kanye was championing in his Trump tweets was an idea of peace and unity, imagining a place where different sides could work together despite vicious ideological differences — that’s it.
Since November 2016, I had heard that a horrendous economic collapse was about to materialize, the planet was going to melt, countless people would die, the fraught situation in North Korea would send the United States into a nuclear Armageddon, and Trump would be impeached, brought down by a pee tape — leaving no jobs for anybody and Russian tanks in the streets.
We also idly noted that the filmmaker David Lynch couldn’t say in an interview that he thought maybe Donald Trump would go down as one of the great presidents in history, not without groupthink forcing him into apologizing for this immediately on Facebook. And where was a resistance that was so attractive and cunning that it managed to sway you, that maybe made you see things in a broader, less blinkered light?
But the one we had in 2018 seemed bent on advocating mostly vandalism and violence. Trump’s star on Hollywood Boulevard was destroyed with a pickax, an actor resembling a septuagenarian Lorax said “F–k Trump” at the Tony Awards, a television hostess called the first daughter “a feckless c–t” on her TV program, another actor suggested the president’s 11-year-old son should be put in a cage with pedophiles. And all of this from Hollywood: the land of inclusion and diversity. Maybe it was just another episode in the reality show that is still unfolding. Or maybe when you’re roiling in childish rage, the first thing you lose is judgment, and then comes common sense. And finally you lose your mind and along with that, your freedom.
Hoo boy, that’s gonna leave a mark."

Scouted: These Bed Frame Styles Will Help You Kickstart Your Bedroom Makeover,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.grudo@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Grudo),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bed-frames-guide-from-panel-to-platform-and-headboard-to-storage,"Scouted By The Beast
We spend so much time in our beds that it’s important to build our bedrooms with intention — and bed frames both determine the function of various mattresses available to you and go a long way in establishing your room’s aesthetic.
We’ve covered sleeping habits extensively (Scouted staff takes its Zs seriously), including advice for light sleepers , mattress shoppers , the sleep masked , the bedroom accessories-obsessed , air purists , and, of course, snorers .
In my own search for a perfect bedframe this spring, I put together some of the highest rated frames I came across that stood out to me as great examples of the styles I’m contemplating.
Beverly Bed in Ivory , $1,295 at One King’s Lane: Simple and minimal, this panel bed allows for your mattress to include a box spring. Its iron framework is hand-finished in gold and the padded upholstery trim cushions you for bedtime reading or late-night (or weekend or anytime) TV watching.
Darcey Cast Iron Metal Bronze , $495 at Pier 1: The headboard and footboard combo doesn’t have to be huge and overwhelming. This cast iron style is comprised of an iron tube frame and rounded corners. The antiqued golden finish and the sparse design lets this piece accent a room based on traditional, romantic, or rustic decor.
Roselawn Upholstered Platform Bed , $358 at Wayfair: Low to the ground and majestic in appearance, the platform bed is similar to a panel bed but lets you throw a mattress directly on it without the need for a springboard. The gray of the Roselawn and its upholstery mean there are few styles it won’t complement, and the elegant styling will elevate your bedroom’s feel (and touch).
Nexera’s Tribeca Storage Bed , $653 at Target: Storage beds are very necessary for some of us and very nice to have for others. Either way, it at least makes sense to make use of the space under your bed if you’re not going for a simplistic aesthetic. And the Tribeca does a great job in maintaining minimalist looks while concurrently providing three reversible storage drawers that you can install on either side of the bed. The headboard further includes two storage spaces, one on each side, for books, Kindles, or phones.
Poundex Louis Phillipe French Style Sleigh Platform Bed , $775 on Amazon: The sleigh style (so-called because its backward curving headboard is styled in a way reminiscent of a sleigh) works best in a luxurious aesthetic. And when the occasion arises, outfitting your bedroom to match can really elevate the entire room and even enhance the calm you’ll experience entering it. The way I see it, a luxurious sleigh bed feels like a sturdy antique, solid and unwavering, supporting your sleep and wildest dreams. This highly-rated French style comprises a deep and attractive cherry wood.
If you’re looking to level up your bedroom this spring, starting with a frame that matches the aesthetic and style you want to achieve is a foundational step in your journey.

Republican Jewish Coalition Has to Remind Trump: We Didn’t Support Obama,www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/republican-jewish-coalition-has-to-remind-trump-we-didnt-support-obama,"Republican Jewish Coalition Has to Remind Trump: We Didn’t Support Obama “How the hell did you support President Obama?” Trump asked the GOP audience. 04.06.19 5:35 PM ET Ethan Miller/Getty
Addressing a crowd of American Jews Saturday, Donald Trump repeated one of his favorite attack lines against former President Barack Obama, saying he had ruined America’s economy and decimated the military. “How the hell did you support President Obama?” he asked the audience. “How did you do it?”
The only problem was, they didn’t. Trump was addressing the annual conference Republican Jewish Coalition, a powerful lobbying group backed by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson . The audience members quickly reminded the president they had not supported his Democratic predecessor.
Trump’s speech was meant to drum up support from American Jews—a voting bloc that has traditionally voted Democratic. The president has attempted to shift this allegiance in recent years, granting the Israel government political favors like sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights region. He has also thrown his support behind Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is up for re-election next week.
On Saturday, Trump occasionally appeared to confuse the American Jewish audience with Israelis, calling Netanyahu “your prime minister” and saying Democrats “very well could leave Israel out there all by yourselves.”
“I know that the Republican Jewish Coalition will help lead our party to another historic victory,” Trump said. “We need more Republicans. Let's go, so we can win everything.”
Trump returned several times to the idea of Democrats betraying Jewish voters. Earlier in the speech, he mocked Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has previously expressed disdain for the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC. The president offered a sarcastic “special thanks” to Rep. Omar before adding, “Oh, I forgot, she doesn't like Israel. I’m so sorry.”
The remark came less than a day after a New York man was arrested for threatening to kill the congresswoman . According to a criminal complaint, the man told the FBI he “loves the president” and “hates radical Muslims in our government.” A representative for Rep. Omar did not respond to a request for comment.
Saturday’s gathering was protested by the progressive Jewish organization IfNotNow, which opposes the Israeli occupation. Ten protesters stood up in the back of the room and chanted “Jews are here to say, ‘Occupation is a plague.’” Their intention was to encourage the Jewish community to reject Trump, Netanyahu, and the RJC, according to a press release.
The group’s cries were drowned out by RJC members chanting “USA” and “Four more years.” As one of the protesters was removed from the room, Trump remarked, “He's going back home to mommy and he will be reprimanded.” READ THIS LIST"
Student in Viral Border Patrol Video: University Caved to Pressure to Punish Me,www.thedailybeast.com,kelly.weill@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Weill),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/denisse-moreno-melchor-student-in-viral-border-patrol-video-university-of-arizona-caved-to-pressure-to-punish-me,"exclusive Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast
At first, the University of Arizona was helpful. “I got a call from the Dean of Students Office,” Denisse Melchor said. “They’re like, ‘Are you okay, we’ve been receiving so many threats naming you.’”
Then a local Border Patrol union leader started lashing out against her on the radio. Now Melchor and another student are facing criminal charges, brought by the University of Arizona’s own police force .
Melchor, 20, and fellow student Mariel Bustamante, 22, became the center of a media firestorm last month, after a viral video showed students protesting Border Patrol agents at the University of Arizona. This week, the school charged both students with “interference with the peaceful conduct of an educational institution,” for which they face up to six months in jail. In a letter to students, the school’s president accused the young women of infringing on “free speech” rights with their alleged protest.
But Melchor said she’s the one facing a threat to her free speech. “I feel like this is an attempt to silence me,” she told The Daily Beast.
Video of the protest shows a student criticizing two Border Patrol agents through an open classroom door, where they are speaking to the university’s Criminal Justice club. The student calls the agents “Murder Patrol,” and other students take up the chant later as the agents get into their car. As the video racked up views in conservative media, Melchor began receiving threats, and at first, the university offered assistance, she said.
But a relatively neutral statement on the incident from the university’s student government drew the ire of a local Border Patrol union. In a Facebook statement, the union called the protest an “attack” on “Caucasian students.”
National Border Patrol Council Vice President Art Del Cueto took the provocation further. In a radio interview, he told listeners to “send me the names of the actual illegal aliens at the school and their addresses and I will be glad, on behalf of the Border Patrol union, to send any type of information when agents are going to be at their school.”
After the union and Del Cueto began their offensive, the university changed its attitude, Melchor said.
“After del Cueto started coming out and putting pressure on the school and UAPD [University of Arizona Police] to investigate, it’s like the Dean of Students went silent with me and stopped checking in.”
The university pushed back on the claim. ""To my knowledge, the dean of students continues to work with the students,"" a university spokesperson told The Daily Beast.
Melchor described the school as unequal in its treatment of disruption on campus. She cited the case of “Brother Dean Saxton,” a hate preacher who made a name for standing on campus screaming obscenities about women and LGBT people.
“We all remember Brother Dean Saxton,” she said. “He’d yell at people walking by, at women, saying ‘you deserve to get raped,’ saying people who wear leggings deserve to get raped. He’d sit out there for hours, yelling and yelling. They let him get to the point where he kicked someone in the chest. ”
In her case, however, Melchor has had to hand over her phone to university police, and has not received it back nearly a week later. A school detective told her its return “‘could be days, could be weeks, could be months.’ That’s my only form of communication. I’m a student living in Tucson, my family lives in another city,” she said. “I feel like they’re just using intimidation tactics.”
She said the investigation won’t stop opposition to Border Patrol on campuses like hers.
“This has been something people have been fighting before, since before I was even thinking about going to college,” she said, citing three Mexican teenagers who were fatally shot while standing in Mexico, by Border Patrol agents standing on the U.S. side.
“The presence of Border Patrol on campus is traumatizing for students; it’s triggering for students. The safety of students and their ability to be in an education environment where they can continue their studies comfortably should be the number one priority for the university.” READ THIS LIST"

Newsmakers who are invited to address the Foreign Press Association in Israel are usually diplomats, politicians, senior army officers or high ranking public servants. Entertainers are a rarity if invited to speak at all. Then again, it’s been a long time since Israel last hosted the Eurovision, and the person who is responsible for bringing Eurovision to Israel is Netta Barzilai who did more than simply win an international song contest. She also conveyed the global message that there’s no need to be embarrassed or ashamed just because you’re not exactly mainstream. Just be yourself. And she certainly has been her somewhat eccentric self, which earned her many fans worldwide. Just a couple of weeks ahead of this year’s Eurovision, Barzilai will tell members of the FPA about her momentous year as the Eurovision champion, how she has been spreading her message of tolerance and inclusion, and will share her thoughts about this year’s Eurovision contest in Tel Aviv. ■ ON THE subject of inclusion, regardless of the obstacles confronting gay men in Israel who want to be daddies, those who are really keen are finding surrogate mothers abroad. Labor MK Itzik Shmuli and his partner recently welcomed a bouncy baby boy, and singer Ivri Lider, who after a long debate with himself, decided to find a surrogate mother in the United States. Last week he posted the results of her ultrasound on his Instagram account. He still has to wait a few months to welcome his son, but he cannot understand why he has to be so geographically far away from “the wonderful woman” who is carrying his baby. He would like to be physically close so as to be there to experience the joy of the baby’s development in the womb, instead of relying on long-distance ultrasound images. It really isn’t fair that lesbians in Israel can have a sperm donor baby from someone with whom they have absolutely no contact, or if they choose, they can find a donor who is interested in the birth and may even accept some responsibility for the child’s welfare. But gay men who want to become fathers have to go beyond Israel’s borders, and then have to fight to have the baby converted to Judaism. Labor MK Michal Biran found an ideal solution that is not available to everyone. She hooked up with a gay man who is looking to be a father. She is carrying his baby, and they will both be parents to the child. Of course there are a lot of heterosexual single mothers whose children were born via sperm donations, but they seldom know the identity of the donor, and in most cases the donor does not want to know anything about the baby. But in cases where donors do want to know, especially those donors who are gay and cannot afford the expenditure involved in making arrangements for a surrogate mother abroad, there ought to be some kind of matching service whereby they get to know the mother of their child and make arrangements for joint custody, or at least accepting responsibility for the child in the event that the mother develops a serious illness or dies. ■ THE WOLF Foundation, which encourages and rewards scholastic excellence, last week awarded its Krill Prizes for Excellence in Scientific Research. The total value of the prizes, which are awarded annually, is $100,000. The areas of research are exact sciences, life sciences, medicine, agriculture and engineering. The prizes are awarded to excelling faculty members at universities in Israel who hold the nontenured positions of lecturer or senior lecturer. Recipients are selected by the Wolf Foundation Scholarship Committee from outstanding candidates, submitted by all universities. The selection is made on the basis of the candidate’s excellence and the importance of his or her field of research. Wolf Foundation CEO Reut Inon Berman commented: “Right before the elections to the Knesset, we again see the importance of investment in Israeli academic research and the enormous potential of the researchers in Israel. We have so much to be proud of and, yet, I hope one day we will see an expression of this in the parties’ agendas.” Chairman of the Krill Prize Committee Hagai Netzer noted: “Krill Prize laureates are part of a chosen group of young scientists who will lead the direction of the 21st century in the field of science. The prize, on one hand, reflects their great achievements and on the other hand, puts a great responsibility on their shoulders.” ■ MODI ’ IN-BASED photographer Debbie Zimelman, who is originally from the US and has been living in Israel for 30 years, chose a very controversial subject for her most recent book – Women on the Front Lines – Inside the Combat Units of the Israeli Army. It’s a strange phenomenon that the more that certain rabbis speak against women joining the army at all, let alone opting for combat units, the more Orthodox young women join the army and ask to be able to serve in combat units. It’s not all that long ago that women were permitted to serve in combat units. Zimelman is launching her book in Mod’in on Monday evening, April 8. She will talk about what motivated her, and will share some of the experiences she had during the year and a half in which she worked on the project. Some of the subjects who she caught in the lens of her camera will be present and two of them will be interviewed. Zimelman, who has photographed extensively for publications in Israel and abroad, says the book is a milestone in her career. ■ THE JUDICIAL system does not give sufficient consideration to victims of sexual assault and harassment, says Orit Sulitzeanu, director-general of the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel, but she does credit the legislature with being sufficiently aware and concerned to enact laws designed to protect women and prosecute those who attack them. The association is running a series of seminars and lectures on the subject. The upcoming seminar on April 16 is dedicated to the procedures that should be taken by rape victims or those who have been subjected to any other form of sexual assault. The seminar starts at 9 a.m. and will be held in Building 4 (daleth), Room 262 on the Academic Campus of the College of Management Academic Studies. ■ THE VALUE that Jews place on education can be seen in the number of foundations organizations and individual philanthropists that are dedicated to providing the best possible education facilities and environment for Israeli students. JNF-USA is now undertaking an extremely ambitious project to create an education village for the purpose of better connecting Israel with the global community. JNF-USA has projects in many parts of Israel, but its main focus has been on helping to develop the south of the country. The education village will be located in rapidly developing Beersheba. In order to pay for the cost, JNF-USA has a launched a mega-gift $300 million fund-raising drive headed by Chicago native and leading philanthropist Richard Wexler. The new JNF Israel Education and Technology Center is being designed as a state-of-the-art facility offering dormitory buildings, 100 apartments, a dining hall, restaurant, cafes, a synagogue, conference center, classrooms and community and leisure rooms. It will provide three separate centers within the village: a Zionist education center for 200 adults at a time to study, live and connect with Israelis and Jews from across the globe; a technology center offering 100 college and post-college students one- to two-year-long internships in Beersheba, where more than 60 global hi-tech and cyber companies have opened operations; and the southern campus of the Alexander Muss High School based in Hod Hasharon, which annually educates some 1,500 students in its college-preparatory study-abroad program. The new Muss facility will have the capacity to house up to 5,000 high school students from the United States and other countries who come to Israel and study Jewish history for six-week and semester-long programs, as well as summer sessions. Construction of the village is expected to begin next year, with an opening date planned for 2024. Ground was broken in February, just inside the Beersheba River Park, which covers an area three times the size of New York’s Central Park, with a large lake, swimming pool, soccer fields, recreational activities, running paths and a 13,000-seat amphitheater within close proximity to the site for the village. ■ EULOGIZERS OF Yiddish have been premature in their predictions of the demise of Yiddish culture. Last week in Tel Aviv, Yiddishpiel attracted a full house and continues to do so. Seen in the audience was Yaakov Bodo, who is usually standing on the Yiddishpiel stage instead of siting in the auditorium. Bodo celebrated his 88th birthday at the end of March, and when he came out into the lobby after the show, scores of people wanted to take selfies with him. Others present included Yiddishpiel founder and former director Shmuel Atzmon and Bella Bryks-Klein, who publishes a monthly newsletter about Yiddish events all over Israel. The newsletter is called Vos Ven Vu, which translates as What, When, Where. greerfc@gmail.com

The Bad Plus never stop,www.jpost.com,JENNIFER GREENBERG,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/The-Bad-Plus-never-stop-585971,"The Bad Plus never stop Experimental rock/jazz collective returns to Israel in May By JENNIFER GREENBERG The Bad Plus (Courtesy). (photo credit: Courtesy)
Good chemistry is hard to come by, especially in the jazz world. Every successful jazz trio starts off as a blind chemistry experiment: add equal parts piano, bass and drums. Stir gently. Observe. The chances of obtaining conclusive results are typically slim; however, there is nothing typical about Reid Anderson, Dave King and Ethan Iverson, founding members of the decades-long, boundary-pushing cooperative, The Bad Plus.“The three of us had a natural chemistry from the beginning,” Anderson told The Jerusalem Post ahead of the band’s return to Tel Aviv for a show on May 6 at the Barby Club. “But of course, playing together for 18 years unleashed a lot of music. What developed from that, you can’t get there any other way.” Anderson (bassist) and King (drummer) have known each other since junior high school. In 1989, Anderson – a then college freshman – met pianist Iverson – who was still in high school at the time – and invited him to jam in his parents’ living room in Minneapolis.“That basically led to nothing,” the veteran bassist confesses. “Fast forward 10 years… we had all been out reading different groups, writing music, developing as young jazz musicians and we thought ‘What would happen if we got together?’”All three budding musicians were already fans of each other’s projects at the time and occasionally collaborated with one another, but it was only after deciding to play a few exclusive trio gigs that The Bad Plus was born.Anderson reflects “We immediately knew that we had something that was unique. We were all on the same page about wanting to create an actual cooperative band. We saw it as an opportunity to commit to the long run and develop our voice along the way. We had visions for the future: a group sound and group music.”The Bad Plus’s collective identity strayed from the usual jazz trio format, which generally casts the pianist as frontman. Their roles as three equal contributors formed the basis for a wildly successful, homogeneous solution – no leader too acidic, no follower too basic. From the band’s rock inspired Black Sabbath and Nirvana covers to their individual genre-defying compositions flaunting a triad of strong, yet harmonious personalities, the trio hit the ground – or more fittingly, road – running in 2000.Since the band’s inception, they have racked up an impressive live performance count (approximately 160 shows per year, adding up to over 2500 shows to date), earning themselves the unofficial “road band” title.Unfortunately, as the adage goes, all good things must come to an end. Anderson and King were thrown this curve ball in the spring of 2017, when Iverson decided to leave the group.“It was definitely a mutual feeling that things needed to change,” Anderson chooses his words wisely. He admits that they really considered ending the band at that point, but ultimately changed their minds. “We had spent 18 years building this thing and it’s this huge part of our lives, so Dave and I decided there was no reason for that to stop.”The duo’s hard-headed persistence is reflected in their first studio album without Iverson (their 13th overall). Aptly titled, Never Stop II is a daring collection of coverless compositions introducing long-time friend and pianist Orrin Evans.“We had discussed getting somebody else before,” Anderson shares. “One way or another, we knew something like this was eventually going to happen. Orrin was the one person that we returned to without fail. He was the obvious choice and fortunately, his response was an immediate yes.”The Bad Plus have played a handful of shows in Tel Aviv, with appearances at the Red Sea Jazz Festival and the Jerusalem Jazz Festival (organized by Avishai Cohen, who is a good friend of the band). But their May show will be their first here sporting the new trio.“Music aside, I am most excited to eat amazing food, hang by the beach, and devour hummus from Abu Hassan,” he jokes, clearly coming to do the White City justice.When asked how he feels his Israeli fans will respond to the new makeup, Anderson responds, “I’m not worried. I am confident that the music that we’ve built and our philosophy behind it is strong enough to carry through and disprove any doubtful people. We’re performing music from the record, but also music from our entire body of work, including older music. So, this is very much a continuation of the old as we ride into the new.”Since the release of Never Stop II, the boys have spent the year touring in their usual fashion, and the audience response so far has been nothing but positive.“The best compliments that we’ve gotten over the last year are: ‘It sounds different, but it still sounds like The Bad Plus’ or ‘I was worried, but that was fantastic!’ That’s absolutely what we wanted to achieve because Orrin is a very different player, and, of course, if one third of the band is really different, it’s going to sound different.”

Fox News’ Sean Hannity insisted that it is no longer innocent until proven guilty.
In today’s world, he told Watters’ World host Jesse Watters , it is guilt “by accusation.”
During an interview where he boasted about his investigative bona fides and talked about how he repeatedly got things right when others did not, Hannity warned Watters that when you get too big, critics will want to silence you.
“They are gonna want to crush you, they want to silence every voice they don’t like and agree with,” Hannity said. “Tucker [Carlson], Laura [Ingraham], me, we’ve all…Rush [Limbaugh], [Glenn] Beck, Mark [Levin], [Bill] O’Reilly you name it… your voice becomes powerful they want to silence you.”
Watters then quipped that the critics will give him the benefit of the doubt.
“No,” Hannity replied.
“Not innocent until proven guilty?” Watters asked.
“No…guilt by accusation, actually,” Hannity said, before noting it wasn’t about the issue anymore but “politics.”
Then, after Watters insisted that the media does not hold Democrats accountable like they do Democrats because “they’re all in the same side,” Hannity offered this not about the state of journalism.
“Journalism is dead,” he said. “I said it in 2007.”

Howard Schultz Says He’ll Siphon Off Millions of Trump Voters ‘On Character Alone’,www.mediaite.com,Tamar Auber,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.mediaite.com/tv/howard-schultz-says-hell-siphon-off-millions-of-trump-voters-on-character-alone/,"Howard Schultz Says He’ll Siphon Off Millions of Trump Voters ‘On Character Alone’ by Tamar Auber | Apr 6th, 2019, 7:00 pm
Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told CNN’s S.E. Cupp on Saturday that he thinks he will siphon off millions of likely Republican voters from Trump if he decides to run for president in 2020.
Cupp started off by asking Schultz if he was surprised by the Democratic pushback to his potential run.
“You know, I think we expected certainly there would be a level of resistance, not to the degree it came,” Schultz replied. “It’s kind of softened a little bit. Now I think they’re focused on Joe Biden .”
He then said this: “But I think clearly whatever the Democrats are thinking about, I have no understanding why they believe that an extreme position that resembles socialism is going to defeat Donald Trump . It’s not going to happen.”
Cupp then asked him why he was “so convinced” he would woo over millions of Trump voters in 2020.
“On character alone,” Schultz insisted. “There’s millions of lifelong Republicans who do not want to vote for this president and they’re not going for Bernie Sanders. The reason they’re dissatisfied is character, morality.”
He then said that during a town hall on Fox, he asked the audience who want to see their children behave like Trump.
According to Schultz, “Not one hand went up.”

Homestead detention facility to deny Democratic congresswomen access,floridapolitics.com,Jacob Ogles,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/292911-homestead-detention-facility-to-deny-democratic-congresswomen-access,"Homestead detention facility to deny Democratic congresswomen access
Democrats say denying access violates the law. Share this: April 6, 2019 A Homestead refugee detention facility plans to deny three Florida congresswomen access to the facility. U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, all Democrats, planned to visit the Homestead Office of Refugee Resettlement . The representatives issued a joint statement slamming the decision. “Denying entry to oversee the conditions and care provided to the unaccompanied children in the Homestead facility would not only be a breach of transparency and confidence in the care provided there, it would violate the law,” the statement reads. Wasserman Schultz and then-U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson were similarly denied entry to the facility last year. After that happened, the statement notes, Congress took action. “Congress specifically addressed it by ensuring Members would have unencumbered access to such facilities to conduct our constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities,” the statement reads. “Given long-held concerns about the Homestead facility’s lack of staffing, space, education and other services, the recent announcement by the Department of Health and Human Services that it will dramatically expand the number of beds there merits immediate scrutiny.” Wasserman Schultz sponsored the access law. President Donald Trump ’s administration this week announced a major expansion in the Homestead facilities, from 2,350 to 3,200 later this month. That comes after a boost from 1,350 beds to 2,350 beds in January. In total, Democrat point out, that’s a 140-percent increase in child bed capacity in just four months.
Notably, Shalala and Mucarsel-Powell toured the facility after the last expansion in beds. The detention of refugees and treatment of immigrants and family separation by federal officials became a major campaign issue last year. But this moves beyond political debate and into lawlessness, the congresswomen said. “The Department’s initial refusal to allow entry there under these current circumstances is deeply troubling,” the statement reads. “Violating the law is never acceptable, and certainly not in this critical moment.” Other Congressional leaders already warned that if officials denied visitation to members of Congress, there could be consequences. U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, chair of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, on Friday said so much in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar . “The representatives intend to visit the facility to conduct oversight of the condition of the facility and care received by the unaccompanied alien children,” DeLauro wrote. “If the Department of Health and Human Services denies them access, the Department would be in violation of the law.” She urged the department to ensure Homestead officials complied with statute.

Is it true that she is 45 yo, not 37?
Something is going on.
It's needless to say that she is a globalist plant with an agenda. She is frens with Anal Clooney and other Hollywood people. She wants to use her position to further the n w o and the globalist causes. The soros network arranged this marriage between Harry and Meghan, Harry was manipulated to marry her by his 'friends' who got paid for it.
The problem is that Prince Charles is another left wing liberal globalist who wants to use his coming king position to focus on green issues rather than on real problems. I like William and Kate, they are right wing conservatives.

"Scientists Found an Edible Mushroom That Eats Plastic, and It Could Clean Our Landfills",www.renegadetribune.com,Elias Marat,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.renegadetribune.com/scientists-found-an-edible-mushroom-that-eats-plastic-and-it-could-clean-our-landfills/,"By Elias Marat ( TMU ) — Whether we like it or not, our society has become completely reliant on plastic. From food preservation to water transportation, computer technology to healthcare and medicine, plastic can be found in nearly every facet of the human experience.
But as we well know, plastic is a double-edged sword, with massive amounts of plastic waste not only piling up in landfills, but floating in the most remote depths of our oceans and water supplies. And despite our knowledge of plastic’s harmful effects on the environment, we’ve become so reliant on plastic that there seems to be no end in sight. In fact, plastic production is growing on a yearly basis–and posing a potentially mortal threat to us all.
However, a newly-discovered type of mushroom could not only play a crucial role in slashing plastic pollution, but could have myriad other uses in addressing the environmental crises the planet faces.
Discovered in 2012 by Yale University students, Pestalotiopsis microspora is a rare species of mushroom from the Amazon rainforest that’s capable of subsisting on a diet of pure plastic, or more accurately, the main ingredient in plastic–polyurethane–before converting the human-made ingredient into purely organic matter.
And not only can Pestalotiopsis microspora live off of our plastic waste, it can also live without oxygen–meaning that the rare breed of mushroom would make an ideal agent for landfill clean-up, literally from the bottom-up.
While the idea sounds fantastic, some scientists have expressed hope that the plastic-consuming fungi can form the basis of the community waste treatment centers of the future–replacing our current practice of dumping our trash into centralized, massive landfills with small, mushroom-centered community composting centers or even home recycling kits, according to Epoch Times .
And as it turns out, Pestalotiopsis microspora isn’t alone in the world of plastic-eating mushrooms–and some of its plastic-consuming kin are event perfectly safe for us humans to consume.
In a study led by Katharina Unger for Utrecht University in the Netherlands, oyster mushrooms and other types of mushrooms were placed in agar cups with plastic waste and held in a climate-controlled dome-shaped environment. After about a month, the roots of the mushroom consumed and transformed the plastic into an edible biomass–or food–that was completely free of any toxicity from the polyurethane.
Not only was the finished product completely free of plastic, but they also had an appealing taste, according to Unger, who described them as “ sweet with the smell of anise or licorice.”
Yes, that’s right: for the very first time in history, plastic trash could be a part of our food chain–in a deliberate and surprisingly healthy way. Indeed, such a discovery–if refined–could be a part of a novel solution to food scarcity in a world brimming-over with plastic waste yet scarce on food for hundreds of millions of people.
“ Our research partner [Utrecht University] expects that the digestion will go much quicker once processes are fully researched and optimized,” Unger told Dezeen magazine, adding that her team “imagined it as being used with a community or small farm setting.”
The benefits of plastic-eating mushrooms seem limitless. At the State of the World’s Fungi 2018 event in Kew Gardens, London, fungi that process polyurethane were also found to be suitable as “mushroom bricks,” or a durable and sustainable building material that could be suitable for building homes.
The management and elimination of plastic waste is among the greatest challenges we face in saving our environment. But if the natural rate of decomposition can be reduced from 400 years to a mere few months, then these fungi could soon be taking over the world. "
Frightening Drug-Resistant Infection Cropping Up Around The World | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45644/frightening-drug-resistant-infection-cropping-ashe-schow,"Frightening Drug-Resistant Infection Cropping Up Around The World Virojt Changyencham/Getty Images
Across the world, a new drug-resistant infection has appeared.
The New York Times reported Saturday morning that an elderly man was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital’s branch in Brooklyn for abdominal surgery. After getting his blood tested, it was revealed that he was infected with Candida auris, a fungus that was recently discovered but has been identified in patients around the world. The fungus is most deadly to those with already weak immune systems.
The elderly man, who was not named by the Times, was isolated in the intensive care unit, but died 90 days later. What makes his case so frightening is that after his death, doctors tested his room and discovered the fungus was everywhere .
“Everything was positive — the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,” Dr. Scott Lorin, president of the Brooklyn branch, told the Times. “The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.”
The hospital had to use “special cleaning equipment” and even had to remove part of the ceiling and floors to get rid of the fungus.
Reports of C. auris have come from Venezuela, Spain, Great Britain, India, Pakistan, and South Africa, according to the Times. In the U.S., cases in Illinois and New Jersey have also been reported, as well as others in New York.
The Centers for Disease Control said it “identified 51 clinical case-patients and 61 screening case-patients” in New York alone . The CDC reported 45% of the clinical case-patients died within 90 days.
Further, in the same study linked above, 98% of the clinical-case patients were resistant to fluconazole, which is used to treat serious fungal infections such as meningitis. The strength and resistance of the infection led the CDC to deem C. auris a “ serious threat ,” and said it infected 3,400 and caused 220 deaths per year.
The CDC also reported that the median age for the clinical case-patients was 72, but that the ages of those infected ranged from 21 to 96 years. Fifty-one percent of those infected were male, and all patients had “serious concurrent medical conditions,” such as needing “mechanical ventilation or central venous catheters or gastrostomy tubes.”
Infections like C. auris have been able to thrive due to the overuse of antibiotics, the Times reported. Such over-prescribing has reduced the effectiveness of the drugs, allowing once curable bacterial infections to thrive once again. Now, fungal infections are becoming resistant.
Naturally, those most at risk of these “superbugs” are newborns and the elderly, who generally have weaker immune systems."
Rachel Maddow As the Symbol Of American Journalism’s Corruption,ethicsalarms.com,Jack Marshall,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://ethicsalarms.com/2019/04/06/rachel-maddow-as-the-symbol-of-american-journalisms-corruption/,"April 7, 2019 at 9:27 am
Michael wrote: “Their entire lives, they have been told that the US is bad, white people are bad, Democrats are good, multiculturalism is good, communism is good by every authority figures in their lives (the press, schools, their parents, etc). Progressivism also sets up an evil adversary to be mocked and despised. They have been told that most ‘conservative’ Americans are racist stooges, too stupid to know better. Americans are led by overt racists and demagogues. You can hear this when Obama speaks about Americans and says they cling to their ‘guns and religion’ or when Clinton talks about the ‘basket of deplorables’.”
Some bold comments, offered nevertheless respectfully
I see Michael as coming right up to the edge of a ‘necessary revelation’. He sees that these ‘progressives’ have their specific links to very destructive potential (the term progressive-totalitarian has been gaining ground), but in my view he is not stating in clear terms what is going to be required to confront and to defeat *them*. As a starting point: It must be positively asserted that multiculturalism as a social and economic project in America, and by extension when America exports this pernicious and wicked project to the lands it bombs to bits and where it seeks to install its ‘democratic system’, must be seen as a cultural and economic movement that must be reversed . Not complained about (endlessly): positively countered .
Second, that the national school system and what stands behind it, that is: the progressive ‘agenda’ and its known links to the so-called ‘Progressive Establishment’, and this means the NY Intellectual Establishment and everyone knows what else that means, must be confronted and countered with something positive, not abstract and weak. This will mean, and can only mean, a sort of cultural revolution in what is taught. When this goes forward it will amount to a social revolution. It will be adamantly opposed by the Progressive-Communistic set, and that set, today, is systemically entrenched and will not surrender their achieved power easily. They will go to the mat, as the saying goes.
This ‘mocking and despising’ is allowed because white people — the white people of America — have allowed it to happen. Because they have internalized this view. This is how they see themselves. They need to regain a power that would allow them when someone ‘mocks and despises’ to turn around and crack their skulls onto the pavement. Behind the assault on ‘whiteness’ (the assault on ‘America’ is related to this) is a terrifying violence that has been taking its tole. The damage is not ‘to be done’ in some abstract future, it is being done now . And the White American Coward can do nothing (except complain). This entire issue, this problem, stands upon and turns around the use of power and also of violence. When the ‘enemy’ knows that ‘mocking and despising’ will result in a cracked head, the hospital, and death, he and she will change their tune toot sweet . This is really what Jordan Peterson talks about when he warns that if the Progressive Left keeps pushing they are going to force the larger demographic to awake in consciousness and to become capable of taking action.
White America, as an extension of its ‘awakening’ and the reclaiming of its power, needs to go over in careful detail what ‘racism’ actually means. It needs to revisit the topic and to understand what these ideas were based on. It needs to understand — and believe in, profoundly so — why it was that original America was conceived as a place for ‘ourselves and our posterity’. It needs to confront the difficult — the possibly insurmountable — problem of who ‘we’ are (what does ‘we’ mean) and then who our ‘posterity’ really is (and should be). I suggest that it is not, and will not be, African Muslims living in Minneapolis. The entire issue of National Identity causes the so-called ‘conservatives’ to defecate themselves. The entire idea is a counter-current to the indoctrination that has been forced into their heads in the perverse education-system and which is almost impossible for them to confront! They are stuck therefore in the Multicultural Moral Construct and basically work for what is slowly boiling them out of existence, like the frog in the slowly heated pot.
It is not that the American Conservatives are stupid but that they are not conservatives. They sold out ages ago. Many know this. They are more akin to traitors than to stupid people; a particularly pernicious treachery because they are positioned deeply in the System. They are complicit in the structures that have been established, and they have no developed ideological position that enables themselves to stand upright, like men. They have given up having a backbone and, taken on the whole, they serve the *agenda* outlined by progressive theory. Again just try to imagine a genuine Conservative! With a genuine position that has any teeth to it at all that would be capable of confronting the Present and what is being done.
Let someone come forward and say:
“I want to live in a more-or-less racially homogenous America and send my children to a school where 25 different ethnic groups are not represented. I refuse to be ‘mocked and despised’ and if you keep doing this I will attack you and destroy you. I want to continue to develop European-centered civilization and to honor and value OUR TRADITIONS and what made us what we are. I will not stand by as some perverse resentful elite socially engineers me and mine out of existence. If acting to preserve my own people, my own stock, my own culture, my communities, my state, my form of government is ‘racist’— so be it! I will now go on to define myself through that term and I will do this through applied ethics.”
You see, you can send a million pounds of bombs and drop them anonymously on some impoverished, terrified people somewhere, kill and maim them, but you cannot stand up like men in your own country. This is how cowardice is defined.
In any case, after 5 years of research . . . you can get here an idea of where my thoughts tend! 🙂"
