Donald Trump's new oddly specific denial about the Mueller report gives something away - Palmer Report,www.palmerreport.com,Bill Palmer,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.palmerreport.com/analysis/oddly-specific-denial-trump-mueller-report/17223/,"Line
Donald Trump went berserk today, which isn’t surprising, because he tends to do that on days that end with a “y.” But when Trump went off the deep end today about the Mueller report, he made an oddly specific denial that shouldn’t be overlooked – because he gave away something in the process.
Here’s part of what Donald Trump tweeted, and see if you can spot the big giveaway: “I have not read the Mueller Report yet, even though I have every right to do so. Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion. Likewise, recommendations made to our great A.G. who found No Obstruction.” Yeah that’s right, even though no one has been asking Trump if he’s already read the report, he just preemptively claimed he hasn’t read it – and whenever he does this kind of thing, he’s lying.
The tricky part is figuring out precisely what Trump is lying about here. Do we think he’s read the entire Mueller report, which is reported to be in the neighborhood of four hundred pages? Of course not. This is a guy who, by all accounts, can’t focus long enough to read a two page briefing memo. But because the liar-in-chief is claiming not to know the details of the report, it means that someone has told him something about the details – and that’s significant.
Does this mean that William Barr has given the entire Mueller report to Donald Trump’s handlers, who have turned around and briefed Trump on it? If so, that’s felony obstruction of justice on Barr’s part. It also raises the question of whether Trump’s handlers gave him the ugly truth about how screwed he is, or misleadingly told him that he was off the hook so he wouldn’t completely fall to pieces. In any case, thanks to Trump’s mouth, we now know that Trump and Barr are conspiring in some way when it comes to the contents of the report – and that could be an even bigger criminal scandal than what’s in the report.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
What’s Bernie Sanders trying to do here? If he’s right and there’s “a global struggle taking place of enormous consequence,” then he’s the last guy we want in the White House in 2021. Are we going to trust a socialist who honeymooned in the Soviet Union and now owns three houses to steer us through something of that magnitude? There is a global struggle taking place of enormous consequence. Right-wing authoritarians backed by a network of multi-billionaire oligarchs are forming a common front. We who believe in democracy must join together to build a progressive global order based on human solidarity.
— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 6, 2019
Um, what now? A progressive global order? Hard pass. We’re kind of fond of the sovereign republic based on the Constitution we already have. Wow, can I have that recipe for you word salad, Bern? @CestAlain"

Shortly before Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed his report on the Russia investigation last month, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., alerted Attorney General Bill Barr to what they described as the “selective” use of emails in Mueller court filings — as well as potential “improper political influence, misconduct, and mismanagement” in the FBI’s original Russia probe.
In a March 8 letter, Grassley and Graham referred Barr to a letter sent to Mueller in late 2017 that alleged his investigators had cherry-picked details from emails to include in court documents, urging him to review the materials. They also notified him that they had asked DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz a year earlier to review the original FBI probe.
Fox News has also obtained the 2017 letter (above) from Grassley to Mueller, which spelled out the lawmakers’ concerns about the “absence of additional context” in the court filings — as well as concerns over how those documents were covered in the media. “The glaring lack of [context] feeds speculation and innuendo that distorts the facts,” Grassley wrote at the time.
That court filing said Papadopoulos emailed another campaign official in May 2016 with the subject line, “Request from Russia to meet Mr. Trump.” The document said the email stated that Russia “has been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me to discuss,” adding in a footnote that the official forwarded the email to another campaign official asking to discuss: “We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.”
The senators said media outlets then seized on the fragments to report a “Campaign official suggested ‘low level’ staff should go to Russia.” However, they said the full emails — obtained from the Trump campaign — tell a different story.
“In full context, the emails in question actually show that the Trump Campaign wanted someone ‘low level’ to decline these types of invitations,” Grassley and Graham wrote in the letter to Barr.
Anybody surprised? If so, may I ask why , exactly? The remarkable thing is that they were so confident that none of this base deception would ever be unearthed that they were willing to resort to it in the first place. Then again, though, that might have been more a matter of panic and desperation than it was confidence."

Actually, that's not true. They just rightfully don't consider them advertising.
A free discussion of issues is vital for a functioning democratic republic. Limiting discussion of issues because there are people who misuse those discussions to cause strife is like limiting any other discussion because there are Internet Trolls.
What needs to be done is to find a way to limit the effects of trolling. That's not something government does well. Government does one-size-is-equally-uncomfortable-for-all well, but not attention to complexity and specifics.
A variety of venues, each developing their own ways of dealing with trolling is how the Internet got to where it is. I can understand why Z doesn't want a variety of venues but the defacto monopolies are more of a problem than any attempts by extra-nationals to troll elections."
Rule Of Law And Institutions Needed For Recovery In Iraq And Syria,www.eurasiareview.com,Eurasia Review,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/07042019-rule-of-law-and-institutions-needed-for-recovery-in-iraq-and-syria/,"By Eurasia Review
The private sector will need to play a central role in the reconstruction of war-torn countries such as Iraq and Syria. Before that can happen, businesses must be confident in the investment climate. “You cannot invest in a place where there is no rule of law,” said Alain Bejjani, Chief Executive Officer of Majid Al Futtaim Holding, United Arab Emirates, in a session at the World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa. “Without it, neither domestic nor foreign investment can happen.”
Job creation can help combat a return to extremism. “A lot of people did not join the militias because of ideology,” said Leena Al Olaimy, Co-Founder and Managing Director of 3 BL Associates, Bahrain. Often, it was due to unemployment and lack of options. Bejjani observed that “there are bad economies in numerous countries. This leads to extremism.”
“Business can play a role, including in changing the culture to encourage diversity, inclusion and tolerance in the workplace,” said Al Olaimy. “Most of the issues we face in conflicts are related to a crisis in values” – which she believes the private sector can help address.
Ghassan Hasbani, Deputy Prime Minister of Lebanon, made a similar observation: “If you do not have the rule of law, regulations for the economy, and institutions, regardless of whether you have reconciliation at the community level, you will not have stability … When the rule of law is in place, we can go from reconciliation to citizenship.”
“Our religious message is clear,” said Seyed Salih Al-Hakim, Director of the Al-Kalima Center for Dialogue and Cooperation, Iraq. “We need people to understand coexistence. Everyone needs to be under the rule of law. That is the foundation of Iraqi society or any society.”
Panellists differed on whether reconciliation is a precondition for reconstruction and the timing of different elements. “If you seek to do reconstruction without reconciliation, you are building on sand,” said Joel Rayburn, Deputy Assistant Secretary and Special Envoy for Syria, US Department of State.
“Reconciliation doesn’t happen at a certain point in time,” noted Ghassan Hasbani. “There needs to be a process. It may require a generation of citizens. You need to build institutions.” Reconciliation includes human, intellectual, cultural and procedural elements, he added.
“I remember that people at the Desmond Tutu Foundation said it was a mistake to wait to do development work after the end of apartheid” in South Africa, recalled Al Olaimy. “Otherwise people are still stuck in the same process. Peace and reconciliation are not the absence of war and a humanitarian crisis. It needs to be a peace-building process.”
Rayburn expressed satisfaction that the insurgents in Syria have “ceased to be a caliphate” but added that “we do not say that the job is done.”
He said that the main difference in Syria is between “those who believe in a military solution and those who believe in a political solution. The United States believes that only a political solution is possible.” Rayburn added: “There has to be a political process. And there should be a government in Syria that behaves differently – that is not hostile to its own people and not hostile to the region.”
Hasbani said he believes that Syrian refugees in his country and elsewhere can begin to go home as soon as certain geographical areas are considered safe. Rayburn urged caution until there is a political solution in the country. “People will not feel that they can go back,” he said.
The World Economic Forum on the Middle East and North Africa is being held at the Dead Sea in Jordan on 6-7 April in partnership with the King Abdullah II Fund for Development (KAFD). The meeting marks the 10th hosted by Jordan since it was first convened at the Dead Sea in 2003.

Joshua Gill on April 5, 2019
A U.K. court sentenced a Muslim Iranian asylum seeker to jail Thursday for stabbing his wife to death, in part for her conversion to Christianity.
Iranian asylum seeker Dana Abdullah stabbed Avan Najmadiein, his estranged wife and 32-year-old mother of four, 50 times in October and left her to die after discovering that she refused to support his application to stay in the U.K., according to the BBC .
Abdullah, 35, returned illegally to the U.K. after being deported in 2013 for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl and he previously threatened to kill his wife because she “dishonored” him by converting to Christianity, authorities said.
“It does show that you are not someone of good character and, having been deported for that matter, you chose to come back into this country illegally and have committed this very serious crime,” Judge Michael Chambers said of Abdullah, according to Premier .
Chambers also lambasted Abdullah for the callous and brutal nature of his crime.
“This was, on any view, a planned and pre-meditated murder involving a brutal and sustained attack using a knife – knowing full well that it would deprive four children under the age of eight of their mother,” Chambers said.
Chambers sentenced Abdullah to a minimum of 18 years and one month in prison. #BREAKING : Dana Abdullah has today pleaded guilty to the murder of Avan Najmadiein in Glebedale Road, #Fenton , on October 1 2018. Abdullah was remanded into custody and will be sentenced on 1 April at Stafford Crown Court. pic.twitter.com/jTer1m7wSf
— Staffordshire Police (@StaffsPolice) February 12, 2019
Detective Victoria Downing characterized Abdullah as “an arrogant and controlling man,” asserting that he killed Najmadiein because he resented her rejection, her refusal to support his application and her conversion to Christianity.
Abdullah murdered Najmadiein with a kitchen knife at her home on Oct. 1, 2018, tried to set her kitchen ablaze in an attempt to erase evidence, then fled, initially to Liverpool, England, and then to Glasgow, Scotland. Authorities discovered Najmadiein’s body at her home when she failed to pick her children up from school. All of her children were under the age of eight at the time.
Abdullah turned himself in to police in Glasgow, but admitted only to being a “failed asylum-seeker” at the time.
Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association, said the violent persecution of those who convert to another religion from Islam is widespread in the U.K.
“We recently wrote a report for the hate crime inquiry on Islamophobia so that we could show the other side of the coin, where much of the persecution of apostates in this country is based on a real hatred for those who quit Islam,” Chowdhry told Premier.
“We do really need to think about how best we protect ourselves in this country,” he added.
As for Najmadeem’s murder, her sister Hevi said it had a “profound emotional impact” on her surviving family members.

Trump admin revokes visa of International Criminal Court prosecutor pursuing Afghan war crimes,thehill.com,Aris Folley,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/437717-trump-admin-revokes-visa-of-international-criminal-court-prosecutor,"Trump admin revokes visa of International Criminal Court prosecutor pursuing Afghan war crimes By Aris Folley - 04/06/19 07:47 PM EDT
The Trump administration revoked the visa of International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda following her inquiry into possible war crimes committed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Bensouda’s office confirmed the revocation in a statement on Friday, in which the office also emphasized that the chief prosecutor ""has an independent and impartial mandate under the Rome statute,” ICC’s founding treaty, The Associated Press reports .
""The Prosecutor and her office will continue to undertake that statutory duty with utmost commitment and professionalism, without fear or favor,"" the statement added. ADVERTISEMENT
The U.S. State Department also confirmed the revocation in a statement to the news agency on Friday, which also said that ""the United States will take the necessary steps to protect its sovereignty and to protect our people from unjust investigation and prosecution by the International Criminal Court.”
Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard Pompeo Trump admin revokes visa of International Criminal Court prosecutor pursuing Afghan war crimes Overnight Defense: Lawmakers urge Trump not to veto Yemen resolution | Pentagon acknowledges civilian deaths in Somalia for first time | Pompeo 'confident' in third North Korea summit Pompeo 'confident' there will be third North Korean summit MORE warned that the U.S. would restrict visas of any ICC staffers who investigate actions by U.S. military personnel over the court’s proposed inquiry into alleged U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan.
“I am announcing a policy of U.S. visa restrictions on those individuals directly responsible for any ICC investigation of U.S. personnel,” Pompeo said in remarks at the State Department then.
“This includes persons who take or have taken action to request or further such an investigation. These visa restrictions may also be used to deter ICC efforts to pursue allied personnel, including Israelis, without allies' consent,” he added.
At the time, Pompeo declined to provide details on how many visas could be affected under the new policy but described the restrictions as “part of a continued effort to convince the ICC to change course with its potential investigation and potential prosecution of Americans.”
“If you’re responsible for the proposed ICC investigation of U.S. personnel in connection with the situation in Afghanistan, you should not assume that you will still have or will get a visa or that you will be permitted to enter the United States,” Pompeo said."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was caught on video making one terribly racist remark | Renewed Right,renewedright.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://renewedright.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-was-caught-on-video-making-one-terribly-racist-remark/,"Liberal Outrage , Politics 68
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is feeling the political heat.
Her “Green New Deal” is the subject of nationwide ridicule and Democrats worry it will lead to Donald Trump’s re-election.
Ocasio-Cortez tried to put a stop to this growing crisis by going on camera, but she made things worse when she made this terribly racist remark.
Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is political star because of her social media use.
So she tried to use that to her advantage in defusing the criticism surrounding her global warming hysteria and the “Green New Deal.”
The New York Democrat compared people mocking her claims that the earth only has 12 years left to segregationists that protested blacks being able to eat at the same lunch counters as whites. On Instagram live, AOC just compared climate change and the world ending in 12 years to the civil rights movement and people protesting against African-Americans… pic.twitter.com/6fcC74h5ny

This – of course – is ludicrous.
The planet is not in danger.
Humanity has more than 12 years left before crossing the point of no return.
And people that oppose a 93 trillion dollar government takeover of the economy are not the equivalent of police officers that blasted civil rights marchers with fire hoses.
The simple fact of the matter is there is no evidence to substantiate any of Ocasio-Cortez’s outlandish claims.
Global warming alarmists have claimed the government only has ten years to act going back to the 1980s.
It’s a fake news hoax designed to allow the Left to impost socialism on America.
As more Americans wake up to that fact, Ocasio-Cortez and her allies become more hysterical. Share this: "

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Prime Minister of the Tripoli-based UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) Fayez Sarraj accused the Libyan National Army (LNA) commander, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, of violating political agreements concluded under the auspices of the United Nations .
""We have stretched out the hand of peace, but the aggression of Haftar's forces and declaration of war against our cities and our capital, and therefore violation of political agreements by him, will only make us resolute and give us strength,"" Sarraj said in a televised statement.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday as Haftar ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the GNA-backed forces. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary.
LNA spokesman Ahmed Al-Mismari said on Friday that Haftar's army was carrying out an offensive on Tripoli in several directions at once but has not yet entered the capital.
As a result of years-long civil conflict, there is no single central government in Libya , and the country's eastern and western parts are controlled by separate powers. The Tobruk-based parliament , elected in 2014 and backed by the LNA, governs the east of Libya , while the GNA, established in 2015 , controls Libya 's western parts from Tripoli .
In late 2015 , the parties to the conflict signed a Libyan Political Agreement in the Moroccan city of Skhirat, outlining the creation of the GNA as the legitimate interim Libyan government , however, the deal was not fully implemented due to the eastern-based parliament 's disagreement over some of its provisions."

Parties asked for a six-month stay on planned trial. Share this:
on April 6, 2019 Environmental groups reached a tentative settlement agreement with Florida Power & Light over a lawsuit involving the Turkey Point nuclear plant. A joint statement released by FPL and three plaintiffs suing the power giant confirmed peace was in sight. Organizations suing include Friends of the Everglades , Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and the Tropical Audubon Society . “The parties in the Clean Water Act lawsuit (FPL, FOE, SACE, TAS) have reached settlement in the suit and have requested a stay in the legal proceedings to allow the parties to present joint recommendations to DEP regarding permit conditions,” the joint statement reads. “The settlement also addresses water quality in Biscayne Bay in a manner that will be good for Florida and the natural environment in and around FPL’s Turkey Point generating facility in Miami-Dade County.” That comes after all parties filed a motion asking the court to stay the case for six months. A bench trial had been set for May 20. A motion filed on Wednesday in the Southern District of Florida Federal Court indicates partied reached a “tentative resolution.” “Finalizing such a resolution, however, will require a period of time to allow the parties to interact with the appropriate government agencies,” the motion reads. Attorneys for all parties suggest six months time will allow the time and resources to conclude negotiations. That should “end all claims in this case.” The Turkey Point plant has been the subject of litigation for years. In 2016, the 3rd District Court of Appeal in Miami reversed a 2014 decision by Gov. Rick Scott and the Cabinet to approve construction of two FPL nuclear reactors near Homestead. The same year, Friends of the Everglades, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and the Tropical Audubon Society filed a complaint in federal court alleging FPL unlawfully discharged pollutants into Biscayne Bay and the Biscayne Aquifer. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission last year issued a key approval on the project. The federal agency at the time issued a statement stating FPL had addressed environmental concerns. “The commission found the staff’s review of FPL’s application adequate to make the necessary regulatory safety and environmental findings,” read an agency statement.

Indigenous experts advise on Declaration plan
Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta today welcomed the delegation from the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) to Aotearoa.
Last week Nanaia Mahuta announced that New Zealand will be taking a step forward on indigenous rights by leading a process to measure New Zealand’s progress towards the aspirations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
EMRIP members have been invited to Aotearoa to provide advice on the development of that plan.
“This is an exciting opportunity to hear from indigenous experts about how Aotearoa can be reflected in a Declaration plan, drawn from global models.
The EMRIP members have been invited to New Zealand by the Aotearoa Independent Monitoring Mechanism for the Declaration and the Human Rights Commission and with the agreement of the New Zealand Government.
“There are a range of policies and strategies already in place that are relevant to the Declaration, but there is no overall plan. EMRIP’s visit will help the Crown and Māori work together to create a plan to guide the implementation of the Declaration,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
During their visit, EMRIP members will meet with various organisations, experts and the Government. They will also hold two community hui in Auckland and Wellington.
“We are pleased to host these indigenous experts. Aotearoa is the third country to be visited by EMRIP, and this visit will show that we are genuinely committed to developing a national plan for the Declaration that meets New Zealand’s needs and aspirations.
“We wish them the best for their time in Aotearoa and look forward to meeting and engaging with them,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
Editorial Note: About the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP)
The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is one of three UN expert bodies that focus specifically on the rights of indigenous peoples
EMRIP is made up of seven independent experts appointed by the Human Rights Council to provide advice and expertise
Three of the seven experts will be visiting Aotearoa in the coming week:• Ms Laila Vars of Norway;• Ms Megan Davis of Australia;• Mr Edtami Mansavagan of the Philippines.

If a tragedy is watching disaster unfold and being powerless to stop it, then such is Brexit -- a conundrum wrapped in an enigma as the saying goes.
The UK parliament has voted on eight alternatives to the prime minister's deal after voting it down. These have all failed to get a majority. They have voted twice more on the PM's deal without success, and they have voted against a no-deal exit. - Advertisement -
Why should we worry? Not just for the numerous small personal tragedies to follow as working (even retired) lives are disrupted, but also because the UK, being the world's fifth largest economy, its pain will be felt elsewhere if only as a hiccup. In the late stages of an economic growth cycle, a hiccup might be all that is necessary for a downturn.
The prime minister's mind remains fixed as she proposes to seek a fourth vote on her deal. She has written to European Council President Donald Tusk requesting an extension to June 30. Perhaps she might tweak her deal a bit for she is also talking to Jeremy Corbyn the Labor opposition leader whose party would prefer to remain in a custom's union. The option could finesse the thorniest issue; namely, the north-south border in Ireland. - Advertisement -
It is well to recall that Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain, also London and the Southeast of England. Moreover, the Irish have become accustomed to border-free travel and are unlikely to accept any customs posts or passport checks.
The country was evenly divided in the 2016 referendum when 51.8 percent voted to leave versus 48.1 percent. Of the 46.5-million electorate, the turnout was 72.2 percent. Worth noting, the Scots voted 62 to 38 percent to remain, as did Northern Ireland. A close vote then and Mrs. May has behaved as if 'leave' won by a landslide. She has ignored the wishes of almost half the electorate choosing to remain in the EU, instead of probing further to find some kind of acceptable accommodation.
A story this week surfaced in another essay on the subject. It happens that a German general classified officers into four categories: clever and lazy, clever and industrious, stupid and lazy, and stupid and industrious. He said he promoted the clever and lazy to the top because he could count on them to make the right decisions and then not interfere with those carrying them out. The clever and industrious were made their deputies to ensure the work got done. The stupid and lazy were sent to the front. The stupid and industrious he considered a menace, who had to be removed from the army as soon as possible. - Advertisement -
It is not too difficult to discern Mrs. May's category. The trouble is no one in her party appears to want her job at present."
Something new to worry about -- Quasi-resonant Amplification,www.opednews.com,Robert Adler,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Something-new-to-worry-abo-by-Robert-Adler-2012_Climate_Climate-Change_Climate-Modeling-190407-596.html,"- Advertisement -
That, in turn, gets us to climate change and quasi-resonant amplification (QRA ).
One of the most dramatic impacts of global warming and climate change is that the far north and the far south are warming much faster than the mid-latitudes and the tropics, a phenomenon known as polar amplification . What this means is that the temperature difference between the poles and the tropics--which is what creates and drives the jet streams--is reduced. And like a river crossing a plain, this reduced gradient lets the jet stream meander farther north and south, and also tends to make the individual loops, known as Rossby waves , drift more slowly from west to east. - Advertisement -
At the extreme, the meanders in the jet stream can form a stable sequence of exaggerated loops around the planet that can stay in place for weeks or months. This is known as quasi-resonant amplification and its results can be devastating. Warm, sunny days can stretch into deadly heat waves, droughts and ideal conditions for wildfires; while cool, rainy weather can linger, drenching an unlucky region with unprecedented rains and floods.
Michael Mann , a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University, says that this phenomenon has now passed from the theoretical to the all-too-real and threatening. ""It played out in real time on our television screens and newspaper headlines in the form of an unprecedented hemisphere-wide pattern of extreme floods, droughts, heat waves and wildfires,"" he says.
Giving us some sense of the magnitude of this problem, the UN reports that extreme weather events displaced two million people people in 2018.
Unfortunately, Mann adds, climate models indicate that such QRA-caused weather extremes will grow more frequent and more severe unless we get a handle on global warming. We can hope that humanity (and the politicians and corporations who hold the reins) will get their act together, and soon. In the meantime, however, we can all expect more QRAs and the devastating weather extremes they bring coming to a region near us.

Strong Ever since Rep.Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D- NY) and her colleagues launched the Green New Deal resolution, the GOP has been betting they can scare the American electorate with new fears of evil government control. Their method is to shout some version of ""Freedom or Socialism? That is the question for 2020!"" But this GOP ""freedom"" ploy is deeply ironic. Their 2016 victory installed the most comprehensive federal control of American lives in recent memorya ""hostile takeover"" by interests dominated by the fossil fuel industry. Their intention was to destroy all federal rules against fossil fuel pollution and to block all efforts to create a clean energy economy. So far, at the federal level , they have succeeded completely. What's free about seeing to it that Americans are forced to breathe more toxic air and drink more polluted water? What's free about being exposed to worse and worse costly climate damage? This is a situation the Pentagon long ago defined as our most serious modern national security threat. The list of other American freedoms the ""new"" GOP, the #AltGOP, is targeting goes on and on. That's why I suggest we start talking about what #True American Freedom really means. As most Americans understand our freedom, it's about our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But the deeply corrupt #AltGOP now in control of the White House, Senate, and Supreme Court aims to violate these and our other basic constitutional rights. Their agenda includes attacking the right to free speech, both personal and in the media. They are challenging our freedom of religion, which should mean no attacks on other people's religion and no state religion. They are hoping to cut protections the Affordable Care Act provides against being refused life-saving care. As for freedom from fear, they consistently encourage unfair personal attacks on us by our highest officials and our neighbors on the basis of ethnic and gender identity. And they are doing everything they can to strip us of the right to vote too. Of course the GOP wasn't always like this. Many landmark environmental rules and other socially beneficial measures were actually approved in the past by GOP Congress members and presidents. The old-style GOP had at least a discernible moral core, however imperfect. In Robert Reich's 2018 book, The Common Good , he lays out a capsule history of how, since the 1980's , the GOP and corporate America fell into the #AynRandTrap of radical, shortsighted selfishness. They have been systematically destroying American moral fiber from the top and ruthlessly preying on everyone else. As Reich shows, this form of national self-destruction has cost us trust in government, in each other, and trust in all the institutions and leaders of our society. A country this sick cannot last long without decaying into a Hobbesian war of all against all. This is in fact what President Trump is calling for if he is not reelected . Rwanda in America a prospect far worse than any of the horrors of our own Civil War. Of course, the first stimulus for a return to sanity has already happened: the 2018 election. With any luck, the 2020 election will serve as even more of a corrective. Speaker Pelosi has spelled out what the 2020 Democratic platform must include: the same type of ""kitchen table"" issues that worked in 2018. But in the face of the #AltGOP's attempt to own the idea of American ""freedom,"" it seems to me that we also have to spell out exactly what #True American Freedom means. And we must call out the ways the #AltGOP is trying to destroy what they claim to own. Part of that step is calling for a national moral revival that transforms the selfish, corrupt behavior of our business and political leaders. In her best-selling book , Daring Greatly , well-known Social Work Research Professor Brene' Brown has laid out specific, doable steps for sincerely and openly ""bridging the gap"" between our highest ideals and our everyday behavior. Her experience is that the process she has developed works.
But we ourselves also have to do a bit more to be clear about what #True American Freedom means. It's about how we talk. We must scrupulously avoid the specific language traps the GOP has set for us. I have long been warning our own people about these traps, which will unquestionably be high profile in the 2020 election fight. For years I have watched in horror as supposedly intelligent members of the Democratic Party, liberals of all kinds, and every type of progressive mindlessly repeat such GOP-launched or GOP friendly frames as ""Obamacare,"" ""carbon tax,"" ""gun control,"" and the most senseless of all in my view, ""single payer."" Let's start with ""Obamacare."" This is a word specifically created by the GOP to kill the Affordable Care Act. Never call the ACA ""Obamacare. Since we're on the subject of healthcare, let's move on here to ""single payer ."" To the average American, that is a meaningless phrase that suggests you are talking about ""an unmarried payer."" Then there's Medicare for All. While it's a lot better than ""single payer,"" it is still, by itself, with no modifiers, very dangerous in the coming election. Lately there has been a rapid proliferation of different kinds of proposals, all labelled ""Medicare for All. If there's one thing Americans desperately fear today a recent Kaiser poll found , it's losing the health insurance or healthcare they already have. Confusing people about what you mean by that phrase is a recipe for sure defeat at the polls. The cure? Come up with a simple add on to the phrase, like ""Medicare for All+50,"" if your proposal is buy in after 50 years of age, or ""Medicare for All: Buy-in,"" and so on. Think Americans will sit still to pore over the details of how the proposal you call ""Medicare for All"" will be set up? Think again: if you can't say it clearly in one breath, your idea is doomed and will destroy your candidate too. Then there's ""carbon tax ."" Never trust anyone arguing for a ""carbon tax."" Call the ""carbon fee and citizen dividend idea"" a ""tax"" and it will be DOA. Yes, I know it's a drop in the climate-fix bucket, but it could be a first wedge in the denial door. And while you are upgrading your language about this issue, be careful to say ""climate damage ,"" and ""climate damage costs ."" People understand damage, and we all know money talks. Drop ""climate change."" It's a phrase that sounds way too mild these days. And now for one of my favorite peeves: calling for ""gun control"" when what we want is ""gun safety"" or ""gun sense."" Yes, I know folks are angry and want to control those guns. But ""gun control"" is the NRA's favorite frame , because they use it to scare even responsible gun owners into voting against the ""gun safety"" or ""gun sense"" they would otherwise favor, knowing as they do exactly what guns can do. With new levels of self-awareness about the words we use, we Democrats, liberals and progressives can finally stop shooting ourselves in the foot. Now for the good news. As I have often reminded my readers, America is a punch-back fighter. The sight of American high school students rallying to push our government to act on rules for gun safety and climate action is a case in point. Though they don't get civics courses in school anymore, they know perfectly well what their rights as Americans are. Their courage and patriotism in the cause of #True American Freedom is another big step in the massive turnaround we need. Let's do all we can to restore #True American Freedom here in the ""land of the free!"" That starts by calling it by its right name."
Virginia beats Auburn thanks to composure and controversy.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/virginia-beats-auburn-thanks-to-kyle-guy.html,"Reds-Pirates Kerfuffle Results in Five Ejections, One Inspiring Image If you can, listen closely to the below highlight, which is of the critical play from Saturday’s Final Four game between Virginia and Auburn. After Virginia’s Kyle Guy misses the would-be game-winner from behind the arc, you can hear a surge of cheers. Those are Auburn fans, unaware that the referee had whistled Tigers guard Samir Doughty for jumping into Guy’s leg. KYLE GUY WAS FOULED. — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) April 7, 2019 The infraction was borderline accidental, but it was indeed a foul. It would take a few seconds for the message to reach all the Auburn supporters in Minneapolis’ cavernous U.S. Bank Stadium, and the delay was particularly unfortunate for at least one fan. One Auburn student poured beer all over his head in the celebration, not realizing a foul had been called. Tough scene for that guy — Alex Roux (@arouxBTN) April 7, 2019 Down 2 points, Virginia couldn’t have picked a better person to step to the line than Guy. The junior guard has a career free throw average of 80 percent, and he cooly drained all three attempts to give his team the 63-62 lead. Well, he only looked cool. Afterwards, Guy admitted that he was “terrified.” “I could lie to you and say I knew I was going to hit them, but I was terrified.”Kyle Guy explains to @tracywolfson what was running through his head during those three free throws. pic.twitter.com/qoMtFz1M9S — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) April 7, 2019 The game had all the makings of a monumental collapse for Virginia before Guy’s intervention. Auburn went on a blistering 10-0 run in the closing minutes to take a 59-57 lead, and the Tigers stretched their advantage to 4 after a pair of made free throws. In a bit of foreshadowing, Guy hit a difficult 3-pointer from the corner with 9 seconds remaining to bring the game within striking distance. HOOS CUT IT TO 1 WITH 6.5 SECS LEFT! 😳 @UVAMensHoops | #FinalFour pic.twitter.com/2UWi7sqD6Z — NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) April 7, 2019 Doughty committed his fateful foul on Guy in the opposite corner, but replays indicate that Virginia shouldn’t have been granted that last opportunity. Forward Ty Jerome had lost the ball off his leg while bringing it up the court, and the referees failed to call him for a double-dribble when he continued the possession. “As Ty Jerome brings the ball up the court, he accidentally bumps the ball off his back foot … he then re-possesses this ball with both hands. That ends his dribble.” @GeneSteratore explains a missed double-dribble violation on Ty Jerome near the end of the game. pic.twitter.com/763pV0sXyA — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) April 7, 2019 There would only be one bad non-call in the game’s final seconds, and Virginia benefited from the officials’ 50-percent success rate in that regard to sneak into Monday’s national championship game. It was an especially cruel way for Auburn to lose, and there’s at least one beer-soaked Tigers fan who can attest to this heartbreak."

More than 50 refugees and employees told NBC News there is a system of rampant corruption within the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. Refugees in Kenya, Uganda, Yemen, Ethiopia and Libya described paying up to $3,000 per person in bribes to UNHCR officials in order to resettle in another country. Others said they were forced to bribe officials for everything from food rations to contacting the police. Three staff members said they were fired after speaking up about the exploitation, while suspected perpetrators were allowed to resign or move to another location rather than being investigated.

The Latest: Beto O’Rourke says he’s focused on White House,www.nationalnewswatch.com,AP,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/the-latest-warren-says-dems-need-more-than-anti-trump-cry/,"The Latest: Beto O’Rourke says he’s focused on White House By AP — Apr 6 2019
The Latest on the 2020 presidential race (all times EDT):
8 p.m.
Beto O'Rourke says he hasn't thought about running for Senate in Texas if his White House bid is unsuccessful, and wants to focus fully on winning the Democratic presidential nomination.
O'Rourke tells The Associated Press while campaigning in Des Moines: ""The only way I can run is by focusing forward, on the task at hand, and for me right now it's meeting everybody that I can in Iowa and in the other states who will decide who the Democratic nominee will be.""
O'Rourke says thinking about an alternative position would be a distraction.
The former Texas congressman came within about three points of defeating Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last November. Some Texas Democrats had hoped he would run against Republican Sen. John Cronyn, who's up for re-election in 2020.
___
7:15 p.m.
Sen. Michael Bennet is trying to keep his recent prostate cancer diagnosis out of mind as he mulls a run for president while visiting New Hampshire.
The Colorado Democrat spoke to a group of roughly 30 people at a coffee shop in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday afternoon. The Senator focused on health care and improving the Affordable Care Act at the event, while also criticizing the Republican Freedom Caucus as ""tyrants.""
Speaking after the event, the 54-year-old said he'll have surgery at the beginning of the Senate recess and hopes to be on the move again a few weeks after.
""I don't think there's any point in dwelling on it,"" he said. ""If it turns out to be worse than I think, I'll deal with it then.""
___
7 p.m.
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is wrapping up three days of campaigning aimed at reaching out to black voters, who are key to a Democratic presidential effort in southern states.
Hickenlooper said Saturday in Charleston, South Carolina, that he's making an effort to ""meet people where they are"" in getting to know the diverse electorate in states outside his own.
Hickenlooper this week addressed the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, using his speech to the group in New York to outline his record on policing. Hickenlooper suggested that the nation ""shutter some prisons altogether."" He then visited a lynching memorial in Montgomery, Alabama.
On Saturday, Hickenlooper met with two survivors of a racist attack on a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina.
South Carolina is the first state on the primary calendar with a largely black electorate.
___
3:45 p.m.
Elizabeth Warren says the Democrats running for president will have to do more than campaign on an anti-Donald Trump message if they want to take back the White House in 2020.
The Massachusetts senator says they'll have to explain their own vision for the future of the country.
Warren is visiting the early caucus state of Nevada. She tells about 500 people at a rally in a high school gymnasium in Reno that she has an ambitious agenda that would force billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes, strengthen labour unions and protect everyone's right to vote.
She says it's important to build a broad grassroots campaign in Nevada and other places now to have a chance to win next year.
Warren says that ""if our message is 'not Trump,' it's not going to work.""
___
3:45 p.m.
Beto O'Rourke may be competing against Pete Buttigieg (BOO'-tuh-juhj) for the Democratic presidential nomination, but the former Texas congressman is still a fan of the South Bend, Indiana mayor.
O'Rourke says ""I like him a lot"" when he was asked about the fact that the two politicians have a similar message and profile, and may be competing for similar voters.
O'Rourke, who's making a series of stops in Iowa, says he likes the way Buttigieg is approaching voters and ""the seriousness with which he answers questions, the thought that he's put into it. I think he's terrific.""
O'Rourke made the comments while leaving a house party in the Des Moines area.

8 a.m.
It's Bernie versus Beto in Iowa.
The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are holding dueling events Saturday just days after Bernie Sanders won the campaign cash derby for the first quarter of the year.
The Vermont senator raised more than $18 million in 41 days, while Beto O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, reported $9.4 million in 18 days.
Iowa hosts the nation's first nominating caucuses.
Other declared or prospective candidates are in early-voting New Hampshire and South Carolina.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg (BOO'-tuh-juhj) of South Bend, Indiana, along with Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (KEER'-sten JIHL'-uh-brand) of New York and Michael Bennet of Colorado are visiting New Hampshire.
John Hickenlooper, a former Colorado governor, is meeting with survivors of the 2015 church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina.

"Sanders, O’Rourke face off in Iowa; other hopefuls in NH, NV",www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Laurie Kellman, The Associated Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/sanders-orourke-face-off-in-iowa-other-hopefuls-in-nh-sc/,"By Laurie Kellman, The Associated Press — Apr 6 2019
BURLINGTON, Iowa — They became notable presidential candidates in Iowa after narrow losses that nonetheless put them on the national political stage. They're competing for some of the same young voters. And this weekend, they've been driving around this first-in-the-nation caucus state reintroducing themselves to voters as others in the 2020 Democratic field dispersed to New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.
It's been Bernie versus Beto all weekend in Iowa, with both hopefuls reintroducing themselves as the man with a plan to deny President Donald Trump a second term. Sanders swept back into the state as the early front runner after raising $18 million in 41 days during the first quarter of the year, the most of any candidate. O'Rourke raised $9.4 million in 18 days.
In dueling rallies, town halls and house parties, they spoke most of improving health care and affording college tuition.
Other hopefuls fanned out to political hot spots elsewhere, with much the same mission: Gauging early strength in a crowded field and raising enough money to secure a coveted spot in the presidential debates that begin in June.
Republican leaders have relished the jockeying among Democrats.
""I'd be happy with any of 'em, to be honest,"" the president said of the Democratic derby.
Here's a roundup of the crowded Democratic campaign.
___
Iowa Democrats know Sanders, the Vermont senator who lost the state — and the Democratic presidential nomination — to Hillary Clinton in 2016. At two town halls in counties he won during that caucus fight, Sanders' questioners asked most about making health care more affordable.
Over and over, people told Sanders grim stories about medical bills putting them deeply in debt. He empathized, at one point putting an arm around a young woman who had begun weeping as she spoke. Sanders told his audience that he supports ""Medicare for All"" and a single-payer health care system. But he didn't get into specifics.
Shannon Abel, a 28-year-old at a non-profit organization in Muscatine, Iowa, said she still liked what she heard from Sanders. Then again, she had only begun seriously paying attention to politics after nearly a year of being ill and seeing the medical bills — with an $80 co-pay — put her family deeply in debt.
Of Sanders, Abel said, ""He knows what it's like to not have money.""
___
O'Rourke is calling for a range of educational changes to alleviate college debt, including providing free community college and allowing students to potentially eliminate or refinance their debt through public service.
""The cost of higher education, and not just tuition . is out of reach for so many of our fellow Americans,"" O'Rourke told a crowd gathered for a campaign house party in Polk City, Iowa. He said the tens of thousands in debt that students carry when they graduate ""is a weight that literally sinks them into the ground.""
To solve the problem, he offered a number of proposals to help students ""stop digging the hole"" and stop taking on debt when they go for a college degree: Making community college free, allowing students to earn an associate degree while they're in high school so they're ""ready to earn a living wage on day one,"" increase access to union apprenticeships. For those already saddled with student loan debt, O'Rourke said he'd like to ""re-up the public service student debt forgiveness program"" — a federal program that currently accepts only a fraction of applicants and is eliminated altogether in President Donald Trump's latest budget proposal.
If students are willing to work in in-demand jobs at places like the Department of Veterans Affairs, or ""willing to teach school or be in a support role in a community that needs your talent and human capital, I want to wipe clean your student loan debt. At a minimum I want to refinance what you have at a much lower rate.""
___
Sanders says he wants to make college free and pay for it by getting rid of tax havens and lowering taxes for the richest Americans.
That's been received with some skepticism among budget and deficit hawks. But to Trevor Meyers, 19, it sounds right.
Meyers, like Sanders, is a democratic socialist. The Muscatine County resident attends a nearby college and lives at home with his family, which owns a farm. A sibling, he said, is five figures in debt from college.
""How is anybody in our society going to get started in life?"" he wondered.
He liked Sanders, but said he's going to check out one of O'Rourke's events too.
___
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is discussing gun control and death penalty issues with survivors of a massacre that claimed nine Bible study participants at a historic black church in South Carolina.
Hickenlooper sat down on Saturday with Anthony Thompson and Polly Sheppard during a visit to Mother Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston.
Thompson's wife was slain in the June 2015 shooting. Sheppard, who survived the ordeal but lost her son and aunt, has said the shooter told her he was sparing her life so she could tell others what happened. He is now on federal death row.
The church has become a place of pilgrimage for some 2020 presidential candidates as they campaign in the state, home of the first primary in the South.
Hickenlooper is known as a staunch advocate for gun control legislation. Following the fatal 2012 shootings in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theatre , the then-governor called for and signed bills requiring universal background checks and limiting magazine capacity to 15 rounds.
Both Thompson and Sheppard told Hickenlooper they want those kinds of reforms in South Carolina and elsewhere.
___
Sen. Michael Bennet told reporters in Nashua, New Hampshire, that he hopes to be on the move again a few weeks after surgery for prostate cancer.
""I don't think there's any point in dwelling on it,"" said the Colorado Democrat. ""If it turns out to be worse than I think, I'll deal with it then.""
The cancer diagnosis has ""slowed us down a little bit,"" Bennet said when asked about how it would impact him getting on the debate stage for the Democratic presidential debates, with well over a dozen candidates now running.
""It's obviously slowed down our ability to raise money and at some point it could have an effect on whether we get to the debate stage or not, but I think we have a good chance to get there,"" he said.
And with how he's feeling right now, Bennet said he's likely to run.
""I mean, I didn't pick this particular set of circumstances,"" he said. ""This is not how I would have rolled it out.""
___
Democrats running for president will have to do more than campaign on an anti-Trump message if they want to take back the White House in 2020, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday.
""If your message is 'not-Trump,' it's not going to work,"" the Democratic presidential hopeful told about 500 supporters who packed a high school gymnasium in Reno, Nevada. ""Our job is to talk about our vision.""
Warren, D-Mass., blasted Trump's economic and environmental policies and touted her plan to invest $500 billion over the next 10 years to build, preserve and rehabilitate affordable housing for low-income families. She said she would pay for it by returning the estate tax thresholds to where they were during President George W. Bush's administration and imposing a new ""wealth"" tax on the nation's 17,000 wealthiest families.
""Washington is working for the ultra-super-duper rich, and until we change that we are going to stay on this path. This is our moment,"" she told the cheering crowd.
Warren was making her second campaign stop this year in the early caucus state, which on Feb. 22 follows only New Hampshire and Iowa in the nominating process. She spoke for about 30 minutes, took questions from the audience and posed for photographs for another half hour. More than half the crowd lined up to take selfies with her.
____
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg headed to New Hampshire after his campaign announced he'd raised more than $7 million this year.
Hundreds of voters interested in the mayor attended his two events in the state; some were turned away because the venues were at capacity.
The mayor gave short speeches at both his Friday and Saturday events and did not take town hall style questions from the two crowds.
Speaking at Gibson's Bookstore in Concord on Saturday morning, the 37-year-old Buttigieg said he understands people's difficulty in avoiding the spectacle of politics these days.
""As hard as it is to take our eye off what we see on cable, because grotesque things have the quality of drawing your eye, and we can't take our eye off that show, but the show's not what matters,"" he said. ""What matters is our everyday life.""
He later told voters, ""We've got to change the channel, and that's what we're about.""

Unions hold rally at Ontario legislature to protest education cuts,www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Adam Burns, The Canadian Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/unions-hold-rally-at-ontario-legislature-to-protest-education-cuts/,"By Adam Burns, The Canadian Press — Apr 6 2019
TORONTO — Throngs of demonstrators covered the lawn in front of the Ontario legislature Saturday afternoon to protest the Progressive Conservative government's changes to the province's education system.
Many in the crowd carried signs declaring ""Cuts hurt kids"" or ""Standing together for students,"" while others banged on drums or chanted slogans denouncing the government's measures.
The Tories under Premier Doug Ford have come under fire for recent changes including increasing class sizes, making students take more online courses and overhauling the province's autism program.
Sam Hammond, the head of the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario, opened his speech with a call-and-response session with the boisterous crowd.
""Work with me here: If you're here to stand up for and fight for children with autism and their parents.... If you're here to protect publicly funded education.... Say 'I am!'"" Hammond shouted to raucous cheers.
Hammond's union is one of five labour groups, representing education workers across Ontario, that organized Saturday's rally.
The ETFO said earlier in a statement that thousands of people were expected to attend and more than 170 buses were bringing teachers to the rally from as far away as Sudbury.
The event followed mass student walkouts that took place across Ontario on Thursday, which Education Minister Lisa Thompson characterized as ""political stunts"" encouraged by unions.
Hammond forcefully denied that claim on Saturday, saying the student activism on display showed the province's future is in good hands.
""Don't forget, Doug Ford: those students are going to be voting in the next provincial election. And we're voting with them!"" he said.
In a statement Friday, Thompson said the government would not be distracted by what she called ""union tactics"" such as protests and rallies.
""The fact is that Ontario’s teacher unions have been handed control of the education system for the past 15 years,"" Thompson said.
""Despite what unions say, their priority has not been student success and as a result our province's math scores are dropping and our students find themselves falling further and further behind.""

One year later: Memorial service for those killed in Humboldt Broncos crash,www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Stephanie Taylor, The Canadian Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/one-year-later-memorial-service-for-those-killed-in-humboldt-broncos-crash/,"By Stephanie Taylor, The Canadian Press — Apr 6 2019
HUMBOLDT, Sask. — After prayers and songs filled the Saskatchewan hockey arena, Carol Brons spoke to the crowd as a grieving mother.
Her daughter was one of 16 people who died after the Humboldt Broncos junior hockey bus collided with a semi truck at a rural intersection. Thirteen others were injured.
Brons spoke Saturday at a memorial marking the one-year anniversary of the collision and described the day as a milestone.
""Not a joyful milestone but one of perseverance, faith and courage,"" she said, standing beside Celeste Leray-Leicht, whose son was also killed.
""We are not preachers. We are moms,"" Brons said. ""And like many moms before us, we have lost a child.""
The crash brought the nation and the world together in grief, Brons added, and got people talking about the importance of mental health and changes in transportation.
""Good must continue to come from this.""
The Broncos were on their way to a playoff game when a semi driven by a novice trucker barreled through a stop sign and into the path of the team's bus.
Jaskirat Singh Sidhu of Calgary was sentenced last month to eight years for dangerous driving causing death and bodily injury.
The three prairie provinces have since made training mandatory for commercial truck drivers and an entry-level national training standard is to be in place next year. The federal government is also to make seatbelts mandatory on new medium and large highway buses in 2020.
The memorial service at the Humboldt rink started off with a moment of silence at 4:50 p.m., the exact time of the collision. Rows of yellow banners were suspended above the main entrance with the names of all 29 people who were on the bus that day.
Dayna Brons from Lake Lenore, Sask. was the team's 24-year-old athletic therapist.
Jacob Leicht was a 19-year-old hometown boy and a forward on the team.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke in a video message at the service and said people cannot forget pictures of the horrific wreckage of the crash.
""But what will stay in our hearts forever are images of compassion and strength: players clasping hands, united, in the hospital ward; young men learning to stand, walk and take to the ice again; hockey sticks leaned up against thousands of Canadian front doors,"" Trudeau said.
Many people also stopped Saturday at the crossing of Highways 35 and 335 near Tisdale, Sask., where the crash occurred.
""These boys have had their year and they are in heaven or skating with Jesus, I guess,"" said Karen Rafael, a first responder who helped the day of the collision, as she wiped falling snow off pictures and mementoes left among wooden crosses.
Jeremy Collyer of Brandon, Man., arrived with a group of hockey parents before going to watch their children play a championship game in Tisdale. It was important they visit the site, he said.
""We all have kids in hockey,"" he said. ""You always hear you're one big family. And it's true.""
Kaleb Dahlgren of Saskatoon, who was injured in the crash, didn't attend the Humboldt service but wrote a letter to his dead teammates that was read out loud.
He asked them whether they were in heaven celebrating the end-of-season party they didn't get to have or playing pond hockey.
""It's been a year since I last saw your beautiful faces and they still cross my mind daily,"" Dahlgren wrote.
""It's the worst knowing there's no way to bring you back.""
Brons and Leray-Leicht then asked those in the arena to stand up if they were first responders at the crash site or hospital staff who aided the injured or people who made food or prayed or shared hope in the weeks after the crash.
By the end of their speech, nearly everyone was on their feet, many with tears.
""We wish we could hug each one of you,"" Brons said. ""Thank you for your love.""

"‘This is a wake-up call:’ swift action needed on rising seas, experts say",www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Michael Tutton, The Canadian Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/a-call-to-arms-swift-action-needed-on-rising-seas-experts-say/,"By Michael Tutton, The Canadian Press — Apr 6 2019
HALIFAX — Worrying figures released this week on the rising seas in Atlantic Canada should prompt governments and citizens to move more swiftly to protect coastal buildings and vital transport links, say flooding experts.
Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, said in an interview Friday that projections of 75 centimetres to one metre of relative sea level rise for the East Coast by the end of the century are ""a wake up call and a call to arms.""
He was reacting to Chapter 7 of Canada's Changing Climate Report, which includes a survey of federal science on sea level rise under various emissions scenarios developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada.
Feltmate points to the study's predictions for quadrupling of flooding along the Halifax waterfront as sea levels rise 20 centimetres over current levels by mid century.
Blair Greenan, a federal oceanographer who oversaw the oceans chapter of the report, said in an interview that without any adaptation measures, flooding during Halifax storms will be noticeable in just a decade as relative sea level goes up about 10 centimetres.
""It will probably have doubled,"" he said during an interview. ""It is an important point that southern Atlantic Canada is the highest risk area in Canada for sea level rise.""
The Atlantic region is facing a dual effect of rising seas and falling coastlines, says the study.
It notes that while in much of the country the coast is rebounding from glaciation — helping counter sea level rise — the eastern coasts are continuing to sink.
Feltmate said while the report documents less drastic outcomes in a scenario of lower emissions, he believes the current ""high emissions scenario"" — where current amounts of fossil fuels continue to be burned — is much likelier.
""That (high emission scenario) is what is going to happen,"" he said, adding that he has attended the most recent G20 meetings and has heard no firm commitments from nations that they will even meet goals set in the Paris Accord.
The federal study also highlights the vulnerability of the Chignecto Isthmus — a low-lying, 20-kilometre band of land which joins Nova Scotia to New Brunswick, said Feltmate.
The Canadian Press recently reported on the risk of much of the East Coast being cut off if the key trade corridor is submerged due to a strong tidal surge overtopping dikes that were last upgraded over 50 years ago.
An engineering assessment seeking proposals for solutions to the possible damage to the trade corridor is expected to begin this spring and last 12 to 18 months, provincial officials have said.
After options are presented, the governments must agree on the way forward and how much they will spend. All of the options presented in a 2016 required at least five years to complete.
The pace needs to pick up, said Feltmate.
""This report should put action on adaptation on steroids for a response to this. We have to act quicker than we currently are.""
Nancy Anningson, the coastal adaptation co-ordinator of the Ecology Action Centre, says part of the response to sea level rise is stricter building rules and the preservation of wetlands.
She said Nova Scotia's recently introduced Coastal Protection Act is a major step in the right direction, though it may take over a year to have the legislation proclaimed.
However, the environmental group is encouraging Nova Scotia's Liberal government to rapidly explore some form of rebate program — similar to the energy efficiency programs offered to homeowners — to encourage people to make changes that protect structures or move them away from the coast.
""This is scientific reality, now what are we going to do to prepare?"" said Anningson.
One key response would be for the province to begin providing detailed assessments of how sea level rise will impact coastal residents, she added.
Her organization has set up a website titled www.sealevelrise.ca to give building owners a place to gather basic information.
Jason Thistlethwaite, a professor of environment and business at the University of Waterloo, says all Canadian jurisdictions also need to rapidly begin providing easily accessible flood risk maps for citizens.
In other G8 countries maps are used to raise public awareness and help create the political will for investment in preparing for sea level rise, he said.
A recent study by his research group indicated many Canadians lack access to clear maps that tell them the risks to their property and what actions to take to prevent flooding, he said.
""This report demonstrates the urgency of this issue ... This is reminding us that climate change will have disproportionate impact on northern countries and we're one of them,"" said Thistlethwaite in an interview Saturday.
One of the report's key overall findings is that Canada is warming up twice as fast as the rest of the world and it's ""effectively irreversible.""

G-7 ministers reveal ‘clear differences’ on Middle East as France meeting wraps,www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Thomas Adamson, The Associated Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/06/g-7-ministers-reveal-clear-differences-on-middle-east-as-france-meeting-wraps/,"By Thomas Adamson, The Associated Press — Apr 6 2019
DINARD, France — Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven nations revealed stark divergences in views on the Middle East on Saturday as they wrapped up a meeting in France that opened with the goal of finding common ground on contentious global challenges but was shaken by the absence of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The diplomats in attendance projected a united front while walking side-by-side along a seaside promenade before they released the agreement from their two-day meeting in Dinard. The agreement included mildly worded joint commitments on issues such as fighting cybercrime, giving women bigger peacemaking roles, and engaging with countries in Africa's Sahel region to combat migrant trafficking.
But what was omitted from the G-7's positions said as much as what was included. The differences could set the stage for tensions at an August summit of the leaders of the G-7 advanced economies — the United States, France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the U.K.
A European Union official expressed ""regret"" the document had what she considered to be several glaring omissions that conflicted with non-negotiable positions of the EU. They included ""no reference to a two-state solution"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and ""no mention"" of the U.N. Security Council resolution in favour of the Iran nuclear deal, she said.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not allowed to speak to the news media, said the language used to described the G-7's deep concern over Iran's ""continuing support for terrorist organizations and armed militias"" was not language EU members tend to use. Four of the G-7 nations are in the European Union.
The foreign ministers' joint statement itself acknowledged ""clear differences"" on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after ""an exchange of views.""
The agreement included an initiative to help countries share best practices on encouraging responsible online behaviour . Also, the group pledged to encourage the creation of funds to help survivors of sexual violence in danger spots, and to encourage Sahel countries to take steps to end trafficking. It also reaffirmed the G-7's ""commitment to a rules-based international order.""
Discord is becoming a theme for the group.
Last June, U.S. President Donald Trump roiled the G-7 meeting in Charlevoix, Que., by first agreeing to a group statement on trade, then withdrawing support from it and sending a string of negative tweets about the summit and its host, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
On Saturday in Dinard, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland tweeted a photo of herself and her counterparts from Germany, France and Japan.
""Many of today's greatest challenges are global and they can only be solved when we work together. That is why Canada stands united with its German, French, and Japanese friends,"" Freeland wrote, adding the hashtag #AllianceofMultilaterists.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was also missing from the final group photo after attending Friday's session. This, combined with Pompeo's absence, raised questions about the G-7's relevance.
U.S. officials acknowledged points of discord at the talks hosted by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drain.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan, who went in Pompeo's stead, said Washington would use the G-7 forum to galvanize support for Venezuela's opposition leader, Juan Guaido, whose claim to the presidency is backed by the U.S. and about 50 other countries.
But the meeting failed to change the position of Italy, the sole G-7 member state not to back Guaido.
""We spoke about it. The Italian position on Venezuela is pretty clear,"" said Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero. ""It is an extremely difficult situation, especially in light of the humanitarian emergency that weighs the most in our hearts.""
Guaido has set out to topple the socialist administration of President Nicolas Maduro amid deepening unrest in the country, which has been plagued by nearly a month of power outages.
Italy also has irked EU and U.S. allies by becoming the first G-7 member to sign up to a Chinese plan to build a Silk Road-style global trade network, the Belt and Road Initiative.
Any reference to the contentious trillion-dollar plan was missing in Saturday's texts.

"“Assange Is Not A Journalist!” Yes He Is, Idiot. – The Greanville Post",www.greanvillepost.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.greanvillepost.com/2019/04/06/assange-is-not-a-journalist-yes-he-is-idiot/,"“Assange Is Not A Journalist!” Yes He Is, Idiot. Print this post. HELP ENLIGHTEN YOUR FELLOWS. BE SURE TO PASS THIS ON. SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON IT.
A s we discussed yesterday , whenever Assange is in the news and people are defending him you always see a bunch of hyper-emotional empire loyalists running around online trying to manage the narrative about him. One of the most common talking points which comes up is that Assange is “not a journalist”.
The reason this talking point comes up, of course, is because the WikiLeaks founder is besieged by powerful forces who are attempting to imprison him for publishing inconvenient facts about them, and his defenders often voice their concerns about what this means for the future of press freedoms. The completely baseless claim that Assange is “not a journalist” is used in an attempt to defuse the argument that his prosecution by the US government could lead to the same fate for any news media outlet which publishes leaks on the US government anywhere in the world. If he’s not a journalist, then his prosecution sets no precedent for real journalists.
This argument, if you can call it that, is fallacious for a number of reasons. For starters, as The Intercept ‘s Glenn Greenwald explained last year , there’s not any legal distinction in the US Constitution between news media outlets like the New York Times and an outlet which solely focuses on publishing leaks. If you set the precedent with any publisher, you’re necessarily setting it for all of them. Greenwald writes the following:
To begin with, the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment isn’t confined to “legitimate news outlets” – whatever that might mean. The First Amendment isn’t available only to a certain class of people licensed as “journalists.” It protects not a privileged group of people called “professional journalists” but rather an activity : namely, using the press (which at the time of the First Amendment’s enactment meant the literal printing press) to inform the public about what the government was doing. Everyone is entitled to that constitutional protection equally: there is no cogent way to justify why the Guardian, ex-DOJ-officials-turned-bloggers, or Marcy Wheeler are free to publish classified information but Julian Assange and WikiLeaks are not.
Secondly, anyone with a functioning brain can see that Julian Assange is indeed a journalist. Publishing facts so that the citizenry can inform themselves about what’s going on in their world and what’s happening with their government is the thing that journalism is. Duh. The need for an informed citizenry is the entire reason why press freedoms are protected so explicitly under the US Constitution, and publishing facts about the most powerful institutions on earth indisputably does create a more informed citizenry.
You can look at any conventional dictionary definition of the word and come to the same conclusion. Merriam-Webster offers “ the public press” and “the collection and editing of news for presentation through the media” . The Oxford English Dictionary offers “The activity or profession of writing for newspapers, magazines, or news websites or preparing news to be broadcast.” Your Dictionary offers ” the work of finding, creating, editing and publishing news, or material written and presented for a newspaper, magazine or broadcast news source.” These are activities that WikiLeaks is undeniably involved in; they collect and publish newsworthy information to be circulated by themselves and other news sources. The fact that they do their part differently (and better) than other outlets doesn’t change that.
Which explains why the WikiLeaks team has racked up numerous awards for journalism over the years, including the Walkley Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism (2011), the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism (2011), the International Piero Passetti Journalism Prize of the National Union of Italian Journalists (2011), the Jose Couso Press Freedom Award (2011), the Brazillian Press Association Human Rights Award (2013), and the Kazakstan Union of Journalists Top Prize (2014).
The claim that Assange is “not a journalist” is both an irrelevant red herring and a self-evident falsehood. It is made not by people with an interest in maintaining a small and specific linguistic understanding of what the word journalism means, but by people who want to see Julian Assange imprisoned by the same government which tortured Chelsea Manning because he made them feel emotionally upset. It’s a fact-free argument made entirely in bad faith for inexcusable motives: the desire to see a journalist imprisoned for telling the truth.
When someone says “Assange isn’t a journalist”, they aren’t telling you what Assange is. They’re showing you what they are.

Brunei should be “chucked out” of the Commonwealth if it does not revoke its anti-LGBT laws, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has said.
Dozens of protesters chanted “shame on you” outside the Brunei-owned Dorchester hotel in London on Saturday. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had expressed “deep UK opposition” to the new laws to Brunei’s government.
But the Foreign Office said “threatening to kick countries out of the Commonwealth” was not the “best way” to encourage Brunei to uphold its human rights obligations.
Reuters reports :
On Saturday, protesters gathered outside the Dorchester carrying banners, with some breaking through a barrier to reach the entrance where they held rainbow flags and chanted slogans such as “shame on you” and “gay rights, human rights”, television footage showed.
Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said death by stoning “has no place in the 21st century”. “Stoning to death is a particularly unique, cruel, brutal punishment designed to prolong the agony of the person being killed,” he told Reuters.
The Guardian reports :
High-profile events and awards shows have been cancelled at the Dorchester in London in protest at the decision of Brunei, the hotel’s ultimate owner, to make gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death.
The English National Ballet, Make-A-Wish Foundation and Tempus Magazine said they would be reviewing their associations with the Dorchester. Major companies, such as Deutsche Bank, are banning their staff from staying in Brunei-owned hotels.
USA Today reports :
Transport for London, the London metropolitan area’s transportation service, is ending its Brunei tourism advertising campaign. The group told USA TODAY in a statement: “The advertisement was considered compliant with our advertising policy when it was submitted and accepted. However, given recent information that has come to light, it is clear that this is an issue of great public sensitivity and controversy so the advert will be removed from our network.” Share"

Drivers who held pink plastic permits under European Union standards were told to get ready to apply for international licenses in case Britain left without a deal.

More from the Hill:
Protestors from a progressive Jewish activist group interrupted President Trump’s speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC).
“Jews are here to say occupation is a plague. Jews are here to say white nationalism is a plague,” the protesters said, according to a statement from the progressive Jewish organization IfNotNow.
Their protests were quickly drowned out by RJC participants who booed them and then chanted “USA” and “Four more years.”
“He’s going back home to mommy, and he will be reprimanded,” Trump said, apparently referring to one of the protesters.
According to its website, IfNotNow said the 10 protesters were members of the group, which works to end the Jewish community’s “support for the occupation.”

He says he’s not a betting man, but Mayor Bill de Blasio’s taking a major gamble on a potential presidential run while New Yorkers increasingly say he’s got no chance at the job.
A recent Quinnipiac poll that found a staggering 76 percent of New York City voters don’t want de Blasio to run for president in 2020.
An earlier Quinnipiac poll, released in March, singled him out as the only possible 2020 Democratic contender to garner a negative net favorability rating among New York Democrats.
But hey, this is the Democratic primary – they don’t let reality horn in on their economic, social, or foreign policies, why would they let reality govern their race?!
Intent on trying his luck, de Blasio traveled to Las Vegas on Saturday. Asked about the naysaying outside a union health center, de Blasio showed his signature stubbornness.
“I think in the end this whole concept of polls — it’s April 2019 — the polls in April 2019 bear no resemblance to what you’re going to see in the second half of 2020. It’s just an obvious fact,” the mayor said.

In response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s promise that if re-elected he will “extend sovereignty” to Israeli settlements in the West Bank and prevent a two-state solution, J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami released the following statement:
“Prime Minister Netanyahu’s outrageous promise confirms what was already clear: The Israeli right is determined to annex the West Bank and permanently prevent the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. If carried out, even a partial annexation would be a disastrous blow to Israel’s security and democracy — and a severe violation of international law. Israel cannot rule permanently over millions of Palestinians while denying them equal civil and political rights.
While the Trump administration has actively enabled and empowered Netanyahu and the settlement movement, all responsible American elected officials and presidential candidates must make clear that Netanyahu’s statement is dangerous and unacceptable — and that any West Bank annexations would bring about a major crisis in the US-Israel relationship.
All American Jewish organizations that claim to support a two-state solution must come together to unequivocally condemn the direction in which Netanyahu and his political allies are leading the state of Israel. At such a pivotal time, any silence or equivocation will be seen as condoning the prime minister’s vision of permanent occupation, unending conflict and a one-state nightmare.” Recent Statements "

Turkey’s F-35s,www.jpost.com,JPOST EDITORIAL,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Turkeys-F-35s-585961,"F-35 Adir Jets. (photo credit: COURTESY IAF)
Turkey’s radical spin under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is hardly a new story. Israel has been facing a militant and aggressive Turkey ever since the IDF ended Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip in 2009.Just a few weeks ago, Turkey denounced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “blatant racism” after he called Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people. In response, Netanyahu said Erdogan was a “dictator” and a “joke”. Thankfully last week, the United States woke up to what is happening in Turkey and decided to take action. On Monday, the Pentagon announced that it was halting the scheduled delivery of equipment related to the stealth F-35 fighter jets to Turkey, marking the first concrete US step to block delivery of the aircraft to its NATO ally.The move came in response to Turkey’s announcement that it was going to purchase an advanced Russian surface-to-air missile system known as the S-400. “Pending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey’s F-35 operational capability have been suspended,” Air Force Lt. Col. Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.In addition, four US senators two weeks ago introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the US government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.The move has important strategic consequences for the State of Israel. The Israeli Air Force currently has a fleet of 14 F-35 jets, known in Israel by the name Adir, and is expected to receive 50 planes to make two full squadrons by 2024.Built by Lockheed Martin, the jets have an extremely low radar signature allowing them to operate undetected deep inside enemy territory, as well as to evade advanced missile defense systems like the S-300 and S-400.For some time now, Israel has been looking at Turkey and wondering whether it is on its way to becoming another version of Iran. Until the Islamic revolution in 1979, Israel and Iran were the closest of allies. The countries jointly invested in defense systems and Jerusalem sold significant amounts of weapons to Tehran.All that changed when the ayatollahs took over and the weapons once sold by Israel were turned against it. Israel and Turkey also once had a similar relationship. The IAF, for example, used to train freely over Turkish airspace, and the chiefs of staff of both countries used to frequently meet to share intelligence.Now though, the countries no longer have an ambassador posted in each other’s country. Last May in an incident carefully orchestrated by Erdogan’s government, Israel’s ambassador to Turkey, Eitan Naeh, was forced to undergo a humiliating security check at Istanbul Ataturk Airport with media cameras rolling.With Erdogan continuing to radicalize his country, the question has to be asked whether the same could one day happen in Turkey that happened 40 years ago in Tehran. Could Turkey one day turn into a clear enemy of Israel and the rest of the West?On the one hand, Turkey is a member of NATO and as such, is committed to certain Western values. Its military regularly trains with other Western armed forces – including the United States – and much of its equipment comes from America as well.Nevertheless, the US, as well as NATO, should be wary of what is happening in Turkey. Erdogan openly supports Hamas, attacks Israel and pours massive amounts of money into Turkish-supported Islamic institutions and organizations in east Jerusalem. He also uses his consul general in Israel’s capital city to funnel aid into the Gaza Strip.As expected, Turkey is already blaming Israel for the suspension of the F-35 delivery. A Turkish source told the TRT news agency that Israel pressured the US to stop the deal. While Turkish defense companies have participated in the production of some parts of the advanced aircraft, the report quoted Turkish sources as saying that Israel wanted the deal with Ankara canceled to take over Turkey’s role in the production.The US made the right decision to suspend the aircraft deliveries. Turkey needs to decide whose side it is on. Does it belong to the West and NATO, or is it continuing its radical turn to the east? Erdogan should let us know.

Martyrs never die,www.jpost.com,ANTHONY AVICE DU BUISSON,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Martyrs-never-die-585962,"April 7, 2019 09:38 b Fighters of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) put an SDF flag in al-Omar oil field in Deir Al Zor, Syria March 23, 2019. (photo credit: ABOUD HAMAM / REUTERS)
The flag of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) flies high over the last conquered area of the Islamic State’s proto-state, signaling a military defeat to the organization. This comes nearly five years after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi – leader of the organization – took to a platform in the al-Nuri Mosque in the heart of Mosul to declare the establishment of the proto-state, rallying thousands of Salafist-Jihadists to fight for the self-declared Caliphate. Coming from across the globe to kill and spread carnage, thousands of fighters once eager to expand Baghdadi’s vision now surrender en masse to the Coalition and the SDF, while Baghdadi – once commander of a proto-state that stretched from Raqqa to Mosul – flees to evade capture in the region. He leaves a crumbled Caliphate behind.As Baghdadi evades detection, the remains of his vision are being cleared out by the SDF and US-led Coalition. Thousands of Syrians gave their lives in the fight against the Islamic State. These “martyrs”– as they are more commonly referred to as – consist of fighters that are Kurdish, Arab, Assyrian and other ethnicities as well as from religious communities across northern Syria. Each community gave up sons and daughters in the war against the Islamic State (ISIS), all in the cause of liberating areas that ISIS controlled. Since the battle of Kobane in 2014 onward, 11,000 lives are estimated by the SDF press office to have fallen in pursuit of the cause, highlighting the large list of martyrs that died in pursuit of peace in northern Syria. These martyrs include Kurdish fighters from the People’s Protection Units (YPG) and Women’s Protection units (YPJ), the backbone of the SDF and the original combat force that has operated since the start of the war against ISIS. Syriac communities who fought with these Kurdish fighters gave lives to the cause too, especially from the Syriac Military Council (MFS) and Bethnahrain Women’s Protection Units (HSNB). Arab tribes from the north of Syria sent forces to fight in conjunction with this growing multi-ethnic coalition of militias in defiance of ISIS, sending Sanadid Forces and forming ranks with contingents of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), such as the Northern Sun Battalion – later known as the Manbij Military Council (MMC). Each force gave sons and daughters in the fight against ISIS.The list of martyrs also includes internationalists that ventured from across the globe to join the SDF. They were people who took up arms in the same spirit as the internationalists of the Spanish Civil War over 70 years prior, each holding different beliefs but sharing a desire to eliminate what they perceived to be a modern-day tyranny invested in taking the lives of the innocent. Leaving relatively safe homes and joining local Syrians, these internationalists fought grueling battles in a faraway land called Syria. Internationalists such as British volunteers Anna Campbell and Jac Holmes, American volunteer David Taylor as well as many more would not return home alive, dying instead on the battlefield.Across northern Syria (Rojava), hundreds of monuments dedicated to those who fell in the war against ISIS have been erected. Decorated with the portraits of thousands of martyrs, these locations provide a sad reminder for locals and visitors of the cost of this war. Each portrait shows the individual’s face, along with the force that they fought in. For example, David Taylor’s portrait shows his face with the background of the YPG. Cemeteries are also found across the north, where families, friends and loved ones still travel frequently to mourn. These graves contain the bodies of fighters and civilians alike, including humanitarian workers and local journalists such as Dilishan Ibish – a Kurdish journalist who perished in an explosion in 2017.In Kurdish there is a proverb used to remember those that perished. The proverb is “Shaheed namirin” and it translates in English as, “martyrs never die.” Connected to the culture of martyrdom that is common but not exclusive to communities in the Middle East, the proverb evokes an understanding of dying in pursuit of a noble cause. This can be best understood for those unfamiliar with martyr culture by reading Mary Elizabeth Frye’s poem “Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep.” The poem speaks about the nature of death and how the spirit of those that perished lives on in the world. If the last line of Frye’s poem were to be repurposed to better understand the martyr culture of northern Syria, it would read something like this:“Do not stand at my grave and cry; While Rojava lives, I did not die.”Over 30,000 foreign volunteers joined the Islamic State to fight for Baghdadi’s vision. This vision included the mass slaughter of local indigenous people, from Yazidis to Arabs and thousands of others, a violence that robbed thousands of their homes and lives. In response to this mass violence that swept across Syria and Iraq, people took up arms in defiance of the organization, giving their lives to destroy the vision that Baghdadi sought to implement. And as the dust settles five years later with the deaths of over 10,000 anti-ISIS fighters, the cause that each fought for still goes on. Only now, over 40,000 hands are doing that work and building the society for tomorrow’s generation.Plenty of work remains ahead now for the SDF and the US-led Coalition as the next phase of the war begins. With liberated areas in need of reconstruction and ISIS sleeper cells active in both Syria and Iraq, it is important to note that the elements that led to the formation of the Islamic State are still present. If those elements continue to remain, so too will the organization’s appeal. However, there will always be people ready to take up the struggle against ISIS and preserve all that makes life worth living. As long as there is resistance to tyranny, there will always be another dawn for humanity. The writer is an Australian-based freelance writer who focuses on politics and the Middle East.

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Paris and other French cities on Saturday for a 21st straight weekend of anti-government ""yellow vest"" protests, but the marches were largely peaceful. The quieter nature of the demonstrations should be a relief to President Emmanuel Macron, who this week wrapped up two months of nationwide town hall meetings as part of his ""grand debat"" initiative.Prime Minister Edouard Philippe is due on Monday to outline the initial findings that emerged from hours of discussions with local mayors and officials, high-school students, workers, intellectuals as well as 1.9 million online contributions.Macron, who launched the debate in a bid to calm the protests and determine which policies people want the government to focus on, is due to announce proposals based on the results later this month.By early afternoon on Saturday, there were 21 arrests in Paris and also a few clashes with police in Rouen on the margins of otherwise peaceful demonstrations.Protesters carrying French flags and holding signs calling for referendums tabled by citizens also marched largely without violence in Bordeaux and Lille.The protests, named after the high-visibility safety jackets worn by demonstrators, began in November as an expression of public anger against fuel tax increases.The movement soon morphed into a broader backlash against Macron's government, despite a swift reversal of the tax increases and other hurried measures worth more than 10 billion euros to boost purchasing power for less affluent voters.By 1200 GMT on Saturday, turnout was 6,300 demonstrators nationwide, according to government estimates, compared with 5,600 at the same time a week earlier.In Paris, two rallies had been authorized, including one from Place de la Republique in the east to La Defense business district in the west. Turnout was 3,100 by 1200 GMT against 1,800 at the same time last week. It was difficult to compare the figures because this week's marches started earlier than last week. As in recent weeks, authorities banned protests in potential trouble spots, including the French capital's Champs Elysees, fearing a repetition of the vandalism seen three weeks earlier.

"Women, Gender And Think Tanks: Political Influence Network In Twitter 2018 – Analysis",www.eurasiareview.com,Elcano Royal Institute,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/07042019-women-gender-and-think-tanks-political-influence-network-in-twitter-2018-analysis/,"What are the relationships and networks of gender studies and women specialists within the global network of political influence on Twitter?
By Cristina Manzano and Juan A. Sánchez-Giménez*
The presence of women in think tanks is still lower than that of men but, in addition, female influencers seem to be less influential in Twitter than their male counterparts. In addition, gender studies are hardly taken into account in the different fields of the analysis of international relations.
During 2018 we have monitored the network of relationships of the world’s leading think tanks and some of its analysts and have added a small network of gender research centres and activists, and women analysts interested in these issues. Our representation of reality, however, gives rise to certain questions: how large is the female presence in think tanks?; how do gender studies relate to the rest of the international relations field?; and how does the gender focus flow within the network? Analysis
As Mary Beard describes in Women and Power , women have been taught to remain silent since ancient times. The British scholar brilliantly traces the reason why female voices have traditionally been ignored in the public sphere by recounting how, in ancient Greece, Telemachus, son of Odysseus, orders his mother to remain silent because ‘speech will be the business of men’. According to Beard,
‘… it is a nice demonstration that right where written evidence for Western culture starts, women’s voices are not being heard in the public sphere. More than that, as Homer has it, an integral part of growing up, as a man, is learning to take control of public utterance and to silence the female of the species.’ 1
Quite a few centuries later, the presence of women in the public debate, despite significant progress in the past few decades, is still limited. This has a direct impact on their visibility, which, in turn, relates directly to their capacity to exert influence. The situation is more than evident even in disciplines in which women outnumber men.
Journalism is one of them. There are more women in schools of journalism and newsrooms than ever. In Spain, for instance, women account for 60% of Information Science students and half the staff of most media outlets. However, they only hold 10.9% of the leading positions in printed media and a slim 3.9% in digital media; when it comes to their role as columnists and opinion-makers, only 21% of the opinion pieces in the Spanish press are written by women. These figures are not very different from the European average of 23%.
It is similar in the academic realm: more than half the students in Spanish universities, around 40% of lecturers and 21% of professors are women. However, the higher the position, the smaller the number of women, with only 20% of deans being female.
The think-tanks world is no exception. When Anne-Marie Slaughter ( @ SlaughterAM ) became the head of the New American Foundation in 2013, only seven of the 50 most important think tanks in the US were run by women according to Foreign Policy Magazine . In Spain, there has never been one.
A good number of surveys and reports show that women are less cited in academic papers than their male counterparts. Dion, Sumner & Mitchell, for example, show that ‘Accumulated evidence identifies discernible gender gaps across many dimensions of professional academic careers including salaries, publication rates, journal placement, career progress, and academic service and recent work in political science also reveals gender gaps in citations, with articles written by men citing work by other male scholars more often than work by female scholars’. 2
Similarly, Maliniak, Powers & Walker, who have studied the specific case of International Relations, find that ‘Research produced by a woman will be read less and cited less than research produced by a man. Not only does this mean that the trajectory of intellectual developments will be slower than it should be, but it means that the types of topics and methods being showcased in journals and on syllabi are likely to be skewed toward those favoured and pursued by men’. 3
One of the significant reasons the authors identify for their findings is that women tend to cite themselves less than men, which clearly has an impact on their capacity to be more cited by others.
A few years ago, various movements started to claim a greater presence of women in expert panels. Several well-known authors ‘rebelled’ against the lack of women at the annual World Economic Forum at Davos. Others, like Owen Barder, Director for Europe of the Center for Global Development, set up initiatives such as ‘ The pledge ’, inviting the expert community not to take part in events without women; many others followed. Lists of female experts have also been collected extensively. A pioneer case was Hay mujeres , a Chilean foundation which offers advice and training for expert women to appear in the media. More recently, in 2018, the office of the European Parliament in Spain launched the initiative #DóndeEstánEllas (‘Where are the women?’) with a similar intention.
The number of women in politics varies enormously from country to country and is not covered here. The introduction of quotas and laws to guarantee a significant presence of women in national parliaments and governments has been critical to improving figures in this respect. The Spanish Parliament, with more than 40% of women among its members, is one of the countries with the largest percentage, behind only Sweden and Finland.
But returning to our topic, be it in the academic realm, in the world of experts or in politics, the link between visibility and influence seems more than obvious: in order to achieve the latter, experts need to make their voices heard.
Over the past decade, Twitter has become a forum where political ideas and influence have found a new channel and new forms of expression. How think tanks behave and relate amongst themselves and with other actors in the new digital arena has been the scope of different pieces of research by the Elcano Royal Institute in previous years .
In such an exercise, together with the papers by the Elcano Royal Institute, the online magazine esglobal published a special dossier that includes two rankings: one with the most influential think tanks and one with the most influential think-tanks experts in Twitter.
In 2018 a Twitter conversation was initiated about the small number of women in the latter ranking, generating a good number of interactions. That conversation is the starting point of this paper. This time the focus of research is therefore twofold: on the one hand, the place, relations and networks of female think-tank experts in Twitter; on the other, the relationships and networks of gender studies and specialists within the global network of political influence in that universe. The global think-tank network
At the beginning of the 21st century, the number of think tanks increased significantly worldwide, especially in the US. Think tanks are research and analysis-oriented organisations in the fields of international relations and public policies whose aim is to influence different players who intervene in decision-making processes. Influence, presence and power are all concepts used in the analysis of international relations. Unlike presence and power, however, influence needs to generate trends through ideas or ideology.
In that respect, we designed our political influence network of think tanks in Twitter following the one published in 2015 by Manfredi, Sánchez & Pizarro. 4 We have added to that network a number of researchers and analysts linked to different institutions, since they help to disseminate and to strengthen the political message beyond the political realm.
The resulting network comprises 799 active Twitter accounts of think tanks and think-tank experts and analysts (Figure 1).
Having framed our network as the context in which we observe political influence in Twitter, we have gathered activity data for three specific periods along the course of 2018: March, August and November. The result is a total of 284,700 relationships, of which 248,033 are tweets, retweets, mentions and conversations (replies). The other 36,667 correspond to Twitter interactions that took place before 2018 and 2017. The bulk of the activity measured (87.12%) can thus be dated throughout 2018 and be used to draw the relationship map of that year.
In our network of influencers in Twitter (Figure 1), which has become our representation of reality, how large is the female presence?, what kinds of relationships between men and women are established in a specialised network such as this?, how do gender studies relate to the rest of the international relations field’ and how does the gender focus flow within the network?
Apart from looking at the number and interaction of women in our network, in order to introduce the role of gender in our study we have also added a small network of 15 gender research centres, which include UN Women and specialists in gender issues and international relations. This will allow us to analyse the behaviour of gender studies in the larger network as well as the gender gaps that emerge in international relations and area studies. Figure 1. Global political influencer network. Source: Information & Documentation Service, Elcano Royal Institute.
When measuring network modularity, we can see that 92% of the network is distributed in five modules or sub-networks: International Relations, Gender, Development, In Spanish and ECFR. We understand modularity as the ability of a network to be seen as a union of several modules, sub-networks, clusters or communities that interact with each other and shape a common logic within the global network. Each module/cluster has specific and differential features in comparison to other modules/clusters while maintaining its relation to the global network. Women, gender, think tanks and Twitter
One of the outcomes of including gender as a specific field is that the geographical element –key in previous editions of the study– fades away, while the network becomes more polarised and also more global. This is directly linked to the weight of global influencers such as UN Women, Human Rights Watch (HRW), ECFR and Crisis Group, which become important nodes (Figure 2).
Gender studies appear to be isolated in relation to the other fields of activity within the realm of think tanks. Gender is of interest mostly to gender specialists and perhaps to a few experts and institutions dealing with human rights and development. Figure 2. Gender cluster relations map. Source: Information & Documentation Service, Elcano Royal Institute.
Our on-line global network of political influence reflects a similar proportion of female presence to that seen in other areas in the offline world: it hardly reaches a quarter of the total on average (see Figure 4: 22.03% women, yellow; 32.29% men, green; and 45.71% institutions, blue).
Looking at our Political Women Influencer Network we can see that Women (yellow nodes) are in the majority in the upper part of the graph, dominated by gender studies, development and human rights. Meanwhile, the global cluster is dominated by institutions devoted to International Relations, security issues and the international economy, while female influencers (in yellow) are very scarce at the centre of the graph.

Michael Cohen claims he's given federal prosecutors new evidence of Trump-related crimes,www.therussophile.org,Daily Kos,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/michael-cohen-claims-hes-given-federal-prosecutors-new-evidence-of-trump-related-crimes.html/,"By Jen Hayden
While Attorney General Bill Barr has been hiding the Mueller report from Congress, and Donald Trump has been running around claiming full exoneration (a claim sadly repeated by many traditional news outlets and Very Serious People in the media), Michael Cohen has been very busy combing through his records, records that were recently returned to him by prosecutors. – Advertisement –
In an interview on MSNBC’s The Beat with Ari Melber , Cohen’s attorney, Lanny Davis, told Melber that Cohen has given new evidence of crimes to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Here’s the exchange between Davis and Melber (the entire interview can be seen below):
DAVIS: Mr. Cohen is fully cooperating with the Southern District of New York and is offering more information that he’s now discovered when he retrieved back his documents and cell phones from the Southern District. He’s working with Congress.
Melber: Are you suggesting he has additional evidence beyond what he laid out in his congressional testimony?
Davis: That is correct. And he also has additional information for the Southern District of New York involving other criminal behavior. – Advertisement –
Davis also marveled that no charges have been filed against Trump. Organization executives Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, who were clearly implicated in the criminal conspiracy to illegally reimburse Cohen for hush money related to the Stormy Daniels case. Davis noted how exceptionally rare it was for someone to publicly testify about crimes committed by a sitting president, both before and after he took office, and have nothing come from that. He further noted that while there might be objections to indicting a sitting president, Donald Jr. and Weisselberg are not covered under any similar legal arguments, and it is truly puzzling that they have not yet been charged.
In related news, Cohen (via his attorneys) reached out to Congress this week to say he has been going over the devices and files returned to him by the SDNY and has retrieved 14 million files from a hard drive. Those files contain “emails, voice recordings, images and attachments from Mr. Cohen’s computers and phones. To date, Mr. Cohen has located several documents that we believe have significant value to the various congressional oversight and investigation committees.”
Cohen and Davis are asking for Cohen’s prison sentence to be delayed so that he can continue to comb through these records to provide additional information to prosecutors, and they note the injustice of Cohen being the only Trump Organization employee to be doing prison time for these crimes.
Finally, in closing, we write this as Mr. Cohen’s attorneys, as well as those who believe in basic justice. It is a fact that Mr. Cohen remains the only member of the Trump Organization, including Mr. Trump himself, who has been prosecuted and who is going to prison for conduct almost all of which was for the benefit of Mr. Trump personally and indeed directed by him. In our opinion, there is something unjust here. In addition, it is our professional opinion that the length of the sentence to which Mr. Cohen was subjected is, most respectfully, disproportionate given the particular facts and circumstances underlying each of the crimes to which Mr. Cohen pled guilty.
In addition to that letter, Davis sent a 12-page memo to House Democrats . From BuzzFeed:
In a 12-page memo sent to top House Democrats, Cohen’s attorneys said Trump “encouraged Cohen to lie and say all Moscow Tower project contacts ended as of January 31, 2016 using ‘code’ language telling Cohen during various conversations that there was ‘no collusion, no Russian contacts, nothing about Russia’ after the start of the campaign. […]” – Advertisement –
Davis went further, attaching documents they claim show additional crimes committed by Donald Trump.
The more than 100 pages of documents included with Cohen’s memo claim to lay bare a “conspiracy to collude” with the Russian government during the campaign, along with an array of other crimes by the president. The memo also for the “first time discloses Michael Cohen’s testimony to the Mueller team and to other non-public testimony to congressional committees,” according to Cohen’s legal team.
In addition, Cohen and Davis claim that Trump instructed him to lie about the Moscow Trump Tower project and that Ivanka Trump was aware that Cohen had initially lied to congressional investigators probing the Moscow Trump Tower deal."

On Thursday Daniel Lazare wrote a review of a book about how intelligence agents set up aspects of the “collusion” story. But in May 2018 Lazare had already begun figuring out the story for himself.
By Daniel Lazare Special to Consortium News
With the news that a Cambridge academic-cum-spy named Stefan Halper infiltrated the Trump campaign, the role of the intelligence agencies in shaping the great Russiagate saga is at last coming into focus.
It’s looking more and more massive. The intelligence agencies initiated reports that Donald Trump was colluding with Russia, they nurtured them and helped them grow, and then they spread the word to the press and key government officials. Reportedly, they even tried to use these reports to force Trump to step down prior to his inauguration. Although the corporate press accuses Trump of conspiring with Russia to stop Hillary Clinton, the reverse now seems to be the case: the Obama administration intelligence agencies worked with Clinton to block “ Siberian candidate ” Trump.
The template was provided by ex-MI6 Director Richard Dearlove, Halper’s friend and business partner. Sitting in winged chairs in London’s venerable Garrick Club, according to The Washington Post , Dearlove told fellow MI6 veteran Christopher Steele, author of the famous “golden showers” opposition research dossier, that Trump “reminded him of a predicament he had faced years earlier, when he was chief of station for British intelligence in Washington and alerted US authorities to British information that a vice presidential hopeful had once been in communication with the Kremlin.”
Apparently, one word from the Brits was enough to make the candidate in question step down. When that didn’t work with Trump, Dearlove and his colleagues ratcheted up the pressure to make him see the light. A major scandal was thus born – or, rather, a very questionable scandal.
Besides Dearlove, Steele, and Halper, a bon-vivant known as “The Walrus” for his impressive girth , other participants include: Robert Hannigan, former director Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, UK equivalent of the NSA. Alexander Downer, top Australian diplomat. Andrew Wood, ex-British ambassador to Moscow. Joseph Mifsud, Maltese academic. James Clapper, ex-US Director of National Intelligence. John Brennan, former CIA Director (and now NBC News analyst).
In-Bred
A few things stand out about this august group. One is its in-bred quality. After helping to run an annual confab known as the Cambridge Intelligence Seminar, Dearlove and Halper are now partners in a private venture calling itself “The Cambridge Security Initiative.” Both are connected to another London-based intelligence firm known as Hakluyt & Co. Halper is also connected via two books he wrote with Hakluyt representative Jonathan Clarke and Dearlove has a close personal friendship with Hakluyt founder Mike Reynolds, yet another MI6 vet. Alexander Downer served a half-dozen years on Hakluyt’s international advisory board, while Andrew Wood is linked to Steele via Orbis Business Intelligence, the private research firm that Steele helped found, and which produced the anti-Trump dossier, and where Wood now serves as an unpaid advisor .
Everyone, in short, seems to know everyone else. But another thing that stands out about this group is its incompetence. Dearlove and Halper appear to be old-school paranoids for whom every Russian is a Boris Badenov or a Natasha Fatale . In February 2014, Halper notified US intelligence that Mike Flynn, Trump’s future national security adviser, had grown overly chummy with an Anglo-Russian scholar named Svetlana Lokhova whom Halper suspected of being a spy – suspicions that Lokhova convincingly argues are absurd. Halper: Infiltrated Trump campaign
In December 2016, Halper and Dearlove both resigned from the Cambridge Intelligence Seminar because they suspected that a company footing some of the costs was tied up with Russian intelligence – suspicions that Christopher Andrew, former chairman of the Cambridge history department and the seminar’s founder, regards as “ absurd ” as well.
As head of Britain’s foreign Secret Intelligence Service, as MI6 is formally known, Dearlove played a major role in drumming up support for the 2003 Anglo-American invasion of Iraq even while confessing at a secret Downing Street meeting that “the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the [regime-change] policy.” When the search for weapons of mass destruction turned up dry, Clapper, as then head of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, argued that the Iraqi military must have smuggled them into neighboring Syria, a charge with absolutely no basis in fact but which helped pave the way for US regime-change efforts in that country too.

Brennan was meanwhile a high-level CIA official when the agency was fabricating evidence against Saddam Hussein and covering up Saudi Arabia’s role in 9/11. Wood not only continues to defend the Iraqi invasion, but dismisses fears of a rising fascist tide in the Ukraine as nothing more than “a crude political insult” hurled by Vladimir Putin for his own political benefit. Such views now seem distressingly misguided in view of the alt-right torchlight parades and spiraling anti-Semitism that are now a regular feature of life in the Ukraine.
The result is a diplo-espionage gang that is very bad at the facts but very good at public manipulation – and which therefore decided to use its skill set out to create a public furor over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
It Started Late 2015
The effort began in late 2015 when GCHQ, along with intelligence agencies in Poland, Estonia, and Germany, began monitoring what they said were “suspicious ‘interactions’ between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents.”
Since Trump was surging ahead in the polls and scaring the pants off the foreign-policy establishment by calling for a rapprochement with Moscow, the agencies figured that Russia was somehow behind it. The pace accelerated in March 2016 when a 30-year-old policy consultant named George Papadopoulos joined the Trump campaign as a foreign-policy adviser. Traveling in Italy a week later, he ran into Mifsud, the London-based Maltese academic, who reportedly set about cultivating him after learning of his position with Trump. Mifsud claimed to have “substantial connections with Russian government officials,” according to prosecutors. Over breakfast at a London hotel, he told Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow where he had learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.”
This was the remark that supposedly triggered an FBI investigation. The New York Times describes Mifsud as “an enthusiastic promoter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia” and “a regular at meetings of the Valdai Discussion Club, an annual conference held in Sochi, Russia, that Mr. Putin attends,” which tried to suggest that he is a Kremlin agent of some sort. But WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange later tweeted photos of Mifsud with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and a high-ranking British intelligence official named Claire Smith at a training session for Italian security agents in Rome. Since it’s unlikely that British intelligence would rely on a Russian agent in such circumstances, Mifsud’s intelligence ties are more likely with the UK.
After Papadopoulos caused a minor political ruckus by telling a reporter that Prime Minister David Cameron should apologize for criticizing Trump’s anti-Muslim pronouncements, a friend in the Israeli embassy put him in touch with a friend in the Australian embassy, who introduced him to Downer, her boss. Over drinks, Downer advised him to be more diplomatic. After Papadopoulos then passed along Misfud’s tip about Clinton’s emails, Downer informed his government, which, in late July, informed the FBI.
Was Papadopoulos Set Up?
Suspicions are unavoidable but evidence is lacking. Other pieces were meanwhile clicking into place. In late May or early June 2016, Fusion GPS, a private Washington intelligence firm employed by the Democratic National Committee, hired Steele to look into the Russian angle.
On June 20, he turned in the first of eighteen memos that would eventually comprise the Steele dossier , in this instance a three-page document asserting that Putin “has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years” and that Russian intelligence possessed “kompromat” in the form of a video of prostitutes performing a “golden showers” show for his benefit at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton. A week or two later, Steele briefed the FBI on his findings. Around the same time, Robert Hannigan flew to Washington to brief CIA Director John Brennan about additional material that had come GCHQ’s way, material so sensitive that it could only be handled at “director level.”
One player was filling Papadopoulos’s head with tales of Russian dirty tricks, another was telling the FBI, while a third was collecting more information and passing it on to the bureau as well. Page: Took Russia’s side.
On July 7, 2016 Carter Page delivered a lecture on U.S.-Russian relations in Moscow in which he complained that “Washington and other western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption, and regime change.” Washington hawks expressed “ unease ” that someone representing the presumptive Republican nominee would take Russia’s side in a growing neo-Cold War.
Stefan Halper then infiltrated the Trump campaign on behalf of the FBI as an informant in early July, weeks before the FBI launched its investigation. Halper had 36 years earlier infiltrated the Carter re-election campaign in 1980 using CIA agents to turn information over to the Reagan campaign. Now Halper began to court both Page and Papadopoulous, independently of each other.
On July 11, Page showed up at a Cambridge symposium at which Halper and Dearlove both spoke. In early September, Halper sent Papadopoulos an email offering $3,000 and a paid trip to London to write a research paper on a disputed gas field in the eastern Mediterranean, his specialty. “George, you know about hacking the emails from Russia, right?” Halper asked when he got there, but Papadopoulos said he knew nothing. Halper also sought out Sam Clovis, Trump’s national campaign co-chairman, with whom he chatted about China for an hour or so over coffee in Washington.
The rightwing Federalist website speculates that Halper was working with Steele to flesh out a Sept. 14 memo claiming that “Russians do have further ‘kompromat’ on CLINTON (e-mails) and [are] considering disseminating it.” Clovis believes that Halper was trying “to create an audit trail back to those [Clinton] emails from someone in the campaign … so they could develop a stronger case for probable cause to continue to issue warrants and to further an investigation.” Reports that Halper apparently sought a permanent post in the new administration suggest that the effort was meant to continue after inauguration.

Notwithstanding Clovis’s nutty rightwing politics , his description of what Halper may have been up to makes sense as does his observation that Halper was trying “to build something that did not exist.” Despite countless hyper-ventilating headlines about mysterious Trump Tower meetings and the like, the sad truth is that Russiagate after all these months is shaping up as even more of a “nothing-burger” than Obama administration veteran Van Jones said it was back in mid-2017. Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has indicted Papadopoulos and others on procedural grounds, he has indicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for corruption, and he has charged a St. Petersburg company known as the Internet Research Agency with violating US election laws.
But the corruption charges have nothing to do with Russian collusion and nothing in the indictment against IRA indicates that either the Kremlin or the Trump campaign were involved. Indeed, the activities that got IRA in trouble in the first place are so unimpressive – just $ 46,000 worth of Facebook ads that it purchased prior to election day, some pro-Trump, some anti, and some with no particular slant at all – that Mueller probably wouldn’t even have bothered if he hadn’t been under intense pressure to come up with anything at all.
The same goes for the army of bots that Russia supposedly deployed on Twitter. As The Washington Post noted in an oddly, cool-headed Dec. 2 article , 2,700 suspected Russian-linked accounts generated just 202,000 tweets in a six-year period ending in August 2017, a drop in a bucket compared to the one billion election-related tweets sent out during the fourteen months leading up to Election Day.
The Steele dossier is also underwhelming. It declares on one page that the Kremlin sought to cultivate Trump by throwing “various lucrative real estate development business deals” his way but says on another that Trump’s efforts to drum up business were unavailing and that he thus “had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services there from local prostitutes rather than business success.”
Why would Trump turn down business offers when he couldn’t generate any on his own? The idea that Putin would spot a U.S. reality-TV star somewhere around 2011 and conclude that he was destined for the Oval Office five years later is ludicrous. The fact that the Democratic National Committee funded the dossier via its law firm Perkins Coie renders it less credible still, as does the fact that the world has heard nothing more about the alleged video despite the ongoing deterioration in US-Russian relations. What’s the point of making a blackmail tape if you don’t use it? Steele: Paid for political research, not intelligence.
Even Steele is backing off. In a legal paper filed in response to a libel suit last May, he said the document “did not represent (and did not purport to represent) verified facts, but were raw intelligence which had identified a range of allegations that warranted investigation given their potential national security implications.” The fact is that the “dossier” was opposition research, not an intelligence report. It was neither vetted by Steele nor anyone in an intelligence agency. Opposition research is intended to mix truths and fiction, to dig up plausible dirt to throw at your opponent, not to produce an intelligence assessment at taxpayer’s expense to “protect” the country. And Steele was paid for it by the Democrats, not his government.
Using it Anyway
Nonetheless, the spooks have made the most of such pseudo-evidence. Dearlove and Wood both advised Steele to take his “findings” to the FBI, while, after the election, Wood pulled Sen. John McCain aside at a security conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to let him know that the Russians might be blackmailing the president-elect. McCain dispatched long-time aide David J. Kramer to the UK to discuss the dossier with Steele directly.
Although Kramer denies it, The New Yorker found a former national-security official who says he spoke with him at the time and that Kramer’s goal was to have McCain confront Trump with the dossier in the hope that he would resign on the spot. When that didn’t happen, Clapper and Brennan arranged for FBI Director James Comey to confront Trump instead. Comey later testified that he didn’t want Trump to think he was creating “a J. Edgar Hoover-type situation – I didn’t want him thinking I was briefing him on this to sort of hang it over him in some way.”
But how could Trump think otherwise? As Consortium News founding editor Robert Parry observed a few days later, the maneuver “resembles a tactic out of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s playbook on government-style blackmail: I have some very derogatory information about you that I’d sure hate to see end up in the press.”
Since then, the Democrats have touted the dossier at every opportunity, The New Yorker continues to defend it , while Times columnist Michelle Goldberg cites it as well, saying it’s a “rather obvious possibility that Trump is being blackmailed.” CNN, for its part, suggested not long ago that the dossier may actually be Russian disinformation designed to throw everyone off base, Republicans and Democrats alike.
It sounds more like CIA paranoia raised to the nth degree. But that’s what the intelligence agencies are for, i.e. to spread fear and propaganda in order to stampede the public into supporting their imperial agenda. In this case, their efforts are so effective that they’ve gotten lost in a fog of their own making. If the corporate press fails to point this out, it’s because reporters are too befogged themselves to notice.

Muellergate & The Discreet Lies Of The Bourgeoisie,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/muellergate-the-discreet-lies-of-the-bourgeoisie.html/,"Via CraigMurray.co.uk,
This cartoon seems to me very apposite…
The capacity of the mainstream media repeatedly to promote the myth that Russia caused Clinton’s defeat, while never mentioning what the information was that had been so damaging to Hillary, should be alarming to anybody under the illusion that we have a working “free media”.
There are literally hundreds of thousands of mainstream media articles and broadcasts, from every single one of the very biggest names in the Western media, which were predicated on the complete nonsense that Russia had conspired to install Donald Trump as President of the United States.
I genuinely have never quite understood whether the journalists who wrote this guff believed it, whether they were cynically pumping out propaganda and taking their pay cheque, or whether they just did their “job” and chose to avoid asking themselves whether they were producing truth or lies.
I suspect the answer varies from journalist to journalist. At the Guardian, for example, I get the impression that Carole Cadwalladr is sufficiently divorced from reality to believe all that she writes. Having done a very good job in investigating the nasty right wing British Establishment tool that was Cambridge Analytica, Cadwalladr became deluded by her own fame and self-importance and decided that her discovery was the key to understanding all of world politics. In her head it explained all the disappointments of Clintonites and Blairites everywhere. She is not so high-minded however as to have refused the blandishments of the Integrity Initiative.
Luke Harding is in a different category. Harding has become so malleable a tool of the security services it is impossible to believe he is not willingly being used. It would be embarrassing to have written a bestseller called “Collusion”, the entire premiss for which has now been disproven, had Harding not made so much money out of it.
Harding’s interview with Aaron Mate of The Real News was a truly enlightening moment. The august elite of the mainstream media virtually never meet anybody who subjects their narrative to critical intellectual scrutiny. Harding’s utter inability to deal with unanticipated scepticism descends from hilarious to toe-curlingly embarrassing.
[embedded content]
In general, since the Mueller report confirmed that $50 million worth of investigation had been unable to uncover any evidence of Russiagate collusion, the media has been astonishingly unrepentant about the absolute rubbish they have been churning out for years.
Harding and the Guardian’s story about Manafort repeatedly calling on Assange in the Ecuador Embassy is one of the most blatant and malicious fabrications in modern media history. It has been widely ridiculed, no evidence of any kind has ever been produced to substantiate it, and the story has been repeatedly edited on the Guardian website to introduce further qualifications and acknowledgements of dubious attribution, not present as originally published. But still neither Editor Katherine Viner nor author Luke Harding has either retracted or apologised, something which calls the fundamental honesty of both into question.
Manafort is now in prison, because as with many others interviewed, the Mueller investigation found he had been involved in several incidences of wrongdoing. Right up until Mueller finalised his report, media articles and broadcasts repeatedly, again and again and again every single day, presented these convictions as proving that there had been collusion with Russia. The media very seldom pointed out that none of the convictions related to collusion. In fact for the most part they related to totally extraneous events, like unrelated tax frauds or Trump’s hush-money to (very All-American) prostitutes. The “Russians” that Manafort was convicted of lobbying for without declaration, were Ukrainian and the offences occurred ten years ago and had no connection to Trump of any kind. Rather similarly the lies of which Roger Stone stands accused relate to his invention, for personal gain, of a non-existent relationship with Wikileaks.
The truth is that, if proper and detailed investigation were done into any group of wealthy politicos in Washington, numerous crimes would be uncovered, especially in the fields of tax and lobbying. Rich political operatives are very sleazy. This is hardly news, and if those around Clinton had been investigated there would be just as many convictions and of similar kinds. it is a pity there is not more of this type of work, all the time. But the Russophobic motive behind the Mueller Inquiry was not forwarded by any of the evidence obtained.
My analysis of the Steele dossier, written before I was aware that Sergei Skripal probably had a hand in it, has stood the test of time very well. It is a confection of fantasy concocted for money by a charlatan.
We should not forget at this stage to mention the unfortunate political prisoner Maria Butina, whose offence is to be Russian and very marginally involved in American politics at the moment when there was a massive witchhunt for Russian spies in progress, that makes The Crucible look like a study in calm rationality. Ms Butina was attempting to make her way in the US political world, no doubt, and she had at least one patron in Moscow who was assisting her with a view to increasing their own political influence. But nothing Butina did was covert or sinister. Her efforts to win favour within the NRA were notable chiefly because of the irony that the NRA has been historically responsible for many more American deaths than Russia.
Any narrative of which the Establishment does not approve is decried as conspiracy theory. Yet the “Russiagate” conspiracy theory – which truly is Fake News – has been promoted massively by the entire weight of western corporate and state media. “Russiagate”, a breathtaking plot in which Russia and a high profile US TV personality collude together to take control of the most militarily powerful country in the world, knocks “The Manchurian Candidate” into a cocked hat. A Google “news search” restricts results to mainstream media outlets. Such a search for the term “Russiagate” brings 230,000 results. That is almost a quarter of a million incidents of the mainstream media not only reporting the fake “Russiagate” story, but specifically using that term to describe it.
Compare that with a story which is not an outlandish fake conspiracy theory, but a very real conspiracy.
If, by contrast, you do a Google “news search” for the term “Integrity Initiative”, the UK government’s covert multi million pound programme to pay senior mainstream media journalists to pump out anti-Russian propaganda worldwide, you only get one eighth of the results you get for “Russiagate”. Because the mainstream media have been enthusiastically promoting the fake conspiracy story, and deliberately suppressing the very real conspiracy in which many of their own luminaries are personally implicated.
Furthermore – and this is a truly tremendous irony, which relates back to the cartoon at the start – only two of the top ten news results for “Integrity Initiative” come from the Western corporate media.
And this next fact comes nearly into the “too good to be true” category for my argument. Those two MSM mentions, from Sky News and the Guardian, do not complain of the covert anti-Russian propaganda campaign that is the Integrity Initiative. They rather complain that it was an alleged “Russian hack” that made the wrongdoing public!! You could not make it up, you really could not.
According to the mainstream media, it is not Hillary Clinton’s fault for conspiring with the DNC to cheat Bernie out of the nomination, it is Russia’s fault for allegedly helping to reveal it. It is not the British government’s, or their media collaborators’, fault for running a covert propaganda scheme to dupe the public of the UK and many other countries, it is the Russians’ fault for allegedly helping to reveal it!
Which brings us full circle to the DNC leak that sparked Muellergate and the claims that it was the Russians who lost Hillary the election. Robert Mueller repeats the assertion from the US security services that it was Russian hackers who obtained the DNC emails and passed them on to Wikileaks. I am telling you from my personal knowledge that this is not true.
Neither Mueller’s team, not the FBI, nor the NSA, nor any US Intelligence agency, has ever carried out any forensic analysis on the DNC’s servers. The DNC consistently refused to make them available. The allegation against Russia is based purely on information from the DNC’s own consultants, Crowdstrike.
William Binney, former Technical Director of the NSA (America’s US$40 billion a year communications intercept organisation), has proven beyond argument that it is a technical impossibility for the DNC emails to have been transmitted by an external hack – they were rather downloaded locally, probably on to a memory stick. Binney’s analysis is fully endorsed by former NSA systems expert Ed Loomis. There simply are no two people on the planet more technically qualified to make this judgement. Yet, astonishingly, Mueller refused to call Binney or Loomis (or me) to testify. Compare this, for example, with his calling to testify my friend Randy Credico, who had no involvement whatsoever in the matter, but Mueller’s team hoped to finger as a Trump/Assange link.
Randy Emerges From His Evidence Session Displaying A Great Taste in Reading Material
The DNC servers have never been examined by intelligence agencies, law enforcement or by Mueller’s team. Binney and Loomis have written that it is impossible this was an external hack. Wikileaks have consistently stressed no state actor was involved. No evidence whatsoever has been produced of the transfer of the material from the “Russians” to Wikileaks. Wikileaks Vault 7 release of CIA documents shows that the planting of false Russian hacking “fingerprints” is an established CIA practice . Yet none of this is reflected at all by Mueller nor by the mainstream media.
“Collusion” may be dead, but the “Russiagate” false narrative limps on.
I should add it seems to me very probable Russia did make some efforts to influence the US election. I worked a a British diplomat for 20 years and spent a lot of time trying to influence political outcomes in the country in which I was posted, in Eastern Europe and in Africa. It is part of the geopolitical game. The United States is of course the world leader by a long way in attempting to influence elections abroad, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to that effect in countries including Ukraine, Georgia, Ecuador and Venezuela recently, and pretty well everywhere in Africa. It is a part of normal diplomatic life.
Mueller uncovered some high level influence-broking meetings. This is what states do. He uncovered some sleazy deals. This is what rich people do. He uncovered some US $110,000 of Facebook ad spending from Russia targeted on the USA, some of which promoted sex toys, some of which was post-election, but some of which was apparently trying to assist Trump against Clinton. Compared to the amount the USA pumps into similar arms length assistance to Putin opponents in Russia alone, it was negligible. That this tiny bit of Facebook advertising crucially impacted the US $13,000,000,000 PR campaigns of the candidates is a ludicrous proposition.
That every country stay out of every other country’s politics is arguably desirable. It is not however the status quo, and the United States is in the worst position of all to complain.

CARACAS, April 7. /TASS/. The Venezuelan system of electricity generation and distribution was attacked not merely from the United States but also from South American countries, President Nicolas Maduro said at a rally in the capital of the country.
“I have already said that we confirmed the version of attacks governed from Houston and Chicago during the investigation,” Maduro said. “We found new sources [of aggression] from Chile and Columbia, used to damage the power system of Venezuela,” he noted.
Venezuela sees major disruptions in operations of the power supply systems affecting the majority of regions from early March. The shutdown of the largest scale occurred in the country on March 7, when Caracas and the majority of states were left without electricity for several days.
More than five million Venezuelans took place in the Saturday marches in support of the government, Maduro noted. “Today, more than five million Venezuelans mobilized all over the country for the operation in support of the freedom and it was successful,” the president said.
Maduro asked governments of Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia and countries of CARICOM (Caribbean Community and Common Market) to help in establishing the dialog between the government and the opposition in Venezuela.
“Venezuela asks for help and support in setting the dialog for achievement of mutual understanding among Venezuelans. I confirm my desire and readiness to find a solution through talks for the sake of the future of the country,” Maduro said in his speech during the rally.
Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia and fourteen member-states of CARICOM should give a new impetus to the mechanism for resolution of crisis in Venezuela, he said. “The dialog will be able to start with their assistance,” he added.

Israel’s Netanyahu Vows to Annex West Bank Settlements,www.therussophile.org,KARIN LAUB The Associated Press,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/israels-netanyahu-vows-to-annex-west-bank-settlements.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
JERUSALEM—Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Saturday to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re-elected, a dramatic policy shift apparently aimed at rallying his nationalist base in the final stretch of the tight race.
Netanyahu has promoted Jewish settlement expansion in his four terms as prime minister, but until now refrained from presenting a detailed vision for the West Bank, seen by the Palestinians as the heartland of a future state. Related Articles
An Israeli annexation of large parts of the West Bank is bound to snuff out any last flicker of hope for an Israeli-Palestinian deal on the terms of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in 1967.
A so-called two-state solution has long been the preferred option of most of the international community. However, intermittent U.S. mediation between Israelis and Palestinians ran aground after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital early in his term. The Palestinians, who seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem as their capital, suspended contact with the U.S.
More recently, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in 1967. The move was viewed in Israel as a political gift by Trump to Netanyahu who is being challenged by former military chief Benny Gantz.
Polls have indicated a close race, though Netanyahu’s Likud Party is expected to have a better chance than Gantz’s Blue and White slate to form a ruling coalition. Polls forecast more than 60 out of 120 parliament seats for the Likud and smaller right-wing and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties
On Saturday, Netanyahu gave an interview to Israel’s Channel 12 TV at the top of the prime-time newscast. Netanyahu portrayed the U.S. policy shifts on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as his achievements, saying he had managed to persuade Trump to take these steps.
Netanyahu pledged that he would not dismantle a single Jewish settlement and that Israel would retain control of the territory west of the Jordan River — the West Bank. More than 600,000 Israelis now live on war-won lands, two-thirds in the West Bank.
The interviewer asked why he hadn’t annexed some of the larger settlements during his current term. “The question you are asking is an interesting question, whether we will move to the next stage and the answer is yes,” he said, adding that the next term in office would be fateful. “We will move to the next stage, the imposing of Israeli sovereignty.”
“I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,” he said. “From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.”
In any partition deal, the more isolated Jewish settlements would likely have to be uprooted to create a viable Palestinian state.
Saeb Erekat, a veteran former Palestinian negotiator, said he held the international community, especially the Trump administration, responsible for Israel’s policies.
“Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump administration’s support and endorsement of Israel’s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine,” he said in a statement."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has taken a further step in violating the international law by saying that he would annex the occupied Palestinian region of West Bank if he wins another term in office.
In an interview on Saturday, Netanyahu said he would not shy away from expanding Israel’s illegal annexations to cover the West Bank, a land currently accommodated by settlers which Israeli regime occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
“Who says that we won’t do it? We are on the way and we are discussing it,” Netanyahu said while responding to a question from the Israeli Channel 12 News on why he had not annexed the West Bank like the occupied east Jerusalem al-Quds and Syria’s Golan Heights.
“You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage – the answer is yes, we will move to the next stage,” he said, adding, “I don’t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlements.”
The comments come just three days before Israel’s April 9 election where Netanyahu is seeking a reelection despite widespread allegations of graft and financial wrongdoing affecting him and his family.
They also come following a controversial move by the United States to recognize Israel’s annexation of Syria’s Golan Heights.
Netanyahu had previously said that the fate of the West Bank, where the Palestinian government has its sit of power in the capital Ramallah, should be decided in talks with the Palestinians who seek to establish their own state in the territory.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Netanyahu’s new comments, which many believe have been made to change the tide in his favor in the upcoming election, would not affect the illegal nature of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank which currently hosts some 400,000 settlers.
“Any measures and any announcements will not change the facts. Settlements are illegal and they will be removed,” said Nabil Abu Rdainah.
A majority of countries in the world consider Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, the East Jerusalem al-Quds, and the Golan Height as illegal under the Geneva conventions that bar settling on land captured in war.

5G: What you need to know—NOW!,www.therussophile.org,State of the Nation,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/5g-what-you-need-to-know-now.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Jeremy Naydlertakebackyourpower.net Acclaimed author and philosopher Jeremy Naydler, Ph.D. is our guide as we explore what a full-scale deployment of 5G may mean for humanity at this critical time… and how we can help create a better alternative. Be sure to read his conclusion. 5G From Space
In November of 2018, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authorised the rocket company SpaceX, owned by the entrepreneur Elon Musk, to launch a fleet of 7,518 satellites to complete SpaceX’s ambitious scheme to provide global satellite broadband services to every corner of the Earth.
The satellites will operate at a height of approximately 210 miles, and irradiate the Earth with extremely high frequencies between 37.5 GHz and 42 GHz. This fleet will be in addition to a smaller SpaceX fleet of 4,425 satellites, already authorised earlier in the year by the FCC, which will orbit the Earth at a height of approximately 750 miles and is set to bathe us in frequencies between 12 GHz and 30 GHz. The grand total of SpaceX satellites is thus projected to reach just under 12,000. FIGURE 1: Satellites beam down 5G. (ZdNet.com)
There are at present approximately two thousand fully functioning satellites orbiting the Earth. Some beam down commercial GPS (or “SatNav”), some provide TV, some provide mobile phone services, and some bounce radar back and forth to produce images for meteorologists and military surveillance. The Earth is thus already comprehensively irradiated from outer space.
But the new SpaceX fleets will constitute a massive increase in the number of satellites in the skies above us, and a correspondingly massive increase in the radiation reaching the Earth from them. The SpaceX satellite fleet is, however, just one of several that are due to be launched in the next few years, all serving the same purpose of providing global broadband services. Other companies, including Boeing, One Web and Spire Global are each launching their own smaller fleets, bringing the total number of projected new broadband satellites to around 20,000 – every one of them dedicated to irradiating the Earth at similar frequencies (fig. 1). 1
[W]hat is really driving it is the creation of the conditions within which electronic or “artificial” intelligence will be able to assume an ever greater presence in our lives.
Why is there this sudden flurry of activity? The new satellite fleets are contributing to a concerted global effort to “upgrade” the electromagnetic environment of the Earth. The upgrade is commonly referred to as 5G, or fifth generation wireless network. It has become customary in tech circles to talk about the introduction of 5G as involving the creation of a new global “electronic ecosystem”. It amounts to geo-engineering on a scale never before attempted. While this is being sold to the public as an enhancement of the quality of video streaming for media and entertainment, what is really driving it is the creation of the conditions within which electronic or “artificial” intelligence will be able to assume an ever greater presence in our lives.
In a previous article for New View , (“Radiation, Robot Bees and 5G”, New View , 85, Autumn 2017), I described how the introduction of 5G will require hundreds of thousands of new mini mobile phone masts (also referred to as “base stations”) in urban centres throughout the UK, and literally millions of new masts in cities throughout the rest of the world, all emitting radiation at frequencies and at power levels far higher than those to which we are presently subjected.
These new masts are much smaller than the masts we currently see beside our motorways and on top of buildings. They will be discreetly attached to the side of shops and offices or secured to lampposts. The 20,000 satellites are a necessary supplement to this land-based effort, for they will guarantee that rural areas, lakes, mountains, forests, oceans and wildernesses, where there are neither buildings nor lampposts, will all be incorporated into the new electronic infrastructure. Not one inch of the globe will be free of radiation.
Given the scale of the project, it is surprising how few people are aware of the enormity of what is now just beginning to unfold all around us. Very few people have even heard about the 20,000 new satellites that are due to transform the planet into a so-called “smart planet”, irradiating us night and day. In the national media, we do not hear voices questioning the wisdom, let alone the ethics, of geo-engineering a new global electromagnetic environment.
But the question we should ask is whether we also want increasingly intense exposure of the natural environment and all living creatures, including ourselves, to more and more electromagnetic radiation.
Instead, there is a blithe acceptance that technology must continue to progress, and the presence in our lives of increasingly “smart” machines and gadgets that each year become cleverer and more capable is an inevitable part of this progress. And who doesn’t want progress? Almost everyone loves their sleek and seductively designed phones, pads and virtual assistants, and regards them as an indispensible part of their lives.
But the question we should ask is whether we also want increasingly intense exposure of the natural environment and all living creatures, including ourselves, to more and more electromagnetic radiation. Is it likely that this does not entail any adverse health consequences, as both government and industry claim? If the electromagnetic waves that connect our smartphones to the Internet travel through brick, stone and cement, then what happens when these same waves encounter our bodies?
Be assured that they do not just bounce off us! They travel into the human body. The degree to which they are absorbed can be precisely measured in what is called the Specific Absorption Rate, expressed in Watts per kilogram of biological tissue. When we fill our houses with Wi Fi, we are irradiating our bodies continuously. When we hold a smartphone to our ear, electromagnetic waves irradiate our brains (fig.2). Do we really believe this could be completely harmless? FIGURE 2: The colours indicate the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of mobile phone radiation. The SAR is the amount of power absorbed by tissue, measured in watts per kilogram, shown here with red as the highest value, blue the lowest. (2) Waves and Frequencies
At present, mobile phones, smartphones, tablets, most Wi Fi and so on all operate at under 3 GHz in what is called the “microwave” region of the electromagnetic spectrum. If you could see and measure their wavelengths, you would find that they are many centimetres (or inches) long. A smartphone operating at 800 MHz, for example, sends and receives signals with wavelengths of 37.5 centimetres (just under 15 inches). Operating at 1.9 GHz, the wavelengths are 16 centimetres (just over 6 inches). Wi Fi uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band with 12 centimetre wavelengths (just under 5 inches long).
The introduction of 5G will entail the use of considerably higher frequencies than these, with correspondingly shorter wavelengths. Above 30 GHz, wavelengths are just millimetres rather than centimetres long. The millimetre waveband (from 30 GHz to 300 GHz) is referred to as Extremely High Frequency, and its wavelengths are between 10 millimetres and 1 millimetre in length. 3 Up to the present time, Extremely High Frequency electromagnetic radiation has not been widely propagated, and its introduction marks a significant step change in the kind of electromagnetic energy that will become present in the natural environment (fig.3). FIGURE 3: Frequencies and wavelengths of smartphone, Wi Fi and 5G.
The reason why millimetre waves are to be used for 5G is that much larger bands of spectrum are available in the Extremely High Frequencies than at lower frequencies. This means that there can be much broader “bandwidth”. Broader bandwidth means that larger quantities of data can be transferred and the speed of transfer of the data will be significantly faster.
One of the effects of this is that it reduces what is called “latency”, or time-lag, in the system, so it improves the quality of video streaming. But in so doing, it also enables a greater seamlessness between the data accessible from virtual sources and our perceptions of objects in the real world, as is required, for example, in Augmented Reality applications. Greater seamlessness means that we more effortlessly inhabit the natural and the electronic worlds as if they were a single reality.
A single 5G transmitter/receiver will have a large number of tiny antennas, grouped together in one unit.
One of the technical problems of using frequencies in the millimetre region of the spectrum is that, because the waves carrying the data are so tiny, being only millimetres long, they are less able to pass through physical barriers, like walls and trees, than are the longer waves of lower frequencies. This is why it is necessary to have so many more new phone masts or “base stations”. They will need to be spaced at 100 metres apart in cities because beyond this distance their signals weaken and are therefore less able to penetrate buildings, and connect with the devices inside. As well as being more closely spaced, the 5G base stations will operate at much higher power than current phone masts, in order to ensure that the signals are sufficiently strong. FIGURE 4: Qualcomm’s millimetre wave antenna array module for a 5G smartphone. It has four antennas that can accurately point towards the nearest 5G base station. Phones will have four of these modules, i.e. sixteen antennas. (4)
Because the wavelengths are so much smaller, the antennas transmitting and receiving them will also be much smaller than those of current phone masts and electronic devices. A single 5G transmitter/receiver will have a large number of tiny antennas, grouped together in one unit. An array of just over a thousand such antennas measures only four square inches, so will easily fit into a small base station on a lamppost, while the smartphone in your pocket will probably have sixteen (fig.4).
But it also means that any living creature that gets in the way of such a concentrated beam will be subjected to a powerful dose of extremely high frequency radiant electricity.
Both 5G satellites and 5G land-based masts will use a system called the “phased array”. In the phased array, groups of antennas are co-ordinated to radiate pulses in a specific direction and in a specified time sequence. This allows a concentrated beam of radio waves to be exactly aimed at designated targets, to enable signals to be sent or received. Because the beams are concentrated in this way, this adds to their power, which means they are able more easily to penetrate buildings.
But it also means that any living creature that gets in the way of such a concentrated beam will be subjected to a powerful dose of extremely high frequency radiant electricity. A study published earlier this year demonstrated that certain insects, because of their small body-size, are particularly vulnerable to the millimetre waves of the higher frequencies to be utilised by 5G (fig. 5). 5 Other studies have shown that bacteria and plants are also vulnerable, and so also (as one might expect) are the skin and the eyes of animals including, of course, human beings. 6 FIGURE 5: Illustration of the absorption of Radio Frequency electromagnetic radiation in the Honey Bee. At currently used frequencies between 2 GHz (top) and 6 GHz (middle), the wavelength is relatively large compared to the insect. But at 24 GHz, (bottom) the wavelength is closer to the insect’s size and the radiation penetrates further.7
As well as its ability to concentrate power in focused beams, phased array technology has a further complicating factor. Either side of the main beam, the time intervals between the pulses are different from the time intervals between those of the main beam, but they may overlap each other in such a way as to produce extremely rapid changes in the electromagnetic field. This can have a particularly detrimental effect on living organisms, because instead of the radiation decaying when it is absorbed into living tissue, it can be re-radiated within the body.
The moving charges streaming into the body effectively become antennas that re-radiate the electromagnetic field and send it deeper into the organism. These re-radiated waves are known as Brillouin precursors, named after the French physicist Leon Brillouin, who first described them in 1914. Research suggests that they can have a significant and highly detrimental impact on living cells. 8 The Un-reassuring Assurances of Government and Industry
The Government body charged with protecting public health, Public Health England, advises us that there is no convincing evidence that Radio Frequency radiation (which radio, television, mobile phones, smartphones and 5G all use) has any adverse health effects on either adults or children.
This advice is based on the recommendations of a supposedly independent body called AGNIR (Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation), which produced a report in 2012 on the safety of Radio Frequency radiation. The report stated that there was a lack of “convincing” and “conclusive” evidence for any adverse health effects. 9 It was like giving a blank cheque to the telecommunications industry to move on into the higher frequencies, without any heed for the consequences.
It was like giving a blank cheque to the telecommunications industry to move on into the higher frequencies, without any heed for the consequences.
It turns out that far from being independent, AGNIR has a high proportion of members with blatant conflicts of interests, and their report distorted or simply left out of account evidence that should have compelled them to reach the opposite conclusion to the one they arrived at. In a forensic analysis of the report, the environmental health researcher, Sarah Starkey, makes it clear that only a wilful disregard of the available scientific evidence could explain its internal contradictions and apparent incompetence. 10
And yet it is the basis of current UK Government policy, allowing government to roll out 5G without so much as even a nod towards the need for prior health and safety assessment. 11 Health and safety simply do not feature in Government thinking, despite a veritable mountain of literally thousands of research papers demonstrating adverse health effects, which continues to grow at the rate of roughly 350 per year, on average practically one every day. 12
Health and safety simply do not feature in Government thinking, despite a veritable mountain of literally thousands of research papers demonstrating adverse health effects…
One of the reasons for ignoring this evidence in the hell-for-leather dash to create the 5G electronic ecosystem is the conviction in government circles that, unless we introduce it immediately, we will be “left behind” and our economic growth and competitiveness will be put at risk. There is simply no time to consider the possible health consequences.
The National Infrastructure Commission, whose 2016 report, Connected Future, forms the basis of current Government policy, pushed this panicky vision of the UK falling behind other nations and urged the government to ensure that the new digital infrastructure is fully in place by 2025. 13 The NIC report repeatedly points out that the rewards of the “connected future” are to be measured in billions of pounds worth of revenue.
The mind-boggling amounts involved are well exemplified in a recent estimate that the global media industry alone stands to gain $1.3 trillion from 5G by 2025, not least because 5G will “unlock the potential of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)”. 14 The irony that the “connected” future is one in which dizzying profits stand to be made from technologies that disconnect us more and more from the real world is entirely missed.
The irony that the “connected” future is one in which dizzying profits stand to be made from technologies that disconnect us more and more from the real world is entirely missed.
The sums involved are sufficient to explain why the telecoms industry has for the last twenty-five years done its utmost to ensure that research into the health effects of wireless technologies produce negative or inconclusive results. Since 1993, the industry has financed a large number of studies, saving governments a great deal of expense and at the same time preserving the convenient illusion that the jury is still out on whether exposure to Radio Frequency radiation causes harm.
Earlier this year, The Guardian published an article citing research which showed that while 67% of independently funded studies found a biological effect of exposure to Radio Frequency radiation, only 28% of industry-funded studies did. Industry-funded studies are almost two and a half times less likely than independent studies to find health effects. 15 The authors of the Guardian article explain that the telecoms industry doesn’t need to win the scientific argument about safety, but simply keep the argument running indefinitely by producing studies with results that fail to verify, or even better contradict, the research that does find adverse health effects.
One of the most notorious is the mammoth, industry-funded “Interphone Study”, which managed to conclude that holding a mobile phone to the head actually protects the user from brain tumours!
One of the most notorious is the mammoth, industry-funded “Interphone Study”, which managed to conclude that holding a mobile phone to the head actually protects the user from brain tumours! This study, which is full of contradictions and suffers from grievous design flaws, is often quoted as the most authoritative to date, while it has in fact been thoroughly discredited. 16
Nevertheless, the impression is maintained that there is no scientific consensus, and so there are not sufficient grounds for action to be taken. Needless to say, this suits Government just as much as it suits industry. The Path to Total Immersion
Beyond the health effects there is another level altogether of what the roll out of 5G actually entails. To gain a perspective on this, we should remember that it was not so long ago that the Earth’s electromagnetic field was undisturbed by human-generated electromagnetic frequencies.
Before the 1880s, there were only two main causes of electromagnetism, both of them natural: the lightning of thunderstorms, which also set in motion the very weak, low frequency resonances known as Schumann Resonances, and sunlight. Lightning and sunlight produce effects in specific, and very limited, parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Beyond lightning and sunlight, the energies of the electromagnetic spectrum did not impact on human life, for they were entirely dormant
The very idea that such a thing as “electromagnetism” and an “electromagnetic spectrum” existed was not even entertained before the nineteenth century. And, from the point of view of the pre-electrical age, the truth of the situation was that they indeed did not exist as a factor of experience. Beyond lightning and sunlight, the energies of the electromagnetic spectrum did not impact on human life, for they were entirely dormant (fig.6). FIGURE 6: Natural background electromagnetic radiation, showing frequencies in cycles per second.
In that pre-electrical world, both lightning and sunlight were regarded with a certain degree of awe, as natural phenomena expressive of powers greater than anything human beings could muster. In antiquity both were associated with gods – lightning with violent storm gods invariably with Underworld associations, like Seth, Baal and Zeus; and sunlight with sublime solar deities like Ra, Shamash and Apollo. In the later Judaeo-Christian era the widespread sense that these phenomena had a spiritual source persisted, with lightning regarded as expressive of the divine wrath, and the light as the garment of the cosmic Logos.
We touch here a deeply felt relationship to nature that has been largely eroded in the centuries since the Scientific Revolution. In the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, both lightning and light were stripped of their spiritual numinosity, thereby clearing the way for an entirely materialistic explanation of light, and an entirely technological approach to electricity.
In the early days, the frequencies utilised were at the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the 1890s, the power lines that delivered the new mains electricity to factories and houses were standardised at either 50 or 60 Hz (or cycles per second). When public radio broadcasts began in the 1920s, they were mostly in the longwave frequencies under 500 KHz (thousands of cycles per second).
As the century wore on, the frequencies used by new and improved technologies became higher and higher. In the 1930s and ‘40s, medium and shortwave frequencies (between 500 KHz and 1700 KHz) were utilised, while in the 1950s the Very High Frequencies (VHF) of 30 – 300 MHz (or millions of cycles per second) were employed for both radio and TV broadcasting.
[W]ith frequencies of up to 70 GHz envisaged, yet more power will be required for effective transmission of its millimetre waves.
During World War II, a method was discovered for generating even higher frequencies, between 3 and 30 GHz (thousands of millions of cycles per second), which became the basis for radar. With each escalation in frequency, more power was required to transmit the radio waves. The advent of mobile phones, smartphones and Wi Fi, brought into widespread use the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) part of the spectrum (300 MHz – 3 GHz) for signal transmission.
Transmission in these frequencies demands more than ten times the power needed for VHF transmission. Today, poised at the threshold of the new era of an Extremely High Frequency “electronic ecosystem”, with frequencies of up to 70 GHz envisaged, yet more power will be required for effective transmission of its millimetre waves. 17 Then the natural environment will be fully saturated with an invisible fog of radiation (fig. 7). FIGURE 7: Human induced electromagnetic radiation, showing frequencies in cycles per second.
In this brief historical sketch, we see higher and higher frequencies forming the basis of each new technological innovation. As each one of the new technologies was introduced, human beings became a little more disassociated from the natural world.
Consider how this happened. From the 1890s onwards, the supply of mains electricity to homes, schools, hospitals and factories caused a revolution in living standards, liberating humanity from subservience to nature’s cycles of day and night, summer and winter, by giving access to a new source of light, warmth and power. Then, in the 1920s, radio enabled people to communicate over vast distances, and brought the voices of kings and politicians, singers and poets into our living rooms, even though they were not physically present.
In the 1950s, television intensified the experience of an absent yet present world, conveyed by the moving image. I remember as a child the addictive quality of television: one is drawn out of oneself and away from awareness of one’s immediate surroundings into the fascinating world of images on the screen.
Smartphone addiction both dislocates users from their own inner centre of stillness, and at the same time disconnects them from the natural environment.
With the advent of the smartphone, the trend towards addictiveness was greatly strengthened, partly because the screen became a portable interface with the Internet, and partly because of the deliberately exploitative policies of Facebook, Google and others to hook people into an addictive relationship to their devices. 18 Smartphone addiction both dislocates users from their own inner centre of stillness, and at the same time disconnects them from the natural environment.
5G will further accentuate this tendency for people to lose themselves, and it will weaken even more their relationship to nature, for it promises to make advanced immersive Virtual Reality accessible to all. While VR headsets have been commercially available for some time now, VR is still in its infancy. The next development in VR technology is to supplement the headset with a “haptic suit”, which enables the wearer to experience sensations of touch – pressure, warmth, hardness, softness, moisture and dryness – in virtual reality.

Such opportunities for “total immersion” in virtual reality will lead to an increasing confusion as to which world we really belong: the electronically generated or the natural world. The use of Augmented Reality, made possible through special helmets, electronic glasses, or contact lenses, that overlay virtual content onto the experience of the physical world, will add to the confusion, as the virtual is increasingly integrated within the real world. 19
People will become adjusted to regarding the virtual world as having as great a claim on their attention, their emotions and thoughts, as the natural world. The temptation will be to give their loyalty to that which not only undermines their relatedness to nature but also, through its assault on the imagination, has a corrosive effect on the inner life of the soul. The confusion will only be exacerbated by a huge increase in the use of 3D holographics that will give virtual entities the ability to incarnate electronically in the physical environment.

This is what the saturation of the world with extremely high frequency millimetre waves will enable. The waves themselves are only part of the issue: it is the technologies that ride on the backs of the waves and their impact on our inner life that should also concern us. The Formation of the Global Electronic Brain
But if 5G promises to radically alter the experiential world we inhabit in these ways, there is something further that we must understand if we are to grasp what is really being prepared. At the same time as increasingly sophisticated technologies increasingly disconnected human beings from the natural world, a network of electronic “intelligence”, global in extent, gradually emerged. At first it was under close human supervision, but it has steadily grown more autonomous.
…a network of electronic “intelligence”, global in extent, gradually emerged. At first it was under close human supervision, but it has steadily grown more autonomous.
Consider the difference between radio broadcasting and the Internet: the former is under tight human control and serves a very specific purpose, whereas the latter has established itself as a permanent, constantly available electronic infrastructure of undefined scope and reach. What has been happening over recent decades is the increasing co-ordination of intelligence- endowed machines, so that they operate without need of human supervision.
The efforts now underway to create a 5G electronic ecosystem are the necessary precondition for developing and perfecting a global Artificial Intelligence network, which feeds on the very fast transfer of large amounts of information. This global electronic “brain”, innocuously called the “Internet of Things”, is already impacting on our lives.
But the reality is that The Internet of Things is itself the precursor to what has been called the “Internet of Thinking”, in which human beings will find themselves having to live in relationship to the vast global electronic intelligence.
Through the Internet of Things, more and more things will be linked to the Internet and made “smart” by being given the ability to function autonomously. On smart motorways your car will drive itself while you, wearing your VR headset and haptic vest, play interactive computer games in the back seat; and in your smart house your fridge will autonomously order more eggs, milk and cheese for you via a wireless connection with a supplier.
But the reality is that The Internet of Things is itself the precursor to what has been called the “Internet of Thinking”, in which human beings will find themselves having to live in relationship to the vast global electronic intelligence. It will be active everywhere in our environment and we shall be obliged to interact with it in order to accomplish the simplest of tasks. 20 In the Internet of Thinking it is not hard to see the lineaments of an electronically supercharged totalitarian state, with unprecedented control over the minutiae of individuals’ lives.
The possibility of this happening will only be increased by the thousands of new mini phone masts and satellites irradiating every inch of the planet with millimetre waves. For this is what 5G means: it means putting in place not just an improved telecommunications system, but rather a new “system of systems”– the infrastructure of electronic totalitarianism. 21 A Curtain Drawn Against the Light
For this is what 5G means: it means putting in place not just an improved telecommunications system, but rather a new “system of systems”– the infrastructure of electronic totalitarianism. 21
As our world is increasingly smothered by a fog of radio waves, microwaves and millimetre waves, it may seem that the gods of the Underworld have taken hold of humanity in an ever- tightening grip, drawing us towards the false lights – the illusory lights of the hell-beings and hungry ghosts that the Tibetan Book of the Dead long ago warned against.
The electromagnetic energies that we have summoned, and which promised to give us new powers, now appear to be overpowering us , carrying us down into an Underworld realm of hellish entertainment and distraction, of illusion and disconnection from the reality that really matters – the reality of nature and the spiritual order that infuses nature, the reality of fellow creatures with whom we share our world, living in soil and sky and walking the Earth beside us.
The electromagnetic energies that we have summoned, and which promised to give us new powers, now appear to be overpowering us
We must ask: Does the Earth need an electronic ecosystem? Is it going to benefit in any way from being irradiated with millimetre waves? Is there actually any need at all for 5G? Can we even remotely conceive that 5G is the answer to any of the pressing ecological, social and spiritual problems that face us today? We stand at a dreadful threshold, and yet surrender to despair cannot be the right response. What can we do?
First of all we can protest! There are campaigns against 5G that we can join [see below -ed.] , there are petitions to sign, letters to write, and legal actions to support. The best place to begin is the “ International Appeal to Stop 5G on Earth and in Space ”, which has now gathered nearly 30,000 signatures [more than 50,000 now -ed.] , including those of many health professionals, environmentalists and other scientists. 22
But as well as protest there is something further that needs to be done, and that is to bring spiritually informed understanding to the deeper significance of the global electronic brain whose emergence 5G will hasten. To this end, we need to develop a clear perception of the moral quality of electricity, the better to recognise the kind of spiritual entity or entities that it serves.
[T]here is something further that needs to be done, and that is to bring spiritually informed understanding to the deeper significance of the global electronic brain whose emergence 5G will hasten.
This will empower us to break the spell that electricity and electronic technologies have cast over us, and it will enable us to form a more appropriate relationship to them. One of Rudolf Steiner’s most helpful insights into electricity was his observation that it is light in a fallen, degraded state – light that has fallen beneath nature into the sub-natural realm – and that is why we must actively guard against an ever increasing dependence on it, for it threatens to drag us down. 23
This points to a third thing we can do, which is really the foundation of everything else. It is to rebuild our relationship to the light, which in its selfless benevolence and purity greets us every morning, and which, unlike the false and illusory electronic lights that would lead us into the Underworld, beckons us in a quite different direction, towards our essential humanity.
It is to rebuild our relationship to the light, which in its selfless benevolence and purity greets us every morning
Through a deepened meditative relationship to the light, practised through the hours of the day and the seasons of the year, we can nurture a relationship to the inner light that is the source of all that is creative and good in the world. This inner light the Christian tradition knows as the cosmic Logos.
As the curtain of electrosmog is drawn across our world, we are presented with a sacred task that, come what may, we attend to all that the light has to give, for therein lies the divine Saving Power.
