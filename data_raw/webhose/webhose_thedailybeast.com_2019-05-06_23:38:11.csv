O n a bleak morning in the autumn of 2015, Peter Farquhar, a retired English professor and novelist, wrote in his journal that he feared he was spiraling into madness. The 66-year-old professor described his acute mental suffering as one of the worst days of his life. “I wanted to die,” he wrote in shaky cursive script on diary pages that were presented in a British courtroom this week . “I saw awful packs of hideous black insects.” He later confided in friends that he felt like Shakespeare’s King Lear, who had been cognizant throughout his own mental breakdown.
But what Farquhar didn’t know was that his 26-year-old live-in lover, Benjamin Field—who is now standing trial along with 31-year-old magician Martyn Smith for the professor’s murder—was doing some journaling of his own, chronicling how he gave the pensioner “drugs on toast.” Jurors heard that Field, a preacher’s son, also kept a precise list of messages he wrote and then wiped clean from the mirrors of the elderly man’s house to further cloud his state of mind.
On the morning Farquhar wrote that he wanted to die, Field had written that he had drugged the professor the night before with the hallucinogenic drug 2C-B, the effects of which had been amped up with a healthy dose of straight alcohol, according to the BBC . A few weeks later, in October 2015, Farquhar was found dead on his sofa with a bottle of spilled whiskey overturned on the floor.
The details of the sadistic manipulation Field and Smith allegedly carried out have been heard at a three-month trial that convened this week at Oxford Crown Court. The men also face charges of conspiracy to murder Ann Moore-Martin, described as “a fundamentally lonely” retired headmistress who lived two houses down from the not-exactly-nutty professor. She, too, was subject to the disappearing messages on her mirrors, many of which included Bible verses commanding her to leave her worldly possessions to Field.
The court was told that Farquhar met both men in 2011 when he guest lectured at the University of Buckingham, where they studied. Moore-Martin met the men through Farquhar, her neighbor one house down in the sleepy retirement community of Maids Moreton. “ The motive was financial gain laced...with a profound fascination in controlling and manipulating and humiliating and killing. ” — Prosecutor Oliver Saxy
The lead prosecutor in the case, Oliver Saxby, told the court on Wednesday that the main suspects had “a profound fascination in controlling and manipulating and humiliating and killing.” A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office confirmed the details of the evidence to The Daily Beast.
In addition to murder and conspiracy to murder, the men are charged with targeting the two elder townspeople and manipulating them to change their wills to leave them property and money, which victims both did.
Authorities say Smith, a professional magician, was also found with a copy of the will of99-year-old widow Elizabeth Zettl, who died before they were able to manipulate her.
Field and Smith have denied the murder of Farquhar and conspiracy to murder Moore-Martin, who died in 2017 at the age of 83. Field has admitted fraud by pretending to be in a “caring relationship” with the pair so that they would change their wills. He has also admitted burglary. Another man, Tom Field, 24, is also charged with fraud for pretending to need kidney dialysis, which Moore-Martin reportedly gave the men money to fund.
Field is accused of pretending to be gay to woo Farquhar, who had written at length in his journal about how he struggled with coming to terms with his sexuality. According to the evidence presented in court, Farquhar had written that he was deeply in love with Field and the relationship was cemented in a private betrothal ceremony in March 2014. “This is one of the happiest moments of my life,” Farquhar wrote in his journal that day. “Gone are the fears of dying alone.” The men bought a double bed as a gift to each other. Field also gave Farquhar porcelain figurines of the owl and the pussycat, evidently meant to signify that love can overcome even the oddest of couples.
The whole time Field was nuzzling up to the elderly professor, he was also engaged in a series of heterosexual relationships with women—all while allegedly seducing Moore-Martin next door with the help of Smith. The court was introduced to three of Field’s sexual partners who testified that they knew nothing of Field’s relationship with Farquhar or Moore-Martin. Extensive diaries that chronicle the men’s plans were found in the house of one of the women Field was sexually involved with. “ She spoke of them sharing a bed sometimes, of having a cuddle, of him occasionally being passionate...He was hoping she might have a heart attack, presumably. ” — Prosecutor Oliver Saxy
The court was also told that Field is alleged to have shown Moore-Martin, who had never been married, a soft-porn video about an older woman who took her own life after experiencing raucous sex with a much younger man she could never date openly. “She spoke of them sharing a bed sometimes, of having a cuddle, of him occasionally being passionate,” prosecutor Saxy told the London court on Thursday. “He was hoping she might have a heart attack, presumably.”
The evidence presented in the case so far, reported by various British press outlets , shows how Field allegedly had made a list of potential ways to kill off the elderly woman, including “heart attack - electrical device, dehydration, stair, sex?, in the bath?”
The list also listed suggestions including that she might overdose on her medications next to a rather cryptic reference to the local church tower. Saxby also showed a glossary of terms Field and Smith are accused of using when they discussed the case. In it, the word “hammer” was used as a reference to Farquhar passing out and “poteen” referred to the pure alcohol they allegedly used to ramp up the effects of the hallucinogens infused in the professor’s chocolate bars and spread on his toast. “Strap” was the word suffocation, according to prosecutors, who noted there were also references to “Flurazepam chocolate” among the notes shown to the court.
Before the trial adjourned for the weekend, the jury was told that the men had engaged in gaslighting, described as “a form of psychological manipulation when the perpetrator sows seeds of doubt in the mind of the victim so the victim ends up doubting their memory and sanity.” Field, often with Smith at his side, continually told Farquhar that he had left his phone in the fridge or that he had left his keys outside. The jury heard that Field also wrote a decoy diary he knew Farquhar would read in which he chronicled fabricated notes about the professor’s fictitious ailing state of mind. Farquhar wrote at one point in his own diary that he no longer trusted Field after what he’d just read, but that he simply couldn’t survive in his worsening state without him.
The trial is expected to wrap up in 11 weeks. Field and Smith are both scheduled to testify in their own defense."

A commercial plane carrying nearly 150 passengers went down into the St. Johns River near Naval Air Station Jacksonville on Friday night, sending 21 people to the hospital, authorities said.
The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office confirmed the incident in a tweet accompanied by photos of the plane stuck in “shallow” water, adding that the plane had not been submerged in the shallow water.
“Every person is alive and accounted for,” the sheriff’s office said, adding that none of the injuries were critical.
NAS Jacksonville said the Boeing 737 had been arriving from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay when it “slid off the runway” into the water. “Navy security and emergency response personnel are on the scene and monitoring the situation,” the naval station said. Local News4Jax reported that 142 people were on board the plane.
Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry had called on people to “pray” for the passengers when fire and rescue workers first arrived at the scene before firing off a flurry of relieved tweets once authorities announced all the passengers had survived.

The Scandalous Life of Marie Antoinette’s Versailles Apartments,www.thedailybeast.com,Erin Zaleski,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-scandalous-life-of-marie-antoinettes-versailles-apartments,"The Scandalous Life of Marie Antoinette’s Versailles Apartments Alain Jocard/Getty Open again after a three-year restoration, the goings-on in these posh suites are as steeped in mystery and scandal as the doomed queen herself. 05.03.19 11:23 PM ET
I f these (gilded) walls could talk!
Of the 700 rooms at the Palace of Versailles, among the most famous are the Queen’s Apartments, which include Marie Antoinette’s private chambers. Open again after a three-year restoration project to return the series of rooms to their former damask-covered glory, the apartments are now back open and attracting visitors in droves who come to gawk at the lavish silk tapestries and over-the-top rococo flourishes.
However, the centuries-old fascination with the frivolous French queen’s former stomping grounds goes beyond the ornate canopy bed and the large jewelry case with mother-of-pearl inlay that sits in an alcove beside it. The goings-on in these the posh suites are as steeped in mystery and scandal as the doomed queen herself.
These apartments were where Marie Antoinette, with the help of myriad staff, got dressed each day in stockings, garters, a tight corset, and layers of silk, topped off with clouds of powder and perfume. And, says the Revolutionary-era gossip mill, got undressed. Often. Love letters were written in these rooms (although not to the king), and there are also rumors of same-sex trysts with ladies in waiting, passionate romps with a young duchess, as well as numerous orgies. Not-so-affectionately known as “Madame Deficit,” the queen's excesses, legend has it, went beyond her flamboyant fashion sense and extended to the bedroom.
“…debauchery and agitation of passions were observed in Marie Antoinette's life,” an anonymous, circa-1783 pamphlet titled “The Historical Essays on the Life of Marie Antoinette of Austria,” reads. “Men, women, everything was as she liked. She was satisfied with everything. Marie Antoinette also was unfaithful to Louis XVI and fooled him too.”
Indeed, among the many scandalous rumors that dogged the queen during her reign was an alleged affair with her husband’s younger, better-looking brother, the Comte d'Artois, also known as Charles X. King Louis XVI was known to suffer from sexual dysfunction, and the intimate life between the king and queen was lackluster at best. Apparently, the two royals didn’t even consummate their marriage until seven years after their wedding, leaving the young queen famished for sexual attention. She is alleged to have quenched her desires in the arms of Louis’s brother, a rumored philanderer who enjoyed a close friendship with his sister-in-law. Just how close, has never been proven, however.
The king’s kid brother wasn’t the only one believed to have indulged in lusty interludes with the queen. Two of her closest female friends, the Princesse de Lamballe, and the Duchesse de Polignac, were rumored to have been more than friends. The queen met Marie-Thérèse-Louise de Savoie-Carignan, who would become the Princesse de Lamballe, shortly after her arrival in France. Widowed young after her husband’s death from venereal disease (you can’t make this stuff up), Lamballe became close with Marie Antoinette, who appointed her as superintendent of her household—a move that provoked jealousy among older, more experienced courtiers. Marie Antoinette referred to Lamballe as “mon cher cœur,” my dear heart, and the Austrian ambassador to the court of Versailles wrote in a letter, that “Her Majesty continually sees the Princesse de Lamballe in her rooms,” adding that he had “taken the precaution to point out to the Queen that her favor and goodness to the Princesse de Lamballe are somewhat excessive in order to prevent abuse of them from that quarter.”
So were they or weren't they? It’s important to remember that effusive demonstrations of affection weren’t unusual in friendships between young women in the 18th century, and there is no historical evidence that the queen and Lamballe were indeed anything other than close friends. The princess even had a reputation of being socially withdrawn and even prudish— not exactly the character of someone indulging in steamy Sapphic capers with her best friend. Nevertheless, she was regularly portrayed as Marie Antoinette’s lover in anti-monarchist propaganda of the time.
Whether friend or lover, Lamballe was soon cast aside for a new object of the queen’s affection: Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron, also known as the Duchesse de Polignac. De Polignac was presented to the queen at Versailles in 1775, and the queen, who was reportedly instantly smitten with her, invited her to move to the palace. The alleged romantic relationship between Marie Antoinette and Polignac was dramatized on the big screen in Benoît Jacquot's 2012 film, Farewell, My Queen , based on the novel by French author and historian, Chantal Thomas.
“Have you ever been attracted to a woman?” Diane Kruger's Marie Antoinette asks her servant, played by Léa Seydoux, in heated whisper. “To the point that you suffer in her absence?”
The film deviates from the book, which is more ambiguous in its depiction of their relationship, conveying an intense friendship between the two rather than a full-blown love affair. Chantal Thomas pointed out that even in the film the sexual relationship is ambiguous.
“Yes, they embrace,” Thomas, who describes their relationship in the film as a “passionate friendship,” told The Daily Beast. “But nowhere in the film are we shown the queen and de Polignac making love.”
Marie Antoinette was depicted as having sex with both the Duchess de Polignac and the Comte d'Artois in other mediums, however. Books, plays, and tawdry pamphlets that can best be described as political porn were clandestinely distributed among in the French public prior to the Revolution. A scene in one circa-1789 play, The Royal Orgy , describes l'Autrichienne having a threesome with the Comte d’Artois and Madame de Polignac, as the corpulent Louis XVI sleeps, oblivious to the debauchery around him.
Such libelles were common during pre-Revolutionary France as public anger towards the monarchy was reaching a boiling point. Stanford University keeps an online archive that includes the smutty cartoons depicting the queen in the arms of the Princesse de Lamballe, as well as in other compromising positions. Many contemporary historians agree that the pamphlets helped shape the image of the queen as a morally bankrupt sex fiend.
Of all the Versailles-related scandals, the queen’s affair with Axel von Fersen is among the most enduring, some even accepting it as fact. A dashing Swedish count, von Fersen is believed to have been Marie Antoinette’s lover throughout most of her reign. The two first met as teenagers at a masked ball at Versailles in 1774. Five years later he moved into the palace, and later divided his time between the court and his military duties.
“I have decided never to marry,” von Fersen wrote in a cryptic letter to his sister. “I cannot belong to the one person I truly want… So I prefer to belong to nobody.”
Even the Palace of Versailles has weighed in on their relationship, acknowledging on its official website that the friendship between the queen and von Fersen, “was the subject of much speculation,” adding that, while there is no solid proof of an affair between the two, “enough mystery persists to maintain the myth.”
Some historians would say otherwise, including Evelyn Farr, whose 2016 book, I Love You Madly , is centered on a trove of secret letters exchanged between the two, many of which had been written in code or invisible ink, or with sections blacked out.
“My dear and very tender friend—my God, how cruel it is to be so close and not be able to see each other!"" Fersen wrote to Marie Antoinette in 1791. “I live and exist only to love you; adoring you is my only consolation.”
The queen responded in kind in January of 1792: “I am going to close, but not without telling you, my dear and very tender friend, that I love you madly and never, ever could I exist a moment without adoring you.”
Perhaps even more telling is the final message she sent to von Fersen shortly before she met her fate at the guillotine. Delivered to von Fersen by a friend 18 months after the queen’s demise, the single line read: “Farewell. My heart is all yours.”
Despite these lovelorn lettres d'amour , there is nonetheless ongoing dissent among historians as to the true nature of their relationship. Some insist it was platonic, others argue that while the two may have had strong feelings for one another, the love was never actually consummated. Others point out the logistical issues such a clandestine liaison would have posed, including French historian Fanny Cosandey, who told The Daily Beast in a prior interview that she “didn't think it was possible for Marie Antoinette to have had an actual physical relationship with Fersen,” given how closely the young queen’s every move was monitored.
Farr’s book nonetheless suggests that two of the queen’s four children, Sophie and Louis-Charles were fathered by the count, not the king. And thanks to a secret room located just about Marie Antoinette’s private apartments, his amorous visits weren't as tricky to pull off as one might imagine. Farr even offers proof by way of a letter Quintin Craufurd, a friend of von Fersen’s, wrote to British Prime Minister William Pitt and Foreign Secretary Lord Grenville asking them for assistance in the royal family’s escape.
“I know him [Fersen] intimately, and think him a man of unquestionable honor and veracity,” Craufurd writes in a letter dated August 3, 1791. “This gentleman was Colonel of the Royal Suédois; was Her Most Christian Majesty’s prime favorite; and is generally supposed to be the father of the present Dauphin.”
What is perhaps most intriguing about the late queen is the dichotomy regarding her image. Depending on the book, blog post, message board, or Versailles-related film you encounter, she is either presented as ruthless profligate libertine, or a chaste, tragic, and deeply misunderstood figure—the country’s favorite royal scapegoat who didn’t warrant the cruel gossip or anti-royalist “political porn” that often made her a punchline. So which is it?
Even some historians admit that the scandalous rumors that continue to follow the queen are impossible to verify.
“There is no hard recorded proof that there were these affairs,” Lauren Pulzier, a New York-based librarian and historian who publishes a blog specializing in the 18th century told The Daily Beast. “She was very attached to the two women [Lamballe and Polignac], but there is just so much room for interpretation.”
“It was known that she wasn't haven't sexual intercourse with her husband until later in the marriage, so who knows? Maybe she was seeking gratification with her friends. It could be, but we just don't really know.”
Thomas said that the duality in Marie Antoinette’s own personality over the course of her lifetime also fueled the duality regarding her image.
“Up until 1789 before the death of her son, she was a rather superficial woman in search of pleasure and diversions,” she explained. “After 1789, she became someone with a serious, tragic, and courageous side.”
A campaign against the young monarch was launched shortly after her arrival at Versailles, Thomas said, which contributed to the destruction of her reputation. She was surprised, she said, by how much hatred was directed at the queen.
“Since her death a certain amount of justice has been done against this abominable image [of the queen,]” she said.
Puzier explained that the century that followed the French Revolution brought renewed interest in the queen, and portrayals of Marie Antoinette in books and essays took on a softer tone. The bloodshed was over, a new government had been installed, and public hatred of the royals had become passé. This renewed, less lurid curiosity about the queen, said Puzier, has continued to the present day.
""People hear the name ‘Marie Antoinette’ and associate her with a type of celebrity that has endured,"" she said.
Along with the ornate furnishings in the queen’s bedroom, there is also a secret door that came in handy on the evening of October 5, 1789. A thousands-strong angry mob had marched from Paris to Versailles and broached the entrance to the palace. A group headed straight for Marie Antoinette’s apartments. The queen escaped via the hidden door and made a run for it. Less than two years later, the royal family fled only to be arrested in Varennes. A couple of years after that Marie Antoinette met the guillotine in the Place de la Révolution (Place de la Concorde today).
Apart from a few minor adjustments, her private apartments are much as she left them. No other queen occupied Marie Antoinette’s room following her hasty departure, and as she fled what many historians believe is a gilded cage, France’s last reine left ostentatious grandeur, scandal, and seemingly endless intrigue in her wake."
"Luxury Brand Started Selling $6,000 Animal Costumes. Furries Are Furious.",www.thedailybeast.com,kelly.weill@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Weill),05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/furries-furious-at-luxury-brand-zweitesich-trying-to-sell-dollar6000-fur-suits,"Luxury Brand Started Selling $6,000 Animal Costumes. Furries Are Furious. Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photos via Zweitesich / Getty The subculture is suspicious of people trying to cash in on them. The latest hairball is over a high-end costume brand. 05.03.19 11:21 PM ET
H ollywood starlets wear Gucci. Sneakerheads buy Supreme sweatshirts . And now furries might have their own ultra-luxury brand.
That’s if the furry community will allow it.
When it launched last month, Zweitesich branded itself as the “world’s first designer fursuit brand” for people who dress up in anthropomorphic animal suits. The company’s aesthetic would have made a high-fashion brand proud. Zweitesich (German for “second self”) launched with a sleek website, where it sold anthropomorphic animal masks, each with a Louis Vuitton-style brand on the cheek. But furries aren’t conventional fashionistas. As parts of the fringe subculture creep toward the mainstream, the furry fandom is grappling with what it means to go commercial.
So almost as soon as Zweitesich launched, the company became the center of a catfight.
On Twitter, furries accused Zweitesich of being “insulting,” “fuckery,” and hopefully “just a social experiment.” One furry made a parody Zweitesich mask, covering their own wolf costumes in upscale logos.
The furries were responding to Zweitesich’s price tag (originally marked at $6,000, according to furry news site Flayrah ), the fact that buyers wouldn’t even receive a full-body fursuit, and Zweitesich’s claim to employ “designers” rather than “tailors.” Some furries interpreted the designer creds as a dig at other fursuit creators.
Looking back, Zweitesich's founder sees where it went wrong. Behind the company's flashy exterior was Albino Topaz, a high-profile fursuit maker, whose creations (like a lavender corgi) have sold for more than $8,000 . Like many in the scene, she goes by a pseudonym, which she ditched in favor of the brand name.
That's when the trouble began, she said. Furries took issue with the high-fashion stylings, assuming it to be the work of a larger company, rather than one artist.
""In my opinion, what seemed to set people off was the idea of a big corporation coming into the fandom and cheapening the hard work of individual artists,"" Topaz told The Daily Beast ""It’s a sentiment that I too, agree with. The Furry Fandom revolves around creativity and individuality, the idea of commercialization has a hard time fitting into that equation [...] When companies try to come in and make mass-produced fursuits (often stealing designs from existing artists/Fursuit-makers) it comes as a real kick in the teeth.""
Controversies like these are common in the subculture, Patch O’Furr, founder of the furry news site Dogpatch Press said.
“You see this pretty regularly. You’ll see somebody catch ire, everybody piles on them, and a month later it’s forgotten. I think this was a thing that wouldn’t matter to anybody else except furries,” O’Furr told The Daily Beast. “But I think it really struck a nerve. It really got to the root of this possessiveness that the subculture has about itself and what it built for itself.”
For decades, furries got no love in mass media, which cast them as weirdos. That outsider status became central to furries’ do-it-yourself spirit, O’Furr said. While historically nerdy pastimes like gaming and cosplay go mainstream, furries have largely escaped mass commercialization. Retail stores might sell Fortnite T-shirts, but they’re not ready to sell full-sized wolf fursuits.
But some of that fringe factor might be fading. Furries have become more common in popular culture, with brands as large as Disney appearing to wink at them. (The community hotly debates whether Disney’s Zootopia movie borrowed inspiration from furry culture.) “ If you want to get a full suit made, you have to spend a few hours basically mummifying yourself in duct tape. ” — Patch O’Furr
“Felix Croc,” who uses an orange crocodile avatar online doesn’t have a fursuit, but said he understood why fellow furries suspected Zweitesich was a mainstream brand trying to capitalize on furries.
“I think there was such a huge backlash because a) the fursuits were overpriced as hell, and b) furry has always prided itself on being weird and non-mainstream,” Croc told The Daily Beast.
“Many people saw Zweitesich as a way to try and make furry appeal to the influencers/upper crust of society, the kind who wear Gucci everything. You'll find that quite a few furries are outspoken socialists or communists and there are very few right-wing furries.”
There was also the matter of Zweitesich selling pre-made suits, as opposed to the custom suits furries covet. Fursuits often come from specialized designers, many of whom are furries themselves. Sometimes furries make their own suits.
Typically, O’Furr said, “if you want to get a full suit made, you have to spend a few hours basically mummifying yourself in duct tape to make what’s called a duct tape dummy. Then you have send that off. So this is not a casual, walk-into-a-store-and-buy-it thing. This is very much an interaction between an artist and a commissioner,” he said. It’s a very collaborative process. There’s a lot of love and personal investment in this, as well as the money.”
In a series of apologies online, Topaz said the campaign’s marketing materials were “poorly chosen.”
The branding problems began when she tried to hire non-furry to market the new brand, she said in a statement. “I was nervous about how this would go, and decided to hire someone who could create a sleek look that reflected my costume style in a professional way,” she wrote. “This was not meant to create a brand that would be considered elitist or exclusive by any means.”
On Twitter , her marketer apologized for having “forced her hand with the aggressive marketing in an attempt to get the brand to stand out from the fandom’s usual open arms inclusion.”
Topaz announced that she was putting the project on hiatus while she dealt with stress from the backlash. “In the end, these past two days have been completely devastating,” she wrote. “Waking up after these months of grueling work and knowing that people believe me to be this arrogant, pretentious jerk, is unfathomably crushing.”
Topaz is not the first person to experience this brand of backlash.
“There’s this odd dance between the subculture and the mainstream culture,” O’Furr said. When FurAffinity, the main furry social network, sold to Silicon Valley company IMVU in 2015, the community worried that venture capitalists would crush the site’s quirkiness. (It’s remained relatively untouched, O’Furr said.)
The conflicts can hit pillars of the furry community. Furry convention organizers sometimes get slammed for not registering the events as non-profits.
“I don’t think they’re really understanding that a for-profit convention is just another way of organizing that cuts out the paperwork that would have to happen for a non-profit,” O’Furr said. (Even conventions that claim to be non-profits are sometimes fudging their record. In 2017, a Colorado furry convention imploded over allegations that its founders misrepresented their tax-exempt status and allowed Nazi furries to run rampant.)
Even as furries plan outreach for their events, they worry about over-exposure, said Dralen Dragonfox, cofounder of Howl Toronto, a monthly club night for Canadian furries.
“Very recently there was some uproar about the billboards put up for FWA [Furry Weekend Atlanta], and not just in the context of rising ticket prices and paying DJs,” Dragonfox said of roadside advertisements for the upcoming furry event. “There was an undercurrent of ‘who exactly are they advertising to?’”
Furries might enjoy brief dips into the mainstream, but many also fear what they’ll lose if they go big. “There's a real fear that the very things we get hammered for (sexual diversity, sex positivity, plenty of PDAs) will have to be scrubbed or suppressed in order to gain ‘mainstream’ commercial acceptance,” Dragonfox said.
The brands may come, but the community isn’t going anywhere, O’Furr said.
“People got really upset about Walmart putting out Maskimals , fursuit costumes that were very, very cheap,” he said. “But I don’t think it’s any threat to fursuit makers because there’s none of this collaboration and unique personality being put into it.
“You can’t mass-produce that. You can’t mass-produce that relationship.”"
The Warriors-Rockets Playoff Series Represents Everything Wrong With Today’s NBA,www.thedailybeast.com,Corbin Smith,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-golden-state-warriors-houston-rockets-playoff-series-represents-everything-wrong-with-todays-nba,"opinion Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photos by Getty
Swedish directing legend Ingmar Bergman’s 1972 film, Cries and Whispers , follows two sisters, Karin and Maria, who, along with a nurse named Anna, are caring for their older sister, Agnes, as she slowly and painfully dies of cancer. Karin is brittle and closed off; Maria is flighty and manipulative; Anna is kind but reduced by her class; and Agnes is a paragon of suffering. In this vicious rendering, they and their dying sister are not a comfort so much as they are a trap—engineered to torment each other and draw out their worst selves whilst held hostage in a massive, red-roomed 18th-century mansion. To watch Cries and Whispers is to abandon the idea of “entertainment” altogether; to sit in front of a screen and bear witness to the horrors we can create sans outright violence.
The second-round playoff series the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors are currently playing is the Cries and Whispers of the NBA—a heap of unbelievably bad vibes radiating out of the television and poisoning its audience with despair. Its two teams, wretched for wildly divergent reasons, are fueled and poisoned by loathing for the other and for themselves. They’re duking it out with a brand of basketball that makes you wonder if modernity was a mistake—heaving up threes at absurd clips, driving at the rim constantly, jumping into contact and hoping the refs sort everything out. Moments of joy feel forced, hideous, grotesque, while the miasma of misery feels like the truth. It is today’s NBA laid bare, burnt and bleeding.
The Golden State Warriors are the suffering sisters . Kevin Durant, who came to the team in free agency two years ago and has won two straight Finals MVPs, is openly disappointed with the amount of happiness he’s wrung from the ultimate victory he’s been chasing all his life. Sources have him poised to leave the team at his soonest convenience, even though team ownership would cut off their fingertips to have him stay and help open the Chase Center, the hideous San Francisco monstrosity of an arena (Iit’s going to have courtside suites with literal butler service) that the Warriors will be moving to next year.
This open secret has sowed dissent in the locker room, creating an open rift between Durant and Draymond Green, and left the fan base grumbling about KD. Durant, for his part, either cares a lot or doesn’t care at all about this, he hasn’t quite decided. He has attached himself to a Svengali-like figure, Rich Kleiman, and begun doing lengthy interviews on podcasts where he talks about striving to exist outside of basketball. All he seems to know is that he’s not feeling the way he was supposed to when he left Oklahoma City, and he is looking for the solution to that. He’s still playing well—magnificently, even—but he’s doing it out of a sense of inevitability, because it’s what he’s supposed to do. “Anything less than total victory is seen as a defeat by observers, and, increasingly, themselves. It’s a losing game and it needs to end for the sake of everyone’s sanity.”
On the other side, the Maria to Durant’s Karin, is Steph Curry . Curry is also entertaining some outside projects, like producing a very un-Bergman-like film about how the power of prayer saved a boy from freezing to death, but he’s still out there taking long shots for the crowd, dancing, and just being joyous. However, even a passive observer may feel like something is…off. Watch him force superstar Rockets guard James Harden out of bounds in Game 1…and then proceed to gloatingly point at the boundary line, celebrating victory through technicality. This is monstrously unsporting. And look: I like a gloat, a hand to the ear, but…for an out of bounds? Celebrating the enforcement of the rules instead of some act of extraordinary athleticism or skill? What is even happening, man? Where is your head if you think this is cool?
Klay Thompson has been mostly pedestrian. Draymond Green has been weirdly excellent, occasionally looking like the only dude on the team who really wants a title instead of something else we can’t quite put our finger on—and probably won’t until dudes start writing tell-alls.
If Durant stayed, The Warriors would probably just keep winning titles for the next few years by virtue of being overwhelmingly talented. Shit, they will probably win this year. But they’re such a victory-or-bust enterprise, the most talented roster in the history of the league, that they’ve nearly stopped competing with opponents and begun competing purely for style points. Anything less than total victory is seen as a defeat by observers, and, increasingly, themselves. It’s a losing game and it needs to end for the sake of everyone’s sanity. Happiness cannot be found here—only disappointment.
Against the Clippers, a massively inferior but spirited squad who they managed to drop two games to, the Warriors were tired and stressed and old, and watching them get beat or play way too close was pretty damn fun.
But in this rematch with the Rockets, they have found their blaring, hideous red room. After a Game 1 loss that hinged on some debatable referee calls, the Rockets’ GM, Daryl Morey, almost certainly leaked a report his office put together last year: a referee audit determining—with the use of highly questionable methodology—that referee malfeasance cost them the Western Conference Finals in 2018. This is a prime loser move, thirsty and miserable, the only thing you could do to make yourself unlikable against an unbeatable team that is grinding through the motions, eye-rolling themselves to the trophy.
On one end, a superteam that can’t be beat by anyone but themselves; on the other, a cynical group of foul-seeking, three-jacking pirates, openly complaining that their foul-seeking isn’t being taken seriously enough. It’s a perfect modern NBA nightmare: a funhouse-mirror mutation of the Pistons-Pacers hellslogs from the mid-aughts, the bitterness of way-too-excellent defense replaced by the cloying sweetness of too-many-three-pointers offense.
Hopefully it’s the last one—for Kevin Durant’s sake. READ THIS LIST"

T o set eyes on Alfred Sole is to like him instantly.
He’s just welcomed me onto the Warner Brothers soundstage in Los Angeles where he works. At 75, Alfred is technically of retirement age, but he remains an in-demand production designer on popular television shows like MacGyver , Veronica Mars and Castle .
As I approach him, Alfred smiles broadly and extends his hand. He has a boyish face and a soft-spoken, warm manner. He’s of average height with salt-and-pepper hair. He’s like your friendly uncle, or your favorite person to sit next to at the neighborhood bar.
But looks can be deceiving, so I have to ask myself: Is this really the man who in the early 1970s was at the center of a national scandal about a pornographic film titled Deep Sleep ? A film he was rumored to have shot in his parents’ home in Paterson, New Jersey using a cast and crew made up of family and friends? And it wasn’t just those close to him who participated in the movie—it was alleged that many in his suburban town had taken part, including a local lawyer, banker, police officer and funeral home director. Hell, even the mayor's wife, high-school teachers, and Alfred’s mother were said to have been part of the erotic production.
What followed was one of the most notorious national prosecutions of adult film in American history.
Is this the man once described by the government as ‘Public Enemy Number One’?
As I sit across from Alfred today, his phone rings. It’s his ex-wife back in Paterson. She wants to know if the person wanting to talk about Deep Sleep has arrived. He gently tells her we’re about to start our interview, then proceeds to hold the phone away from his ear to protect himself from the volume.
It’s been 45 years since the film was splashed across the news, but Alfred’s ex has a loud-and-clear message for him: Say nothing. Nothing at all. No good can possibly come from re-visiting the past. Some stories are better left untold. The Origins of an Accidental Pornographer
Alfred Sole is a born-and-bred Jersey boy from Paterson, an industrial community of 150,000 residents, 20 miles west of New York City. He vividly remembers the Paterson of his youth in the 1950s.
The suburban city was a mix of working- and middle-class neighborhoods with clearly defined boundaries. There was the Italian enclave, and there was the Irish enclave. The wealthier families—all doctors and lawyers and mostly Jewish—lived by Eastside Park. The working-class Catholics—among which Alfred counted himself—mostly lived by the city’s landmark Great Falls of the Passaic River. Alfred was always curious about the wealth residing in Eastside Park, so much so that one of his main goals in high school was to date a Jewish girl. He went so far as to pretend he was Jewish because the girls he desired weren’t allowed to date outside their religion.
Alfred’s creativity extended beyond his ability to craft a suitable backstory. He had a love of architecture, design and fashion that he honed at the University of Florence in Italy and then used to open a fashion boutique in New York City after graduation. The business was a success, clothing celebrities of the day like Andy Warhol and Clive Davis in custom-made suits. But while Alfred was doing well, he was distracted by a dream—one that had been with him ever since he was a young boy.
Alfred Sole wanted to make movies.
As Alfred explained it, “I wanted to be a film director more than anything else in the world. For me, everything started from the love of movies. I used to go to the cinema all the time when I was a kid. My parents couldn't afford a babysitter so they would dump me at the theater at 10 in the morning and pick me up just before dinnertime. I devoured film magazines. To this day, if I don't get to a movie on a Saturday I feel uncomfortable.”
One day Alfred went out and bought himself a 16-millimeter Bolex camera. He started making short films, leaning on friends and neighbors in Paterson for help. They may not all have been the best actors or crew, but they were available and eager. And Alfred was prolific, working every free moment to realize his dream.
But sometimes dreams cost money. And while Alfred’s clothing boutique was doing well, it wasn’t doing fund-a-feature-film well. So during a regular card game he hosted at his Paterson home, Alfred turned to his friends for advice. He explained how he wanted to make a movie—specifically a Western—but he didn’t know how to fund it. The guys around the table began teasing him, spouting less-than-helpful ideas to raise the desired funds. Then one friend put forward a fateful suggestion: if you make a porno, I’ll give you five grand right now.
Alfred dismissed the offer, laughing it off as a joke. But soon others around the table piled on. And before he knew it, he’d raised $25,000.
“You want an X-rated movie? Alright, I'll make one if you’re serious about the money,” Alfred said.
They all replied yeah. Hell, yeah. “ These were all guys in their thirties. Playboy-reading, horny guys from New Jersey. But thanks to them, I now had the budget to make a film. ”
“The guys who threw in the money... one was a judge, one was president of a bank, and there was an accountant. These were all guys in their thirties. Playboy -reading, horny guys from New Jersey. But thanks to them, I now had the budget to make a film.”
Many investors in early porn films were motivated by the chance to turn a healthy profit. Gerard Damiano’s Deep Throat had just come out and the papers were filled with tales of the film’s earnings. With its simple story, accessible humor, and famous party trick, Deep Throat helped expand the audience for adult films from raincoat-clad middle-aged men to mainstream couples curious about—and titillated by—the hoopla.
The promise of profit was a motivating factor for Alfred’s card buddies, but Alfred remembers that they were spurred on by more prurient interests too. “They wanted to come to the casting sessions. They wanted to be on the set. It was that time period, you know? It was the sexual revolution. These were suburban guys with a little bit of cash, hearing about wife swapping and open relationships—and they wanted in. It was in the air in the 1970s.”
Alfred now had the financial support he needed, but he hadn’t a clue about adult films. He said he’d never seen one—and when Alfred tells you that, you believe him.
So he headed to Times Square for a cinematic education, and found himself judging the films in a way the average viewer might not. “I thought, God, these people don't wear makeup. They don't have good costumes. The sets look like shit. There's no plot, and no story. A guy takes a bag of groceries out of a woman’s hands and before you know it, they're doing it. Knock on the door, and she spreads her legs."" While he may not have started off wanting to make a porn film, Alfred was sure he could make a better one. Referring to Al Goldstein’s penis-shaped scale for rating adult films, Alfred said, “I want to get five stars on Screw magazine’s peter meter."" An eloquent example of aiming high. “ I want to get five stars on Screw magazine’s peter meter. ” The Making of ‘Deep Sleep’
Hoping to cash in on the success of Deep Throat, Alfred called his movie Deep Sleep . Then he set about writing the script.
“The story of Deep Sleep focuses on Harry, who is in love with his niece. One day he finds her having sex with some guy and in a jealous rage, shoots them both. In despair, Harry goes to his niece’s funeral and climbs into her coffin to have sex with her. After that, Harry can’t get it up anymore so he goes to the Maharishi Summa Cumma to learn how to enjoy sex again.
Alfred pauses, as if realizing the ridiculousness of it all: “Listen, it wasn’t a great plot but I was just trying to make it fun.”
With the story settled, Alfred set about casting his movie. As he watched films during his pornographic crash course, Alfred had seen the same faces popping up over and over—but had no idea where to find these people. So he put an ad in the local trade magazine Backstage , making clear he was looking for actors willing to have sex on film. Alfred wasn’t sure what he was going to get—or if he’d get any responses at all—but soon replies started pouring in.
“Boy, I saw some strange things. One guy called and asked, ‘Do you need anybody who can blow himself?’ I told him to come on down. I mean, I had to see that. The next day, a reasonably attractive man shows up and proceeds to put his money where his mouth is, so to speak. It was only years later I learned that he went by the name Dr. Infinity —for obvious reasons—and that he was a political activist who once tried to steal a copy of the Gutenberg Bible from Harvard University. You can’t make this stuff up.
“Then I got a call from a woman who called herself Honeysuckle Divine and said she did something to Tchaikovsky’s '1812 Overture.' She showed up with a tape recorder, a large container of talcum powder and a broom. She quickly disrobed, laid on her back, put a bunch of powder in her vagina and hit play on the tape recorder. Well, when the guns went off in the song, she emitted little puffs of smoke from down below. It made me proud to be an American.”
Finally, Alfred met Kim Pope. Like Alfred, Kim had grown up in New Jersey. She began acting as a child, playing Snow White, Becky Thatcher, and walking down the yellow brick road more times than she cared to remember. After moving to New York as a young adult, Kim answered an ad for an adult film. She had no qualms about having sex in front of the camera. Kim wasn’t shy about her body and thought porn would be a great way to learn about filmmaking.
In addition to being a petite and attractive blonde, Alfred remembers Kim as a talented actor and extremely kind. He knew right away that he wanted her to play Harry’s niece.
Kim had a similar response to Alfred. When asked about meeting him for the first time, Kim said, “My first impression was that he was a very nice guy, very sincere. I think Deep Sleep was his first film and he really wanted to do a good job, within the limitations of a minuscule budget and a short shooting schedule. It was all really sweet, and I liked him very much so I was on board."" “ Boy, I saw some strange things. One guy called and asked, ‘Do you need anybody who can blow himself?’ I told him to come on down. ”
For the male leads, Alfred leaned on local actors. The part of Harry was played by Joseph Rose, a Shakespearean hopeful on the fence about participating in an adult movie. A local muscleman named Anthony DeMarco, who played Kim’s boyfriend, had no such qualms about appearing in a porn film.
While there was no doubt that Deep Sleep would be marketed as an adult film, Alfred didn’t give much thought to the fact that he was making a pornographic movie. For him, Deep Sleep was simply a chance to be involved in making a real film: “I never saw it as a porno. I mean it was X-rated and, yes, people had to fuck and do all this other stuff, but I just never saw it that way.”
Lead actress Kim Pope had similar feelings about adult films. And while she never had a problem making them, she did worry her participation might damage her acting career down the road. But she justified her involvement by telling herself these films weren’t going anywhere. They’d play in scuzzy theaters in sleazy neighborhoods like Times Square, nobody would see them, and then they would disappear. It never occurred to her that one would stick around.
It's easy to dismiss Alfred and Kim’s justifications in today’s age of streaming video and reissued films, but in the early 1970s the future landscape was far from clear. Many aspirational filmmakers—including Barry Sonnenfeld, Wes Craven and Francis Ford Coppola—worked on sex films as a way of learning about the business. And you could often find crew members who worked with established directors like Woody Allen picking up extra money on the sets of porn films.
But those were already reasonably seasoned film participants. Alfred Sole had no idea how to make a porn film. To be honest, he didn’t know much about making any kind of film. Kim Pope picked up on this straight away. “As we got into things, it became very evident that none of these people had ever made a film before. Alfred had roped in his buddies and neighbors, and they were having a great time. But they were not pornographers—these were suburban, very straight people. It felt like middle America. Go to the next PTA meeting and look around the room—that's who these people were.” “ These were suburban, very straight people. It felt like middle America. Go to the next PTA meeting and look around the room—that's who these people were. ”
It was truly a homegrown affair. Just like when he'd made films as a kid, Alfred asked his friends and neighbors to help out behind the scenes and on screen as extras. And as he started shooting in Paterson, New Jersey in the summer of 1972, Alfred was in heaven. “The idea of making a movie—just the idea—with lights and cameras and actors was my dream. When I opened the door to my house for the crew to enter, it was the most exciting day of my life.""
Along with those offering their support was Alfred’s then-wife—the same woman now warning Alfred not to speak about Deep Sleep . She worked with Alfred’s mother to organize the production, prepare meals for the crew and generally help out any way she could. The one area she and Alfred avoided discussing was the hardcore sex. When asked why, Alfred answered “The sex stuff wasn't the fun of it. The fun was making the movie.”
Alfred understood that some of his cast and crew wouldn't be comfortable around a hardcore film shoot. So he shot all the non-sex scenes first, then went back to film the required sex. This division made it easier for many of Alfred’s friends and family to turn a blind eye to the fact that Deep Sleep was, in fact, an adult film.
The few professionals whom Alfred hired weren’t adult film veterans either, and they approached the shoot with a mix of curiosity, trepidation and excitement. Joseph Friedman was hired as the cinematographer—and it was his first time on a porn set. He had reservations about working on an adult movie but was desperate for film experience. Actually he had one even bigger concern. “I guess the greatest fear in your mind is that you're going to walk around with this constant erection and have to sit down a lot to hide what's going on” Joseph admits. “But the reality is that it is the most unsexual thing you could possibly imagine to witness. It's like bolts going into nuts.” “ The sex stuff wasn't the fun of it. The fun was making the movie. ”
Alfred’s lack of experience filming sex may have contributed to the shoot’s unerotic atmosphere. He struggled with how to direct the performers, explaining “I didn’t know how to talk to these people. The first day I thought, what do I say? Put your penis in her vagina? But by day three I was like OK, come on. We have a deadline.”
He may have gotten used to it, but questions like “Did we get the cum shot?” and terms like “chopped meat” never became second nature to Alfred. He found filming the sex scenes completely strange and numbing. And this experience didn’t end on set either—during the production Alfred found himself utterly devoid of any sexual desire in his private life too.
Actress Kim Pope also found the sex on adult films far from arousing. She was playing a role and focused on providing a realistic experience for the audience, not to mention trying not to kick the cameraman in what were often close quarters.
The shooting schedule for Deep Sleep was hectic. It was made all the more difficult by some of the locations Alfred wrote into the script, including a funeral home. Alfred had helped a friend design the business a while back and was looking for a favor in return. To save on set design costs, the funeral director allowed Alfred to shoot between services, taking advantage of the flowers and other trappings mourners had arranged for their loved ones.
“I remember it was like the Keystone Kops” Alfred said. “There were two funerals going on that day. I stole the flowers from one funeral. We took the body out of the coffin. We had to move fast because we had to be out in a couple hours. It wasn't treated disrespectfully, but... we had to get these two people fucking in a coffin real quick, you know what I mean? It was crazy.”
The strange circumstances weren’t lost on the crew. Cameraman Joseph Friedman remembers, “I walked into the funeral parlor and exclaimed ‘Alfred, you did a great of job setting this up.’ He said, ‘Oh, no, no, no. This is a real funeral that's going to take place at five this afternoon and we need to be done before they come in.’ I asked done with what and Alfred answered ‘the scene where Kim is in the casket and Harry gets in and fucks her.’"" “ It wasn't treated disrespectfully, but... we had to get these two people fucking in a coffin real quick, you know what I mean? It was crazy. ”
As usual, Alfred carefully separated the filming of sex scenes from the rest of the film: “I filmed my whole family crying in front of the coffin. My mother was in the scene. My aunt was in it. We even had the mayor's wife in it. Then we made them leave, and brought in Kim and Joe Rose to have sex in the coffin.”
But few other scenes were as sad—and many were downright funny. Alfred breaks into peals of laughter as he describes a scene with a character named Dr. Dicktor. As part of a thorough medical examination of an attractive young woman, the good doctor places a tongue depressor between her legs and asks her to cough.
Less humorous were performance issues afflicting some of the male actors on set. Local performer Anthony DeMarco was particularly affected. Kim Pope remembers trying to bolster the actor’s confidence as she and Alfred waited for what seemed like hours while Anthony tried to arouse himself. “Alfred had warned me that he’d never been in an adult film before and that he was very nervous. It's very hard for the men. So I said, ‘Don't worry. I'll calm him down. I'll walk him through it.’ But he was scared to death.”
Some of the seasoned adult stars had performance issues too. “I didn't know porno stars could come to work and not get an erection. But it was a daily problem, and after a while my politeness went away,” Alfred said. “If someone couldn't get an erection, I was like a madman. I remember having a temper tantrum, screaming, ‘Hey, you've got to get it up here. This is costing me a lot of money. You guys are paid to get a hard-on. You came to me bragging that you have the biggest dicks in the world, and now you can't get them up?!’ At one point I actually used a friend who was visiting the set to stand in for one of the porn guys. So if you watch the scene, you'll see the pubic hair goes black, blonde, black, blonde. To this day, the guy’s wife doesn't know that it was actually him that was screwing on film.” “ To this day, the guy’s wife doesn't know that it was actually him that was screwing on film. ”
For the last day of shooting Alfred and the crew descended on a stately home, a location he’d wanted to use all along. He didn’t have a permit, but decided to take his chances. “We just grabbed the shot. Most of our stuff was grabbed. It was low-budget filmmaking, guerrilla filmmaking. I only found out later that the house belonged to an archbishop in the Catholic Church.
“As we wrapped that day I remember being satisfied with how it had all turned out. The filming had gone very well. We were pretty much on schedule and had got most of our desired shots. So I sent everyone home and prepared for post-production, which is where the hard work really comes in.” The Premiere
Like filming, editing went smoothly for Alfred. When he was done cutting the film, Alfred decided he wanted to commission some original music. So he turned where anyone would turn in those circumstances—to his wife’s 16-year-old cousin.
Butch Taylor spent most of his teenage years down in the basement with friends playing guitar, bass and drums and making recordings. They had a band—and now an opportunity for a professional gig. It would be unpaid, but it would be their first big shot.
The problem was, Butch and his friends legally weren’t old enough to watch a porn film. Alfred made an exception and screened his film for the band. Kim Pope joined them because she wanted to see the edited work as well. As they sat viewing the movie, Butch had the urge to compliment her on her acting, but was unable. It was the first time he’d seen anyone have sex, and he was struck speechless. Butch and his friends wound up re-watching the film over and over in the basement as they wrote and played the accompanying music.
With editing and sound mixing complete, Alfred was ready to look into distribution. It was time to find out whether Deep Sleep was good enough to show in Times Square. Two theater owners dominated the grindhouses of 1970s New York. One was Chelly Wilson, a Greek immigrant who found success in Times Square real estate. Alfred remembers taking the film to screen for Chelly. “She was a really interesting lady. She started by telling me how she came from Greece and first had a pushcart that she sold hotdogs from, then used her earnings to get on the real estate ladder. She was a really successful woman by this point, so I was really nervous. As I screened the movie for her, she sat chain-smoking and talking to another woman in Greek. She occasionally cackled with laughter which I took as a good sign. “ I wanted my name on it...I made a movie, and I didn’t care if it was X-rated or not. It’s like an artist who signs his name at the bottom of a painting. ”
“Then at a certain point she said, ‘No more’—and that signaled the end of the screening. She told me the movie was great, but then gave me a list of all the things I’d need to change in order for her to exhibit it. These were the rules of making porno in the 1970s, and to get distribution you had to meet them: You had to have a certain number of cum shots and make sure you showed the man pulling out to finish. You had to have at least one lesbian scene. It was basically all the stuff I had cut out because I found it too crude. So I went back and added the hardcore shots back in, and then we secured distribution.”
When finalizing the film credits, Alfred respected the wishes of friends and family who chose to remain anonymous. But as for himself, Alfred didn’t want to hide. “I wanted my name on it. Maybe it was in part an ego trip, but I believed in the film and didn’t think I’d done anything wrong. I made a movie, and I didn’t care if it was X-rated or not. It’s like an artist who signs his name at the bottom of a painting. I signed my name on the bottom of this painting in my life. It was a labor of absolute love.”
When Deep Sleep was finally released, Alfred was the proudest person in Paterson. He remembers standing in front of a local cinema marquee showing his film and feeling like a kid in a candy store. As he stared beaming with pride, more and more people showed up to see the movie. Soon enough there were long lines. It seemed to Alfred like all of Paterson was there to see his film and the theater owner pretty much confirmed it. He told Alfred Deep Sleep was out-grossing The Poseidon Adventure , selling out every night. “ He could hear people whisper things like, 'That couch they’re fucking on!? I can’t believe I’ve sat on it so many times.' ”
But not everyone was able to see the film. When soundtrack composer Butch Taylor and his high-school friends tried to get into the theater, they were stopped cold at the box office. Butch showed the cashier his school ID to prove that his was the name on the film poster behind her, but the response was still a hard no.
Still, other people who had helped out on the film were able to see it—and to many it was a bit of a shock. While from the beginning Alfred had told them that there would be hardcore sex in the movie, seeing it was believing. Alfred recalled being at the theater and literally seeing mouths drop open. He could hear people whisper things like, “That couch they’re fucking on!? I can’t believe I’ve sat on it so many times.”
The buzz continued outside of the theaters. Alfred recalls going to a friend’s wedding and hearing a couple of guys talk about him while he was relieving himself in the men’s room. They seemed to be fighting over who knew Alfred best. And Alfred was enjoying it. “I remember I felt a little bit like a celebrity. I was proud. And it was fun.”
Little did Alfred know that events were about to take a sharp turn. Everyone’s a Critic
While Deep Sleep continued to perform well at the box office, the film started attracting attention for the wrong reasons. And one man in particular took an interest—his name was John T. Niccollai.
Niccollai had recently been appointed first assistant prosecutor for Passaic County. When he started the job, he got into the habit of personally going through all the mail that came in from residents. He considered it to be like taking the community’s pulse. Even though the county is so close to New York City, he found Paterson a much more conservative environment.
In the fall of 1972, concerned citizens began contacting the prosecutor’s office about a local film that was being shown, and Niccollai said the volume of complaints quickly grew into an avalanche. Some protests came from residents that only heard about the film once it hit the theaters, others from people who had actually been part of the film but had no idea it was going to be so explicit. But perhaps the straw that broke the prosecutor’s back was when members of the clergy began contacting his office, outraged that the archbishop’s house had been included in such a cinematic abomination.
For Niccollai, it all led to one conclusion: “If you make it easy for people to do things that are offensive, you're going to attract similar people to the jurisdiction. It’s going to cause other people to come in and make this type of movie here.”
When Alfred caught wind of the fact that the prosecutor’s office was looking into his film—all thanks to complaints from the Catholic Church—he was furious: “Niccollai wasn't spurred on by community complaints. My film was shown in theaters where many other X-rated movies had played before. He was solely motivated by the church because I had supposedly insulted the bishop. And if you think about the history of the church and what it's done to mankind, it's really incredible. The church has done a lot more damage in the name of God than I did with my tiny little film in Paterson, where people paid money to see and enjoyed it.”
Members of the church decided to protest the film. They formed a human chain in front of the most popular theater in Paterson to prevent people from seeing Deep Sleep . Those who made it through were greeted by protesters shaming them as they came out—all caught by local news cameras covering the demonstration.
Soon there were warrants out for the arrests of those responsible for the film, and well as for those that appeared in it. Kim Pope remembers the first time she heard about the trouble when she called home to let a friend know she was on her way: “My friend said, ‘Don’t come home. The FBI is on our doorstep and they’re looking for you.’ I asked him if he was sure it was me they wanted as I couldn’t think of any reason they’d have for talking to me. I even laughed, telling him obviously they’ve got the wrong person. But he said ‘Kim, this is serious. There have been two agents on our doorstep for three days round the clock, just waiting for you.’ So I went to stay with some friends and figure out what the hell was going on. It took about a week to learn that the reason for their interest was the film I’d shot in New Jersey. I was facing up to 28 years in prison for a selection of some truly bizarre charges.”
And bizarre the charges certainly were, because it was actually pretty difficult to prosecute someone with making a pornographic film in 1972. This was a year before the Supreme Court case ‘Miller v. California’ established what came to be known as the ‘Miller Test’ to determine if a work was obscene. The only recent precedent Niccollai had to go on was a 1964 Supreme Court decision where the lead justice famously said about obscenity, “I know it when I see it.”
So if Niccollai was to be successful, he needed to get creative: “I knew that if you spend some time in a law library, you're always going to be able to find something that is compatible with the course of action you want to take. So I went into the library, did a lot of research, and came up with something that would help us get the film out of our county.”
To find his legal weaponry, Niccollai went back in time—to 1796 to be exact. He found an anti-fornication law from the 18th century that was technically still active in New Jersey. It was an ancient statute prohibiting people from having—and in some cases even thinking about—sex.
Kim Pope couldn’t believe what she was hearing when she finally learned what she was being prosecuted with. “I was charged with fornication, conspiracy to fornicate, acts of carnal indecency, conspiracy to commit acts of carnal indecency and, I swear to God, private lewdness. These were old, old laws that had been around for hundreds of years, and nobody had ever bothered to take them off the books. I mean, if you enforce those laws, then every person over the age of 12 would be in jail. I don't know anybody that hasn't conspired to fornicate, whether they succeeded or not. It was just so absurd I thought they had to be kidding.”
To be fair, Niccollai saw the absurdity in the laws too. He understood that prosecuting everyone who engaged in intercourse outside of marriage was a ridiculous thought: “I'm not going to sit here and tell you that in my tenure as first assistant prosecutor, we initiated thousands of prosecutions for adultery or fornication. We didn't. But the fact is the laws were on the books and we knew we could use them. Is that a problem with our system? Maybe. This was my introduction to the power of the prosecutor.” And Niccollai aimed that power at Deep Sleep .
The next step for the prosecution was to get information that tied Deep Sleep to the filmmakers. So Niccollai obtained a search warrant for Alfred’s house and, accompanied by a slew of assistants, made his way over.
“When they raided my house, that was scary” Alfred remembers. “It was like a B-movie. They knocked down my door, and they went through everything. They tore up the sofa. They trashed my house. They came at me like I was this super-criminal. They were grabbing everything and anything.”
Niccollai walked away from Alfred’s house with some photo stills of the film being made and several artifacts, including a whip he was convinced was used in the movie. Niccollai took this evidence to a grand jury and was able to get the indictments he sought.
Alfred quickly reached out and warned those that had helped him on the film. First he called cinematographer Joseph Friedman and suggested that if he had an address book with information about anyone connected to the film, he should get rid of it. Then Alfred called Butch Taylor and other family members to let them know that the movie was being investigated. Finally Alfred called friends who had helped him out on the production.
Every time he made a call, Alfred was met with fear and sometimes anger: “It became a witch hunt and got really scary. They were after everybody. It became this small town where people were afraid—afraid for their careers and their livelihood. And I felt incredibly guilty. You know how people will do anything to make a movie? Well, I did anything to make a movie, and along the way I betrayed their friendship. I didn't do it intentionally. I just had no idea how crazy things would get.”
Alfred questioned Niccollai’s motivations. He was convinced Niccollai was going after Deep Sleep to make a name for himself. Because prosecutors are elected officials, Alfred was sure Niccollai was just thinking about his future, not about protecting the community. Niccollai flatly denied this, stating that he was just doing his job and meeting his obligation to serve the people he represented.
At first Alfred entertained the idea of a plea bargain. He had the fate of friends and family to consider: “Do you know how many phone calls I got, people saying to me ‘Look what you've done, you've ruined my life.’ Friends were afraid for their professions and their families. Some of the investors... their wives didn't even know that they had backed the film. There were six school teachers involved, including my wife, who could lose their licenses. My funeral director friend could lose his license and his livelihood.
“I had an Italian mother-in-law who came to hate me, and wanted to have me killed by the Mafia. I had ruined her daughter, I had ruined the family name. I mean, you'd think I’d killed the pope...But like everyone else who had worked on the film, [most of my wife's family] had been really excited while we were making Deep Sleep ... Now [they were] afraid ... but I understood [their] fear.”
But Alfred believed in the freedom of expression. As long as nobody is harmed, he felt this freedom was critical to being an artist: “You can't tell an artist what to say or do. Even if an artist comes into a room and shits on the floor, he’s free to do that, and that's what's good about this country. We think we have that freedom. We don't, but we think we have that.”
Kim Pope was also convinced they shouldn’t back down. She was absolutely indignant about the charges brought against her, and perhaps young enough at the time to not fear potential repercussions: “I wanted to take the case to trial. There was absolutely no way I was settling. I was not going to be intimidated. Certain conservative elements were absolutely hysterical over the sexual revolution, and everything that meant, and they were desperately trying to put the lid back on Pandora's box. Who made them the moral center of America? They had no right. If you want to go and see an X-rated film, then that should be your choice. I personally don't like violence in films, but I will defend your right to make one.”
So Alfred and Kim decided to fight. See You in Court
On the first day of the trial, a large group of protesters gathered outside the courthouse to defend the pornographers. They were organized by Alfred Sole’s mother, who hadn’t seen Deep Sleep but was convinced that Alfred hadn’t done anything wrong. She developed the “Free Alfred Sole” campaign, bumper stickers and all. She even brought picket signs and handed them out to those that gathered.
Alfred was determined to come to court with his head held high, and arranged a big media entrance for Kim Pope. He had a limousine bring her to the trial and Kim wore the shortest mini-dress she could find. “We wanted to embarrass them” Kim explained. “If they had the nerve to pull out these totally ridiculous charges, we were going to let people know about it. We were not going to slink in the back door.”
Niccollai was somewhat taken aback by all the commotion: “I had never seen anything like it in my life. It was like a Hollywood premiere. There were all kinds of media members covering it, and police, and just loads of people. You couldn't find a place to park, you couldn't stand in front of the courthouse. And if you saw the way the star of the movie came dressed, it was obvious she wasn’t going to the confessional.”
The trial became a cause célèbre, making all the news programs as well as the late-night TV show circuit. But inside the courtroom, the atmosphere was different. Kim Pope saw it as a kangaroo court where the outcome was decided before the trial had even started: “Oh my God, there was no justice. I was so disillusioned, and I started to be nervous, because I realized that truth and justice and common sense had nothing to do with the outcome. It was very corrupt—and very frightening.”
As court appearances became more and more frequent, there was no end in sight. The case could drag on for years, and Alfred and Kim’s attorneys believed they knew why. They thought that the prosecutor’s plan was to wear the defendants down, and let their costs continue to rack up. The fees could easily grow into hundreds of thousands of dollars, and Alfred and Kim just didn’t have that kind of money. Their lawyers worked on a deal which would have them plead guilty to disorderly conduct. All they would have to do was to admit their guilt in court and pay a fifty dollar fine.
Alfred and Kim were on the verge of taking the deal, when things suddenly got a whole lot worse.
It started when Alfred received a phone call from United Press: “The journalist asked me if I knew that I’d just been indicted for interstate transportation of pornography. I put down the phone and thought, ‘What the fuck is going on?’” Alfred was in disbelief because he’d been very careful to only show Deep Sleep in New York and New Jersey theaters. Even a newbie like him knew that distributing pornography across state lines was a federal offense.
But somehow, a stolen print of Deep Sleep had turned up in an Oklahoma City theater, hundreds of miles away. Alfred thought he was being framed: “I remember that when the movie first opened, a theater owner in New Jersey called us to say his print was stolen—and he needed a replacement. I thought it was a little bizarre that someone would steal the film, but didn’t give it much thought.
“I put two and two together when I got a second call telling me that FBI agents had been in an Oklahoma City theater and had busted the film there. We never booked a print in Oklahoma. This was the stolen print. I was being set up by Niccollai,"" Alfred said. His lawyers even suggested that Niccollai had made several trips to Oklahoma. ""We were totally set up. And now the stakes were really high.""
Today Niccollai recalls some communication between his office and Oklahoma City, but claims he can’t recall the exact nature of the exchange. He states that if he was asked for help by another jurisdiction, he absolutely would have provided it. But he flatly denies ever setting foot in Oklahoma or trying to frame Alfred.
What did come out of Oklahoma was a minute-by-minute report of what the FBI agents saw in the theater the day the film was busted:
To: Acting Director, FBI
Re: Deep Sleep, pornographic motion picture
Starting at approximately 2pm on January 21st, 1973 Special Agents [redacted] and [redacted] began viewing a movie entitled Deep Sleep showing at the Centre Theater in Oklahoma City.
At approximately 2:23pm, there was a scene in a doctor’s office which showed a nude female on the examining table with her legs spread apart. The doctor inserted his finger into the woman’s vagina and began massaging her for several minutes.
At approximately 2:40 PM, a scene was observed wherein what appeared to be a candle shaped to the form of a penis was used to stimulate a nude female in the vagina.
At approximately 2:41pm, a scene was observed wherein a nude female was performing fellatio on a nude male.
At approximately 2:46pm, the male ejaculated on a piece of glass.
At 2:49pm began a long scene in which a nude female begins to massage a nude male who is lying in a hammock.
At approximately 2:55pm, the male climaxes on her face and chin.
At approximately 3:12pm, a scene showed a female performing fellatio on a nude male.
The movie concluded at approximately 3:15pm.
The higher stakes meant that the news headlines about Deep Sleep graduated from the local to the national level, and now Alfred Sole was terrified. He understood that a federal charge meant that the potential punishment was significantly more severe. And the controversy also kept the spotlight on his family and friends—who desperately wanted to move on.
It was a stressful time. A cross was burned on Alfred’s front lawn so the cops assigned a round-the-clock watch on his house. And then there was the fate of local actor Anthony DeMarco who had played Kim Pope’s boyfriend. When the federal charges came to light, DeMarco committed suicide. Details of his motives were sketchy, but Alfred felt the two were connected: “I was walking on eggshells. I never knew when the phone was going to ring with more bad news. Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, it kept getting worse. And worse.”
Eventually the federal trial date was set and Alfred and his friend—one of the film's producers—traveled to Oklahoma. “As we made our way to the airport [he] said to me, ‘I’m married, I have two kids, my whole life could be ruined in just a few days. What are we going to do?’ I didn't have an answer for him.""
""It was a hostile environment in Oklahoma. The local paper reported the story about a Dago and a Jew, two pornographers, coming to town. That’s what they called us in the paper—a Dago and a Jew. I read that and thought, Holy shit. We’re in serious trouble.”
After several days in court, the trial was abruptly ended after some back-room plea-bargaining. The judge suddenly dismissed the case, giving Alfred a one-year suspended sentence, a $2,500 fine for each count, and a two-year probation period during which Alfred was banned from making any films.
While Alfred hated the idea of not fighting for his artistic rights, he explained his decision with resignation. “I got scared. I thought the whole world was falling in on me.”
“As we were leaving the courtroom, a clerk had a print of Deep Sleep in his hand and said, ‘Hey! Your film is great. We’re going to play it at our Christmas party!’
I thought, “Fuck you.” I was not amused. I mean, Jesus Christ, this is our system? This is the great American justice system?”
Alfred had one final surprise when he returned home from Oklahoma. He got a phone call from the local paper letting him know there had been a formal ceremony at his neighborhood Catholic church excommunicating him. Alfred’s only thought? He couldn’t believe he had that much power. Legacy of a Sex Film
As for the money Deep Sleep made—and there was quite a bit thanks to the film’s success—Alfred never saw any of it. In accordance with court rulings, the government confiscated all proceeds along with any prints of the movie.
But despite all the distress associated with Deep Sleep , Alfred credits the film with his subsequent success in life. It allowed him to make his next movie, the cult anti-Catholic horror film Alice Sweet Alice , featuring a young Brooke Shields. And that lead to other films and eventually a career in Hollywood where he still works today.
As Alfred explains, “It gave me my dream. I made a film that led to other films. And what Deep Sleep taught me was to continue making movies the way I wanted, no matter what anyone else said. It gave me the drive and confidence that I needed. Ever since then when I get home from work every day I look in the mirror and ask myself if I was as creative as I could be that day.”
As for John Niccolai, he also views his experience with Deep Sleep as a success. “I think we did what needed to be done, and we did it as effectively and efficiently as we could under the circumstances. We managed to get a result when no one else was getting results. We found an avenue to restrict something that was not in the best interest of the community. We weren't looking to put people in jail for 20 years—we wanted to stop the activities. Maybe the explosion exceeded the guidelines, but we didn't have parameters—it just blew up and went everywhere.”
Actress Kim Pope also felt that Niccolai’s efforts were successful: “They accomplished their mission, because they frightened off legitimate actors, legitimate film people. That's why today, 45 years later, we have a separate adult film industry. We had wanted to blur the lines. We thought that the idea of adult entertainment would disappear, the idea of X-rated films as a separate genre. We thought that once the public got used to adult films, they would get over the hysteria.
“If you're making films or doing any sort of artistic thing, prohibiting something is like saying, ‘You can compose a symphony, but you can't use this octave, you can't play those notes.’ I wanted to see people playing on a full keyboard. And history is funny, because looking back it felt like a very innocent time. I didn't perceive it as being sleazy, or criminal, or even rebellious, really. It was just a very free time when we were pushing the envelope of artistic expression, and fighting back against puritanical, ridiculous hang-ups.
“But Deep Sleep did have its consequences. I realized it was going to make my legitimate acting career virtually impossible. There had just been too much publicity and too much prejudice, and I was too well known at that point. Which is kind of sad. But you can't turn back the clock. And I have no regrets because I think it was important that we fought. I'm glad that they picked on us, because we didn't cave in. You can't have regrets about anything you’ve done—only about the things you didn't do."" Epilogue
As we near the end of our interview, I ask Alfred when was the last time he saw Deep Sleep . He answers that it has been decades, probably around the time that the film was pulled from theaters in the early 1970s. So I ask him to watch it again with me and he does, right then and there.
When the film is over, I ask one last question: What does he think of this landmark film, a movie that had started his career, and that he’d risked so much for?
Alfred draws a breath and answers “Wow, it really sucks. It’s a piece of shit! Did I really make that? You kind of separate yourself—your memories of something and the reality of something are two different things. My memories were so fond but now seeing it I’m thinking maybe the prosecutor was right... I mean it shouldn’t have been prosecuted for indecency—we need to have freedom of expression—but it’s definitely criminal in the artistic sense!
Maybe Niccolai was onto something after all...”"
Why I Left NYC in Springtime for 10° Days on the Arctic Ocean,www.thedailybeast.com,sarah.rogers@thedailybeast.com (Sarah Rogers),05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-i-left-nyc-in-springtime-for-10degree-days-on-the-arctic-ocean,"IT’S STILL A BIG WORLD Why I Left NYC in Springtime for 10° Days on the Arctic Ocean Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast Yes it was cold and yes it was remote. But the beauty of both the land and its people in Nunavut is one of the world’s most magical experiences. 05.04.19 12:25 AM ET
A t a balmy 10°F, spring had sprung in the Arctic.
The sun was shining, the ravens were cawing, and the capital of Nunavut was buzzing with its nearly eight thousand residents. I’d been in Iqaluit, Canada for only a few hours and it seemed everyone was commenting on the relatively nice weather.
It may be Canada’s newest and largest territory, but Nunavut and its terrain is objectively beautiful.
There is a seemingly endless landscape of bright white snow contrasting with flecks of slate rock. Perched on the jagged and slick frozen beach of the Arctic Ocean, the candy-colored buildings of Iqaluit are a welcome and playful sight.
I was in Nunavut, 2,000 miles away from my cozy Brooklyn apartment, because the team at Destination Nunavut wanted to showcase to journalists and travel bloggers the remote beauty and Inuit culture this region of Canada has to offer.
The primary allure of the region for both tourists and residents is the untouched land: Dog sledding , ice fishing, and snowmobiling are all readily available as excursions from local guides if frozen exploration is on your bucket list. Iqaluit is the most populated part of Nunavut, but still offers an experience that, especially coming from New York, is alluring and calming in its isolation.
Nunavut is only a twenty-year-old territory, but the Inuit history of Canada’s arctic is deeply rooted in the land. Hunting along the floe edge or ice fishing in the Arctic Ocean are skills that Inuit people have mastered over generations, and are recently becoming more accessible to tourists as excursions from Nunavut’s dwellers. This makes it a ripe choice for The Daily Beast’s bimonthly series on underrated travel destinations, It’s Still a Big World .
I've arrived ahead of Toonik Tyme , an annual community celebration of Inuit traditions and the return of Spring. Toonik Tyme is named after “Toonik,” a word meaning one of the Tuniit people, the ancestors preceding the Canadian Arctic Inuits.
At the community curling rink, hundreds of residents filed into neat rows of folding chairs facing a stage, while a handful of children, some in pajamas, played on the floor. An organizer wheeled a 103-year-old Inuit woman to the front row. A chorus of chatty conversations—both in English and the native Inuktitut—quickly quieted as the opening ceremony festivities began.
After an introduction and announcing the years’ honorary “Tooniks”— Cooking show dynamo Rebecca Veevee and sculptor Lew Phillip —the celebration was underway.
There was a performance of traditional throat singing, an Inuit art where a duo performs vocal sounds similar to a low, growling beatboxing.
The performers face each other and exchange breathy percussive vocals. Initially a form of entertainment for Inuit women whose husbands were on hunting trips, throat singing is less of a musical number and more of a playful contest to see who can last the longest without running out of breath or laughing.
Yet the highlight of the opening festivities was undoubtedly the fashion show. Men, women, and children strutted across the stage in their exquisite handmade parkas, pausing midway to pull up their hoods and pose. Crafting these intricate garments is a skill provided to the members of the Inuit community through the elders and the Nunavut Literacy Council .
These were no drab gray North Face puffer jackets: Some parkas were made of spotted seal skin, others sported western fringe and metallic embellishments. There were teens with embroidered floral detail on their sleeves and brightly dyed fur hoods, and doughy toddlers waddling across the stage in warm onesies. The audience was delighted, cheering and clapping throughout the mostly-Inuit runway show.
It was frankly more fun, and far less pretentious, than any Fashion Week event.
Toonik Tyme is a festival that spans 10 days and has evolved since 1965 to a hybrid of showcasing traditional Inuit skills (seal skinning, igloo building) and more contemporary ones (snowmobile racing, bingo night).
A new retrospective exhibit of the late Inuk graphic artist Alootook Ipellie debuted during Toonik Tyme, an impressive breadth of work including satirical and editorial cartoons, graphic posters, and detailed line work. At its best, Ipellie critiques the media, the Canadian government, and the residual problems of colonization in the area.
Down the street from the exhibit, a line of people snaked around the curling rink holding large cardboard boxes filled with produce. It was IqualuEAT, a large farmers market that had attracted much of the town with a cost-effective alternative to shopping at the local grocery store. In an arctic climate with zero produce production, fresh food prices are astronomical. (Peaches at the farmers market were $1 each, whereas two pounds of nectarines cost $60 at the supermarket.)
Rebecca Veevee, who has been attending Toonik Tyme for 52 years, says she’s seen the high cost of living affect Toonik Tyme. “It used to be $47 dollars [to fly to nearby Pangnirtung] from here, now it’s $500,” she said. “A lot of people like to come [to Nunavut], but everything is too expensive.”
Obstacles aside from cost are plentiful living in Nunavut: a housing crisis , an abnormally high suicide rate and alcoholism all weigh heavier on the community than the bitter cold.
It’s clear why Toonik Tyme is worth celebrating: The end of Winter means the more daylight after months of darkness, and more time outdoors.
If extreme temperatures make you weary, Theresie Tungilik, Nunavut’s Advisor of Arts & Travel Economy, offers the bright side.
“It’s cold, but the thing is, the people are warm.”"
How Grace Kelly Dressed Like a Princess in Christian Dior,www.thedailybeast.com,Liza Foreman,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-grace-kelly-dressed-like-a-princess-in-christian-dior,"STAR QUALITY How Grace Kelly Dressed Like a Princess in Christian Dior An exhibit at the Musée Christian Dior in France celebrates the Dior wardrobe of Grace Kelly, the luminously beautiful Academy Award-winning actress turned Monaco princess. 05.04.19 12:24 AM ET Bettmann/Getty
GRANVILLE, France—As a child, designer Christian Dior lived in a pretty pink house, overlooking long sandy beaches and the swell of the Atlantic in Normandy.
His family left for Paris when Dior was only five, and the home is one of the only fashion museums in France dedicated to a designer. Musée Christian Dior ’s new exhibition Grace Kelly: Princess in Dior (to November 17) celebrates the Dior wardrobe of the Academy Award-winning actress turned Monaco royalty.
Alfred Hitchcock ’s beloved muse worked a gig at the Cannes Film Festival in 1955 into a new day job as Princess of Monaco, after she met at the festival that year, Prince Rainier III of Monaco, who was to become her husband.
Although she called herself a feminist—and, hey, she did become both a top movie star and a princess—Grace Kelly subsequently ditched the film career to live every Barbie doll’s dream. She went from Hollywood to French Riviera royalty overnight upon marrying Rainier.
For her new role, Grace Kelly needed outfits. Step in Dior and its designer at the time, Marc Bohan. Eighty-five of mostly-his Dior creations for Kelly—who died at the age of 52 following a stroke when her car plummeted from a mountainside road—show just how princesses from yesteryear dressed.
There were no bad hair days or outings to the local gas station for Doritos in Juicy Couture. Kelly, we learn, liked to dress both simply and casually which she still managed to do as a princess whilst maintaining royal protocol. She never went more casual than shirt dresses or fisherman’s smocks. But those were probably the Juicy Coutures of her day.
Taking up the entire house, the exhibition includes accessories, perfumes, Dior baby clothes, and vintage magazines. Dozens of these show Grace Kelly on the cover at a time when Photoshop wasn’t around. She had dimples and even wrinkles.
Coinciding with the 90th anniversary of her birth, the exhibition puts the spotlight on her style and personality, rather than her private life. Bohan, who became Dior’s Creative Director in 1960, found in Kelly the embodiment of his style.
“She was emblematic of my style,” Bohan said in an interview published in the exhibition’s book. “A style that captured attention but was never aggressive. Shirtdresses, blouses and crepe de chine suited her tastes perfectly.”
Co-Curator Florence Müller told the fashion trade paper WWD that Kelly brought about change in how much and the way princesses were seen in public.
“Before Grace of Monaco, Princesses remained a private affair,” she said. “Princesses weren’t seen in public as much or photographed by the press. She represents a change of etiquette. A real rupture.”
As per the show notes: “From grand balls to official trips around the world, along with artistic events and charitable works, this exhibition reveals the princess’ ability to always choose outfits appropriate to the occasion, with a sense of spectacle inherited from her time in Hollywood tempered by the sober necessities of her royal status. In her family and private life, the Princess Grace prized comfort, contemporary simplicity and a sporty allure that traced her origin to her American youth.”
The exhibition is divided into thematic sections, each accompanied by photographs, magazine clippings and sometimes sketches of Grace Kelly, or some of the designs.
It begins in the former living room with, ‘A Princess in Ball Gowns’ where we discover how Dior helped develop her classical elegance to inform an appropriate wardrobe for a princess. Among the dozen-odd pieces in this first display cabinet are a white satin dress, worn for her engagement, and a simple black and white Colinette dress from Fall/Winter 1956, worn for her first official portrait.
After this flamboyant selection of outfits, which includes a yellow canary frilly coat from Spring/Summer 1981, comes a more somber selection of outfits used for official outings. Some of the coats look like something women would have worn to the ammunition factory, during the war. Others looks frumpy to the modern eye. The materials seem threadbare compared to today’s super textiles.
Many of the pieces, throughout the collection, are monotone in color. There’s a section on sporty looks and shirt dresses, which we learn the princess favored. We also learn that she dressed her babies in Dior before Dior Baby was launched.
There’s a distinction to be drawn between the many evening gowns, with long sleeves, and the knee-length daywear with a more sporty aesthetic. Some of it is a bit Pierre Cardin without the edge. A couple of the pieces look exquisite and cool, including a shimmering bottle green dress with a scaly surface, and distinctive use of feather around the wrists and neck, from Fall/Winter 1971.
Who knew she liked shirt dresses? It is a pleasure to see her simple elegance reverberate throughout this beautifully maintained house.
The clothes are beautiful, but this critic wondered more and more about the dramatic choice Kelly had made: marriage over career. I found myself asking what was wrong with flying back to LA for work, in-between royal outings? I thought of an actress I worked with recently who didn’t want to be dressed in any way other than how she chose, which meant the fashion houses would not dress her. We think it sounds glamorous to have a fashion house want to dress us, but is it all that? What freedoms did Princess Grace give up in the name of fashion, family, and marriage? READ THIS LIST"
The Cold Case That Haunted Author Mark Bowden for Decades,www.thedailybeast.com,Kevin Canfield,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-cold-case-that-haunted-black-hawk-down-author-mark-bowden-for-decades,"TRUE CRIME The Cold Case That Haunted Author Mark Bowden for Decades In 1975, two Maryland girls went missing. Forty years later, a break in the case lured the ‘Black Hawk Down’ author back to investigate a story he’d covered as a young reporter. 05.04.19 12:21 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
One was in fifth grade, the other seventh. Katherine Lyon and her older sister Sheila made the honor roll, kept spare change in piggy banks, and tacked posters of Kenny Loggins and John Denver to their bedroom walls. In the last week of March 1975, they vanished from a mall in Wheaton, Maryland, just north of Washington. Their disappearance transfixed the public and puzzled police. Weeks passed, and as it grew less likely that their daughters would be coming home, John and Mary Lyon grieved and wondered.
Mark Bowden, a rookie reporter with the Baltimore News-American , spent much of that spring writing about the missing Lyon girls. When the investigation came to a standstill, he and his colleagues moved on to the next story. He’s since published several nonfiction bestsellers, including Black Hawk Down and Hue 1968 . The Lyon story has always bugged him, though. In 2015, the case resurfaced in the pages of the Washington Post , which reported that investigators in Maryland appeared to be closing in on a culprit. Bowden felt compelled to find out what was going on. “A story like that doesn’t really ever leave you,” he told me in a recent interview.
The result of his curiosity is The Last Stone , a gripping new book that seeks to differentiate itself amidst a surplus of true-crime titles, documentaries, and podcasts. Drawing on a deep cache of question-and-answer sessions between Montgomery County, Maryland. police and one of their chief suspects in the girls’ disappearance, Bowden gives us an eerily intimate look at what it can take to crack a cold case. It’s not the first time he has written about the interrogation of reputed criminals and terrorists . This time, though, he had access to dozens of hours of videotaped conversations.
Cold cases, Bowden writes, are often “defined by wasted effort,” as police duplicate the work of their predecessors, “pursuing leads so unpromising that others had long ago abandoned them.” Indeed, in the Lyon investigation, there was a notable lack of physical evidence. This meant that if officers were going to make an arrest, they’d have to get their information by repeatedly buttonholing witnesses and suspects—which is what they did with a convicted sex offender named Lloyd Welch.
On April 1, 1975, less than a week after Katherine and Sheila Lyon were reported missing, Welch, 18, went to the mall where they were last spotted. He told a security guard, and then a police officer, that he’d seen the girls leaving with a sketchy older man. His story included strange details—he had a lot to say about the pinstripes on the car the girls purportedly rode away in—but ultimately, it was written off as unconvincing. The cops figured Welch was just trying to collect some reward money. A summary of his statement was set aside, Bowden writes, and Welch’s link to the case was forgotten. Decades passed.
In the 2010s, a Montgomery County officer, hunting for overlooked clues in the Lyon case, came across Welch’s report. Why hadn’t this guy—now nearing 60 and locked up for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl in Delaware—received more scrutiny? Shouldn’t they talk to him now, better late than never? So began a grim pas-de-deux, in which Det. Dave Davis met with Welch for a series of subtle, increasingly revelatory interviews.
The transcripts of these sessions, which make up much of the book, serve as a case study in the effectiveness of the Good Cop method of interrogation. Davis, often accompanied by colleagues, met with Welch 10 times over a year-plus, plying him with fast food, praising his intelligence, and feigning anger on his behalf when Welch claimed that he was being persecuted. Welch’s story constantly evolved. At first, he said he knew nothing. Later, he conceded that he talked to the girls, after which he admitted that he saw them being raped. In time, the officers “teased out the whole abomination,” Bowden writes, and in September 2017, he pleaded guilty to murdering Katherine and Sheila. Welch will never get out of prison.
Though he thought he was done with the Lyon story, Bowden says he decided to return to it after an informal chat with a new generation of officers tasked with solving the case. “They explained to me that the whole case rested upon this marathon interrogation of this guy,” he says. “I said, Do you have transcripts? And they said, No, we have video. I thought, Oh man, I’m going to have to look at all this.” “Even some of the genre’s biggest devotees will admit that there’s a glut of true-crime content.”
Bowden presents compassionate portraits of the victims, telling us about the girls’ respective personalities, what they did for hobbies and chores, how they decorated their rooms. But he can’t be accused of writing an opportunistic tearjerker. His interest, he says, “was primarily in the way that the case was solved.” Talking to Davis and other officers, “it was clear they had no physical evidence of any consequence. They had no witnesses other than, as it turned out at the end, a couple witnesses possibly seeing the bodies burned. The bulk of the case, from beginning to end, rested on these conversations with Lloyd Welch. I zeroed in on those because that’s where the work was done.”
Even some of the genre’s biggest devotees will admit that there’s a glut of true-crime content. We’re in an era of four-part documentaries inspired by 12-part podcast series. Bowden is aware of this overabundance, and he doesn’t want to add to it (a portion of the book’s proceeds will be donated to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . He wouldn’t “have gone back to write a book about the Lyon sisters and their disappearance,” he says, if he felt like he was just rehashing “the tragedy of it and the mystery of it… For me, that wouldn’t have been enough.” He needed a different angle. “The moment when I decided that I was going to start looking at it seriously, potentially as something book-like, was when I found out there was” so much interrogation video—about 70 hours.
On top of that, there were many hours of audio. It took months for Bowden to make sense of it all. “I remember my wife telling me how sick of hearing Lloyd Welch’s voice she was,” he says, “because I’d be sitting there with my laptop, watching hour after hour of interrogations.” Bowden’s patience, his willingness to listen to a monster tell his story, has yielded an unusual, compelling book, a worthy effort in a crowded field.

"Camille Paglia Wants to Provoke, but Mostly She Just Irks Us",www.thedailybeast.com,Allen Barra,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/camille-paglia-wants-to-provoke-but-mostly-she-just-irks-us,"BIG MEH Camille Paglia Wants to Provoke, but Mostly She Just Irks Us The literary and social critic’s magnum opus, ‘Sexual Personae,’ landed like a bombshell. Her latest collection lands with a thud. 05.04.19 12:21 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photos by Getty
On so many issues, Camille Paglia and I are simpatico. We believe in free thought and free speech, we root for the Philadelphia Eagles, we dig Rihanna , we think comparative religion should be part of a core curriculum, we loathe modern French literary theory, and we agree that “Anarchism is glorified thumb-sucking.” Our ancestors were peasants from southern Italy. And we are both huge fans of her classic, Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson .
It may be hard for younger readers to appreciate the impact that Sexual Personae had in 1990. Those old enough liken it to the effect of Susan Sontag’s Against Interpretation in 1966. An exhilarating swirl of decadence, sexual politics, and revisionist art history, Sexual Personae bitch-slapped a stuffy and complacent academia. Opening its pages was the intellectual equivalent of finding foie gras in a high school cafeteria. It was as if Nietzsche had a lesbian Italian sister.
It’s been nearly thirty years since Sexual Personae . We’ve waited for the next thunderclap from the Ubermensche Frau. But what we’ve gotten after all that time is a pundit. Provocations is 712 pages, a collection of Paglia’s essays, Salon columns, interviews, and even one hundred pages headed under the title “A Media Chronicle” of everything written by or said about her over more than two decades.
The big pieces—“Erich Neumann: Theorist of the Great Mother” (a compact and concise introduction to the exemplar who “became Jung’s intellectual heir), “Slippery Scholarship: Review of John Boswell,” “Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe,” “Intolerance and Diversity in Three Cities: Ancient Babylon, Renaissance Venice, and Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia”—are welcome and might be more so if collected into a fine, neat volume. (Though I would not include “Homer on Film,” a bizarre, 33-page review of four bad movies on classical subjects that no one will ever watch.)
On these subjects Paglia is in her element and writes with such assurance that you feel she can illuminate them better than anyone else. But less of Provocations would have been more.
In Break, Blow, Burn , her 2005 commentary on 43 great poems, she comments that it “may be the only book of poetry criticism that has ever reached the national best-seller list in the United States,” a Trumpian-like boast that is nonetheless probably true. Her choices, from Shakespeare to Donne to Yeats, can’t be faulted, but when she gets further into the 20th century, there are huge, yawning gaps.
I’m fine with her excluding Ezra Pound (“a monotonous series of showy, pointless, arcane allusions to prior literature”) but I’m dumbfounded by the absence of W.H. Auden because “few of his poems can stand on their own in today’s media-saturated cultural climate.” (I’ve no idea what that means.) Philip Larkin and Louis MacNeice aren’t even mentioned. Robert Frost, who Clive James would “put forward as the greatest modern poet of them all,” is rejected for what she calls his “pious platitudes.” These are serious lapses of judgment.
In another terrible decision, she insults Seamus Heaney, “who enjoys an exaggerated reputation for... middling poems that strike me as second-or-third-hand Yeats.” Yeats? Is it possible to name a poet whose ability for evoking the artless beauty of rural life makes his work less like Yeats’? (Yes: Robert Frost.) Only one Irish genius allowed per century.
I skipped the chapter on her selection process. I wish I had skipped it a second time in Provocations .
As her subtitle indicates, Paglia takes on a broad range of subjects. But as a critic of literature, she has more blind spots than an NFL official. She doesn’t read modern fiction—“I don’t care about any novels published after World War II,” so much for Nabokov, Garcia Marquez, and Bellow—and has no affinity for any modern playwright except Tennessee Williams (“my main man”).
As to film, she gives a nod to Francis Ford Coppola’s Godfather movies and Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 , but little since Ingmar Bergman’s Persona (1966) has floated her boat. “Art movies are gone, gone with the wind,” which strikes me as an odd epithet for the art film, but to each her own. The new wave of American films from Bonnie and Clyde (1967) through the end of the ’70s made no impact on her. No Robert Altman, Martin Scorcese, or Sam Peckinpah. Not even the films of David Lynch, which surprises me; I thought Mulholland Drive would be right up her Freud-friendly alley.
The only 21st century film which draws an unqualified rave is George Lucas’ Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith , “which will remain a classic, beloved by worldwide audiences...” Remain beloved? The movie got a 65 percent score from a very friendly audience the year it was released.
Like Sontag (who once asked rhetorically “Why can't I love Dostoevsky and The Doors?”), Paglia drops rock and pop names as a way of validating her street cred. She knows a lot more about music than Sontag ever did, and her taste is pretty good, but we seldom get any critical insight beyond assertions of her “exacting high standards.”
Those standards are no longer met by Madonna, whom she once called “the future of feminism” in The New York Times . But in 2017, Madonna “struggles to regain the creative brilliance and global impact of her early years.” Perhaps Paglia was still ticked off at her for not wanting to get together years ago: “I was Madonna’s first major defender... The media, in the U.S. and abroad, constantly asked Madonna about me or tried to bring us together and she always refused...”
Madonna should have taken the get-together. David Bowie listed Sexual Personae as one of his favorite books, and in return Paglia writes, “It did not surprise me: that great artist was sensing himself mirrored back from my pages.”
Some of her generalizations on popular music stretch to the breaking point: “Folk and rock music, emerging from both black and white working-class traditions, were the vernacular analogue to William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s epical Lyrical Ballads ...” But I don’t see how John Clare leads me to appreciate Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly. We both love many of the same songs, including Rihanna’s “Pour It Up,” but Paglia doesn’t tell us much about why, except “I think it’s a true work of art.” She writes about pop music artists like a priest anointing saints. “We’ve always read Paglia for her inventiveness and unpredictability, but over the last couple of decades, the unpredictability has become predictable.”
Bob Dylan’s “Desolation Row” isn’t just a great song: “I submit that this lyric is the most important poem in English since Allen Ginsberg’s Howl …” She would “classify Prince as a major artist of the late twentieth century.” Patti Smith’s 1975 album Horses “remains one of the greatest products of the rock genre.” Chaka Khan’s “Ain’t Nobody” is “a masterpiece of modern popular culture...” “Goldfinger” by Shirley Bassey is “the most terrifying manifestation of ruthless star power ever recorded.”
When Paglia writes at the top of her voice like this, it sounds like she’s trying to say everything without actually saying something . I agree that Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” is a killer, but what does it add to say it “recapitulates the entire history of black music”? Can’t I enjoy it without seeing images of Buddy Bolden, Robert Johnson, and Thelonious Monk floating by?
We’ve always read Paglia for her inventiveness and unpredictability, but over the last couple of decades, the unpredictability has become predictable. Paglia’s opinions in Provocations are filled with scattershot observations on matters in which she seems more passionate than knowledgeable. Such as ...
—Global warming is “a sentimental myth unsupported by evidence.” “I have been highly suspicious for years,” she tells us, “about the political agenda that has slowly accrued around this issue. From my perspective, virtually all the major claims about global warming and its causes still remain to be proved.”
I’m no expert on global warming—it’s possible that I know even less about it than Paglia does—but I know a little about the so-called political agenda that has “accrued around” global warming, namely that since conservatives won’t accept scientific opinion on this issue, anyone who even entertains the notion that global warming is real is by definition a liberal.
—“Guns are not the problem in America, where nature is still so near. These shocking incidents of school violence [such as the Columbine massacre] are ultimately rooted in the massive social breakdown of the industrial revolution which disrupted the ancient patterns of clan and community ...”
I don’t know what nature has to do with our gun problem, but I know that people in Canada, Australia, and a lot of other places are at least as near to nature as we are, and they don’t suffer mass shootings. The recent tragedy in New Zealand was the first mass shooting in that part of the world since the 1996 massacre of 35 in Tasmania, which prompted quick gun law action in Australia just as New Zealand has now responded with similar legislation.
—Ayn Rand. “The kind of bold female thinker who should immediately have been a centerpiece of women’s studies programs, if the latter were genuinely about women rather than about a cliched, bleeding-heart victim-obsessed, liberal ideology that dislikes all concrete female achievement.” I assume Paglia hasn’t read Rand’s novels (including The Fountainhead , which Pauline Kael called a “megalomaniac comic book”), so she must be talking about the rigid ideology of a humorless, puritanical didact whose most prominent disciples in our time are Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck. If Paglia truly regards Rand as a “bold female thinker,” why does she relegate Rand to the children’s table of women’s studies? Would Paglia take Rand’s work seriously if it had been written by a man?
—Princess Diana. “Diana had a burning but erratic energy, like that of the great Hollywood stars... Diana will have eternal life through her resurrection in the innumerable documentaries... The photogenic Diana made an immense contribution to world visual culture, in my view exceeding the work of painters and sculptors as well as most filmmakers in the same period... Diana has been absorbed into world myth... Her saga will become archaeological, like the love stories of Victoria and Albert or Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson... Since there are no celebrities left of Diana’s stature, we are mesmerized by a vacuum.”
Does Paglia have no one who will tell her that this kind of writing is kitschy, myth-mongering supermarket tabloid gush? I’m dumbfounded as to why she would associate Diana with two Nazi sympathizers.
—Sarah Palin. “The gun-toting Sarah Palin is like Annie Oakley, a brash ambassador from America’s frontier past.” Annie Oakley grew up in Ohio and spent almost her entire life in the Midwest or East and saw almost nothing of the frontier. And Sarah Palin’s parents were educators, not ranchers. Palin spent a couple of years competing in beauty pageants while attending several different colleges (including two in Hawaii) and is no more an ambassador from our frontier past than Hillary Clinton.
—War. Gone With The Wind “beautifully demonstrates the horror of war. Everyone is so wildly enthused for the war at the start, but Ashley Wilkes says, ‘Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars. And when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about.’” This is drivel. The great misery of Ashley Wilkes’ world was slavery, and it was ended by a war, not caused by it.
—Taylor Swift. “An obnoxious Nazi Barbie.” I can’t imagine what Taylor Swift could have done to provoke such a vehement reaction from anyone, with the possible exception of Tom Hiddleston. As Clive James observed, Paglia “has a taste for bitchery but no touch.” “Too many of the pieces in Provocations are hastily thought through and shoddily written.”
—Genius. In Salon, she rattled off a quick roster of 20th century geniuses—“Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Martha Graham. Claims could also be made for Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Alfred Hitchcock, Jackson Pollock, Ingmar Bergman, and Bob Dylan.” Her list strikes me as both obvious and arbitrary. Where are Kafka, Yeats, and Proust? Hitchcock, but not Orson Welles? Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, OK, but surely the most influential jazz musician—maybe the century’s most influential musician in any form—was Louis Armstrong. Bob Dylan, sure, but since I’m from Alabama, could I raise a hand for Hank Williams?
***
Too many of the pieces in Provocations are hastily thought through and shoddily written. In an interview with the Columbia Journal , she admonishes young writers who “don’t know English well enough... they don’t care with individual sentences or paragraphs.” She would have benefited from having a student from the Columbia Journal read through her own copy before it went between covers.
For instance, her maddening overuse of “ly” words. If Nabokov or Hemingway (who surely would have agreed about nothing else) had edited Paglia, they’d have red-flagged hundreds of cases of adverb abuse. To note just a few:
“Dramatically demonstrates,” “wonderfully catches,” bloodily jammed” (all p. 88), ”barbarically sensual” (p. 90), “grotesquely overblown” and “densely visualized” (p. 113), “chillingly archaic” (p. 115), “interestingly ghoulish” (p. 118), “admirably captures” and “grittily building” (p. 122), “very authentically beating” (p. 123), “sweepingly scored” and “gorgeously ornamented” (p. 126), “instantly smitten” (p. 127), “standing eerily” (p. 128), “blindingly charismatic desirability” (p. 130). Vivien Leigh in Anna Karenina is “beautifully controlled” (p. 123), and Kirk Douglas as Odysseus is “charismatically convincing.” (p. 128) Can someone be charismatically unconvincing?
A character in a version of The Odyssey is killed by “an arrow gorily piercing his throat.” Do we really need “gorily”? Another character “narcissistically primps.” It would be better to say primps narcissistically, but better still not to write it at all.
Paglia is too easily stunned. Dylan’s “Desolation Row” is “a stunning achievement.” A scene in Truffaut's Jules and Jim is “stunningly successful.” European art films achieved “a stunning sexual sophistication.” The poems of Theodore Roethke were “a stunning departure” from what she had been taught in school. “Far too much of Paglia’s time is taken up in political punditry, a field for which she has no talent.”
When groping for an insight, Paglia has a frustrating habit of falling back on her heritage, “that stately, archaic sense of time in my Italian grandmother’s kitchen when I was a small child in upstate New York.” Her Italian-ness enables her to understand death: “The steely Italian stoicism and even irreverence about death have often gotten me into trouble in American academe ...” It helps her better understand celebrities, even those of Polish heritage like Martha Stewart (“As an Italian-American, I had an immediate vibe with Martha Stewart ...”) and Iraq (“It’s a cauldron of warring tribesmen... I understand it from my family background in Italy... it’s a tribal memory.”) and even concrete: “In Italian culture we pay attention to infrastructure... The Romans developed concrete. In my family—oh my God—they could talk about concrete forever!” (I wonder if her family read Pietro di Donato’s Christ in Concrete , the only novel anyone in my family read before The Godfather . Paglia thinks that we “are the most defamed minority group (after blacks).” Maybe, except for Jews, Poles, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Muslims, and gays.
Far too much of Paglia’s time is taken up in political punditry, a field for which she has no talent. For someone who claims to be a registered Democrat, she sure sounds like she’s lobbing Molotovs for Fox News.
“Why,” she wrote in Salon in 2009, “has the Democratic Party become so arrogantly detached from ordinary Americans?” The Democrats are so arrogantly detached from ordinary Americans that they’ve given them the GI Bill (which boosted an entire generation of working class families into the middle class), Social Security, Medicare, welfare, unemployment benefits, and health care, most of which the other party has relentlessly tried to cut back or abolish. I can’t believe that at least some of Paglia’s family didn’t benefit from one or more of these programs, as mine did.
Paglia uses the terms identity politics and political correctness the way my cousin Bart uses parmesan cheese. As for PC, she is right to ask, “Has campus leftism in the U.S. been so transformed that it now encourages, endorses, and celebrates suppression of ideas ... ?” The answer is yes. But whose politics and whose idea of correctness? Political correctness is a door that neither side wants to swing both ways. I don’t see Michelle Wolf and Amy Schumer on Fox News, or Jim Jefferies doing his gun control routine at Liberty University or BYU.
As for identity politics, when fresh out of college I worked for the Republican Party, and one of the first things I was told was to remember that “All politics is local.” This was code for white politics, which somehow is never acknowledged to be a form of identity politics. Let’s face it, in America we have a shorter term for identity politics: politics.
Paglia’s bad political instincts congeal around Trump. Again, in Salon she writes, “Wow, millionaire workaholic Donald Trump chases young, beautiful, willing women and liked to boast about it. Jail him now!” This dismisses nearly two dozen unwilling women who have accused our president of sexual misconduct (and I haven’t a clue as to why she associated workaholic with Donald Trump, who doesn’t seem to have done a day’s work in his life).
She gets a charge out of Trump saying John McCain “isn’t a war hero, because his kind of war hero doesn’t get captured—that’s hilarious! That’s something crass that Lenny Bruce might have said! It’s so startling and entertaining!” No, I don’t think Lenny Bruce would have said that; Bruce volunteered for the Navy during World War II while Trump successfully evaded the draft five times during Vietnam. I think Bruce might have pointed out that you can’t get captured if you don’t serve.
Liberal Democrats, she thinks, classify Trump voters as “racists, sexist, misogynistic, and all that.” By knocking down a straw man, Paglia obscures the obvious fact that so many racists, sexists, and misogynists are Trump voters. Or perhaps the TV cameras are lingering too long on the Confederate flags at his rallies.
When she talks about her politics, many critics follow Paglia’s lead and classify her simply as a “contrarian.” But they let her off too easily. This, from a 2003 interview, is typical of her political pronouncements: “I’m a libertarian Democrat who voted for Ralph Nader.” I suppose that is contrarian, but it’s contrarian in the sense that Paul Berman nailed when writing in Salon about Nader supporters: “I interpret the Green Party as a movement of the middle and upper-middle class, as actually having a certain satisfaction with the way things are—which is to say, the reason you should vote for the Greens is because you want to feel the excitement of political engagement... but you don’t really care what it’s going to mean for other people if the Republicans get elected.”
Maybe it’s not fair to judge Paglia by what she wrote a year before the Trump administration caged hundreds and perhaps thousands of immigrant children; ignored the murder of a journalist, an American resident, probably because of financial considerations; and caused unwarranted suffering to hundreds of thousands of government workers and their families by cutting off their salaries in a government shutdown.
Paglia seems much concerned with her legacy. “A writer must always think about being read in the future,” she told an interviewer in 2004. “I’m always thinking how to make what I’m writing relevant not only to contemporary readers but to someone looking at it ten, twenty or thirty years from now.” She might want to consider that her cheerleading for Trump and, sadly, not her early books, is what she might be remembered for.

Could the Inuit Steer Us Through Climate Change?,www.thedailybeast.com,M.R O'Connor,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/could-the-inuit-and-other-indigenous-cultures-steer-us-through-climate-change,"EXCERPT Could the Inuit Steer Us Through Climate Change? People of the Arctic, the South Seas, and the desert have been alert to the ravages of climate change long before the so-called more sophisticated scientific community. 05.04.19 12:20 AM ET Cheryl Ramalho/Getty
When I set out to talk to traditional navigators in the Arctic, Australia, and Oceania, I had not anticipated how intricately the issue of climate change would be intertwined in these conversations. Again and again the indigenous communities I visited happened to be on the front lines of climate disruption, and only later did I fully appreciate that it was often because of their unique cultural practices, including oral transmission of information through generations and methodical observation of nature, that they were so keenly aware of these disruptions. In some cases, individuals are able to compare the changes wrought by climate change against several hundred years of collective experience because of the integrity of their oral traditions.
In the Arctic, where sea ­ice conditions, weather, and temper­ature are increasingly unpredictable, I learned that for years older hunters—the same individuals who most often possessed a mas­tery of wayfinding skills—have reported strange environmental phenomena that they said had never been witnessed before. The Inuit filmmaker Zacharias Kunuk was often told by these elders that the sun was emerging after the long winter in different places in the sky than before, and the stars were often appearing in the wrong place. Initially, Kunuk thought it was a joke, but the elders insisted; the earth must have shifted on its axis, they told him. “I never paid any attention to it, but when I started making the docu­mentary Inuit Knowledge and Climate Change , people from other communities started saying the same thing,” he told me. “I don’t think they were taken seriously. The Inuit don’t have a PhD, they haven’t gone to the university.”
Kunuk was curious enough that he and a film partner, the geographer Ian Mauro, began reaching out to scientists for an explanation, even writing to NASA, which rebuffed them. They finally found a scientist at the University of Manitoba who was an expert in atmospheric refraction, a kind of mirage caused by changes in air density that deflects light. The earth had not shifted on its axis, but it turns out that the appear­ance of celestial phenomena had changed in the Arctic, most likely as a result of temperature variations stemming from cli­mate change. As it turns out, the Inuit already had a word for this sort of mirage, but they didn’t connect it to what they saw in the sky: qapirangajuq . It means “spear strangely” and de­scribes how when spearing fish, a hunter has to adjust for refrac­tion in the water. “You start realizing they are right,” said Kunuk. “Across the South Pacific, home to ten million people, sea level rise threatens livelihoods and entire islands.”
The scientific group Arctic Council, composed of members from eight countries, now predicts that the entire Arctic will be ice free in the summer by 2040. According to Claudette Engblom­ Bradley, a professor of education, the Yup’ik in Alaska begin observing and predicting the weather as young children, but environmental changes are now making forecasts extremely difficult. Similarly, in villages like Qaanaaq in Greenland, the changes have wrought havoc on where people can go and what environmental cues they can use to inform their movements. As one villager, Jens Danielson, told the Washington Post , “Earlier, the hunters, they can just look at the weather and see how it is going to be the next few days, so I can go out. But today, you can’t do that anymore, because the change of the weather happens from day to day, or from hour to hour.”
In the South Pacific, climate change is literally confusing the environmental cues used for navigation. Seasonal trade winds are weakening or blowing in inconsistent directions. Across the South Pacific, home to ten million people, sea level rise threatens livelihoods and entire islands. These changes in sea level have been happening at an average rate of 1.7 millimeters per year for most of the twentieth century, a rate that accelerated in the 1990s, ac­cording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For islands like Tuvalu or Vanuatu and hundreds of others, the threat is flooding and erosion, and potentially the submergence of atolls. Ninety percent of the population of the Maldives, Marshall Is­lands, and Tuvalu live on land, for instance, that is less than ten meters above sea level.
The potential costs of relocating entire island populations in the future are head­spinning. As Robert McLeman points out in his book Climate and Human Migration, there is no direct modern­ day analog for the disappearance of land masses for en­tire nations as could happen in the South Pacific. Such refugees would join the 12 million currently stateless people in the world. “Tuvaluans will not cease to be citizens of Tuvalu because of [sea level rise], but Tuvalu itself may physically cease to be habi­table, becoming a sort of modern Atlantis,” he writes. “No inter­national law or policy would give automatic shelter or protection to those made stateless by [sea level rise]. Although the popular media, non-government organizations, and some scholars use terms like ‘environmental refugees’ or ‘climate change refugees,’ such a category of persons simply doesn’t exist under interna­tional law.”
Over the course of my reporting, I began to connect another surprising aspect of the relationship between human navigation practices and global climate. At the start of the Industrial Age, humanity unleashed a revolution in transportation powered by accessing fossil fuels deep in the earth, propelling us to greater and greater speeds in cars, airplanes, ships, and rockets, vehicles unimaginable to our ancestors. In that same period, from the in­vention of the combustion engine to now, we have put so much heat­-trapping carbon into the atmosphere that levels are higher than at any period in the last 800,000 years. In other words, the same revolution in transportation that led to changes in the way we navigate helped create the problem of cli­mate change, and now climate change will undoubtedly impact how and where humans move in the coming decades. “Indigenous communities have much to offer the scientific community, if only their traditions and methods for accumulating and synthesizing knowledge were seen as equally valid.”
But are indigenous cultural practices and knowledge of navi­gation potentially critical tools for combating climate change? McLeman writes that pastoralist cultures from Central Asia to Lapland to Saharan Africa practice inherently migratory lifestyles. Among the Aboriginal Australians, Inuit, and First Nations of North America, mobility and migration are inherent compo­nents of culture practice and environmental stewardship. What might others learn from those who embraced mobility and mi­gration as part of their identity and possess skills for travel and survival under their own power?
The Columbia University pro­fessor Rafis Abazov has written that the modern world has much to learn from nomadic cultures, including attitudes toward the Other, because exploring otherness and learning from newcom­ers about the land beyond the horizon is essential to nomadism. At the very least, it seems that indigenous communities have much to offer the scientific community, if only their traditions and methods for accumulating and synthesizing knowledge were seen as equally valid.
The Indigenous Peoples’ Bio Cultural Climate Change Assess­ment Initiative argues that indigenous knowledge, experiences, wisdom, and perspectives are needed to develop evidence­-based responses for adaptation. And across the South Pacific, the revival of traditional navigation is increasingly seen as a potent response to the threat of climate change, and the specific technologies and economies that unleashed it. The Marshall Islands is the first Pa­cific country to commit to reducing its transport emissions by nearly 27 percent by 2030. The Okeanos Foundation wants to create a new Pacific inter-island transportation industry using a combination of traditional canoe technology, biofuels, and solar power to wean Oceanians away from a dependence on the very fossil fuels that threaten to submerge their nations. Voyaging socie­ties, NGOs, nonprofits, schools, and communities are recogniz­ing that traditional knowledge and wayfinding could be powerful aspects of a sustainable, fossil fuel–free future.

‘Tuca & Bertie’ Is Netflix’s Next Great Animated Series,www.thedailybeast.com,kevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Fallon),05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/tuca-and-bertie-is-netflixs-next-great-animated-series,"‘Tuca & Bertie’ Is Netflix’s Next Great Animated Series via Netflix ‘Broad City’ meets ‘Bojack Horseman’ is yet another quirkily profound animated series for adults from Netflix, this one featuring the voices of Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong. Kevin Fallon 05.04.19 12:17 AM ET
I t’s been a lonely month without new Broad City episodes to look forward to. Enter Tuca & Bertie .
It’s reductive to compare two clever, bawdy comedies about female friendship to each other. But it’s refreshing that, as one era of the genre ends, marked by the series finale of Broad City at the end of March, another one, a spiritual soul sister of sorts, seems to be beginning—and it’s just as thrilling.
The New Yorker ’s Emily Nussbaum noted this when Abbi and Ilana were signing off, that as Broad City , Jane the Virgin , and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend say goodbye, it’s encouraging to see unique, refreshing, inquisitive new shows like Shrill , PEN15 , Russian Doll , Fleabag , and, now, Netflix’s just-released animated series Tuca & Bertie arrive in their wake.
More, and as Variety’s Caroline Framke writes , these series are interested in exploring a crucial and under-excavated stage in women’s lives: not the millennial angst of a Girls or the crude coming-of-age of a Broad City , nor the post-40s existential crisis of a women of a certain age. Tuca & Bertie , especially, mines that formative transition period of being in your thirties. It just so happens to do it with two best friends who are also birds.

Tiffany Haddish is Tuca, a tall toucan who loves short shorts, explodes with confidence, and is unapologetic about the parts of her life that spark joy, but which others might have Konmari’d out of their lives as they moved out of their twenties.
Ali Wong’ s Bertie is a people-pleaser and a fussbudget. She’s a data processor at Conde Nest publishing (get it?) and an amateur baker who has just moved in with her boyfriend. While she may seem like the more put-together of the two, her anxieties about life, love, and her identity prove that even the most assured birds aren’t immune to having their feathers ruffled.
They’re the yin to each other’s yang, which leads to support and inspiration, but also jealousy and resentment.
That’s the case whether they’re on a wild adventure—chasing after a bowl of sugar that contains the ashes of Bertie’s grandmother that a rogue turtle has run away with—or guiding each other through issues of romance and self-worth. In one early episode, Tuca helps Bertie break out of her shell in the bedroom while Bertie in tandem helps Tuca realize that she’s deserving of love.
That moments of such surreality—oh yeah, the grandma sugar gets baked into a cake that is then eaten—are punctuated with such raw emotion makes sense given the history of the show’s creator. Lisa Hanawalt is an illustrator and graphic designer best known for her work as producer on BoJack Horseman.
That show’s signature visual aesthetic is largely Hanawalt’s doing. Tuca & Bertie shares not only that style, but also BoJack ’s masterful blending of the whimsy of animation with the darkness of human life. There’s a spirit to Tuca & Bertie , a vitally feminine and maybe even more mischievous one, that is all Hanawalt’s own.
Early episodes feature the skewering of office culture and toxic masculinity, as well as institutionalized misogyny, the pressures put on women in relationships, and the complexity of maintaining intimate female friendships when the pressures of society are designed to fracture them. The episodes are also weird and rude and real and recognizable and just really funny. Like, belly-laugh funny. There’s a talking boob.
It takes a few episodes for all that materialize. The first episode is jaunty and fun, but the real mission of the show clarifies almost right away in episode two, which has Bertie trying to psych herself up to ask for the promotion she deserves at an office where her contributions are ignored because of her gender and timid personality.
Not to bring it back to Broad City , but to totally do it, it’s a show that reminds us why Abbi and Ilana’s work was so special. It proves that goofiness and profundity can go hand in hand, that grand statements can be made with silliness—because those things aren’t dichotomies the way we’ve been programmed to think, but actually quite inextricable. “ The episodes are weird and rude and real and recognizable and just really funny. Like, belly-laugh funny. There’s a talking boob. ”
Perhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise that animation is proving to be such an adept medium for distilling the social mores and issues of the current age. I mean, duh, The Simpsons is the longest running comedy for a reason. Fox has known this for a while, hence King of the Hill , Family Guy , and Bob’s Burgers . South Park at one point may have been the most important show on TV.
Nickelodeon shows like Spongebob Squarepants and Doug are downright existential. Then there’s film, where Disney’s animation is the source of its own theology, while Pixar’s oeuvre proves, perhaps unexpectedly, that the best way to capture and reflect the complexities of the human spirit is through animation.
But there’s something of a wave, or a golden age, or at least a pleasant trend happening now, and, of all platforms, especially on Netflix. It’s too early to say whether Tuca & Bertie will rank as highly on critics’ year-end lists as BoJack routinely does. But as far as launching first seasons go, Netflix pushed the series out of the nest, and boy does it fly."
NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio Unites the Nation: No One Wants Him to Run for President,www.thedailybeast.com,Harry Siegel,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nyc-mayor-bill-de-blasio-unites-the-nation-no-one-wants-him-to-run-for-president,"THE MAYOR CAN’T HELP IT NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio Unites the Nation: No One Wants Him to Run for President Blame it—and everything—on Anthony Weiner. opinion Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty
To become mayor, he defeated a Republican who vowed to kill kittens to keep the trains running.
Then helped kill a deer .
Now, he’s coming for America.
I get it: If there’s one person who can unite this nation, it’s New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who likes to prattle on about his transcendent, historic vision and who (polls confirm) roughly nobody wants running for president after he’s flirted with the idea for months, but who The New York Daily News reported Friday will announce as soon as next week that he’s joining the absurdly crowded Democratic field—where he’d be the only one of 23 declared candidates with a negative favorability rating.
I was tempted to propose a New York to America: Take our mayor, please, joke, but 76 percent of New Yorkers say he shouldn’t run. Politico New York surveyed 30-odd members of Team de Blasio , and all but two said it was a bad idea, with one calling it “fucking insane.”
The crew that helped him become mayor has mostly stayed away, some of them still scarred from his horrifically humiliating and ineffectual attempts to play a role in the 2016 presidential campaign.
The chronically late mayor of New York eats pizza with a fork, and has the NYPD drive him from Gracie Mansion in Manhattan to Park Slope in Brooklyn so he can use the gym there. He leaves town an awful lot, and even when he’s here the pols looking to replace him in 2021 are already openly looking past him when they’re not bashing him.
And it’s not like New York mayors have a great track record of finding any higher office, let alone president, but I get why de Blasio is doing this. He has the stubborn, superstitious confidence in his approach and abilities common to politicians who’ve proven naysayers wrong before.
In seeing the progressive wave coming . And in getting elected mayor—albeit by winning a low turnout primary in a crowded field and with a big under-the-table assist from his cousin John Wilhelm and the unintended help of Carlos Danger—and then reelected.
“I was the underdog in everything I’ve ever been near, and I’m not saying that with any hubris,” he told the Daily News . “Any time I get in a race I get in it to win.”
The trouble is that, after his first year, he’s spent more time explaining how, despite copious evidence to the contrary , he is not a crook. And while the city hasn’t collapsed on his watch—which is really all a Democrat needs here at this point to win a second term—he’s had precious few accomplishments after year one other than maintaining the decline in crime he inherited and an economy that, if anything, has remained hotter than most New Yorkers would like, so the wages haven’t kept up with rent and the cost of living for most of us.
The lobbying business, at least, has boomed on his watch , swelling from $62.7 million in 2013 to $102.6 million in just five years of de Blasio, with his favorite firms doing particularly well . That’s happened amid scandal after scandal involving bribers and the mayor, who inevitably says that if he wasn’t criminally charged, that means he did nothing wrong, and also that he gave the bribers calling him directly the same treatment he would any other constituent.
And as we were reminded in de Blasio’s own little Mueller Report, finally made public the same week as the one about Trump and even more heavily redacted , he’s always depended on a pay-to-play operation and the feds already forced him to shut down his shady local fundraising operation .
Mostly, a term-limited mayor with no clear political future at home and who roots for the Red Sox anyways has little reason not to run for president and see what that gets him. Just ask the mayor of Indiana’s fourth-largest city, who’s polling at 8.3 nationally, according to the Real Clear Politics average, roughly 8 points higher than de Blasio.
With no filter on the field, and the prospect of national TV time, why not?
Like Al Sharpton told me about his 2004 run—where he was advised by Republican ratfucker Roger Stone, beta-testing the debate-disrupting tactics that paid off in spades for Trump three elections later— “They keep saying I can’t win. How do they know what I’m trying to win?”
Funny thing, but not really: If Anthony Weiner’s lust for power had suppressed his lust for other things , there’s almost no chance de Blasio would be mayor now , or that Donald Trump would be the president he’s hoping against hope to challenge.
“Whatever theoretical bases he may target are already being courted by nationally recognized figures,” observed one of the sources who told the News about the mayor’s plan to make official the run he’s been flirting with for months now. “He may have a shot if every Democratic candidate is caught sending racy selfies to minors.”
And unlike with the groundhog , among many other things , there’ll be no covering it up. READ THIS LIST"
The Incredible Saga of Tracy Edwards: A Real-Life Female Superhero Who Sailed Around the World,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-incredible-saga-of-tracy-edwards-a-real-life-female-superhero-who-sailed-around-the-world,"The Incredible Saga of Tracy Edwards: A Real-Life Female Superhero Who Sailed Around the World Sony Pictures Classics Tracy Edwards led the first all-female sailing team around the world. Now, the subject of the new doc ‘Maiden’ opens up about making history and silencing all the male haters. Amy Zimmerman 05.04.19 3:02 AM ET
I n 1989, the first-ever all-female team entered the Whitbread Race to sail around the world. Everyone, from the (male) sailors who scoffed at their efforts to the (male) journalists who took bets on how far they’d make it, was convinced that they would never finish. But the Maiden team, led by the indefatigable Tracy Edwards, not only completed the race but won two legs of it.
On paper, the story of the Maiden yacht reads like documentary catnip. On screen, reanimated through old media clips and exclusive on-board footage, salty shots of the ship pummeling the water and a deck full of women the moment when they realize that they’ve taken the lead, it somehow manages to exceed expectations. Alex Holmes’ Maiden is fun to watch on so many different levels, whether it’s witnessing world-class athletes push their bodies past what even they thought possible or listening to a bunch of old men admit, on the record, that they were wrong to ridicule and underestimate them. At 22, Tracy Edwards decided to put together an all-female crew to sail around the world. Thirty years later, she’s a delight as chief narrator, insightfully and humorously ushering viewers along through the stages of that historic journey.
While the bulk of the film focuses on the race, with all of its built-in drama and visual majesty, we start by getting to know Edwards. It takes a special kind of twentysomething to dedicate her entire life to a project that no one thinks she is capable of, and Edwards is certainly that. Rebellious, stubborn, and adventurous, the teenage Edwards took her school expulsion as an opportunity to travel around the world. By chance, she was offered a position working on a charter yacht. As she became increasingly involved in the sailing world, Edwards learned about the Whitbread Round the World Race, and liked the sound of it. She convinced an entrant to take her on as a cook during the 1985-1986 race. Of the 230 crew members taking part in the race, only four were women.
During a recent interview Edwards, as candid and entertaining in person as she is on film, told The Daily Beast that Whitbread started as just the latest in a string of nomadic adventures.
“I just thought, sailing around the world, how awesome would that be? And then as it often happens in my life, an idea then becomes an obsession and then it’s I have to do it and nothing else exists —but it didn’t start out like that.”
The documentary juxtaposes Edwards’ recollections of male crew members making her life hell during her first Whitbread race with brief television interviews in which she exudes gratitude for being given the opportunity to tag along. “Lying through my teeth, because I had to get back on the boat,” she laughed. Being the only woman on board meant being treated as a joke, not a teammate—at one point, having “for sale for one case of beer” scrawled on her underwear. Edwards told The Daily Beast that while the situation eventually became manageable (“after we won coming into New Zealand I then became the lucky charm on the boat”), she knew that if she continued sailing with men she would continue to be underestimated. “I think I started to think about an all-female crew probably on the last leg, and I was just thinking, I want to sail around the world as a sailor. Because even on the next race, I’m not going to get on as anything other than cook, even with having done the 37,000 miles that I’ve just done on the Whitbread, going through the worst conditions, learning everything I’ve learned—I still haven’t gotten any further forward.”
“How do I get further forward?” she remembered thinking. “The only way that’s ever going to prove to men that women can do this is if we do an all-female crew, because then they can’t say she only won because she was with the guys.”
Edwards knew that she was doing something unprecedented, but she didn’t see it as deliberately history-altering, or as some sort of grand feminist stand. “It wasn’t a holy grail moment, it was just a I don’t see how it’s going to change unless we do this . I mean, maybe we’ll fail,” she remembered thinking, “but I don’t think we will. I think we’ll succeed.”
Of course, what started as a daring idea would take untold amounts of effort, not to mention money, to see to fruition. The documentary does a fantastic job of showing just how trying of a time it was for Edwards, who felt the weight of seeing her vision through not just for herself, but for the accomplished all-female crew that she enlisted to sail around the world. Together, the crew took a beaten-down, used yacht and rebuilt it themselves. Edwards mortgaged her own home in order to afford it. “Nobody had ever seen a bunch of girls working in a boatyard so there was a lot of ‘do you want help with that love?’” Edwards explained in a previous interview .
Maiden struggled to find financial backing, with executives either disdainful of the endeavor or terrified that their names would forever be attached to a fatal disaster. As Edwards fought to keep the project on track, she was met with a chorus of discouragement and doubt. The sailing world treated Maiden like a foolish pipe dream, and the media covered it like a stunt.
“It just became a battle of wills,” Edwards recalled, positing that if her efforts hadn’t faced such resounding, sexist backlash, she might not have seen the project through: “Yeah, that helped.”
In interview clips from the time, questions range from patronizing to all-out sexist. Edwards and her crew were rarely asked about sailing, underlining the fact that the world didn’t see them as sailors at all—more like an all-female sideshow act. “It gave us great direction, if nothing else. It really focused our minds. Whereas before we were a bit like, you know, let’s just give it a go. This sounds so weird, but it wasn't about women sailing. We just wanted to race around the world on an equal playing field. Then it became about women.” “ The male chauvinists who were entrenched in their doctrine, they would never change their minds—even if every other boat dropped out and we were the only boat that finished. ”
While Edwards isn’t shy about labeling many of the journalists that covered the Maiden as hardened “male chauvinists,” she’s quick to give credit where credit is due. While she’s grateful toward all of the men, even the “vile” ones, who agreed to participate in the documentary, she’s particularly effusive toward journalist Bob Fisher. “The difference with Bob Fisher is that he began changing his mind almost from day one,” Edwards enthused. “He was never entrenched in his ideas. So yes, he called us a tinful of tarts. But when we won coming into New Zealand he wrote, dear reader, I’m putting salt and pepper on my hat as I write this article. He said, they’re not just a tinful of tarts. They’re a tinful of smart, fast tarts. So not much better! But that was a massive step forward, so we took it.”
Laughing, she added, “He allowed himself to be educated. Now that’s a great journalist.”
While many expected Maiden to hit disaster almost immediately, they came in third out of four in their class for the first leg before pulling ahead and winning two legs in a row. After losing their lead Maiden ultimately finished second—the best performance by a British competitor in 17 years. Incredible footage shows the Maiden coming in to huge fanfare, with the all-female crew that had been so thoroughly dismissed returning as bona fide celebrities.
According to Edwards, the other entries in their class took their success quite poorly. “The guys in our class hated the fact that we were winning. They always were a bit like, Oh it’s just luck .” But the other sailors, who had less of a personal stake in their victory, began to begrudgingly admit early on that “the girls aren’t doing too bad.”
She continued, “They didn’t really have an ax to grind, so they were like, okay, you’re in the race—and still, a lot of journalists didn’t like it. I find it so weird still. The male journalists who loved the sport were very easily persuaded because they want what’s best for the sport. The male chauvinists who were entrenched in their doctrine, they would never change their minds—even if every other boat dropped out and we were the only boat that finished.” Shaking her head, Edwards offered that she’s not sure how much has changed in thirty years, saying, “I don’t think we’re anywhere near where we need to be.”
Edwards pointed out two moments in the documentary that were particularly hard for her to watch. The first is an interview in which she is quick to insist that she is not a feminist. “I do watch it and I go, Oh God, please don't say…Oh, you’ve said it ,” she told The Daily Beast. “Men had made it into a terrible word. No one would be caught dead being called a feminist. My mom was there when I was being interviewed, and she said that’s not a very good thing to say. And I said, mom, it’s just a horrible word and I hate it, and she said, but it’s everything you are and what you’re fighting for.”
Later on in the film, Edwards explains how her feminist consciousness was nurtured in large part by the bitter Maiden backlash. “I was having a battle that I didn’t know I was having until I started having it,” she told The Daily Beast. “I just thought people would go, you can’t do it, and then leave us alone. But it didn’t go quite like that.”
The second difficult moment is when Edwards and the crew, disappointed by their performance in a leg, decide to don their bathing suits at the finish to distract from their results. Edwards’ embarrassment speaks to a possible generational gap; whereas some viewers will applaud the crew members turning the male gaze to their advantage, Edwards worries that she “let other women down” with the stunt. She recalled, “When we first did it, I thought, great, we look brilliant. You know, we needed to cheer ourselves up cause I was so depressed like, oh, I was almost suicidal. But as we’ve gone through the years…we all winced when we watched that part of the documentary.” “ I wanted to show them that women’s success is not pretty. Sometimes it’s hard and difficult. ”
Thirty years later, Edwards is able to easily joke about the massive amount of stress that she was under. But at the time, as Maiden makes clear, she struggled with feelings of guilt and isolation onboard. Edwards determined the navigation of the boat, which made her largely responsible both for their successes and their failures. She barely slept, poring over tactical decisions and putting herself under immense pressure.
At that point in her life, Edwards was not always pleasant to be around, and was not the most temperate of leaders—something that she’s well aware of. Once Holmes began reaching out to the other Maiden crew members for the film, Edwards started getting calls asking “how honest” they should be with him. “And I went, let’s just do it, warts and all,” Edwards recalled. “A couple of the girls said to me, you said to be honest, I was a little bit more honest than I thought I was going to be, and you may not like it. I’m like, Oh no, I know, I know how awful I was. Please don't apologize! ” She laughed. “I didn’t want to ever watch this film and go, Ah, that’s not strictly true . No matter how uncomfortable—and it was uncomfortable for me!”
Shortly after the Maiden’s historic Whitbread finish, the crew participated in their first documentary. At the time, Edwards explained, “We were in protective mode of us and Maiden and we couldn’t have anyone saying anything like, Oh, they didn’t get o n, or anything like that. So it was very positive and upbeat and it was a bit schmaltzy.”
Telling the true story of the Maiden, without having conflicts reduced to catfights or struggles glossed over, strikes Edwards as an opportunity to show young women what success really looks like. “What I find so sickening about what girls have to deal with today is how perfect they have to be to do anything. How you look, how you dress. And I wanted to show them that women’s success is not pretty. Sometimes it’s hard and difficult. And you can only say that afterwards. We could never have said that as we were going through it, we would have been annihilated.”
Post-Maiden, Edwards has lived many lives, showing a penchant for reinvention. In addition to the documentary, she’s recently spearheaded the restoration of Maiden, which is now being put to use raising money and awareness for girls’ access to education. “It became really about Maiden inspiring the next generation,” she said. “We don’t say the words ‘we’re creating social activists’ because teachers tend to get a little bit funny about that, but what we hope we’re doing is teaching girls to understand that other girls don’t have an education, and to think about the world and how they can change it.”
All of these efforts are very much connected to Maiden’s legacy, and what Edwards and her crew accomplished at Whitbread. But Edwards, who has expressed disillusionment with the sport in past interviews, insisted that she doesn’t see the Maiden Factor as a “sailing project.”
“I’m not part of that world anymore,” she maintained. “I still love the ocean. I’m not too enamored with being part of the racing world, with sailing, I find it not a pleasant place to be a lot of the time. I think I can fight battles that will help women in sailing, but I don’t have to be in that environment.” The fact that the first woman to ever be awarded the Yachtsman of the Year trophy has actively chosen to maintain her outsider status speaks for itself. Maiden may have made history, but the rest of the racing world is still catching up."

From different cleaning modes to direct control and scheduling, she’ll be able to fully customize her vacuuming experience using the free app for the vacuum or channeling it through her smart devices (if she doesn’t have those, scroll up in this article). The robot will clean for up to two hours on a single charge and returns automatically to its base to charge when it needs to or when she’ll tell it to. Considering the ease-of-use, smart home functionality, and low-profile and sleek design, this is a perfect Mother’s Day gift.

Trump Spends Morning Promoting Far-Right Fringe,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau) kelly.weill@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Weill),05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-spends-morning-promoting-far-right-fringe,"05.04.19 9:41 AM ET REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque
President Donald Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning to retweet a number of well known far-right extremists, some of whom were recently banned from Facebook. Among them, InfoWars’ London editor Paul Joseph Watson who was banned from the social media platform on Friday along with the program host Alex Jones.
Trump retweeted Watson’s Friday tweet, in which he linked to a YouTube video rant and wrote, “‘Dangerous’. My opinions? Or giving a handful of giant partisan corporations the power to decide who has free speech? You decide.”
On Friday, Trump had warned against censorship of American citizens. “I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms,” he tweeted. “This is the United States of America—and we have what’s known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH!” Trump wrote in a tweet. “We are monitoring and watching, closely!!””
Watson, who is a British citizen, retweeted the president’s tweet.
The president’s love didn’t stop with Watson. Trump retweeted an incendiary missive by Mindy Robinson, host of ‘Red, White, and F You: Unapologetically Patriotic’ in which she wrote of her disappointment that actor activist James Woods, was among those banned from Twitter. “So James Woods was kicked off Twitter for quoting Ralph Waldo Emerson...but @TalbertSwan the racist fake man of God, that’s SUPPOSED to be permanently banned for hate speech is back on? What have you to say @jack @Twitter ?”
Robinson’s tweet failed to mention the real reason Woods was kicked off Twitter. His tweet that “quoted Ralph Waldo Emerson” ended on a decidedly non-Emersonian call to “#HangThemAll.” The hashtag violates Twitter policies about promoting violence.
The president also retweeted Lauren Southern, a Canadian far-right extremist and self-described patriot who has spent time in Europe protesting the use of nongovernmental organization rescue ships. She was also part of a group that promised to “hunt migrants” traveling from the coast of North Africa to Italy.
The president retweeted her Friday tweet, in which she wrote, “Lmao at establishment conservatives who think they won’t be labeled the new “dangerous” / “extremist” voices when those to the right of them are all banned. Good luck with that one guys.” The tweet ended with an emoji sometimes associated with a white power hand signal.
Trump also retweeted an anti-Muslim video by an account that promotes QAnon, a wild conspiracy theory that falsely accuses Trump’s opponents of being involved in Satanic child sex-trafficking and cannibalism. Trump has previously retweeted the same account, which uses the spike in traffic to promote the author’s fringe conspiracy books.
Trump ended the Saturday morning tirade with his own warning. “When will the Radical Left Wing Media apologize to me for knowingly getting the Russia Collusion Delusion story so wrong?” he tweeted. “The real story is about to happen! Why is @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN, @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter & Facebook. Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!” READ THIS LIST"
Kim Jong Un Fires a Missile. Is This the Return of ‘Rocket Man’?,www.thedailybeast.com,Ankit Panda,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kim-jong-un-fires-a-missile-is-this-the-return-of-rocket-man,"FIREWORKS Kim Jong Un Fires a Missile. Is This the Return of ‘Rocket Man’? When confidence building doesn’t work, a bit of confidence busting is in order. That’s now happening on both sides. Kim is showing his patience is limited. And so is Trump. 05.04.19 1:22 PM ET REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov
North Korea launched a missile for the first time in 522 days on Saturday morning, but it’s hard to be surprised. And much will depend on Washington’s reaction.
In a speech in April , North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made it clear that he wasn’t happy with the way the last summit with U.S. President Donald J. Trump, in Hanoi, had turned out.
There, it became obvious that the grand bargain for North Korea to give up, in one stroke, all its nuclear weapons and delivery systems in exchange for a complete lifting of sanctions and massive aid—which Trump wanted to claim was a done deal after his first meeting with Kim last year—is not at all what Kim has in mind. His preference has long been a gradual step-by-step approach, building trust and confidence along the way. That process can last for years, leaving Pyongyang’s nuclear program still fundamentally intact in the short-run.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met with Kim last month, supports confidence-building gradualism. Putin’s office says he told Trump as much in their long phone call on Friday , “stressing that Pyongyang’s good-faith fulfilment of its commitments should be accompanied by reciprocal steps to ease the sanctions pressure on North Korea.”
So, when confidence building doesn’t work, a bit of confidence busting is in order, and that’s now happening on both sides. Kim’s making clear that his patience is limited. “Trump staked his deal-making reputation on the claim that his agreement to meet with with Kim at least ended North Korea’s missile launches.”
Kim reallywasn’t happy with two specific recent developments: the fact that the United States and South Korea had pushed ahead with military exercises and that the U.S. conducted an apparently successful missile defense test against a target that was designed to simulate an intercontinental-range ballistic missile (ICBM) of the sort that might be launched by North Korea in a war.
Kim warned that these actions—just additional evidence, in North Korea’s view, of the United States’ decades-long so-called “hostile policy” against it—would “bring our corresponding acts.” The basis for a tit-for-tat had been set up.
While Saturday’s launches will have evoked unpleasant memories for the residents of Seoul and Tokyo, who spent 2016 and 2017 waking up every couple to news of North Korean missile launches, it wasn’t the first sign of Kim’s turn toward his old ways. In April, the North Korean leader presided over a “tactical” weapon test—one that was carefully calibrated to not rise to the level of a missile launch resulting in major news alerts the world over.
Whatever Kim launched on Saturday, South Korea’s military managed to pick it up on its terrestrial radars. That led to the release of a statement that North Korea had launched “short-range missiles” early on Saturday. This alert was later revised by South Korean authorities to the more anodyne-sounding word “projectiles.”
Not all projectiles are missiles, but all missiles are projectiles. There’s a particular sensitivity around the word “missile,” especially if you’re South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has put his credibility on the line with his North Korea diplomacy.
Trump staked his own deal-making reputation on the claim that his agreement to meet with with Kim at least ended North Korea’s missile launches.
So, Saturday’s actions could mark a tipping point, and we might imagine a return to the days of “fire and fury” last seen in the second half of 2017 should the White House overreact.
A little more than one year ago, Kim unilaterally announced that North Korea would no longer test ICBMs—not in this case to build confidence with the United States, but because Kim claimed the technology had been fully validated over the course of testing in 2017.
Trump would cling to Kim’s promise–and oversell it. At the press conference after the collapse of the Hanoi summit, Trump claimed Kim said “he’s not going to do testing of rockets or missiles or anything having to do with nuclear.”
We don’t know what Kim may have told Trump privately, but his commitment in public only barred him from testing the real big missiles: the ones capable of reaching the United States.
What’s true of whatever North Korea tested on Saturday is that it is assuredly not a nuclear-capable system. North Korea’s known nuclear warhead designs are too large to be fitted comfortably onto whatever short-range projectiles were fired off on Saturday. That’s an important distinction, and a signal or gradualism. In the same vein, Kim also withheld any nuclear-capable assets from his parade in September 2018, right before his third summit with Moon Jae-in.
Now, he's only testing “tactical” systems and short-range weapons—ones without a clear nuclear role. If the White House chooses to seize on that salient fact, it could keep a fig leaf on the negotiating process. In effect, the tests are similar to the way North Korea often has reacted to major U.S.-South Korea exercises.
Saturday’s launches also are about more than just Trump and the United States. For Kim there are domestic issues. The launches convey a degree of seriousness about national defense after the embarrassment he faced in Hanoi.
In March, North Korea’s First Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Choe Son Hui told diplomats gathered in Pyongyang that Kim had faced “petitions” from domestic groups, including “officials of the munitions industry,” warning him not to go to Hanoi to talk to the United States.
But in this scenario Kim Jong Un went out on a limb and ended up with nothing. Since his return, not only has Kim conducted two significant weapons tests, he has underscored the importance of national defense.
In the same speech last month where he criticized the United States, Kim emphasized the importance of a “self-reliant national defense” for North Korea and several prominent officials known to be associated with North Korea’s missile programs were seen for the first time in state media reports since 2017. The rocket-men were back.
In South Korea, Saturday’s launches will give ammunition to critics of Moon’s engagement with Kim. In particular, critics will argue that Kim’s move represents a clear violation of the spirit and the letter of the September 19, 2018, inter-Korean Comprehensive Military Agreement, which has seen remarkable successes in implementation so far.
Article 1 of that agreement commits both sides to cease all “hostile acts” against each other; North Korea’s launches are in violation. In Pyongyang’s view, the recent defensive U.S.-South Korea exercises—particularly a recent joint aerial exercise—are also evidence of Seoul violating the pact.
None of this portends well for the course of diplomacy this year, but for the moment it does not shut any doors. North Korea has set a clock ticking for the end of the year. As Kim warned in his New Year’s Day message even before the Hanoi summit, the United States only had so much time before North Korea’s patience would run out. Saturday’s launches are yet another reminder to Trump about what stands to be lost: this time it was a small missile, but it might not be so small in a matter of weeks or months.
U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen E. Biegun is bound for Seoul and Tokyo in the coming days, where he'll coordinate with allies. Meanwhile, National Security Advisor John Bolton, the greatest skeptic of engagement with North Korea, may seek to derail the route back to diplomacy.
Since Hanoi, Bolton has been conspicuously doing the rounds on Sunday talk shows, making clear that the administration is far from interested in the kind of step-by-step denuclearization process that North Korea has made apparent is the only way forward.
The realities of negotiating with North Korea are setting in now after Hanoi. If Trump thought he and Kim were in “love” last year, he may find now that it was more of a fleeting infatuation. The hard work that will be necessary to make their relationship work—and realize a third date—lies ahead. READ THIS LIST"
Scouted: Don’t Discount BAGGU’s Leather Goods Because This Bucket Bag Is Damn Good,www.thedailybeast.com,jillian.lucas@thedailybeast.com (Jillian Lucas),05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-baggu-drawstring-bucket-bag-is-a-great-everyday-bag,"Scouted By The Beast
BAGGU may be synonymous with their reusable tote bags, but their leather goods are pretty spectacular, as well. While cleaning out my closet the other day, I found their Drawstring Purse hiding and I decided to take it out of retirement. Boy, did I miss this thing.
It’s incredibly roomy (I can fit a small travel umbrella) but doesn’t feel too big or clunky even on my smaller frame. I tie the strap of mine to keep it as a shoulder bag rather than a crossbody, but you can always leave it long and throw it over your head. I have one of the first versions that has two side pulls to close it, but the new ones have a classic pull-cinch closure. The leather itself is incredibly soft but the flat, rounded bottom gives it a sturdy base for when you want to set it down on a table or the floor. It’s thick enough to feel like you don’t need to be too gentle with it, which is great for an everyday bag.
When it comes to simple, utilitarian bags, BAGGU reigns supreme. Both with their nylon reusable shoppers (of which I have at least five) and their sleek leather goods (I’m eyeing the Medium Leather Retail Tote as my next purchase), the brand is a powerhouse of minimalist style that looks and feels luxurious but will work as hard as you do.

Sink vs. Sink: South Carolina Lawyer Sues Son for Starting Law Firm With Their Shared Name,www.thedailybeast.com,kelly.weill@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Weill),05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lawyer-sues-son-for-starting-law-firm-with-their-shared-name,"LIKE FATHER LIKE... Sink vs. Sink: South Carolina Lawyer Sues Son for Starting Law Firm With Their Shared Name George Sink Jr. might be the son’s legal name—but it’s weird for him to use it, his father alleges. 05.04.19 4:51 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
Like father, like son, as the saying goes. Unless the son is too much like the father, and both are lawyers, in which case the father might sue the son for trademark infringement.
That’s the case with a pair of South Carolina lawyers. The father-son combo, both named George Sink, used to work together. But when George Sink Jr. left the firm in February, he launched his own practice with a similar name. The move constitutes trademark infringement, unfair competition, cybersquatting, unfair trade practice, and dilution, the elder Sink alleges in a new lawsuit.
Until February 2019, both men worked at George Sink, P.A. Injury Lawyers, a large South Carolina firm with a catchy advertising jingle, according to Charleston’s Post and Courier . A lawyer like his father, Sink Jr. began handling client cases in March 2018 until his termination in February 2019, according to the lawsuit.
“George Sink PA Injury Lawyers® has been forced to bring suit to protect consumers of legal services,” the elder Sink’s lawyers told The Daily Beast in a statement. “The marks exist to protect consumers from the confusion and misdirection caused by infringement. The lawsuit is intended to serve these consumer interests.”
The suit does not state why Sink Jr. lost his job.
But days after the termination, the son launched an LLC. And recently, the elder Sink learned his son was using “the designation GEORGE SINK II in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, and/or marketing of legal services in the same geographical regions as Plaintiff—namely, South Carolina and Georgia,” the lawsuit alleges.
George Sink Jr. might be the son’s legal name—but it’s weird for him to use it, his father alleges.
“To the extent ‘George T. Sink, Jr.’ is Ted Sink’s legal name, on information and belief, Ted Sink has throughout his life preferred the use of his middle name and gone by ‘Ted’ or ‘Teddy,’” the suit alleges. It includes pictures of social media were the son goes by “Ted.”
“The goal is not to keep ‘Ted’ Sink from practicing law,” his father’s lawyers said in their statement. “He’s been a lawyer for two and one-half years, and we wish him well with his new law firm. However, when consumers look for George Sink PA Injury Lawyers®, they must be confident they will find the firm they seek.”
But Sink Jr. has every right to call himself by his legal name, his lawyers say.
""This is the name that appears on his birth certificate, driver’s license, Yale undergraduate degree and on his law degree, as well as on his licenses to practice law in South Carolina and Georgia,"" they told The Daily Beast in a statement.
""It was George Sink, Sr. who first introduced George Sink, Jr. to the legal community as George Sink. Whether trademark law permits a father to take back his son’s name or restrict his right to practice law is an issue we would forward to litigating through the Courts.""
Furthermore, the elder Sink has referred to his son as ""George"" in old commercials. One tv commercial, uploaded to YouTube last year shows the father and son standing side by side.
""I'm attorney George Sink,"" the elder says, and this is my son.
""Attorney George Sink,"" the younger introduces himself.
The ad spells their names as ""George Sink"" and ""George Sink Jr.""
His father, meanwhile, says the common names have been a nightmare for Google searches.
“As a result of the overlap in the business names and geographical location of Plaintiff’s and Defendants’ Google business listings, Plaintiff’s business listing was flagged by Google and suspended,” the suit alleges. The older company’s Google listing allegedly disappeared for two weeks, wiping out more than 600 positive reviews until the firm could restore it.
Meanwhile, search results appear positive for Sink Jr. Since the lawsuit was first reported by local outlets this week, the George Sink II Law Firm has received its first two Google reviews, both five stars. Neither user left a comment. Google does not check reviews for authenticity.
The younger Sink’s firm has its own website. At the bottom, along with standard legal jargon, the page also includes an unusual disclaimer:
“This firm is not at all associated with George Sink, P.A. Injury Lawyers or George Sink, Sr. (well, besides the founder of George Sink Law Firm, LLC being the son of and former employee of George Sink, Sr.).” READ THIS LIST"

Kentucky Derby Winner Maximum Security Disqualified After Objections,www.thedailybeast.com,Audrey.McNamara@thedailybeast.com (Audrey McNamara),05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kentucky-derby-2019-maximum-security-disqualified-country-house-named-official-winner,"UNPRECEDENTED Kentucky Derby Unofficial Winner Maximum Security Disqualified in Huge Upset For the first time in 145 years, the horse that crossed the finish line first was disqualified, and the 65-1 longshot was declared the winner. 05.04.19 7:29 PM ET Jerry Lai/Reuters
The Kentucky Derby has disqualified its unofficial winner, Maximum Security, for an alleged infraction that occurred during the race—the first disqualification of this kind in the history of the race.
The official Kentucky Derby Twitter account tweeted after the race: “For the first time in 145 years, the horse who finished first in the Kentucky Derby was disqualified.”
Maximum Security, a horse owned by billionaire philanthropist Gary West, had been the favorite in early betting and had previously won the Florida Derby. After objections, however, a horse named Country House, the 65-1 longshot, was officially named the winner. Only one other horse has ever been disqualified as the winner.
An objection review was filed by the team behind Country House, the number two horse. The review was called to determine if Maximum Security had bumped into Country House as the two horses were coming around the final turn. Country House was coming in hot for the lead as the horses ran into the stretch. The review lasted more than 10 minutes and changed the end of the biggest annual moment in professional horse racing.
Country House’s trainer, Bill Mott, answered questions about the disqualification during a winner’s press conference after the race.
“You always want to win with a clean trip... and recognize the athleticism of the horse... Due to the disqualification, I think some of that is diminished,” Mott said. “I know the stewards had a very very difficult decision... that being said, I’m damn glad they put our number up.”
Asked if race rules were possibly followed too closely, in light of the Kentucky Derby’s importance, Mott said he believed officials made the right decision.
“I think the Stewards, in my opinion, made the right call... if it was an ordinary race on a Wednesday they would have taken the winner down.”
When asked, Mott refused to place blame for Maximum Security allegedly interfering with the path of other horses on the jockey, Luis Saez.
Saez, a 27-year-old jockey with over 2,000 wins, won the Florida Derby on Maximum Security earlier this year.
“I think the horse did this on his own... I don’t think Luis Saez did anything intentionally,” Mott said. “Luis is a friend of mine, he rides with me, my heart actually aches for them—I’ve been on the other end of this plenty of times, just not in the Kentucky Derby.” READ THIS LIST"

Rachel Held Evans, a hugely popular progressive Christian writer, has died at the age of 37 after being hospitalized last month for flu complications.
Evans had tweeted from the hospital as recently as April 14, alerting her over 160,000 Twitter followers of her condition. “If you’re the praying type - I’m in the hospital with a flu + UTI combo and a severe allergic reaction to the antibiotics they gave me. (I’m totally going to miss GOT!).”
Evans entered the hospital in mid-April with the flu but her condition rapidly deteriorated after she suffered a severe allergic reaction to antibiotics. She developed sustained seizures as a result of the reaction, ultimately leading to swelling in her brain, according to her husband Dan Evans.
Dan regularly updated his wife's devoted followers on her condition under a page titled, “ Rachel's Health Updates ” on a section of her website. His updates documented the dizzying downward spiral Evan’s health took after she first began exhibiting “unexpected symptoms” on April 19, from a medically induced coma to control her seizures to a frantic scramble by doctors to save her after “sudden and extreme changes in her vitals” shortly before her death.
She died early Saturday morning on May 4, from “severe damage” caused by brain swelling that “ultimately was not survivable,” her husband wrote.
“This entire experience is surreal. I keep hoping it’s a nightmare from which I’ll awake. I feel like I’m telling someone else’s story. I cannot express how much the support means to me and our kids,” her husband wrote in his last post. “... We are privileged. Rachel’s presence in this world was a gift to us all and her work will long survive her.”
Throughout her career, Evans worked tirelessly to challenge fundamentalist evangelicalism. She became a hugely popular author by tackling subjects typically left unchallenged by those in the evangelical faith. In her own words, she wrote about “faith, doubt and life in the Bible Belt,” according to her website bio.
She began writing online during the onset of blogs in 2006, gaining traction as a young voice among the traditionally older evangelical crowd. Evans eventually left the Evangelical Church in response to its activism against same-sex marriage. She instead joined the Episcopal Church , and continued to write about her love for the Bible and faith. Her writing often discussed the gender imbalance in church leadership, and questioned a literal reading of the Bible. Recently, she critiqued the widespread evangelical support for President Trump.
A New York Times best-selling author, Evans' four books include Faith Unraveled, A Year of Biblical Womanhood , Searching for Sunday , and most recently, Inspired , published in 2018.
Shealsoserved on President Obama’s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships during his second term, and traveled the country as a speaker at religious and academic institutions alike.
As news spread of her illness, Evans' fans, as well as some religious leaders—many of whom she had challenged in the past—took to social media to express their support, and eventual grief.
So well known in Christian circles, many referred to Evans online simply as “RHE.” The hashtag #PrayforRHE became a trending topic on Twitter earlier this month, and again on Saturday. And a GoFundMe page created on April 22 to cover her family's expenses has raised almost $150,000.
Writer Sarah Bessey shared on Twitter that her close friend was surrounded by family and friends at the time of her death. Bessey ended the post by praising Evans as “eshet chayil,” which translates to “woman of valor” in Hebrew.
“She put others before herself,” her husband said in an email to The Washington Post on Saturday. “She shared her platform. She always remembered how others had helped her. She enjoyed seeing other people in contexts where they thrived. She didn’t hold grudges, would forget as well as forgive. She had little time for pettiness and a big heart for people. And these are all things I wish I had told her more while I still had the privilege to keep her company.”
In Evans' last blog post titled “Lent for the Lamenting,” published March 6 (Ash Wednesday on the Christian calendar), she discussed how we all share in the inevitability of death.
“Whether you are part of a church or not... whether you are a Christian or an atheist or an agnostic or a so-called ‘none’... you know this truth deep in your bones: ‘Remember that you are dust and to dust you will return,’” she wrote. “Death is a part of life. My prayer for you this season is that you make time to celebrate that reality, and to grieve that reality, and that you will know you are not alone.” READ THIS LIST"
"Adam Sandler Returns to SNL, Sings ‘I Was Fired’ With Chris Rock",www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/adam-sandler-returns-to-snl-sings-i-got-fired-with-chris-rock,"HE'S BACK Adam Sandler Returns to SNL, Sings ‘I Was Fired’ With Chris Rock “I was fired, I was fired, NBC said that I was done,” he concluded. “Then I made over $4 billion at the box office so I guess you could say I won.” Justin Baragona 05.05.19 12:44 AM ET
24 years after getting canned from the show that helped propel him to superstardom, Adam Sandler returned to Saturday Night Live to host the long-running sketch comedy program for the first time ever.
And he poked fun at the way he departed the show back in 1995, with a little help from an old castmate.
Following a cold open that featured the casts of current pop culture phenomenons The Avengers and Game of Thrones facing off on Family Feud , Sandler took the SNL stage for his opening monologue. Reminiscing about the old days, the Happy Gilmore star joked that he lost his virginity in “this very studio.”
“I don’t kiss and tell, but it was the church lady, she said I was special,” Sandler quipped.
Noting that he’s told everyone his SNL tenure was the “greatest time in my life,” the 52-year-old funnyman said his daughter asked him why he ever left, prompting him to break out into song to give the reason.
“I was fired, I was fired, I was fired so sad to tell,” Sandler sang. “I never saw it coming I got fired by SNL . Between seasons I heard a nasty rumor that I was getting the sack, I tried to call Lorne Michaels but he never called me back.”
He interjected, “I’m joking. I’m joking. He called, he called.”
Going back to his little ditty, Sandler crooned that NBC may have had enough of his trademark characters such as Canteen Boy before the Jewish comedian added: “But I think they just hate the Jews.”
After impersonating the late Chris Farley telling him SNL “fired my ass too,” Sandler welcomed on former castmate and Grown Ups co-star Chris Rock -- who also recounted his time getting fired from the show.
“I was fired by NBC then I went on In Living Color, three weeks later they took it off TV,” Rock sang.
Current SNL cast member Pete Davidson then jumped onstage to sing about being fired, causing Sandler to interrupt and tell him he wasn’t.
“I wasn’t, how’s that even possible?” Davidson wondered.
“I don’t know, man,” Sandler answered. “You just be patient ‘cause it’s coming soon.”
Sandler wrapped up his comedic song by noting he got the last laugh.
“I was fired, I was fired, NBC said that I was done,” he concluded. “Then I made over $4 billion at the box office so I guess you could say I won.” READ THIS LIST"
The Hezbollah Sleeper Agent Who Allegedly Ran Black-Ops in America,www.thedailybeast.com,michael.daly@thedailybeast.com (Michael Daly),05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ali-kourani-the-hezbollah-sleeper-agent-who-allegedly-ran-black-ops-in-america,"MOONLIGHTING The Hezbollah Sleeper Agent Busted for Black Ops in America Ali Kourani allegedly helped a global terrorist network plot revenge against the U.S. from a home in the Bronx. He was undone after running a stop sign with 190 pairs of Uggs. 05.05.19 12:05 AM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty/LinkedIn
Naomi Rodriguez is an emergency medical technician who works 12-hour shifts in the streets of The Bronx, so she immediately recognized the irony when the unremarkable-looking man who lived one floor above her was alleged to be a terrorist sleeper agent.
“I save lives, and here’s this one trying to take them,” she remarked this week from the doorway of her apartment on West 238th Street in the borough’s Kingsbridge Heights section.
Neither Ali Kourani’s attire nor demeanor gave any hint of his religion or ideology.
“How do you say, it’s just unexpected,” Rodriguez added. “Very unexpected.”
She recalled that at the time of his arrest last June, the news called 34-year-old Kourani “the Kingsbridge Heights Terrorist.” But he was not just another lone wolf inspired to Islamic radicalism by internet hate sites and following online instructions to build a bomb in the kitchen of his mom.
As will become clear when he goes on trial Monday, this seemingly unremarkable man whom Rodriguez saw in the stairway is alleged to have been a longtime undercover operative for an international terrorist organization.
Kourani had allegedly been recruited as part of a plan to exact revenge for the car-bomb killing of a terror mastermind whom a former CIA agent called “probably the most intelligent, most capable operative we’ve ever run across, including the KGB or anybody else.” Kourani was, by his own multiple admissions, trained in explosives and small arms, along with secure communications, survival and interrogation as a member of Hezbollah’s External Security Organization (ESO), also known as the Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO). Or simply 910.
“Or Hezbollah black ops,” the FBI adds in court papers.
Kourani was born in Lebanon in June 1984 to a family he claims has connections with Hezbollah. He has told the FBI that his clan were “the bin Ladens of Lebanon.” He was 16 when his familial social stature enabled him to attend a 45-day terror boot camp.
“During the training, Kourani was taught to fire AK-47 assault rifles and rocket launchers, as well as basic military tactics, by Hezbollah personnel wearing uniforms,” a subsequent criminal complaint says.
In 2003, at the age of 19, he emigrated to the U.S.. He lived in a two-family house in Queens, and studied biomedical engineering at the City University of New York. The course of his life was to change when Imad Mughniyah—second in command of Hezbollah and founding head of its military, intelligence and security wing—was killed in Damascus in 2008. “These sleepers were tasked to maintain ostensibly normal lives the world over who could be tasked with operational activity should the ESO decide to take action.” — FBI
Mughniyah was behind the 1983 truck bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that killed seven CIA operatives along with 10 other Americans, as well as the truck bombing of the Marine barracks there later that year that killed 240. His full list of killings includes the 1985 torture and murder of Beirut CIA station chief William Buckley, the torture and killing of an American sailor aboard a hijacked airliner later that year, and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. Air Force personnel.
Add to that the killing of several hundred Israelis. Not surprisingly, Hezbollah blamed the U.S.and Israel for the killing of its mastermind and vowed revenge. Kourani would tell the FBI that Hezbollah sought to do so by copying an Israeli tactic that had long been used by the Russians, and was later portrayed in the TV series The Americans .
“Kourani stated that the ESO wanted to copy the Israeli Mossad and sought to recruit ‘sleepers,’” an FBI report says. “These sleepers were tasked to maintain ostensibly normal lives the world over… [and] could be tasked with operational activity should the ESO decide to take action.”
Kourani was in Lebanon visiting his family when a cleric in his home village recruited him for the new effort, likely because of his education and the fact that he was already rooted in the U.S.. He was a perfect candidate for a “sleeper,” a seemingly ordinary person leading a normal life who could be activated to carry out terrorist acts when called.
The new recruit was instructed to don a helmet with a blacked-out visor. He was driven to meet the man who would allegedly be his handler.
“Whom Kourani knew as ‘Fadi,’” the criminal complaint says. “Fadi typically wore a mask during their meetings.”
The complaint details one of Fadi’s first instructions: “Obtain United States citizenship and a U.S. passport as soon as possible.”
Kourani fulfilled the first part of that mission in April of 2009. He applied for a passport the following week, and for a visa to China a week later. He is said to have flown in to Guangzhou, the location of a company that manufactures purported first aid ice packs that contain ammonium nitrate, an active ingredient in explosives. A large number of these “ice packs” would subsequently be found in Hezbollah bomb factories in Thailand and Cyprus. Guangzhou is also a major center for counterfeit clothing, which has been described as a major source of income for Hezbollah.
That same month, Kourani received his bachelor’s degree back in New York. He went on to receive an MBA from Keller Graduate School, making his cover all the more convincing.
In 2011, Fadi summoned Kourani to Lebanon for military training. He returned to the U.S. and allegedly followed Fadi’s instructions to identify possible sources of weapons and to research how to open businesses in New York that Hezbollah could use.
“As cover for the storage of firearms intended for ESO assassinations and attacks in the U.S.,” the FBI report explains.
Kourani was further asked to scout out the security around the Israeli consulate in New York and identify Jewish businessmen in the city who were former or current members of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) for “either assassination or recruitment purposes,” according to the FBI report.
The list of surveillance targets is also said to have included the federal building in Manhattan where the FBI has its offices and a Secret Service facility in Brooklyn. Kourani allegedly made videos of a U.S. Army Armory in Manhattan, and JFK airport.
In the meantime, he and his wife had two children. One of the kids triggered a brief interruption in the e-mail communications he maintained with his handler via a Toshiba laptop. “His daughter spilled something on it,” an FBI report says.
The Toshiba was destroyed, but Kourani purchased an Apple laptop and allegedly continued his double life. He might have been the perfect sleeper had he not gone into the counterfeit clothing business. He was caught with 190 pairs of Ugg boots after he ran a stop sign in Queens in November 2013.
“I make about two dollars per pair,” the resulting police report quotes him saying. “I buy them for 20 dollars.”
The arrest prompted the NYPD Intelligence Division to interview Kourani on a number of occasions. He came to the further attention of law enforcement in September of 2015, when arriving from a trip to Lebanon back to the same airport he had extensively surveilled.
“Law enforcement personnel determined that Kourani’s cellphone did not contain a memory card, but found a memory card secreted under a travel sticker affixed to Kourani’s U.S. passport,” the complaint reports.
Kourani had gone seven years as an alleged sleeper agent without being activated in any operational capacity. He deduced that the most likely reason was Hezbollah’s 2015 discovery that Mohammad Shawraba, the very man in charge of external operations and the revenge mission in particular, was an Israeli mole. Shawraba was said to have sabotaged numerous attack plans while the sleeper agents slumbered on.
On April 1, 2016—“April’s Fools Day,” Kourani would note—he stopped into his regular Starbucks in Queens. A man approached and showed him an FBI badge.
“We know your affiliation with Hezbollah,’” the agent said.
“You most likely have the wrong person,” Kourani said.
At a McDonald’s next door, the agent handed him a file folder containing a cellphone.
“I'm going to reach you at that phone number,” the agent said. “Make sure that no one knows that you have that phone.”
The FBI repeatedly called Kourani over the days ahead to arrange meetings, during which they urged him to become an informant.
The day then came when an attorney Kourani had retained left a voicemail message with the FBI.
In a series of meetings at his lawyer’s office, Kourani is said to have told the agents about his life as a sleeper agent, but the FBI remained convinced he was not telling all he knew. The agents sought to shake more out of him.
On June 1, 2018, the agents quietly arrested him up in the Bronx, where he was living with relatives after separating from his wife. He was booked on eight counts of terrorism-related offenses at the same federal building he had surveilled for Hezbollah, but waived a court appearance and the criminal complaint was sealed. He was held overnight at a nearby Marriott Hotel.
“We thought keeping him there in custody versus in a prison would help preserve the possibility of cooperation,” the agent would testify.
The next day, the agents and prosecutors concluded that Kourani was still holding back and would not make a reliable informant. He was brought to court and the criminal complaint against him was unsealed. He was held without bail.
Search warrants were executed for his emails and internet history, as well as his Bronx apartment above Naomi Rodriguez. Agents there found lined notebook paper on which Kourani appeared to have handwritten notes in English concerning what he wanted from the FBI, including cash and an apartment in a Manhattan building with a doorman.
Kourani retained a new lawyer, Alexei Schacht, who sought to suppress what amounted to a multi-installment confession. The judge ruled the statements to the FBI admissible and they are expected to be used against him at the trial set to commence Monday. “At the end of the day he was still willing to answer that phone call and do what they asked. ... Being willing is just as guilty.” — Naomi Rodriguez
Up in the Bronx, Rodriguez told The Daily Beast that Kourani was living directly above her with a cousin and the cousin’s teenage son.
She described the teenager as, “a good kid… really good,” adding, “We don't have an elevator. When I do food shopping, he helps me carry some bags or helps me with the shopping cart.”
She could only remember seeing Kourani once, as she is seldom home, leaving early to work 12-hour shifts as an EMT and returning late from attending school to become a paramedic. She is also raising two boys of her own, aged 10 and 4.
Of the accused terror sleeper agent who was her upstairs neighbor, she observed, “At the end of the day he was still willing to answer that phone call and do what they asked. You’re saying, ‘Okay, call me when you need me.’”
She added, “Being willing is just as guilty.” READ THIS LIST"
"Virtuoso Pastry Chef Milton Abel on Fatherhood, Jazz, and His Life’s Greatest Regret",www.thedailybeast.com,Pervaiz.Shallwani@thedailybeast.com (Pervaiz Shallwani),05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/thats-my-jazz-virtuoso-pastry-chef-milton-abel-on-fatherhood-jazz-and-his-lifes-greatest-regret,"GOING ALL THE WAY Virtuoso Pastry Chef Milton Abel on Fatherhood, Jazz, and His Life’s Greatest Regret The star of the short film ‘That’s My Jazz,’ premiering at the Tribeca Film Festival, Milton Abel discusses fatherhood, food, and growing up the son of a jazz music legend. 05.04.19 11:54 PM ET Tribeca Film Festival
To Milton Abel Jr., a chocolate tart is just five ingredients: milk, cream, dark chocolate, milk chocolate and eggs. “But when you eat it,” he notes, “there’s no way you think it’s just five ingredients.”
Yes, the technique sounds simple, but for it to work, the tart shell must be crisp and warm when the custard is poured. The temperature must be turned low when it goes back in the oven so it cooks from the inside out. “It’s that little difference that makes all the difference in the world,” Abel says, leading to a cookie-like crust and a silky center.
“To give that to someone and they can’t even realize what’s gone into it is just nice and exciting. It just seems effortless,” Abel says. “It’s very similar to a jazz solo . These guys are just moving up and down the strings. Dad used to do this thing where he would scat and play at the same time. Him and the bass were like singing together. It looked effortless and it sounded effortless, cause he’s playing what’s he’s singing at the exact same time. They’re moving together.”
In pastry circles, Abel is as accomplished as they come, a protégé of Thomas Keller, who trained at the celebrity chef’s temples to fine dining, French Laundry and Per Se.
He went to Noma in Copenhagen—then the best restaurant in the world—at Keller’s urging, returned to be the head pastry chef at French Laundry (his dream job) and moved back to Denmark to be with the woman who is now his wife. Shortly after, he walked away from the upper echelons of the restaurant world to open a modest bakery that gives him a shot at a normal family life.
What Abel rarely shares is that he is the son of legendary Kansas City jazz musician Milton Abel Sr. who is probably best known as half of a duo with his wife Bettye Miller, but who also had a second successful 25-year-career in jazz after she died in 1979.
This week he’s had to openly share that relationship at the Tribeca Film Festival . Abel is in New York for the world premiere of That’s My Jazz , the 14-minute short documentary in which he reflects on his relationship with his dying father and his own attempts with fatherhood. He has a son, now three, and a daughter who is 17 months old.
“If you were to put a button in front of me today where we would go back and I would say ‘no’ to the French Laundry and stay at home with my dad, live in a split-level apartment, take care of him, I would hit that button,” Abel solemnly declares at the outset of the film.
Over the 15 years since his father died at age 77, Abel has battled an internal struggle many grapple with: should he have stayed at home to be close to his father or was he right to travel the world in pursuit of his own destiny?
“Looking into that camera, it was the first time I had said most of that stuff out loud,” Abel says. “I’ve never talked to anybody about these sorts of things except my wife.
“When people ask, of course I share, but outside of that there are very few people who know who they were or what they did,” he says.
The day before the premiere, Abel and director Ben Proudfoot meet me for cocktails at Café Altro Paradiso in SoHo to discuss the film, which grew out of a project that was meant to be a love letter to Copenhagen but went bust.
There wasn’t much to be found during January in Denmark. “It was fucking freezing outside. It was not going well,” Proudfoot said. “I was totally angry and depressed and we have three extra days.”
A friend suggested meeting Abel, an American-born chef who was in the process of opening the first location of the bakery Andersen & Maillard . A second opened last month.
“My first response was, ‘Why am I going to Copenhagen to meet an American chef?’” Proudfoot said. “I went in there, and there is Milton wearing a white T-shirt and glasses and looking exhausted because they are building this thing.
“Basically I just wanted to convince him to make some croissants or something for our love letter to Copenhagen thing,” he added.
The conversation turned to how Abel ended up making his way from Kansas City to Copenhagen. He started talking. Proudfoot and his team spent the next three days capturing the story.
The bakery was about a week away from opening. “The construction is not done and nothing is going to happen on time and they’re spilling concrete in my [bread] starter,” Abel said. “One challenge after another.”
“But something about this just said you gotta do this,” he said. “This is important. I have had a few times in my life where that has happened to me where it’s like, make this decision. This is what you need to do, and this was one of them.”
“I call it the tug,” Proudfoot interjects. “And you get the tug.”
After hearing Abel’s story, the film feels too short. But it brings together the struggles children face as they begin their careers just as parents are wrapping theirs up, enveloped by two men, each dedicated to honing their craft—one jazz, the other food. “If you were to put a button in front of me today where we would go back and I would say ‘no’ to the French Laundry and stay at home with my dad...I would hit that button.”
“I remember smoke everywhere, tuning basses, the smell of Grand Mariner,” Abel says in the movie.
He was a self-proclaimed mistake, born when his father was 55, the product of his marriage to his second wife, but also his father’s first child. His parents would later go on to have a daughter, Chloe, who is a professional dancer.
Abel’s earliest recollections are falling asleep under pianos at his father’s jazz shows. “I was a bar baby,” he says.“My mom coined that phrase.”
By age six he was playing gigs with his father. “My father was super encouraging. This is Tommy Ruskin on drums, this is P.I. on piano. I’m Milton Abel and this is little Milton Abel and we’ll be right back. That’s how he went on break.”
Abel would break away from the music world and go into acting at the University of Missouri, where he decided to start working in restaurants as a side gig.
He had a roommate in college who was cooking. “And I was like if he can do it, I can do it,” Abel said.
Abel was hooked. In the movie, he recalls how he returned to Kansas City, and began walking into restaurants armed with a résumé and hearing over and again, “We’ll get back to you.”
He was ready to give up. And in a last ditch effort, he walked into Grand Street Café, a legendary fine dining restaurant in the heart of the city and handed his résumé to the manager who offered to go get the chef.
“I sat down with this guy Michael Magliano and said, look, I don’t have any culinary school training, but I’ll work really hard for you,” Abel says in the film.
“Magliano inspired me about cooking and showing me what it can be and how far you can go,” he later adds.
He would show him the French Laundry cookbook, a sort of culinary bible among serious chefs. “I didn’t even realize this life was out there,“ Abel said.
The two dishes he remembers that had a lasting effect on him at Grand Street are both desserts.
“I burnt the hell out of some caramel once. Like I ruined the pan. There was so much burnt caramel that you couldn’t throw it away,” he said. Magliano’s solution was to turn it into burnt caramel ice cream. The second was the pure joy he and Magliano had creating a formless crème brûlée made out of popcorn. “I remember smoke everywhere, tuning basses, the smell of Grand Mariner.”
Soon Magliano was off to French Laundry in Napa Valley. Abel soon followed, taking a job on the pastry team because that was the job that was open.
His father “was having a hard time walking and losing his ability to play,” Abel says in the film. “And I’m like I am going to California and I’m going to try for a job at this restaurant. I don’t know if he knew I was serious, that this was the Carnegie Hall of the culinary profession.
“If I’m going to do it, I’m going to do it all the way. I can’t see you living your life any other way,” he continues. “My family probably did need me at home, but they didn’t tell me that.”
The last time he saw his father alive, he was back in Kansas City a few years later, and wanted him to experience French macarons, the delicate meringue-based cookies that are the finale to a meal at the French Laundry.
“’Cause that was the most special thing I had learned to make at the French Laundry,” he said. “I made them everyday. I made 200 a day. It was the last thing everybody got, and the commis (the junior chef) made them. This was the fanciest cookie I had ever made in my entire life.
“It’s a big thing for me to start nailing this and that’s what I wanted to show him, ‘look what I learned to make,’” Abel said. “And dad loves cookies, so let’s just make something fancy together.”
Abel arranged for a car and drove his father from the nursing home where he was now living to a kitchen where he used to work and had negotiated for time so that he could cook while his father watched the performance.
“He just sat in the wheelchair in the kitchen and we baked them and we mixed them. He loved it,” Abel said.
“We ran out of time, so I didn’t get to make the buttercream. We didn’t get to make this and we didn’t get to make that, so we are now back in his room and he’s got this dry time of macarons,” Abel recalls laughing. “I think he was just proud of me, to see me showing some skill. And it didn’t matter. Even if the cookies had been terrible, he would have been excited just the same.”
They stopped by a jam session at a club called Jardin’s.
“People came out to say hi to him,” Abel said. “And that just plays over in my mind over, and over and over again. Had I just been there, we could have done that every Sunday. So many people spilled out just to say hi to him in the car. We could have done that all the time, even if that gave us five more years together.”
The film picks up a month later. He had called his father to say hello. His mother picked up the phone. “She put the phone to his ear. He was trying to say something but he couldn’t speak,” Abel recalls, “and I told her I had to go and I just went back to work.“
“I have dedicated myself to my work my whole life and I’m not going to stop now,” he said. “I worked until 2 in the morning, got home, and when I got home, then my phone rang.”
His father was dead.
A few years later, he asked to be transferred to Per Se. Soon after he went to work at Noma.
“He was able to be a professional and a father and do them both at the highest level. Hall of Fame Jazz Musician, a Hall of Fame Dad. I wasn’t going to be able to do both and I had to choose what was more important to me.”
From here, That’s My Jazz switches from black and white to color as you see Abel playing with his baby daughter. Then, as the credits roll, he feeds his son a series of desserts.
At the restaurant, he finishes a second cocktail—a mix of fennel, olive, lemon and gin which he earlier declared “dangerous, but it’s less dangerous than whiskey.” These days, he works 2 a.m. to 2 p.m. and rushes to be home for dinner.
“I know that I can’t do both inside of me,” Abel says. “I know that one would take over. The bakery almost does already take over. I am struggling right now to get home for dinner every night, but I do get home for dinner, get them to bed and then go back while they are asleep.”
“They’re don’t care if dad is a great pastry chef,” he adds. “They just care that dad is a great dad.” READ THIS LIST"
Nazi Horrors of Auschwitz: This Stark Exhibit Reveals What It Was Like to Live and Die in the WW2 Concentration Camp,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nazi-horrors-of-auschwitz-this-exhibit-reveals-what-it-was-like-to-live-and-die-in-the-ww2-concentration-camp,"Travel NEVER AGAIN Nazi Horrors of Auschwitz: This Stark Exhibit Reveals What It Was Like to Live and Die in the WW2 Concentration Camp Jose Barea From shoes to socks to gas chamber peepholes to survivor testimonies, the largest-ever exhibition in the U.S. devoted to Auschwitz is shocking—and an urgent warning to us today. Tim Teeman 05.04.19 11:52 PM ET
T he card reads, “Child’s shoe with sock (1944).” In the display case is a shoe—small, curved and warped with time; dust or muck or aging scored on its surface. It has no laces. And then, flowing out of its top, is the limp sock. In the display case the shoe and sock are artifacts. But their human meaning, the experience and execution of Holocaust , is all around you.
Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away , at the New York City’s Museum of Jewish Heritage—A Living Memorial To The Holocaust (May 8 to January 3, 2020) is full of such jolting moments. The objects can be small, like the shoes, and also feel impossibly enormous and freighted. You will see buttons, eyeglasses, some smashed, more shoes, cooking implements, bowls: intimate emblems of lost lives and unimaginable horror.
Then you come to a metal peephole Auschwitz guards looked through to the gas chambers, a poker used to manage the fires in Auschwitz’s crematoria, a gas mask used by the SS, a rusting shower head. All of these objects are frozen, terribly and meaningfully, in time right in front of you.
The largest exhibition on Auschwitz ever presented in the United States features more than 700 original objects and 400 photographs, and the curators have managed to somehow create something both profound and illuminating. It is unflinching but not exploitative. It tells a story, and it also issues a clear warning to us in the present day about the evils done in the name of all kinds of prejudice and hatred.
The stark intent of the exhibit is made clear outside the museum; there the curators have placed a boxcar like those used to transport Jews to death camps like Auschwitz. An estimated 1,100,000 people were killed at the camp.
The exhibit is not prurient in any way. It takes place over three levels of the museum, and it begins with a sign describing “a time and place when hope turned to fear and governments and their citizens turned to genocide.” It shows us where Auschwitz is, now once again part of the Republic of Poland; many of the objects on display are from the city’s Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum .
When Russian Red Army soldiers first arrived at Auschwitz in January 1945, they found 7,000 men, women and children alive, barely, “and piles of unburied corpses… hundreds of thousands of items of clothing and shoes, and tons of human hair.”
The soldiers heard from inmates about the gas chambers, the hundreds and thousands of dead, “of human ashes used as fertilizer; of medical experiments on the living.” Primo Levi noted of the Russian guards’ expressions that it was the “shame that the just man experiences at another man’s crime; the feeling of guilt that such a crime should exist, that it should have been introduced irrevocably into the world of things that exist.”
A woman’s shoe, red, a strap at the heel, is in the first display case; there are also, standing sinisterly, three concrete posts, isolators, and barbed wire that were once part of Auschwitz’s perimeter.
The first few rooms of the exhibit act as a historical primer, a sober prelude to the graphic horror curated directly from Auschwitz. We read of the Roma people, the development of Auschwitz as a place before its name became synonymous with the worst of vicious abuse, cruelty and mass murder.
There is a potted history of Judaism, illustrated with objects like a Seder Box made in 1929, and volumes of the Mishnah and the Talmud; a Tallit (prayer shawl) and portable Sabbath candlesticks. We read of a Jewish family, the Haberfelds, who lived in the town, then known as Oświęcim, and what terrible fate awaited them later. “ Anti-Semitism spreads like wildfire, to such an extent that one must be thankful for practically anyone who shows himself free of prejudice ”
The exhibit charts how anti-Judaism transmogrified into anti-Semitism in the 19th century; and Jewish life in pre-World War II Europe.
“Anti-Semitism spreads like wildfire, to such an extent that one must be thankful for practically anyone who shows himself free of prejudice,” wrote Berthold Auerbach in 1880. The responses to this anti-Jewish sentiment are sketched: emigration, Zionism, Orthodox Judaism, Bundism, and “negotiation, assimilation, and conversion.”
Just as clearly, the exhibit next sketches out the growth of Nazism and rise of Hitler and the Third Reich. There are photographs of the many uniforms of Nazism, the persecution of the Roma, and the hideous work of Dr. Robert Ritter, aiming to prove the Roma’s “racial degeneration.” There are pictures of him drawing blood from a Roma woman’s arm.
In display cases are SS belt buckles, a Hitler Youth bugle. The exhibit illustrates how Hitler’s plans to extend his murderous demonization to Jews developed. On one wall is Pastor Martin Niemöller’s famous “First they came…” quote.
The exhibit notes that after the liberation of the camps, gay sexuality remained criminalized and LGBT people still persecuted. Before the now-ubiquitous rainbow, the pink triangle worn by homosexual prisoners was reclaimed by LGBT activists as a symbol of pride and resistance; and later used on AIDS direct action group Act Up’s Silence Equals Death T-shirts.
Every category of concentration camp prisoner had a differently colored triangle. There are stark black and white images of roll calls at Dachau and Sachsenhausen. We see a prisoner registration form, a forensic drawing of the corpse of an inmate at Mauthausen.
The increasing ferocity of the Nazi persecution of Jews, encompassing the Nuremberg Laws, Kristallnacht and the Kindertransport, are sketched. There are fascinating images of Jews defiantly practicing their faith within Nazi Germany, and the story of the famous Talmudic academy, Mir Yeshiva. In another display case is one of Anne Frank’s drawings, dated April 9, 1941. The disbelief and indifference of other nations toward the unfolding horrors of Nazi persecution are noted. We read of the letters tossed desperately from trains by those being transported to the camps.
The first images of Auschwitz we see are of the bucolic experiences that its commandant, Rudolf Höss, had there with his family. “My family had it good in Auschwitz, every wish that my wife or my children had was fulfilled,” he said in 1947. “The children could live free and easy. My wife had her flower paradise… There was always something new and interesting in the garden.”
We see a whip laid out, used to beat prisoners, and then Höss’s desk, a guide to the administrative structure of the camp, and many mugshots of prisoners, which the SS would eventually aim to destroy. The mugshots are in black and white; each prisoner poses in three stances.
There is much art in the exhibit; some of the most piercing is by Jan Komski, an artist whose drawings, after being liberated, showed what life in the camp had been like: the grinding work, the torture and murder, the whippings, chokings, the cramped sleeping quarters, the executions, and the interior of the crematoria, bodies piled on top of one another. “ I felt obsessed, driven in fact by the overwhelming desire to put down every detail of this unfathomable place ”
There are stark color and black and white photographs of the camp. An anonymous Jewish woman, in one later from 1943, describes mass execution; a photograph shows a woman with two children waiting to be killed. The artist Alfred Kantor said in 1971 he had drawn his experiences of Auschwitz, because, “I felt obsessed, driven in fact by the overwhelming desire to put down every detail of this unfathomable place…”
Here are the suitcases, inscribed with his name, of Kurt Stein, a Czech doctor, along with other people's battered bags and cases. In another display case are SS jackboots.
On video, survivors describe arriving at camp, the guards with dogs screaming at them; the men and women being separated; the elderly and disabled being separated again; women on their own separated from women with children. The survivors describe being wrenched from their partners and parents, in the blink of an eye never to be seen again.
In other display cases are prisoners’ personal possessions taken from them as soon as they arrived at Auschwitz: shaving brushes, buttons, combs, hair-brushes, trinkets, cups. There is a white slip dress worn by 18-year-old Esther Zoldan. One room holds an original barrack—a prisoner accommodation. We see tools from the camp’s workshop. There is a prisoner’s coat, a stretcher, a tobacco pipe, matches and a lighter.
There is the story of a tin ring one man, Arno Levit, gave to his beloved girlfriend Zdenka Fantlová. He said it would protect her, and it did. We learn about the music some prisoners managed to play.
Photographs of SS officers and prison staff laughing and dancing are positioned alongside the photographs of their pre-camp lives belonging to Jewish inmates which were saved by a group of brave prisoners.
The Final Solution is laid out in stark terms, with Höss outlining how he had decided to use Zyklon-B as the chemical mass killing agent in the gas chambers.
Höss boasted Auschwitz had “improved” the process over Treblinka; at the latter the victims were told they were being exterminated, while at Auschwitz Höss boasted they were “fooled” into thinking they were being deloused. A full map of the Nazi killing centers is on one wall. There are pictures (and memories of seeing) Josef Mengele, the physician who conducted horrific experiments on prisoners. “ We read of bodies piled into pits in the ground, covered in gasoline by the guards, and burned. Eventually, four crematoria were built, ‘with a combined daily incineration capacity of 4,416 corpses’ ”
Of the 1.1 million Jews deported to Auschwitz, we are told, “only 200,000 were admitted as registered prisoners; the other 900,000 were murdered shortly after their arrival. Of these, 200,000 were children.” We see an operating table, test tubes and medical instruments used on the prisoners.
In one display case is the frame of a pram, wicker baskets, children’s clothes, and more buttons. We read of bodies piled into pits in the ground, covered in gasoline by the guards, and burned. Eventually, four crematoria were built, “with a combined daily incineration capacity of 4,416 corpses.”
Here are postcards that inmates were instructed by guards to send to loved ones claiming they were being treated well. Here are photographs of people in queues heading to the gas chambers.
Former SS officer Oskar Gröning justified the mass killing of Jewish children thus: “The children, they’re not the enemy at the moment. The enemy is the blood inside them. The enemy is the growing up to be a Jew that could become dangerous. And because of that the children were included as well.”
There is a scale model of a gas chamber door used in crematoria 2, 3, 4 and 5 at Auschwitz; drawings by artists who survived show the horrors of dead bodies being dragged across floors.
We see the brown steel door that gave access to the ash pit of the crematorium oven for crematoria 2 and 3. It looks as hideous as you would imagine, and like the peephole into the crematorium alongside it, looks—viscerally—like a torture instrument. There is a tin of a Zyklon-B, and the “gas column” the Nazis used to transport the gas into the chamber to kill the inmates.
The visitor then alights upon more display cabinets of personal possessions; there are men and women’s shoes; eyeglasses, some smashed and warped.
We see resistance fighter Alberto Errera’s photographs of naked women being led towards the gas chambers and the burning of bodies in a deep pit. Somehow a resistance movement existed amid the murderous carnage. Ester Wajcblum sent this message to comrades before her execution on January 6, 1945: “I know what is in store for me, but I go readily to the gallows. I only ask you to take care of my sister Hanka. Please don’t leave her, so that I may die easier.”
As the Russians closed in, the Nazis forced thousands of brutalized living prisoners to embark upon “The Death March” to transport to take them to concentration camps elsewhere—if they survived the “march” (photographs graphically show many did not).
The exhibit illustrates the moment when the remaining Auschwitz prisoners were liberated—as emaciated and almost dead as many were. There are photographs of piles of bodies from a Life magazine story headlined “Atrocities.”
Some closing videos show what happened to the war criminals who carried out the mass murder and torture at Auschwitz (including Johanna Langefeld and Maria Mandl, Chief Supervisors of the Women’s Camp and Eduard Wirths, Chief Camp Doctor).
A final video shows survivors voicing their own piercing insights. One woman notes how the prisoners’ humanity towards one another compared to their brutalizers’ inhumanity as its own statement of strength and endurance. Others plead with us watching to “stay away from hate,” to learn to live alongside one another.
In 2003, Auschwitz survivor Esther Brunstein said, “I prayed that I would not forever be consumed nor destroyed by hatred. I would say against all the odds I have succeeded—but not without scars.” “ The words of hatred create hatred. The words of dehumanization dehumanize. The words of menace increase the threat. We have already started paying for this ”
The exhibit ends by issuing a louder, political message. Piotr M. A. Cywiński, Director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, writes, “The words of hatred create hatred. The words of dehumanization dehumanize. The words of menace increase the threat. We have already started paying for this. [Auschwitz survivor] Raphaël Esrail wrote, ‘The camp is not just a memory. For the majority of us, its reality is omnipresent in our everyday life.’ I have never heard a more terrible warning. The warning against our own words.”
The visitor leaves the Museum of Jewish Heritage and sees the boxcar again: a final jolt of shock. This exhibition is intense, wrenching and a warning to us today—sadly, an urgently necessary one."
The Resurrection of Florence’s Cimabue Crucifix,www.thedailybeast.com,Allison McNearney,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-resurrection-of-florences-cimabue-crucifix,"LOST MASTERPIECES The Resurrection of Florence’s Cimabue Crucifix After a devastating flood in 1966, Cimabue’s Crucifix will forever bear the scars of its watery ordeal both in its wood and in the areas of paint that can never be fully restored. 05.04.19 11:50 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
Just after 5 a.m. on November 4, 1966, the roiling waters of the River Arno overwhelmed its banks and rushed into the streets of Florence.
Despite the abnormally rainy season and a history of severe flooding, there had been no warnings to residents of impending disaster nor any emergency precautions taken. Within minutes of the breach, a surprised Florence was drowning.
As water gushed through the city, breaking through doors and turning cobblestoned streets into tributaries, it quickly entered the flood-prone neighborhood of Santa Croce. Hanging on the wall of the refectory of the Church of Santa Croce, a painted Crucifix by the 13th-century Florentine artist Cimabue bore witness to the devastation. The water rose and rose until it was eventually submerged.
As centuries of Florentines know all too well, the wrath be it of God or nature flashes fierce and fast. By the end of the day, the waters were already beginning to recede, but they left behind a terrible scene.
The next morning, residents woke up to streets covered in a thick sludge of mud, oil, and sewage that coated Renaissance masterpieces and modern amenities alike.
Around 100 people died, and nearly half of the records in the state archives were destroyed in addition to a conservative estimate of over 1,500 works of art and 1.5 million books that were damaged to varying degrees.
As news of the disaster spread, the horror the city faced came to be symbolized by one image: that of the water-soaked wood and chipped paint that was now Cimabue’s Crucifix.
But the Crucifix was also a symbol of hope. In the grand tradition of its painted figure, it rose again.
Volunteers who became known as “mud angels” came to help save the endangered cultural treasures. In the case of the Crucifix, the restoration took 10 years, but—through an effort that was part miracle of science and part pure miracle—it was re-installed in the Santa Croce refectory in 1976. But Cimabue’s Crucifix will forever bear the scars of its ordeal both in its wood and in the large swaths of paint that can never be fully restored.
When Cimabue received the commission to create the Santa Croce Crucifix, he was one of the leading artists in Florence. His skill as a painter helped set the stage for the developments that would lead to the Renaissance, and the prominent historian Giorgio Vasari not only started his 10-volume series on the “most eminent” artists with Cimabue, he also credited him with “having little less than resurrected painting.”
But Cimabue’s renown waned following his death in 1302 mostly due to his sin of being a good teacher. His apprentice Giotto soon outshone the master and became one of the most important artists of the 14th century, eclipsing the life and work of Cimabue.
“Thus began a process that one art historian later referred to as ‘the curse of Cimabue’: the decline in his historical and critical status, the damage to or deterioration of his existing works, and the removal of his name from important works once attributed to him,” writes Robert Clark in Dark Water: Flood and Redemption in the City of Masterpieces .
One of the only major pieces from his oeuvre that remained prominent was the crucifix he created for the Franciscans to crown the altar of their new Church of Santa Croce.
The piece is part sculpture, part painting. Cimabue crafted the cross out of wood that he sourced from the nearby forest.
Once his canvas was ready, he laid a layer of gold leaf over the cross and then painted the crucified figure over it. It was a revolutionary image with a visceral humanness displayed in Jesus’s suffering. There is a dignified, even radiant aura befitting the son of God, but he is also clearly wearied and in pain. Blood drips from his wounds, his head tips to the side too tired to hold up, and he is slouched in resignation.
The 1966 flood wasn’t the first time the Crucifix had encountered the Arno. On eight recorded occasions since 1333, Florence has been inundated with river water. It was a fact of life in the city, one that has preoccupied generations of great minds including Leonardo da Vinci , who was fascinated by the movement and mechanics of water. In an eerie coincidence, three of those disasters, including the 1966 flood, struck on November 4.
Clark writes that during the 1333 flood, Cimabue’s Crucifix was hanging in pride of place above the altar of the Church of Santa Croce when floodwaters stopped just short of reaching the base of the cross. It again faced down the rising tide in 1557 .
But just over 400 years later, it wouldn’t be so lucky. The 1966 flood was by far the worst in Florence’s history, and Cimabue’s Crucifix was considered, as Life magazine put it, “the greatest single art loss” of that disaster.
The Crucifix was under water for 12 hours, its wood soaking up the moisture and swelling, which in turn caused large swaths of paint that had been applied directly to the wooden surface to chip off. There were gouges in the wood and important areas in the face and body of the painted figure were completely gone. “When he got there, he saw flecks of paint and gesso floating in the murky water ‘some bright and gilded like tropical fish.’ He made an effort to scoop up as much of the paint flecks as he could”
While the story of how the damaged Crucifix was first discovered vary, Clark says it is believed that Father Cocci first entered the refectory by boat sometime on November 5. When he got there, he saw flecks of paint and gesso floating in the murky water “some bright and gilded like tropical fish.” He made an effort to scoop up as much of the paint flecks as he could.
It at first seemed that all was lost for the Crucifix, and, in the days following the flood, Life ruled it “a masterpiece beyond repair.” But Kay Larson writing for New York magazine in 1982 noted that the damage occurred at an opportune time when developments in the field of art restoration enabled experts to treat the ruined work. It took a heroic effort, but they succeeded.
First, Larson says they removed the painted Jesus from the cross using a technique that involved gluing rice paper to the wet wooden surface and lifting it away. They took the cross apart and, over the course of two years, allowed it to dry out. Chips were filled using wood from the nearby forest and then the cross was reassembled. A fiberglass layer was laid on top of the wood to protect the painting in any future encounters with water, and then the painting was returned to its refurbished home.
The swaths of the figure that were lost could not be restored, but the conservationists filled in the missing patches with crosshatches of paint that matched Cimabue’s original colors. The Crucifix was brought back to life, though not entirely as it once was.
The River Arno has always been wild; until an effort is made to tame its periodic bouts of rage, Florence will always be in danger of flooding.
But when the next disaster strikes, Cimabue’s Crucifix will be ready. It may still carry the scars of its resurrection, but it also now carries the means of its future redemption. The Crucifix is back on view in Florence, but now it hangs from four steel cables that are connected to a pulley system. If the waters come again, it can be raised to safety out of their reach.

How Mother of the Miniskirt Mary Quant Changed the World,www.thedailybeast.com,Clive Irving,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-mother-of-the-miniskirt-mary-quant-changed-the-world,"SEX AND THE SWINGING CITY How Mother of the Miniskirt Mary Quant Changed the World Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty From a single boutique to a world style, one woman shook up her own country and then built an empire. Clive Irving 05.04.19 11:45 PM ET
L ONDON—She threw out everything that was chaste in a woman’s wardrobe. She raised hemlines above the knee and so created the miniskirt. More than any other fashion designer before or since, she caught the zeitgeist of her time, and of her country as it threw out the constraints of the past.
Finally, Mary Quant is getting the accolade her life merits, in a scintillating show at the Victoria and Albert Museum, a temple of good taste as perceived, collected and exhibited in works dating from ancient Greece to the present.
Quant came softly into American awareness with a story in Life magazine in December, 1960, headlined “A British Couple’s Kooky Styles”. The headline itself is loaded with the contradiction, to American eyes of the time, that anything “kooky” might emanate from a realm so uptight as Britain.
The photographer carefully places a frisky, skipping Quant in Park Avenue with a backdrop of Lever House, itself a revolutionary architectural force. She wears a two-piece suit in the bright yellow and red MacLeod tartan with a hemline just floating above the knee. Unremarkable now, it signaled real cheek then, when most American skirts fell to mid-calf.
Many things sometimes conspire to create the tone of an age and this was true of the ’60s, ranging from the “can-do” technical hubris of the moonshot to the surrender of the Hollywood studio system to a generation of radical movie directors. But at street level, and particularly in the lives of women, the agitation for independence and liberation came to be expressed as much in wardrobe as in rhetoric.
Quant instinctively picked up on this in a way that no other designer had. From a small boutique in London’s Chelsea she grew to be a truly seismic challenge to the whole fashion industry and specifically to the French idea of “couture” as the arbiter of how “well-bred” women should conform to the male idea of elegance. For one thing, Quant’s models were brazenly sexy as she bared legs and limbs and, by doing so, released an athletic energy.
From my perspective as an editor in 1960s London, first at a newspaper and then of magazines, there was barely a strand of the city’s creative life that did not reflect the sudden influence of a new wave of artists and designers like Quant. This broader context does not really get traced in the V&A show. “ It’s not an accident that an early group portrait of the Rolling Stones features a ‘bird’ in a slinky sheath shaped by Quant. ”
Quant was part of a generation of visually talented Brits who benefited from the democratization of the entry system of the best London art colleges as part of a more general opening up of educational opportunities. Along with other contemporary art college graduates like David Hockney and Ridley Scott, she was able to assert a highly personal and transformative influence on her chosen field.
And in a strange way all the visual arts–painting, movies, fashion, graphics, photography–were interwoven into a radical new revision of British style that was set to the music of an equally insolent new British music. It’s not an accident that an early group portrait of the Rolling Stones features a “bird” in a slinky sheath shaped by Quant.
However, it would be misleading to see Quant as an avatar of a risen working class. Her parents were middle-class meritocrats from Wales, both school teachers devoted to their work who instilled a similar work ethic in her. And her career might never have taken off without the suave young toff from a world of privilege she married, Alexander Plunket Greene, who had a flair for publicity and moved in a flash social set with the connections to help create a buzz. They included the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones and his new wife, Princess Margaret, who were real swingers .
Plunket Greene’s genius was to see his wife not just as a gifted designer but as a brand—she physically embodied his idea of a new British woman as precisely as Roger Vadim had crafted Brigitte Bardot to be French cinema’s idea of the new impishly nubile French woman. But where Bardot was a well-endowed, pouty seductress there was more than a whiff of the androgynous in Quant, and especially in the models chosen to wear her clothes, a line of willowy beauties that ended in the most androgynous of them all, a fragile-looking waif who went by the name of Twiggy.
The trademark Quant face was framed in the trademark Quant hair style, closely cropped in the shape of an inverted bowl by the young London hairdresser who himself became a world brand, Vidal Sassoon. It was as though women’s heads had suddenly become streamlined, the hair almost seeming like a helmet shorn of all the bird’s nest confections of the 1950s—a sort of purity that was echoed by the Beatles in their own branding that was deliberately counter to the wild, leonine locks of the Rolling Stones.
The Quant effect was not only cultural but geographical: Bazaar, her first boutique, opened in 1960 in the King’s Road, Chelsea. Until that point Chelsea generated little tourist traffic. It was mostly a mix of working and middle class homes with a small bohemian enclave of artists and writers.
Largely as a result of Quant, the King’s Road became the coolest street in the Swinging London of the 1960s. Coffee bars, Italian restaurants and bistros were part of a British passeggiata where any young woman not in a miniskirt felt out of place. For visitors this long street presented an astonishing carnival, and particularly a rejection of the European view of British women’s fashion as something confined to conservative tweeds and flowery hats.
One of the smartest of Plunket Greene’s promotional ideas was to pose the saucy Quant models alongside groups that symbolized rigid British customs—for example, and much to their annoyance, soldiers in the rigid and unsmiling duty of guarding royal palaces.
In America the first people to spot the Quant phenomenon were the managers at the swank Fifth Avenue store Henri Bendel. It was Bendel’s decision to sell some of Quant’s designs that brought the spread in Life magazine.
But her real American break came from a very different kind of store: JC Penney. There a young sportswear buyer, Paul Young, who was a Brit, saw in Quant a chance to reboot the store’s conservative image.
In 1962 Young proposed a new youth fashion line called Chelsea Girl, and Quant was hired to design it. The British embassy in Washington recognized the value of this for selling British style in the U.S. and gave Quant a launch party. Quant was by nature shy and never comfortable living up to a public image as a Chelsea swinger but she consented to make personal appearances at Penney stores and the Chelsea Girl was a hit. The second collection was extended to 80 stores, and the deal with JC Penney lasted until 1971. “ Quant even came up with skirts in PVC that today look like cheap and nasty items from an S&M catalog but were then regarded as extremely hip. ”
Her American experience transformed Quant and Plunket Greene’s business. They learned how to move from clothes designed for the limited demands of a boutique to mass production. They were also pathfinders of another trend, for department stores to introduce the work of young designers as a rejuvenating move for the whole store brand.
In fact, Quant’s name became a valuable ticket for any company with an interest in breaking into the young fashion market. An anachronism that jumps out from the V&A show is the wide use she made of synthetic fabrics.
Chemicals companies like DuPont in the U.S. and ICI in Britain that had pioneered the use of nylon, polyester, acrylic and spandex signed up Quant to use these “new miracle fabrics” that never wrinkled, were stain-resistant and light on laundering. Quant even came up with skirts in PVC that today look like cheap and nasty items from an S&M catalog, but were then regarded as extremely hip. In those days the makers of natural fabrics like wool and cotton had to fight a rearguard action against what were then believed to be the fabrics of the future.
A show with the dazzling impact achieved at the V&A can end up overstating the case for its subject. In truth, Quant was not the only breakaway fashion visionary of Swinging London. There were many others just as original. One who deserved at least a mention in this show but did not get it was Ossie Clark who, for a while, was known as the “King of the King’s Road.” Clark married Celia Birtwell, a textile designer and the two of them for a while were style rock stars, designing stage costumes for the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, and were the subjects of one of David Hockney’s greatest portraits, Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy .
But it was Quant who had the staying power because she had behind her shrewd business minds to sustain the brand well beyond the expected life cycle of a new wave in fashion. She did that by leaving behind the direct personal imprint on clothes and moving on into cosmetics, sunglasses and home furnishings, in effect industrializing her brand. When I reached the end of this show I had a sad sense that there were really two Mary Quants: the blazing talent that burst out of the King’s Road and the later business mogul who industrialized a 1960s design ethic and, in doing so, made it commonplace and, therefore, less exciting.
She is Dame Mary Quant now, anointed by the Queen in 2015 for services to British fashion. And it’s certainly true that she opened the path for British designers eventually to conquer even the French—like John Galliano, who headed both Givenchy and Christian Dior.
In 1966 Quant wrote: “Fashion is not frivolous; it is part of being alive today.” But by its very nature fashion is, of course, ephemeral and superficial. The bewitching surface of Swinging London was only surface. The King’s Road was not mainstream Britain—it wasn’t even mainstream London. The photographers and models who worked together to portray such a tempting visual coitus on the magazine pages and in the glossy ads were portraying a dream world. Some were themselves living the dream but millions in Britain were far from enjoying the same affluence.
By far the greatest agent for social change for women in 1960s Britain was the contraceptive pill. For the first time power was given to young women to decide with a high degree of independence and confidence between sex as pleasure and sex as procreation, a choice that remains today contested by men in many societies, including our own.
Other new British talents told a deeper story of the tensions of social disruption as the country changed its view of sex. For example, in movies the ravishing Julie Christie tries desperately to test sexual freedom within a background of domestic denial and repression in Darling ; in Alfie Michael Caine plays the magnetic but careless philanderer encouraged by the sudden promise of the miniskirt.
But there’s nothing shocking about a miniskirt anymore. And, apparently as a result of the V&A show, hemlines in London have been visibly rising. The simple, clean Quant style has not dated much. It’s a global look now, and that is probably the greatest tribute that could be paid to it."
Archaeologists Uncover More Secrets at Ancient World’s Largest Christian Cathedral,www.thedailybeast.com,Candida Moss,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hagia-sophia-archaeologists-uncover-more-secrets-at-ancient-worlds-largest-christian-cathedral,"NEW TRICKS Archaeologists Uncover More Secrets at Ancient World’s Largest Christian Cathedral Excavations at Hagia Sophia (‘Holy Wisdom’) in Istanbul have revealed a number of new and exciting discoveries. 05.04.19 11:43 PM ET DEA / A.

For some tourists, the goal of travel is to stand on the spot where historical events took place: to follow in the footsteps of Jesus; follow the trade and pilgrimage routes of the Mayans, or stand on the field at Gettysburg. It’s an attempt to reach across time and grab hold of the past but, in most cases, we are speaking in generalities. The via dolorosa —the pilgrimage route that Jesus took to Calvary and his death—is slightly wrong . And while you can go to Gettysburg, you can’t necessarily pinpoint the exact spot where President Lincoln delivered his famous address (even though we do know the approximate place).
Now there’s a new exception to this rule: excavations at Hagia Sophia (“Holy Wisdom”) in Istanbul, the largest Christian cathedral built in the ancient world, have revealed a number of new and exciting discoveries. Among them is a disk identifying the exact spot where the emperor Justinian I would have stood.
He’s not as famous as Caesar or Augustus, but Justinian I was the most influential and important Byzantine emperor. When Justinian came to power Vandals, Huns and Franks had conquered much of the western Roman empire. Justinian would then spend over two decades driving these “barbarians” from Italy and North Africa and restoring order to the Roman empire. His most important contribution, however, was his Corpus Iuris Civilis , or the Code of Justinian. It wasn’t the first Roman legal code, but it did reform and incorporate earlier material. His legal code remained the foundation of the Byzantine legal system for 900 years, and its influence is felt even today. Over two centuries ago the historian Edward Gibbon could write of him that while “the vain titles of the victories of Justinian are crumbled into dust… the name of the legislator is inscribed on a fair and lasting monument.”
The cathedral itself has a lengthy and violent history. Construction on the current structures began in 537 CE. It was built on the site of an earlier church, known as the “Great Church,” which was burned down during rioting in the early fifth century. A second church, ordered by the emperor Theodosius II, was also almost entirely destroyed during the Nika Revolt (532 CE), an uprising that burned nearly half the city and resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
To replace it, Justinian decided to build a third, larger and more inspiring church; one that would dwarf its predecessors. Even at the time it was recognized as a structure of great architectural significance. And it became the site of important imperial rituals, including coronations. In the medieval period, the cathedral was, according to the Byzantine era historian Niketas Choniates, sacked by Crusaders at the behest of the Doge of Venice during the Fourth Crusade. It was then pillaged again in 1453, after Mehmet II captured Constantinople. When Mehmet II entered the cathedral after three days of brutal looting and pillaging, he commanded that it be converted into a mosque. Over the following centuries a number of sultans contributed to the maintenance and improvement of the building, then, in 1935, the building was converted into a museum.
Now researchers are discovering that the Byzantine structure was larger and more elaborate than previously believed. A team of archaeologists led by Ken Dark , an archaeologist at the University of Reading and Jan Kostenec , a founding member and director of the Czech Centre for Mediterranean Archaeology, worked at the site from 2004-2018. Many of their discoveries were made during an official restoration. When museum officials removed recently added plaster, Dark and Kostenec found mosaics, frescos, tiles, and graffiti from the ancient and medieval periods.
In their recently published book Hagia Sophia: An Archaeological Reexamination of the Cathedral of Byzantine Constantinople Dark and Kostenec announced that they have discovered what is likely to be the baptistery, which was previously believed to be lost. Some 1,400 years ago this structure would have hosted the baptism of the children of emperor, and initiated the offspring of elite society into the church. In addition, they discovered what may have been an ancient library underneath a large hall. The size of the potential library means that it would have been able to house thousands of scrolls, only adding to its importance as a site of learning and intellectual inquiry in the late antique world.
It was in another building, known as the northeast vestibule, that archaeologists discovered and identified a disc-shaped spot made out of a porphyry rock as the place where the emperor would have stood. The disk forms part of the original sixth-century floor of the church constructed by Justinian. Ken Dark told Live Science , “As such, it is probably the only place where it is possible to identify anywhere the precise spot on which the most famous Byzantine emperor stood.”
If you want to follow in the footsteps of one of history’s greatest legislators you may have to act soon: Hagia Sophia’s status as a museum is currently under threat. In 2018 and again last month President Erdoğan indicated that he intends to convert the museum back into a mosque. READ THIS LIST"

As Brian Reader was making his way to Hatton Garden on Thursday, April 2, 2015, just another anonymous senior citizen on a bus, the guards at 88–90 Hatton Garden, Kelvin Stockwell and Keefa Kamara, set the alarm, as they had every working day for the past 12 years, in the basement premises of the safety deposit. Stockwell was the last to leave, and he locked the safe deposit company’s wooden front door. It was 6 p.m. This being a long holiday weekend, the two guards did not plan to return until Tuesday. Once the guards had left, the building’s concierge, Carlos Cruse, locked the magnetic glass door at the entrance of the building and left through the front door, which closed behind him and locked automatically.
A relic of the 1940s, the security deposit was nevertheless trusted among Hatton Garden jewelers, many of them older Jewish men, who believed in its sturdy dependability. Like them, it had been in the quarter for decades, and the sight of jewelers traveling to and from the safe deposit, their precious diamonds hidden in small plastic bags in money belts or concealed in their underclothing, was a part of the rhythm of daily life in what was a modern-day shtetl and commercial center. Reader and his gang were preying on elderly men and women of their same generation, men and women who valued God over technology, and who thought nothing of leaving their precious valuables in a safe deposit that had barely been updated in decades. “One wrong move and the millions of pounds in jewels they had been fantasizing about for months would be out of reach.”
By early Thursday evening, Reader reached the inconspicuous seven-floor building on the handsome, manicured street. A large plaque on the outside said Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. The rest of his crew was already there: John “Kenny” Collins, Daniel Jones, Terrence Perkins, and Carl Wood. The men had arrived in Hatton Garden at 8:25 p.m. in a white Ford transit van driven by Collins.
A few minutes earlier, Collins parked the vehicle on Leather Lane, around the corner from 88–90 Hatton Garden, where Jones and his old mate Carl Wood exited. They cautiously walked around the building and around the block to conduct reconnaissance. After three years of planning, the moment had finally come. One wrong move and everything would unravel. One wrong move and the millions of pounds in jewels they had been fantasizing about for months would be out of reach.
Lionel Wiffen, the busybody jeweler whose office was in the back of the building, was still there, dealing with a customer, and the men returned to the van on Leather Lane and waited until 9:21 p.m. when Wiffen finally emerged, delayed by a last-minute phone call from his wife. Wiffen left from the fire escape door in the back of the building. For the gang, the wait must have felt like an eternity. They had been observing Wiffen for months and worried that the pesky workaholic could prove an obstacle. He always seemed to work late and had a perpetual look of suspicion on his creased face. The tension must have been palpable, though the men at this stage of the caper appeared to be confident.
Most of them were dressed as maintenance workers; Collins, the lookout man, wore casual clothing. Wood sported a dark shirt, a surgeon’s mask, dark-colored gloves, a high-visibility fluorescent vest, a navy baseball cap, and his ever-present glasses. He was also carrying a black backpack. Jones, the extroverted narcissist among them, had opted for flashier heist attire: a hooded sweatshirt, trousers with bright blue vertical stripes, a high-visibility vest, a navy baseball cap, and bright red running shoes. His face was also obscured by a black mask. The men carried walkie-talkies.
Along his way to Hatton Garden, Reader had discarded his overcoat and was now wearing a yellow hard hat and fluorescent jacket with “Gas” written on the back. He wore brown shoes, distinctive striped socks, and a colorful scarf.
Perkins, a diabetic, had brought with him a three-day supply of insulin shots, apparently mindful that the Hatton Garden job could take days. They knew they could use Good Friday to their advantage. “Fucking 20 pills a day!” he would later tell the others. “If I don’t take the insulin for three days,” he said, “you’d a had to carry me out in a wheelie bin.” But Perkins had sought to downplay his illness. Acknowledging his frailty did not appear to be in his character, and, judging by his reticence, he didn’t want the others to worry that he could be a liability if he fell ill during an operation that required both nerve and stamina, the former of which he possessed in abundance, even if the latter was waning.
Basil walked casually down Greville Street and entered through the front of the building, having acquired a key from an elderly tenant there. The immediate area near 88–90 Hatton Garden was largely deserted. But as he walked, a black taxi with its lights drove by. There were also people from the neighborhood walking their dogs. It was nighttime and nearby pubs were busier than usual with denizens eager to begin taking advantage of the long holiday weekend.
All residents had a key to the front door, which was fitted with a mortise night latch that could not be jimmied by a credit card. Even if Basil hadn’t managed to acquire a key, he would’ve noted that there was a mail slot immediately next to the front door and that a nimble intruder could access the door’s inside handle by putting his or her hand through the slot. Inside there was a glass door with a four-digit coded lock, which police say was opened with the correct combination of numbers. Basil, it seemed, had insider information.
After hours, the basement premises at 88–90 Hatton Garden, where the safe deposit was located, were reachable through a fire escape door accessible on Greville Street, adjacent to the main building. A locked gate on Greville leads to about twenty stairs that descend to a courtyard at the end of which is a door leading to the basement businesses, including the safe deposit. Only a handful of people had a key, including Lionel Wiffen.
Once inside the building, Basil observed a small, dimly lit and worn-looking lobby with beige-colored marble walls, and a list of the companies on the premises on a wall next to the elevator: among them E Katz & Co Ltd, Savvy+Sand, Hattons Antiques, Vicky Gems, and Hatton Garden Safe Deposit, next to which was written “Basement.” From inside the building’s main lobby, a flight of stairs led to the basement and the safe deposit company. Access to the flight of stairs after hours required a key to another door. Only a select few—including the building’s caretaker, the safe deposit’s two security guards, and two cleaners—had one. There was no visitor’s book recording people coming in and out of the building. But there were eight doors between the front door of 88–90 Hatton Garden and the fortress-like high-security vault. Getting past all eight, with the risk of triggering the alarm at any moment, would have made even the most experienced burglar jittery. Basil descended the interior staircase leading to the basement and then opened the fire escape door—pulling back the two bolts on the basement door—to let the others in. “A younger strongman was conspicuously missing among their ranks. Age and wisdom would need to trump brawn and bluster.”
He carried a large black bag slung over his shoulder, apparently designed to obstruct his face from the CCTV cameras. He had the codes to the interior doors of the building and it was his role to disable the alarm.
With the Greville Street entrance now open, Collins slowly drove the van to the gate leading to the fire escape and let the men out. Jones and Wood carefully exited and unloaded bags, tools, metal joists, and two plastic trash cans with wheels, which they took into the building, walking through the basement door. The trash cans were full of tools for the job and were heavy. But a younger strongman was conspicuously missing among their ranks. Age and wisdom would need to trump brawn and bluster.
The men had turned off their mobile phones and communicated only by walkie-talkie (Reader, the proud Luddite among the gang, didn’t have to bother turning off his cell phone since he didn’t own one). Collins, dressed in a green quilted jacket with buttons down the front and a flat cabbie’s cap and carrying a brown briefcase, walked purposefully toward his position in the office building, his arm swinging back and forth as if to propel him forward. As he did, cars and pedestrians passed by, underscoring the brazenness of the men beginning the crime on a busy Thursday evening, even if the immediate area around Hatton Garden was relatively quiet. He entered through the front door at 25 Hatton Garden, on the other side of the street, which housed Madison Jewellers. How he had a key remains unclear. But once inside, he had a bird’s-eye view of both doors to 88–90 Hatton Garden, assuming, of course, his tendency to fall asleep on the job didn’t interfere.
Once inside 88–90 Hatton Garden, the gang called the elevator to the second floor and disabled it, ripping off the elevator door’s sensor so that it remained open. They left an Out of Order sign next to the elevator on the first floor, taping it on the left side of the elevator over the down button. Then, in an adrenaline-fueled feat of athleticism that defied diabetes, arthritis, and bladder-control problems, members of the crew climbed about twelve feet down the elevator shaft from the lobby toward the basement. They had removed the metal barrier that had been installed in the 1970s after an armed robbery in the building. Prior to the burglary, the Firm had learned that the elevator didn’t go to the basement since a man with a shotgun had tried to enter the vault some forty-five years earlier.
After they landed in the basement with a slight thump, Basil cut a gray telephone cable jutting out of an alarm box, as well as the GPS aerial and the wires of an electrical box. The men used a hammer to break off the lock to the exterior wooden door. So far, so good.
It took another forty-five minutes to bring the rest of their tools— including the essential diamond-tipped power drill that weighed seventy-seven pounds—down the elevator shaft by rope. They moved slowly.
To get to the vault required getting past two sliding iron gates. The first one could usually be opened from the outside by entering a four-digit code on a pin-code box (or by a foot switch manned during the day by a security guard). The second gate was locked manually with a key. The gang reasoned that once they had deactivated the alarm, cutting through the iron gates was just a matter of brute force—and power tools.
At around midnight, as Friday dawned, the gang opened the outer iron gate, which they had disabled when they cut the wires. It would take several more hours to cut through the second iron gate.
Between the two gates was a small office containing CCTV recording equipment where the security guards could monitor five cameras—two inside the vault, two outside, and a fifth pointed at the safe deposit’s front door. The office appeared dated, and sparsely outfitted with worn furniture and a Union Jack flag. Another CCTV camera belonging to a jewelry company called Berganza Ltd— triggered by movement—was aimed at the fire exit leading to the premises from Greville Street. Basil was charged with smashing all of the building’s CCTV cameras—which he thought he did. After getting past the gate, Basil removed the CCTV hard drive and began to destroy the other cameras with a hammer.
The 999 safe deposit boxes in the basement safe deposit were protected behind the Chubb vault. After entering the safe deposit company’s entrance, a person had sixty seconds to deactivate the intruder alarm by entering a five-digit code—1930Y—on an alarm box. Basil, who was schooled in electronics and alarms, had figured out how to disable the alarm just a few weeks before the break-in, according to a person familiar with the planning of the burglary.
When the men were finally ensconced in the vault, they didn’t waste any time and began the long and arduous task of drilling through the vault’s wall, which was twenty inches of reinforced concrete. Jones, who had spent months watching hours of video footage on YouTube to know how to handle it, was the main driller, helped by Basil. Jones would later recall the responsibility bestowed upon him with a mix of bravado and exuberance. But Reader must have known from his experience tunneling underground toward a vault during the Baker Street burglary that they were a long way from accomplishing their goal.
The Hilti DD350 power drill, which cost £3,475 ($5,210) can rotate 667 times per minute in its highest gear. But even Jones struggled as the hours elapsed. The drill was so cumbersome it had to be anchored to the floor. Jones and Basil took turns aiming it at the wall. The air was thick with smoke as the cement flew everywhere with each thrust of the drill and produced a loud humming sound. So loud, in fact, that several neighbors next to the safe deposit said they heard the commotion. But it was the gang’s good fortune that the area had been under construction during the previous several months, and Crossrail, a £15 billion ($22.5 billion) project to build a high-capacity, high-frequency railway line for London and the southeast, had sent out letters to local residents warning them about upcoming construction. No one thought anything was amiss. “At one point, Basil had to interrupt the burglary, walk across the street, and wake up Collins.”
Reader was the commander, and he and the Firm would have calculated how long it would take before the sun rose and they had to flee. Each passing hour brought with it the risk of getting caught. But Jones’ and Perkins’ later boasting suggests that they had been running on pure adrenaline, barely able to conceal their excitement that they were back in the game. They were giddy at the recollection of the slowly widening hole. Perkins and Jones were urging each other on, no doubt determined not to let Reader’s grumpy mood undermine their high spirits. The gang allowed themselves periodic bathroom breaks; at one point, Collins escaped from his lookout perch across the street to buy fish and chips.
As Jones wielded the drill and he and Basil struggled to breach the reinforced concrete, Perkins would later recall that he had taken a seat in the safe deposit, away from the others, at some points taking a break to inject a shot of insulin. He also suffered from heart problems; the stress of the job was intense.
The neighborhood outside was eerily quiet because it was the holiday weekend, but the area’s private security guards and the local Camden police were on duty. Across the street, the getaway driver and lookout man, Collins, was fast asleep, snoring. Perkins pressed a button on his walkie-talkie and called out to him. No answer. At one point, Basil had to interrupt the burglary, walk across the street, and wake up Collins.
But the gang had bigger problems to worry about besides Collins’ propensity for napping.
Shortly after 12:21 a.m. on April 3, Alok Bavishi, whose family owns the safe deposit company, received a call that the intruder alarm had been triggered. The alarm managed to send a text message to the Southern Monitoring Services alarm company, which in turn notified the police. Bavishi was told that police were on the scene, giving him a false sense of security; in fact, the police had not come. Bavishi’s concerns were also tempered by the fact that a previous alarm had been triggered by an insect. But he still called Keefa Raymond Kamara, one of the guards, who said he couldn’t come as the trains had stopped running and he didn’t have a car. Then he called Stockwell, his other trusted security guard, but the call went to voicemail.
He kept trying, and finally reached Stockwell, who agreed to go to the safe deposit to see what was happening. Stockwell arrived nearly an hour later by car at 1:15 a.m., just barely missing Carl Wood, who would later be seen on a CCTV camera at 12:51 a.m. at the top of the basement stairs, before he went down to rejoin the others. Stockwell’s arrival also went unnoticed by the gang since Collins was blissfully asleep. After three years of meticulous planning, and more than five hours inside the claustrophobic safe deposit, the men were enticingly close to the shimmering jewels they had been coveting. They had braved fear and anxiety, CCTV cameras and high- security alarms, and a heavy power drill that would’ve challenged some men half their age. Now, they were just moments away from being discovered. “Jones continued to wield the drill, oblivious that the security guard was only feet away, outside the vault.”
Alok Bavishi was initially so nonchalant that he decided not to accompany Stockwell. But he then changed his mind since Stockwell was by himself. After examining the front door and peering through the mail slot of the fire escape door, Stockwell called Bavishi, who by then was only five minutes away, to say it was a “false alarm.”
“It’s all locked up,” he told him; the main door of the building and the fire escape door exit were locked, so there was no reason for Bavishi to come. There were no signs of forced entry, so Stockwell decided that the building was secure. If he was bewildered as to why there were no police at the scene, he didn’t show it. Perhaps the lack of police response had reinforced the impression that there had been a technical glitch, and there was nothing to worry about. He left without going inside, and both men returned home.
Notified of the alarm, the police decided not to respond, as “a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required,” according to Scotland Yard. They would later issue the statement that the “call-handling system and procedures for working with the alarm-monitoring companies were not followed.”
All the while, Jones continued to wield the drill, oblivious that the security guard was only feet away, outside the vault. Oblivious to the fact that the alarm had been triggered and that their plan was perilously close to being undone, they continued to bore three adjoining circular holes through the vault’s thick wall. The men had brought jugs of water because, as they knew from their prior practice with the technology, the drill periodically needed to be doused with a coolant to keep it from overheating.
After several hours of drilling, Jones was getting tired. Perkins and Reader, the consummate professionals, were adept at keeping their emotions in check. Basil was also proficient at maintaining a professional distance. But Wood paced in circles with nervous anticipation.
“Carl, do something for fuck sake!” Perkins scolded Wood, whom the others regarded with barely concealed contempt. By then the men had been in the vault nearly six hours. Despondency and fatigue had begun to set in. Nevertheless, Perkins and Jones continued to egg each other on as Jones pushed the drill through the wall. “The jewels were just inches away but remained out of reach. There was nothing that could be done.”
After hours of exhausting work, they had finally managed to drill three holes, twenty inches deep through reinforced concrete. It was the moment they had all been waiting for. They were just inches away from the jewels, inches away from their audacious goal.
Except there was an obstruction.
It took a few seconds for them to figure it out, but the metal cabinet holding the safe deposit boxes, on the other side of the concrete wall, was bolted to the floor. Their moment of glee quickly disintegrated into disbelief. What could they do? If they drilled through the cabinet, it might destroy the very jewels and valuables they had come to steal. In any case, the cabinet wouldn’t budge. They tried to use the ten-ton hydraulic ram they had brought with them to push it over. They hadn’t anticipated the cabinet being locked into place.
“Smash that up!” Jones commanded. “Smash that up! Smash that up!” as Jones pumped the ram with the aim of pushing over the cabinet. But the pump “pinged back,” Perkins would later recall, and Jones fell to the floor with a thump. Jones and Perkins then secured the pump to the floor. But it was no use. As Perkins and Jones tried to push over the cabinet with the ram, the ram wouldn’t remain in place, and then shattered into dozens of pieces.
They had broken into a secure location, shimmied down an elevator shaft, disengaged the alarm system, and drilled through concrete—and they were nowhere. The jewels were just inches away but remained out of reach. There was nothing that could be done. Their frustration was intense, only slightly tempered, perhaps, by exhaustion and the resignation of aging criminals who were no strangers to stubbornly impregnable vaults that had eventually yielded to brute force and even more brute human will. But for now, their three years of planning had come to nothing. Reader, the “Master,” had proven anything but. Age appeared to have caught up with them.
The men lugged the heavy equipment back through the back passage to the fire escape door near the back of the building on Greville Street. Meanwhile, Collins, newly refreshed from his nap, left his hideout at 25 Hatton Garden and walked cautiously though determinedly toward the white van, parked on nearby Leather Lane. He was carrying his briefcase. He approached the vehicle, suddenly stopping in his tracks, looking left and right before getting in. As he arrived at the Greville Street entrance, a large green Carlsberg truck was pulling ahead, just a few feet in front of him. One by one, Reader, Jones, Wood, and Perkins exited the building, and loaded up the van with carrier bags and tools. But Basil, seemingly a loner, left the building from the front door entrance, walking away, carrying a dark bag that concealed his face from CCTV cameras.
The men left the premises on Friday at 8:06 a.m., empty-handed, some twelve hours after they had first arrived. They had worked through the night and were overcome with sleep deprivation. Their heads must have been pounding. Like many golden agers, they needed their sleep and, judging by their later grousing about the aborted mission, they were even more irritable if they didn’t get it.
It was a typical cloudy and rainy London day. Collins had activated the windshield wipers in the white van. The fresh air, daylight, and drizzle assaulted their senses after so many hours stuck in the cavernous, dimly lit, dusty basement, drilling. Daylight also brought with it a sense of reality that had been absent in the vault and once again the fear of getting caught intensified, at least for some members of the gang.
Collins, the only one who was well rested, drove Perkins and Jones to their homes in Enfield. Then Collins drove Reader to Collins’s house on Bletsoe Walk in Islington. From Collins’ house, Collins’ brother-in-law, Lincoln, drove Reader to London Bridge station, where Reader took a train back home to Kent. It was morning rush hour as Reader slid his senior citizen pass through the turnstile at the train station.
It turned out that human will had its limits, at least for one old man. In the hours after leaving 88–90 Hatton Garden, Brian Reader did something the others thought unimaginable: he abandoned the heist, deciding that it was too risky to return to the scene of the crime. Jones and Perkins would later express how they had felt exhaustion, disbelief, and anger that Reader was abandoning them when they needed him most. Of the gang, Collins was the most sympathetic to Reader, whom Jones and Perkins resented. But Reader had made up his mind. He was out.
Perhaps the years he had spent in a jail cell flashed through his mind. He had a lot to consider. He wasn’t the spring chicken he once had been. There was his ill son, who had high blood pressure. His dead wife. Perhaps he couldn’t face another day behind bars.
The others were now bereft of the Master, both the chief strategist and curmudgeonly cheerleader. And they were irate that he had pulled out, angry at his cowardice and unwillingness to follow through on what they had started. Following the bungled burglary, Jones, in particular, was intent on going back in, convinced that they could infiltrate the vault, if only they could get a stronger battering ram to push over the cabinet.
Rather than return immediately to Hatton Garden, the remaining members of the gang decided to go home to gather their strength. Collins went back to his wife, Millie, at his home in north London, and, one imagines, took a nap. Carl Wood, ailing and perennially irritable, was, by all accounts, feeling skittish and nervous.
Jones returned to his north London home where he kept his drilling videos. At that point, there were no television reports of the break-in. Did that mean it was safe to go back? As for Reader, his decision to walk away meant that he could now be cut off from any booty. But the rest of the gang needed to make sure that Basil, Reader’s associate, and the one with the keys and codes to get into the building, didn’t ditch them. They proceeded to lobby him not to give up. “I’ll tell you something now, if we never proceeded me and you, Basil would have walked away,” Jones later recalled. The remaining team members decided to plod on.
Meanwhile, Reader was at home in his country-style manor in Kent. His last big job had imploded. He was out of the game, but at least he remained a free man.
Vinnie Jones on a Mission for Power Tools
They were an eccentric duo: the athletic fabulist who imagined himself as a would-be soldier and the pot-bellied senior citizen who made a killing selling smuggled cigarettes. But Jones and Collins were nevertheless united by a common adventurous zeal, a love of their canine companions, whom they both talked to, and a determination to finish what they had begun.
So it was that on Sunday, the day after the first bungled burglary, the two men used Collins’ Mercedes to go shopping and buy another hydraulic pump. First, they set out for D & M Tools, a tool store in the affluent west London suburb of Twickenham. Wearing a gray-hooded sweatshirt and no disguise, a jovial-looking Jones entered the store and casually asked the woman at the cash register about the store’s inventory of pumps.
When D & M didn’t have the model of pump they were looking for, they went next door to Machine Mart, another tool store, where Jones paid about £100 ($140) for a new red Clarke pump ram and hose. He used his last name for the invoice but with the initial V for his first name, which the British media would later breathlessly conclude was a reference to Vinnie Jones from the 1998 heist film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Less glamorously, it was a reference to his long-standing partner, Valerie Hart. A store attendant recalled that Jones, appearing calm and relaxed, had put his own street address on the invoice.
A CCTV camera outside D & M also recorded video footage of the two men, along with Collins’ distinctive black Mercedes with its white roof and black alloy tires. Collins, apparently giddy with excitement about the prospect of going back in, called Perkins to update him on the purchase. Then he called Wood. Returning to the scene of the crime was fraught with risks. But if they were nervous, they managed to overcome it, and decided to proceed.
Returning to the Scene of the Crime
When the remaining members of the gang returned to Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd—a full forty-eight hours later on Sunday, April 4—Perkins’ sixty-seventh birthday—they found that the fire exit door at the back of the building, which they had left unlocked, was now engaged. Lionel Wiffen had stopped by his office on Saturday with his wife to prepare for a visit by an electrician the next day. After noticing that the fire exit door on Greville Street was unlocked and ajar, he locked it, and went to his offices. He had a feeling that something wasn’t quite right. He was the only person to visit the premises on the weekend. Most of the neighboring businesses were, as the criminals hoped and suspected, closed for the Easter weekend. Wiffen then checked the door leading from the courtyard into the basement. It had been bolted from the inside after Basil had left the building after the first night. After cleaning his office, Wiffen departed the building at 9 p.m.
At 9:17 p.m., Collins left his home in north London, and with Jones, Wood, and Perkins, drove his white Mercedes to Hatton Garden to check out the area. They got out of the car and walked carefully toward the fire escape door near Greville Street. They looked around. The coast was clear. Satisfied with their preliminary reconnaissance mission, the men left Hatton Garden before returning, around 10 p.m., only this time in the white van. “'We’re in! We’re in!' Perkins hollered, abandoning his usual calm. They had succeeded, at last.”
It is not clear how the others had convinced Basil to return to the scene of the crime, but he did. As the men waited for Basil to go to the front of the building, unlock the door from the inside and let them in, as he had done on the first night, this time Carl Wood got cold feet as he tried to open the locked fire escape door at least two times. The others were already fed up with Wood, a whiny man beset by illnesses and debt, always complaining. They were also probably calculating in their heads how much Wood’s departure would enlarge their share of the loot. Collins nevertheless urged him to stay.
“He thought we would never get in,” he later told Jones and Perkins. “The cunt I said, ‘Give it another half hour; fuck, we’ve done everything we can do; if we can’t get in, we won’t be able to get in, will we?’”
Evidently spooked, Wood scuttled back up the stairs near the fire escape and fled on nearby Leather Lane, “His arsehole went and he thought we would never get in,” Collins added.
They were now down two men. With Wood and Reader out, only three remained. It was half the crew they’d planned for, but Jones, Basil, and Perkins remained steadfast. They wanted what they’d set out to take. And when you want something strongly or for long enough, it can begin to feel like it’s already yours.
After Basil let them into the building, the gang returned to their posts inside the vault. The men carried their equipment, including several wheeled trash cans, back into the safe deposit. Jones carried a black Nike bag and the new pump and hose, enclosed in a red box that matched his shoes. Collins, for his part, returned to his lookout post at 25 Hatton Garden, this time determined not to snooze.
As Collins scanned the empty street below, Basil, Jones, and Perkins set about dislodging the cabinet, anchoring the new pump with metal joists on the wall opposite the vault.
Once again, Jones said, “Smash that up!” Jones began pumping aggressively. This time, the pump did not “ping” back. The men were urging one another on.
“It’s fucking working!” Perkins cried out. “It ain’t ping back. It ain’t fucking come back.” He egged on his friend as Jones continued to pump. The pump hissed violently and suddenly there was a loud bang.
“We’re in! We’re in!” Perkins hollered, abandoning his usual calm. They had succeeded, at last.
“It was hissing, that pump, bang, didn’t it?” Jones would later recall. The noise, he complained, had given him a massive headache. Jones slithered through the narrow figure-eight-shaped hole in the concrete. It was just as well Collins was the lookout man; he was portly and would’ve struggled to wiggle through. Once inside the vault, Jones used heavy cutting equipment to jimmy open 73 out of 999 safe deposit boxes to ransack them. The usual method to open a safe deposit box was for the box’s owner and a security guard to individually turn two separate keys clockwise at the same time. But in the absence of keys, brute force could do the trick.
Jones focused mostly on the boxes at eye level on the right-hand side. Dislodging one box would loosen the box next to it. But in a sign of his frantic state of mind or lack of experience, he chose boxes randomly, significantly slowing himself down and reducing the gang’s final booty. “The safety deposit boxes at Hatton Garden were the difficult ones—they were made in the 1950s,” a person familiar with the heist’s planning recalled. “In other places you could do a box per minute—or 60 boxes an hour. But then Jones was saying, ‘Oh, I’ll do that one, now I’ll do that one.’ So it took longer. That’s why they only opened about 70 boxes.” And of the 73 boxes they opened, about 29 were empty. Among the nearly 1,000 boxes, dozens were empty because they belonged to box owners who had defaulted on their rent, according to a statement the safe deposit company gave to police.
Nevertheless, the men quickly filled several bags and two large trash bins with jewels, gold, precious stones, and cash. The bags were so weighted down with jewels, that they struggled to carry all the loot up the stairs to the fire escape. As they emptied the boxes and stuffed jewels into wheelie bins, Perkins, at one point, nearly collapsed. Had his blood sugar gone too low? Wielding a drill while shooting himself with insulin had apparently taken its toll. But he was nevertheless elated and managed to bring several bags stuffed with jewels to the fire escape in the back of the building where Collins was waiting nearby in the van, its front lights on. Jones and Perkins loaded the trash cans into the van. The men, though exhausted, tried to work quickly. Greville Street was deserted, save two pigeons on the street, oblivious to the historic burglary unfolding before them.
Before they left, Jones brought the red pump he had bought earlier that day in Twickenham back to the van. He left behind the Sealy pump that had malfunctioned. Jones had apparently studied his copy of Forensics for Dummies, and the men scrubbed every inch of the safe deposit with bleach, ensuring that Scotland Yard wouldn’t find even a trace of DNA evidence.
At 6:44 a.m. on Sunday—more than ten hours after they’d entered for the second time, and more than two days after they’d initially broken in—exhausted and out of breath, the men sped away in the white
van. Collins dropped them off at each of their homes. Later that day, William Lincoln called his nephew John Harbinson, a taxi driver, and asked him if he would be willing to collect some goods for him for storage. He did not say what they were.
The next day, Jones and Perkins met at Collins’ house in north London to take stock of the loot before Harbinson spirited away three bags stuffed with jewels in his taxi. It was a good haul. At least £14 million, or $21 million worth of gold, gems, diamonds, and cash, most of which was stored at Collins’s house. They would meet the next day to divvy it up.
It was more than they had even hoped for.

The Mexican Government Wants You to Think Acapulco Is Safe. But Is It?,www.thedailybeast.com,Shawn E. Milnes,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-acapulco-safe-the-mexican-government-wants-you-to-think-so,"The Mexican Government Wants You to Think Acapulco Is Safe. But Is It? Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty Despite 874 murders in 2018 and more than 200 already in 2019, the Mexican tourism industry thinks that the crisis on their hands is just one of communication. Shawn Cohen 05.04.19 11:38 PM ET
A young man on vacation with his wife, enjoying a seafood dinner just steps from Acapulco Bay, was left riddled with bullets on April 6 after a gunman stormed into the restaurant and opened fire.
The tourist, a Mexican national named Esteban who was living in Fresno, California, collapsed, and his wife Zulema jumped to his aide, administering mouth-to-mouth and pressing a towel against his head to stanch the bleeding.
“No, no, no!” she wailed as paramedics arrived and struggled to pull her away so they could take over the CPR. The chilling scene was caught on cellphone video .
As Esteban took his last breaths, hundreds of dignitaries, business executives, tourism industry bigwigs and travel writers gathered several miles down the coast, washing down gourmet finger foods with complimentary cocktails at the opening reception of Tianguis Turistico 2019, Mexico’s biggest travel trade show. The welcome party was held at 7.17., an avant-garde reception hall where white-cloth tables and romantic lighting spotted the lawn, and a DJ livened up the crowd, playing Bruno Mars’ “24K Magic and Treasure” under the stars.
There were no news alerts at the ceremony, or in the days that followed, even though more than a dozen additional homicides were reported in Acapulco that second week of April. Four corpses were discovered in a mass grave in the Simon Bolivar colony and two bodies washed up on consecutive days at Langosta Beach in the Port of Acapulco. The violence was the last thing the organizers at Tianguis wanted to talk about.
Acapulco hosted the four-day conference with a mission to show the world that this former playground to Hollywood stars is safe for travelers, but they did so by skirting the issue. Security was not on the agenda.
Conference organizers instead focused on presenting the new face of Mexico’s original beach destination, taking travel writers on whirlwind tours of the area’s hot spots.
At Los Flamingos waiters served pink piña coladas on the cliffside deck where John Wayne once gazed out on the Pacific. Hotel staff then showed off the new suite, which has a view that might have made even the Duke smile.
They strapped their guests into harnesses so they could soar like Superman on the world’s longest zip line over water, and tantalized them with news that the wire will be raised so they can fly even faster and at night, and in a hammock.
Star chef Eduardo Palazuelos prepared soft shell crab and short rib taquitos, served with a boutique mezcal created exclusively for his new bistro called Mario Canario.
“This is the real Acapulco,” Piquis Rochin, Acapulco’s international promotion director and stalwart cheerleader, declared to a group of foreign travel writers flown in for Tianguis. “We bring you to enjoy what any normal tourist would enjoy in Acapulco.”
The city she depicted was so magnificent that the guests might overlook one not so minor caveat—that Acapulco has the second highest homicide rate in the world.
Yes—the world.
The onetime “Pearl of the Pacific” in recent years has become the ultimate Potemkin village. It offers some of the country’s most spectacular resorts and beaches—and is also a virtual shooting gallery where gang warfare occasionally spills onto the streets and sands of the tourist zone.
It makes for some gruesome spectacles.
Hank Fey, a Philadelphia resident who’s been vacationing here with his wife since the 1970s, stood slack-jawed on the balcony of his hotel overlooking the popular Condesa Beach when he noticed why police and sun worshippers were massing on the shore.
“This dead guy was floating out there in the bay and they just let him drift back in,” recalled Fey, 79. “They said he drowned, but I believe he drowned with holes in him.”
That was in 2017. Last year, a person was shot dead outside his hotel, Fiesta Americana, he said. In the days since the tourist expo, mutilated bodies have popped up on a daily basis within a few miles of the coast, shocking but not surprising locals who’ve grown accustomed to the displays.
On April 23, tourists stepped around a sheet covering a bloody body on the sidewalk of Puerto Marquez, in the newer Diamond Zone where the expo center is located.
The previous week, a half dozen bodies were discovered, local media reported—one chopped up and dumped in two different neighborhoods. Another was found stuffed in the trunk of a taxi. A security guard was also found beaten to death with his finger tips mutilated, and a doctor was shot to death at a pharmacy in the Magallanes district, a couple of blocks from Condesa Beach.
On the roads, state police engaged in a shootout on Acapulco’s main highway, and a Mexican tourist leaving town after Easter was carjacked at gunpoint, according to local reports.
“It’s everywhere. There’s no control,” said Mary, a Buffalo native who lives in Acapulco. “The cartels are in control.”
Mary, 55, saw a man getting executed in the parking lot of an OXXO convenience store last year. Her husband fears he too might get targeted so takes a different route home from his restaurant job in the tourist area each night. A suspected gang member attempted to run him off the road by smashing into his car in September.
Local Spanish-only news sites, such as Lo Real De Guerrero, report on the daily bloodshed, and don’t shy away from posting pictures of the mutilated bodies. But the reports don’t get western media coverage unless they involve a foreign tourist, or a year-end murder roundup.
Esteban’s suspected killer, Javier Salvador, aka “El Koreano,” was arrested April 24. The homicide received almost no outside attention, in part because the victim was reportedly a Mexican national and not a U.S. citizen, despite his residency in Fresno. Another reason it didn’t get further publicity is that police in Acapulco kept it largely under wraps. They shared the victim’s first name, last initial and city of residence. No motive was presented. Victor Mateo, a crime reporter for Lo Real De Guerrero , said this is typical. Police are reluctant to share much of anything.
“I don’t know why he was killed,” Mateo said. “The police don’t say anything. A lot of times, the government or the police don’t give you the last names. They say they’re protecting the family. Maybe they don’t talk too much sometimes because they don’t want to scare the tourists away.”
The city logged 874 murders in 2018, and another 207 in the first three months of this year—averaging more than two a day.
None of them occurred in public view of the Tianguis crowds.
“Do you see any violence?” Acapulco’s promotion director said when asked about the reality that cartels are battling it out on the streets.
Piquis, a happy warrior in the field of public relations, repeats the mantra sounded by nearly everyone at the conference—that tourists are perfectly safe here.
“We don’t hide anything,” she says. “Nothing different happens here than any city in the world with guns. The perception is totally different from the reality of Acapulco.”
The dignitaries and business executives working their way through the Mundo Imperial conference center were in agreement that there is a crisis in Acapulco. But for them, the biggest problem isn’t the violence—it’s with messaging and the belief Mexico is barely fighting back against all the damning news.
Local reps and corporate leaders with business in Acapulco all scoff when asked if it’s safe in Acapulco. They insist the only people getting killed are gang members and their associates outside the tourist zone.
What’s needed, they say, is crisis management, a massive and sustained PR campaign to accentuate the positive. The more immediate problem as they see it is that the new president of Mexico, who spoke at Tianguis, recently slashed funding for tourism promotion and shut 18 of the government’s 21 international tourism offices, including several in the United States. It was the hottest topic not on the official agenda.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his tourism minister talked up his strategy to deploy more soldiers to improve security in places such as Acapulco, and invest in poorer neighborhoods outside tourist zones.
Tianguis participants, however, were more concerned with the PR aspect, arguing the cutbacks are limiting the government’s ability to counter damaging press after a year in which Mexico saw a 15 percent spike in homicides.
Promotion is “very important, particularly at a time when Mexico is losing global market share,” argued Alex Zozaya, CEO of Apple Leisure Group, the mega-wholesale travel company that is investing millions of dollars to renovate a 600-room hotel in Acapulco. “The perception of safety in Mexico, along with all the other issues and President Trump’s rhetoric against Mexico, describing Mexico as a very dangerous place, these are factors we have to fight. We need marketing. We need crisis management. We need to continue to have the promotion and we don’t have the resources now to do that.”
And Acapulco officials were using Tianguis to orchestrate their own PR blitz.
With a large swath of the travel industry present, they showcased a city in the midst of a renaissance. The dozens of travel writers and travel agents visiting from the United States, Canada and Europe enjoyed guided tours to see the haunts of Howard Hughes, Elvis and Frank Sinatra that are still in operation. They met a new wave of entrepreneurs who are investing in fusion-style restaurants, an international tennis stadium, and a world-class hospital to attract health tourists.
The officials pampered their guests with four-course meals in five star hotels, serving endless varieties of ceviche, stews and curries, flans and soufflés, and mango and tamarind cocktails. The writers and agents oohed and aahed during tours of penthouses offering spectacular views of the bay, before boarding a yacht to enjoy the calm waters. The guests left with their bags stuffed full of brochures, business cards and gifts such as mini-bottles of mezcal and hats. Photographers from the city’s tourism office documented the smiley exchanges.
All of it was standard PR. But there was no avoiding a brutal reality. The U.S. State Department is warning travelers to stay away because of widespread killings, kidnappings and robberies, in a city where federal and state police last year seized control of the local police force because of its corruption and gang ties.
Extortion is also prevalent, especially during the high season and holidays when workers, not tourists, are targeted.
“They don’t let us work if we don’t pay,” said Connie, 56, who owns a restaurant on Caletilla Beach, where in April 2018 a man’s body washed up on the tourist-packed sands after a suspected shooting. “We know already that they can kill us if we don’t pay.”
In late March, she and co-workers had to hit the floor when eight gunshots rang out during a gang dispute just outside.
On Good Friday, a gang member walked through her front door demanding 500 pesos in extortion at lunchtime. He barked that it was for “the bank,” not wanting customers to know his affiliation or the real reason he was there—to take his cut of the earnings during a busy holiday weekend.
Connie paid it, as she always does.
But despite her predicament, she was anxious not to frighten tourists.
“The problem is really not for the tourists; the problem is for the people who work here,” she said. “The mafia is not interested in doing something bad to tourists.”
That’s because the gangs need tourists to fund their operations, she explained. If tourists get killed, the international media would cover it and scare travelers away, hurting business owners and ultimately their ability to pay extortion to the gangs.
It’s a pretzel logic that keeps tourists relatively safe—but not one that would instill confidence in international travelers. Americans have long since abandoned Acapulco. Most traffic in recent years has been from Mexicans who drive in for the weekend. Average hotel occupancy is just 40 percent. This was evident even in the famed celebrity hangouts that were showcased during the non-holiday workweek. Las Brisas, the cliffside resort that once housed Brad Pitt and Liza Minnelli, was less than 20 percent full, despite steep discounts. Rooms at John Wayne’s Los Flamingos were going for $47.
“The indicators are telling us that Acapulco, despite having the whole infrastructure, has a security crisis that is keeping tourists away,” said Fatrima Masse, project coordinator for the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness.
And it’s not just tourists who are scared, she said. Nine out of 10 residents fear for their safety in their chosen city, which ranks last out of 22 tourist destinations its size in Mexico, according to a recent survey by the think tank.
Even a tour guide hired by Tianguis, while riding around Acapulco, told a reporter that he too fears for his safety and remains in Acapulco only because his wife’s elderly parents can’t move.
He was not among the official speakers. Piquis was, and she admitted she’s got a tough job trying to sell the city in an environment where nearly all major news stories are negative. Google “Acapulco” and the first items to pop up after Trip Advisor and Wikipedia entries are reports referencing “Mexico’s murder capital.”
""We have to change that perception,” she said. “But I am not a genius and we have not been able to find the key to change that perception. So we can do that through you.”"

Tarpley Hitt 05.04.19 11:36 PM ET
A s a general rule, the Bible isn’t keen on material possessions, but Jesus Christ has a thing for certain ones; specifically, he’s partial to tunics, and owns nearly a dozen of them—eight from cheap vendors on Amazon, two out of higher-end custom novelty shops. Jesus wears one wherever he goes—to Comic-Con , to WonderCon , and on all of his Twitch streams . Usually, these get-ups involve breezy, burlap-looking fabrics, topped with a regal red shawl. Occasionally, he’ll throw in a crown of thorns—he has several—or a pair of Warby Parker shades. These particular material possessions are important because they afford the wildly popular YouTuber, whose legal name is Jesus H. Christ and whose verified account has racked up more than one million subscribers, the ability to adhere to his cardinal rule: never, ever, ever, break character.
So it was a big deal when, in January this year, Jesus uploaded a video in his street clothes—his signature cotton robes swapped out for a Space-X sweatshirt, black glasses, and a beanie. The video, titled “I need your help! #savejesus #justiceforjesus,” marked a sharp departure from the online messiah’s standard fare. Usually, Jesus plays a character he calls “SoCal Christ,” a sardonic caricature of the biblical figure—like if the Buddy Christ from Kevin Smith’s Dogma had a YouTube channel, only took on more of Silent Bob’s theological sensibility. But in this video, Jesus is serious; somber, even. “Hello,” he says, staring at the ground. “My name is Jesus H. Christ. Obviously that isn’t the name I was given when I was born. I was raised in a highly controlled religious group. Some people call it a cult... YouTube set me free. I need your help.”
Then, Christ begins to cry.
By his own admission, the Lamb of God is an ugly crier. But, as the video goes on to point out, he has reason enough. Jesus grew up in the Mormon Church: his parents were Mormon, his seven siblings were Mormon, his friends were Mormon. He married a Mormon, worked as a Mormon wedding DJ, and raised three Mormon kids. When he left the church, his wife and children did not. Now, the four-minute video explains, he’s locked in an expensive legal battle to keep joint custody. “My own parents have sided with my ex-wife and are trying to strip me of all of my parental rights,” he says, directing viewers to a Patreon link to help him pay for his expenses. “YouTube has saved my life once. It unshackled me from the bonds of superstition and gave me a career. Then, it saved my career. And perhaps if I’m lucky, it can save my kids too.”
As is often the case with YouTube, conflict captured attention. The video went viral, receiving over 3.6 million views. Likes, subscriptions, and donations poured in. A day after the video was posted, Jesus’ fundraiser got a shoutout from PewDiePie, the controversial video-game streamer whose nearly 100 million subscribers puts him among the most popular YouTube personalities. Christ already had a substantial subscriber count, but after the signal boost, his fame started to snowball. He met his fundraising goal within hours; he was invited to conduct a Reddit AMA; and he was bombarded by messages from fans and reporters, begging for more details on how he went from “schlepping Jesus,” as he put it, to schlepping, among other things, Bible-themed, discount dildos.
In the past decade, the internet has become a gargantuan distortion field for religion, reshaping it in unusual ways. In some respects, the online explosion has made it easier than ever to go to church, ushering in an era of live-streamed services , hyper-linkable Bible passages, and Instagram-friendly congregations. But it has also posed a unique problem, especially for insular denominations that rely on members’ lack of ready access to information. As an ex-Mormon whose departure was brought on by the internet, who created, in a certain sense, a kind of anti-church online, and who garnered, in the span of three years, a significant fraction of the following that the Mormon Church had cultivated over nearly two centuries, YouTube Jesus seemed to embody that impulse.
But Jesus stopped responding to reporters. For all his fame, Christ had also elicited some less supportive responses. His ex-wife had begun compiling excerpts from his videos to use against him in court. Then, another YouTuber accused him of sexual assault, which he had to address in a separate video (it proved to be a hoax). All the while, demand for answers about his legal situation outpaced his ability to answer them. By the time the Reddit AMA came around, Jesus seemed weary. The thread was locked not long after it opened. “You’ve only answered 3 questions in the span of 6hrs,” a moderator wrote. “This is being removed.”
A few months later, he re-emerged and responded to my request(s) for an interview: “Hey there! So sorry that it’s taken so long to get back to you. Yes, I’m still interested. I just got completely slammed and this got lost in a sea of messages. Love, JC.”
A lot had changed in three months. In February, his channel had hit 1 million subscribers. In March, he’d linked up with Studio71, talent management company for online creators. And in May, he would be approaching the end of his custody case. Not long after his reply, we met in a Studio71 conference room dotted with heart-shaped decals. A tall guy in his thirties with billowing brown hair, a floor-length tunic and an Apple Watch, the YouTuber cuts a confusing figure. After he filed through a hallway, one woman asked audibly: “So, what’s up with that guy?” SECTION 2: IN THE BEGINNING
(Genesis 1:1)
In the Mormon Church, Jesus explained, every child receives something called the patriarchal blessing right around puberty. During the ceremony, an ordained priest places his hands on the kid’s head and offers up a prediction about their future. The tradition stems from a parable in Genesis, when God speaks to Jacob and promises to make him king of a vast land (“Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee”). The modern version turns out to be a little less grand, and a lot more specific. “My patriarchal blessing,” Jesus said, “mentioned that I’d been called by God to help advance his work through the use of the internet, and through computers—specifically through fiber optic cables.”
At the time, Jesus was 15 years old in ’90s-era Bakersfield, California. To the extent that he knew about computers, he liked them. But, as with all aspects of his life, Jesus’ interaction with technology had been restricted. He had grown up in the conservative hamlet with his seven siblings (he’s number six), his mother, and his father, a high-ranking official in the church. Mormonism is very structured. There are your standard local congregations; then, multiple congregations are gathered into groups called “wards”; several wards make up a “stake”; and a collection of stakes makes a “region.” Jesus’ dad led their local ward, before becoming a Stake president. It was a full-time job, on top of his actual full–time job (most mid-level Mormon officials are unpaid). Jesus’ father didn’t have much time for family, but what time he did have, he dedicated to ensuring his children were raised with ultra-orthodox values. That meant waking the kids up at 5:30 a.m. for family scripture study. It meant sending the older kids off to seminary before their school days at conservative, religious academies, and requiring they give practice sermons on subjects like prayer, tithing, and fasting. It also meant banning R-rated movies, pulling Jesus out of sex-ed as a freshman in high school, and boycotting musicians like James Taylor. “He’s a commie pinko fag,” was a common household refrain, according to Christ.
It worked for Jesus. He loved the faith, the scripture, and the community. At 19, he got his endowments—the ceremony where Mormons are given their special garments (known derisively as “magic underwear”)—and left home for a two-year missionary stint in Argentina. Jesus was stoked to be in Argentina, where he could master Spanish (his father was fluent). He kept a diligent diary and wrote home every week. On their missions, Mormons are prohibited from watching TV, reading the news, or having any technological contact with the outside world, except for two annual phone calls home—and Jesus broke the rules only once, watching the 9/11 attacks on the tiny TV in the kitchen of an Argentinian-Italian restaurant. A conversion wunderkind, he baptized 24 people. “I really knew how to schlep Jesus,” he said. “It’s all about family. My first baptism, I’ll never forget—it was a widow. She missed her husband. She had his photo over the mantle. It was really easy. It was just promising that she was going to see him again, and they would be in heaven together.” “ My patriarchal blessing mentioned that I'd been called by God to help advance his work through the use of the internet, and through computers––specifically through fiber optic cables. ”
Jesus did do stuff with computers—loosely. But after Argentina, his first priority was getting married. He bypassed college, met a girl at the Singles Ward—a congregation specifically for young, dating Mormons—courted her for 50 days, and married her 50 days later. Eventually, in 2004, he started a company DJing for weddings. Four years later, he got into wedding videography. He also made other types of movies—the biggest being a $200,000, feature-length biopic of his grandfather. It took home prizes at a major Christian film festival and was rated “Five Doves” by The Dove Foundation. By the late aughts, Jesus was wholly online. But what he found there didn’t bring him closer to God. It brought him to the Google Apostasy. SECTION 3: I DO HAVE FAITH, BUT NOT ENOUGH
(Mark 9:24)
In Mormonism, as with many reclusive denominations, no group is understood to be more evil, more susceptible to sin, and more deserving of damnation than “apostates,” or people who leave the church. The prophet Brigham Young once wrote that there was, literally, a special place in hell reserved for former Mormons. Asked about the proper punishment for murderers, he answered: “Make them soap-boilers and kitchen flunkeys, we are not going to send them into hell fire, for it takes a good Latter-day Saint apostatized to get down that deep (did I say bottomless?) pit.” An apostle named Heber Kimball put it a little more bluntly: “If men turn traitors to God and His Servants, their blood will surely be shed, or else they will be damned.”
But in the 2000s, Mormons were becoming angels of the Devil in increasingly distressing numbers. It’s hard to get solid statistics on just how many people left the church or their exact reasons for doing so, but by 2012, there was an established sense that membership was dropping off, and that it had something to do with Google. Church officials blamed the spike on misinformation—a kind of proto-fake news. (“Never before have we had this information age, with social networking and bloggers publishing unvetted points of view,” former church historian Marlin Jensen told the Salt Lake Tribune that year.) But apostates saw it differently. Now online, Mormons had unprecedented access to information about their faith. If they had questions, they could Google them—and not everyone liked what they found. The church has been historically cagey about their legacy of polygamy, for example, shying away from the fact that founder Joseph Smith had multiple wives, some as young as 14. With search engines, reading up on that history became a matter of clicks. The phenomenon took on a name: The Google Apostasy.
The movement exposed church blind spots—not only in historical accounting, but in digital strategy. Mormonism hadn’t migrated online, and it quickly became cause for concern (the church did not respond to requests for comment). In 2012, Jensen told the Salt Lake Tribune that officials had assigned a staffer to draft “a strategy to get church history on the web.” Later that year, the official Mormon website—which previously had not mentioned polygamy, Smith’s wives, or many other controversial subjects—finally addressed them in a series of articles called the “Gospel Topic Essays.” (Notably: the website makes them hard to find, but here are a few ). By 2015, they established “social media missionaries,” according to a leaked draft of an internal guide called “Missionary Work in the Digital Age.” And just earlier this year, they changed the church’s official URL.
At the same time, the Google Apostasy was also growing. In 2013, a PDF called the CES Letter about a Mormon’s religious doubts went mini-viral (the piece can now be read in six languages and five different digital formats). The ex-Mormon Subreddit—the site’s most-subscribed religion recovery thread—racked up nearly 120,000 followers (the official Mormon page clocks in under 10,000). In 2016, a YouTube account called Mormon Leaks released footage of internal church meetings on taboo subjects like homosexuality, marijuana, and Pirates of the Caribbean . The account later evolved into a mock-WikiLeaks whistleblowing site.
The past few years amounted to an exercise in dueling digital strategies, and it was in the early stages of the Google Apostasy that Jesus first encountered a video—shared on Facebook by his younger brother, another church skeptic—called “Science Saved My Soul.” The video wasn’t especially fancy. Most of the 15-minute piece involved a soft-spoken Brit, waxing corny on the cosmos. (“I stepped out of a supernova,” the narrator says over screensaver shots of the Milky Way, “and so did you.”) But the video was enough to plant an idea in J.C.’s head. Maybe, he thought, Mormon scripture had left some things out. SECTION 4: WEEP BITTERLY FOR HIM WHO IS EXILED
(Jeremiah 22:10)
In September of 2011, Jesus had just come home from a wedding shoot abroad, when he was struck by an unpleasant thought. “I realized, Oh my god, I have to do this blessing in front of everyone,” he said. Christ’s third child had been born just weeks prior, and the family was making arrangements for her blessing—a Mormon rite of passage somewhat like a christening, but conducted by the father before more than one hundred uncles, aunts, and family figures whose precise position in the genetic tapestry was either unclear or had never been explained.
A crisis of faith doesn’t happen all at once; it’s a gradual build-up of pressure. For Jesus, the rumblings had started in 2008, when the Mormon Church campaigned to pass Proposition 8 in California, a ballot measure revoking the right for gay couples to marry. He hadn’t understood why God cared so much about gay marriage; the campaign left him uneasy. He’d always found ways to be busy during canvassing. After embracing the internet, that discomfort evolved into doubt. By the time of the blessing, “I kind of knew at that moment: I don’t think I believe this anymore,” Jesus recalled.
He performed the blessing, but not well. J.C.’s older brother, who had also harbored doubts, knew something was wrong right away. When they got lunch the next day, the brother told Jesus details he had never heard before: that Joseph Smith had a long criminal record; that he had a history of “glass looking,” or alleging he could use a magic rock to find buried treasure; that Mormon texts like The Book of Abraham and The Book of Moses , which Smith claimed to have translated from Egyptian papyri, had actually proved to be basic funerary texts. Jesus reeled. Later that day, when he recounted what he’d learned to his wife, she did too—though not in the way he’d hoped. “I was out that night,” he said. “I remember getting a hotel room. I remember going to Target and buying underwear for the first time in my entire life. I was 30 years old, and for the first time in my life I was buying underwear.”
Jesus moved to Long Beach, where he could stay close to his kids, while testing out his newfound secularism. Outside the church, Christ was lonely. His whole social world had come from faith. His parents weren’t speaking to him; neither were some of his siblings. He met a friend on Reddit, but mostly, all he had was YouTube, which he watched a lot: hours on end, daily, for nearly two years. He watched talk shows, tutorials, gamer streams, and sketch comedy. Above all, he watched science. He downed educational videos by the dozen. “With my worldview kind of wiped away, I got to start over again, rediscovering this stuff. I wanted to basically enroll in school again and just learn,” he said.
On YouTube, all roads lead to Joe Rogan , and in one of the libertarian commentator’s videos, he harped on a certain line, a kind of self-help disguised as machismo: Be your own John Wayne . Jesus didn’t particularly like John Wayne. But he did like the framework, the idea that people should act like the heroes of their own movie. For a man who had spent his whole life in a supporting role, acting in the image of God, it hit home. Organized religion had disappointed him, but some of it was worth saving. “I just love Jesus,” Jesus said. Not long later, he ordered a tunic on Amazon. He was 33. SECTION 5: WHERE IS THE ONE BORN KING?
(Matthew 2:2)
How do you become Christ? Jesus wasn’t really sure. He knew a lot about his namesake. He’d read Jesus the Christ , a 350-page history by Mormon scholar James E. Talmage, three times through (once in Spanish). He knew about the Beatitudes: the meek being blessed and so on. He had long hair. But what would modern Jesus do? He started in an unlikely place: the freelancing site Fiverr.
In May 2015, Jesus started offering custom videos in costume, for five bucks a piece. When the first real order arrived, Christ knew he was onto something. It came from another ex-Mormon, trying to raise awareness about the misinformation in the church. (“I can quote it,” Jesus recalled. “It said, ‘If I have one nugget of truth, it is to visit Mormonthink.org.’ That’s a website for people with doubts. I just cried.”) Around that same time, he tried his hand at YouTube. He developed a loose backstory: something about the Messiah’s second coming, how He’d returned during the Super Bowl to a world too obsessed with Left Shark to notice. His first sketch was a standard unboxing video. He called it “Jesus Christ reviews Authentic Crown of Thorns from the Holy Land.” Overnight, it racked up more than 50,000 views.
But Jesus’ initial virality was hard to replicate. YouTube success is slippery—when the range of top channels involve seven-year-olds reviewing toys, gamer commentary, and guys scoring trick shots, it can be unclear to a newcomer, or to anyone for that matter, what works. His second video went all but overlooked. Ditto the next few. Christ hit something of a standstill until January 2017, when he got a Fiverr order from PewDiePie. The request seemed simple: a short greeting for another popular YouTuber named Jacksepticeye. But PewDiePie had misspelled the guy’s name, writing “Jackspedicey.” Unsure if the typo was intentional, Jesus made two videos—one with the right spelling, one with the error. PewDiePie uploaded the error, and it went viral. Jackspedicey became a meme, and Jesus became famous. It wasn’t exactly the kind of fame Jesus wanted—the joke was on him, more than with him—but it was enough to establish his account in the PewDiePie extended universe. Orders poured in with riffs on Jackspedicey. PewDiePie put in more requests too. “ If it strikes you as odd that modern Jesus might be tight with PewDiePie, that’s probably because you’re familiar with his repertoire. ”
If it strikes you as odd that modern Jesus might be tight with PewDiePie, that’s probably because you’re not familiar with his repertoire. The Swedish gamer became the undisputed king of YouTube by way of producing gaming and online news videos, peppered with shrill, sphincter-clenching yammering, and occasionally screaming the n-word . When Jesus joined his sphere, dubbed the 9-Year-Old Army, PewDiePie hadn’t yet become wholly synonymous with the most annoying parts of the internet. But after a few more Fiverr orders, that changed. In 2017, as part of what the gamer claimed was a thought experiment, he hired Fiverr freelancers to make a string of controversial videos. One involved two Indian men holding a banner which read “Death to All Jews.” Another featured Jesus, claiming: “Hitler did nothing wrong.”
When the videos went viral, Jesus and the other freelancers were promptly banned from Fiverr. (A spokesperson for Fiverr wrote that “any attempt made to bully, harass, or use hate speech is in clear violation of our terms of service and strictly prohibited.”) The gesture was a small part of what came to be known as the “Adpocalypse”: a wave of platforms—most prominently, Youtube—banning or demonetizing content deemed “not advertiser friendly,” usually on the grounds that they constituted hate speech. But PewDiePie, who would later lose revenue of his own in the Adpocalypse, came to Christ’s rescue, calling for Fiverr to reinstate the accounts banned on his behalf, and suspend his account instead. Days later, Jesus was back online. But the scandal and his ongoing role in the 9-Year-Old Army illustrated that his new schtick was not, strictly speaking, especially sacred; or, if it was sacred, that Jesus had in mind a whole other kind of holy. Case in point: Shortly after the Fiverr ordeal, Christ named PewDiePie a Saint.
The easy read on Jesus’ relationship with PewDiePie is financial. The bigger YouTuber, despite his controversial track record, put Jesus on the map. He lifted him out of algorithmic anonymity, saved his account from suspension, and—most recently—helped crowdfund his lawyer fees. But that’s only part of it. Although Jesus does make money from his Fiverr account, he has not accepted a cent from YouTube. The proceeds go to a small charity called Aussie Rescue SoCal, a one-woman Australian Shepherd shelter not far from his home. Beyond money, what draws Jesus to PewDiePie is his following. Messiahs need disciples, and PewDiePie’s reach of nearly 96 million people comprises a significant slice of the online world. “I recognize that it was his audience that came and helped me. It wasn’t necessarily him,” Jesus said. “His audience is really a cross-section of what the internet is, of what Youtube is. This is YouTube. This is the internet.” SECTION 6: UPON THIS ROCK, I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH
(Matthew 16:18)
These days, Christ lives in a condo just off a main drag in Long Beach. His apartment is a shrine to his post-Mormon interests: giant photos of Hollywood, racks of vinyl records, a small fleet of bikes (Jesus doesn’t drive), a bed for his dog (Judas), a wall of longboards, a green-screen studio, and books upon books about science. The morning I dropped by, Jesus was dressed down in a Darwin graphic tee and slacks (he breaks character at home). His arm tattoo, a diagram of the carbon atom—“six electrons, six neutrons, six protons, the most metal element”—peeked out from a sleeve. Earlier that day, a global network of telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope had zoomed in on a black hole in the M87 galaxy, documenting the first-ever visual evidence of Einstein’s century-old theory that a colossal gravitational pull could warp spacetime. Jesus went buckwild; he’d spent the morning poring over science videos. “It’s black hole day!” he exclaimed.
YouTube has given Jesus everything: an identity crisis, a career, a vast network of friends, fans, and financial supporters. It is the closest thing he has to a church, and introduced him to the closest thing he has to a scripture: science. When he left religion, Christ turned to the video that had started it all: “Science Saved My Soul.” From there, he found videos on chemistry, biology, and physics. This thing called the Scientific Method—it struck him as the only means of drawing conclusions that couldn’t be corrupted, constructed, or turn out to have secret 14-year-old wives. If an experiment could be repeated over and over, he figured, its results were unassailable: a slice of pure, unadulterated truth. “It was like, boom . It’s the answer, finally,” he said. “I became religious about it.”
Science has also become his only hope of salvation. In November, after six years of co-parenting his kids, Christ’s ex-wife told him she planned to move to Oregon and sued for sole custody. They fought for months in court, but couldn’t reach an agreement. At its core, the custody battle came down to religious differences: Christ didn’t want their kids ordained in the Mormon priesthood; his ex didn’t want them subscribed to him on YouTube. Finally, at Christ’s request, a judge ordered something called a 730 Evaluation, a last-ditch effort for parents who can’t hash out custody. It’s a mental health study of a family and its members, prepared by a psychiatrist, to determine the best custodial outcome for the kids. “My lawyer thinks this is my only chance and I agree,” Jesus said in his YouTube video asking for funds. The results come out later this month.
Recently, J.C’s lawyer suggested he join a church, just to assist his assessment. It would make him more sympathetic, he said, help him look like a good guy. Why not swing by a service? It could even be Unitarian. “I lost my shit,” Jesus said. “I’m here because I couldn’t lie anymore.” Instead, he wants to start his own church—on YouTube. The internet, he argues, functions a lot like religion—and not just because of the crusades, the followers, and the constant claims that the whole thing is fake. For Jesus, it became his community. He plans to file a trademark on the new name: the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Dudes."

The city of Minneapolis has agreed to pay $20 million to the family of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, an unarmed woman who was shot to death by a police officer in 2017 . According to NBC News, the family sued the city for $50 million after former police officer Mohamed Noor shot the 40-year-old while responding to her report of a potential rape or sexual assault next to her home. The lawsuit was put on hold pending Noor’s criminal trial, which came to an end earlier this week. The officer was sentenced to 15 years in prison for third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. At the trial, Noor maintained that he thought the 40-year-old woman was a threat when he saw her approaching his police vehicle. Damond did not have a weapon on her at the time. “This is not a victory for anyone, but rather a way for our city to move forward,” Mayor Jacob Frey told reporters on Friday. “And I do believe that we will move forward together, united in the shared believe that such a tragedy should never occur in our city.” Family of Woman Killed by Minn.

"Trump Nominates Mark Morgan, Obama-Era Border Patrol Chief, As New ICE Director",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-nominates-obama-era-border-patrol-chief-as-new-ice-director,"BORDER LINE Trump Nominates Obama-Era Border Patrol Chief As New ICE Director Mark Morgan resigned as head of U.S. Border Patrol one day after President Trump signed an executive order to build a border wall. 05.05.19 12:10 PM ET NICHOLAS KAMM
In a surprise move, President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would nominate Mark Morgan, the former chief of U.S. Border Patrol under President Barack Obama, to serve as the new permanent director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“I am pleased to inform all of those that believe in a strong, fair and sound Immigration Policy that Mark Morgan will be joining the Trump Administration as the head of our hard working men and women of ICE,” Trump tweeted . “Mark is a true believer and American Patriot. He will do a great job!”
Morgan had served only six days under Trump before submitting his resignation as head of Border Patrol, one day after Trump signed an executive order mandating the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Morgan has recently made appearances on Fox News, in which he supported the president’s immigration policies.
The former Border Patrol chief told Law & Crime in January that he had been pressured to resign from the position, in part because of his public opposition to the concept of a border wall, the keystone of Trump’s immigration agenda.
Asked by a U.S. Senate committee in November 2016 about Trump’s proposed wall, Morgan said that such a wall would not be “the sole answer,” and that it did not need to cover the full 2,000-mile border between the United States and Mexico.
Morgan has since come around to supporting the administration’s policies on immigration, including the as-yet-unbuilt wall.
“The current administration had decided to go in a different direction since the president was inaugurated,” Morgan said at the time. “The president is correct, and what he’s doing—the wall works, one hundred percent.”
In a discussion with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto in January, Morgan told the host that “we need to do it all, including the wall.”
“I agree one hundred percent with what the president is trying to do with al things related to border security,” Morgan said at the time. “It is absolutely, one hundred percent, in my opinion... a national security and humanitarian crisis.”
ICE declined to comment on the nomination, and White House did not immediately respond for clarification on whether Morgan’s nomination has been formally submitted to the Senate.
The nomination is the latest change in senior staff at the Department of Homeland Security, which has endured numerous shakeups in recent months as Trump has grown frustrated by the legal, political and, occasionally, ethical hurdles to implementing his hard-right immigration proposals. Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stepped down in April following numerous reports that Trump felt she was slow-walking his agenda on border security, and Trump pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to lead ICE two days earlier, declaring that he wanted a “tougher” nominee.
“Ron’s a good man,” Trump told reporters at the time. “But we’re going in a tougher direction. We want to go in a tougher direction.” READ THIS LIST"

President Donald Trump continued on Sunday to give oxygen to calls for Fox News to let Judge Andrew Napolitano go after the on-air personality claimed that the president was “immoral” and “repellent” and that he likely did obstruct justice, according to evidence in the Mueller report. Trump retweeted an obscure Twitter account on Sunday morning that said, “When you look at the continuous incorrect statements by Napolitano over the past 2 years, it is fair to ask FNC why they allow him to have national air time. The man has been significantly wrong on at least 8 major occasions. Unacceptable! Take him off the air!” He had previously claimed that Napolitano was just angry because he was overlooked for a Supreme Court post. "
‘Yesterday’: A Musical Fairy Tale That Asks What if the Beatles Didn’t Exist?,www.thedailybeast.com,,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/yesterday-a-musical-fairy-tale-that-asks-what-if-the-beatles-didnt-exist,"SHE LOVES YOU ‘Yesterday’: A Musical Fairy Tale That Asks What if the Beatles Didn’t Exist? Danny Boyle’s new musical rom-com, ‘Yesterday,’ imagines an alternate reality in which there were no Beatles and a young busker must introduce the world to their music. 05.05.19 4:45 PM ET Jonathan Prime/Uni
Introducing Yesterday at the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival , festival co-founder Robert De Niro had a unique reason for endorsing the film. It made him think of a world in which there was no Donald Trump .
It’s outlandish and almost unthinkable given the state of the world right now and Trump’s omnipresence in the news and our every consuming thought. But so, too, is the central premise of Yesterday , which asks a similarly inconceivable question: What if the Beatles never existed?
The new film, directed by Danny Boyle ( Slumdog Millionaire ) and written by Richard Curtis ( Love Actually ) is a musical fairy tale of sorts—or a musical nightmare, depending on your devotion to the Fab Four and purview of a world without them in it.
It is without a doubt a high-concept Richard Curtis romantic comedy, featuring the hallmarks of his most noteworthy films, which in addition to the indelible holiday mashup of love stories includes Notting Hill , in which a movie star falls in love with an anonymous bookshop owner; About Time , in which a man travels through time to nab a girlfriend; and Four Weddings and a Funeral , about a group of unlucky-in-love friends who encounter romance at a series of social occasions.
Yesterday certainly fits in with this oeuvre, though certainly doesn’t reach the benchmark of the best of Curtis’s work. It’s high concept nearly to a fault, stretching the logic of its own universe. It’s romantic storyline is slighter, and as such, the emotion more saccharine than swoon-inducing. But intact is Curtis’s playfulness with telling a love story—it certainly doesn’t get more whimsical than reinventing the Beatles—his cheeky dissection of celebrity and fame, and a quick, tart, British sense of humor punctuating it all.
The result is a film that’s fun and, in a world where Bohemian Rhapsody makes $900 million at the box office, will certainly be a hit, especially once trailers featuring star Himesh Patel crooning those Beatles tunes start to circulate. But as enticing and clever as the premise initially is on paper, its implausibility also becomes aggravating.
Patel is Jack Malick, an unsuccessful British-Indian aspiring musician who decides, at the protest of his best friend and manager Ellie ( Lily James ) to call it quits. While biking home from his final gig in a terrible rain storm, there’s a freak global blackout. At just that moment, a bus crashes into him, knocking him out during the entirety of the power outage and, among other things, destroying his guitar.
When he recovers from the crash, Ellie gifts him with a new guitar, and he christens it in front of his friends with an impromptu rendition of “Yesterday.” They’re moved to tears, as if they’ve never heard the song before. He’s certain they’re pranking him. How have they not heard one of the greatest songs of all time by one of the greatest musical acts there’s ever been? Calm down, they tell him. It’s good, but “it’s not Coldplay.”
Jack runs home and starts furiously googling. “The Beatles” only yields a spelling correction and information about bugs. “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” only surfaces images of red peppers.
This new alternate reality gives him divine inspiration. He, Jack Malick, would bring back the Beatles.
There’s almost infinite hilarity to be mined from the idea of a world hearing the Beatles’ biggest hits for the first in 2019, and, more, for it to be an average Joe of sorts to be the one introducing them to the work. (That the infinite hilarity is, in essence, the same joke over and over actually isn’t as bothersome as you’d think.)
He may know that he’s recreating the work of genius, but other people have no idea. When he plays “Let It Be” for his parents for the first time, they keep interrupting him, assuming it’s another hack song he had written himself. Frustrated, he wails, “You’re the first people on earth to hear this song! It’s like watching Da Vinci paint the ‘Mona Lisa’ in front of your eyes!”
When he plays “A Day in the Life” on a local news show, Ed Sheeran hears it and decides to take Jack on tour, though he thinks it would be a better idea to change “Hey Jude” to “Hey Dude.” Then there’s the comedy of Jack not being able to remember lyrics to certain songs.
It’s all very cute! But then the more you think about the movie, the more irritated you become.
There are major, unanswered questions surrounding the rules of a universe in which the Beatles doesn’t exist. Chiefly, what happened during that blackout that eradicated them specifically? And what is the connection between them and the other things that Jack learns were also eliminated: Coca Cola, cigarettes, and Oasis. They seem utterly random, and straining to figure a connection between them is maddening.
Or is it actually fun? We’d say maybe it’s best not to overthink, but that becomes impossible. Even when it comes to the love story: There’s never a compelling reason given for why these two characters haven’t been together the entire time.
Roughly halfway through the movie you might have a realization, too, that there’s no gratifying way for it to end. We obviously won’t spoil how it ends, and only briefly chastise the morbid, crass cameo that happens and sets the eventual conclusion in motion. But the film by its own premise is written into a creative impossibility: Do you want him to get away with this lie? Or do you want to take this new career successful away from him?
The ride to that point, though, is pleasant enough. How could it not be, when it’s two hours spent listening to the Beatles? The truth is that, enjoyable as they are, none of the scenes of Jack recording the band’s songs are as rousing as the major musical moments from past films that Beatles songs have soundtracked, including one from one of Curtis’ own movies, “All You Need Is Love” from Love Actually.
But Patel is a force of a talent, and makes a star-making film debut here. James continues her track record of making the most of underwritten female leads, and is charming as always even in another thankless role. The surprising amount of screen time for Ed Sheeran, again, proves how much fun Curtis has when given the opportunity to take the piss out of celebrity, and Kate McKinnon, playing Ed and Jack’s manager, is a very funny scene-stealer, though she seems to be robbing an entirely different movie.
In the end, the film is a bit like going to see a very good Beatles cover band, and maybe that’s the point. It pales in comparison from the magic of the real thing, but, by nature, it’s going to be a lot of fun anyway."

John Oliver Roasts Dem Congressman Steve Cohen’s ‘Pathetic’ Attempt at Trolling AG William Barr With KFC,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-oliver-roasts-dem-congressman-steve-cohens-pathetic-attempt-at-trolling-attorney-general-william-barr-with-kfc,"YIKES John Oliver Roasts Dem Congressman Steve Cohen’s ‘Pathetic’ Attempt at Trolling AG William Barr With KFC It was ‘just tragic for so many reasons,’ argued the late-night comedian. 05.06.19 12:03 AM ET HBO
On Sunday evening, Last Week Tonight host John Oliver dedicated the opening portion of his program to Attorney General William Barr’s no-show at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.
“On Thursday, Attorney General Bill Barr failed to turn up to a congressional hearing—and that prompted this exhilarating bit of prop comedy,” offered Oliver.
Yes, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) spent the hearing chowing down on a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. If that wasn’t enough, he also flaunted a ceramic chicken to send the message that AG Barr is—yep—“a chicken” for refusing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.
“Yeah, we get it. You’ve made that painfully obvious. And it gets even more pathetic,” explained Oliver. Because the Barr hearing was at 9:30 a.m., and because the nearest KFC didn’t open until 10:30 a.m., Cohen—as The Daily Beast reported —“bought the chicken the night before and kept it in his fridge.”
“Which is just tragic for so many reasons,” said Oliver. “One, he’s biting into leftover KFC—or, as it’s more commonly known, ‘trash.’ And two, that means this adult man probably lay in bed all night thinking about how fucking awesome his chicken joke was going to be—and he was completely wrong about that.”
Not to be outdone, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) proceeded to bring a blown-up photo of Cohen munching KFC to the Senate floor to argue that Cohen was being, well, unprofessional for doing so during a House committee hearing.
“I see,” said Oliver. “So it’s pathetic theater to eat KFC but not to rush to Kinkos and laminate a poster-board image of someone eating KFC. I get it.”"
Houston Cops: 5-Year-Old Brain Surgery Patient Missing After Stepdad Reports Abduction,www.thedailybeast.com,Tracy.Connor@thedailybeast.com (Tracy Connor),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/maleah-davis-5-missing-after-stepfather-darion-vence-reports-abduction-beating-in-houston,"Houston Cops: 4-Year-Old Brain Surgery Patient Missing After Stepdad Reports Abduction Maleah Davis’ stepdad says he was beaten, kidnapped, and then dumped—without the little girl. 05.05.19 11:26 PM ET Houston Police Department
Houston Police are searching for a 4-year-old girl who recently had brain surgery and who was reported kidnapped by her stepfather—who said he was ambushed, beaten, and then dumped on the side of a highway with his 1-year-old son.
Sgt. Mark Holbrook said “there are a lot of blanks in that story” because the stepfather said he was in and out of consciousness for nearly 24 hours and doesn’t remember most of what happened.
Darion Vence, 26, told detectives that he was driving to the airport with stepdaughter Maleah Davis and his son Kourtland to pick up their mother arriving on a flight from Massachusetts, when he heard a “popping sound.”
Thinking he might have a flat tire, he pulled over and got out of the car, Vence told police. He said two men in a blue pickup truck rolled up and while one was making comments about Maleah, the other knocked him out, Holbrook said.
When he opened his eyes, he was in the back of the truck with the two children and three men, he said.
“Darion loses consciousness… he’s in and out of consciousness… he really does not know where he is until 6 p.m. Saturday when he comes to down on Highway 6 in Sugar Land,” the sergeant said.
Maleah was gone, but Kourtland was with him, Vence told cops. He said he walked around asking for help and then trekked on foot to the hospital, where he reported the little girl missing.
Houston cops put out an Amber Alert for Maleah, who has undergone numerous brain surgeries, including one last month. They also released photos of the type of truck Vence described and the silver car Vence was driving—which was caught on a traffic camera around 2:45 p.m. but has not been spotted since.
Maleah’s mother was in Massachusetts, attending her father’s funeral, family members said. When she got off the plane and Vence was not there to pick her up, she called her own mother, Brenda Bowens, to come get her and did not report him or the children missing.
“I can’t even imagine anybody going through what my family is going through,” Bowens told the Houston Chronicle . “It’s unbelievable.”
Holbrook said police have not yet found any video or witnesses to corroborate Vence’s account of what happened. He was treated and released from the hospital.
“Maybe somebody saw him. Maybe he was walking around in a daze. Maybe someone saw him doing something. I’d love to know anything about that,” Holbrook said.
Bowens said the family is worried sick.
“If anybody hurt my grandchild or they took my grandchild, I want them to be punished the way they are supposed to be because she was the sweetest little girl,” she told the Chronicle . “I miss her terribly.”"

Three performers describe their lives sighing and moaning for a living. WARNING: graphic content. Alaina Demopoulos 05.05.19 8:01 PM ET
A young woman named Serena lies down on a bed, lights some candles, and begins to masturbate. She’s picturing Rihanna, thinking of how the pop star’s nipples look in the “Needed Me” music video.
“I love her ‘don’t fuck with me’ stare,” Serena breathes. She keep touching herself, thinking of her friend Nia. “She has the perfect mouth. Almost like her teeth don’t quite fit, but it’s so cute. I love women with crooked smiles. It’s so… commanding.”
Welcome to the world of audio porn, a medium some insist is the most empowering way to get off. These recordings—half-erotica, half-radio play—have long flourished on Reddit communities like GoneWildAudio or PillowTalkAudio . Now, entrepreneurs bet it can go mainstream—and make money.
Last December, Gina Gutierrez and Faye Keegan founded Dipsea, which churns out three heavily produced sexy stories a week. (Serena’s scene comes from a Dipsea episode called “Cliterati.”) The app charges $4 a month for a yearlong commitment, or $9 paid month-by-month. In February, the founders announced their app had hit $5.5 million in seed funding.
Though Gutierrez declined to provide The Daily Beast with any details on Dipsea’s reach, its Instagram, which reposts both Gloria Steinem quotes and Timothée Chalamet glamour shots, has around 6,700 followers.
That breadth has yet to rival R/GoneWildAudio’s 270,000 members. However, Dipsea’s professionally acted audios are undoubtedly slicker than the homegrown stuff.
Next week, Dipsea will release its hundredth episode. Anyone looking for the classic tropes—for example, a pizza delivery boy’s romp with a bored housewife, or any sex that starts with “I’m sure we can figure out some form of payment”—should look elsewhere.
Gutierrez prefers to think of Dipsea scenarios as “aspirational reality.” Think a woman hooking up with her hot barista, or two bi-curious friends messing around at a bachelorette party. “ We all go to yoga classes and know what it’s like to be in a hot, crowded room. We imagine that kind of thing might happen. Even if it’s really unlikely, it could, and that’s super sexy ”
The most popular audio to date has been “Hot Vinyasa,” a torrid romance between a yoga student and teacher. The saga has spawned two sports bra-ripping sequels.
“We all go to yoga classes and know what it’s like to be in a hot, crowded room,” Gutierrez explained. “We imagine that kind of thing might happen. Even if it’s really unlikely, it could , and that’s super sexy.”
In “Hot Vinyasa,” yoga student Laura finds herself crushing on Mark, her teacher who also happens to be a former marine. Ninety percent of the first episode is all sexual tension. Only about four minutes are dedicated to the juicy stuff.
Traditional visual porn has been vilified for presenting an unrealistic world where poreless women with no body hair want to sleep with balding, bacne’d taxi drivers.
Again, you will not find that on Dipsea, though the app does traffic a different kind of fantasy made for “The Future is Female” T-shirt set. There, consent is as explicit as Serena’s dirty talk.
In “Hot Vinyasa,” Mark makes a point of asking Laura, “May I?” before putting his hands down her yoga pants. (Equally unreal: Laura’s sweaty spandex “glides right off” her skin with ease.)
“In our stories, people who are hooking up for the first time definitely need to get a condom,” said Kristina Loring, Dipsea’s storytelling lead editor. No ifs, ands, or butts about it—though the team has gotten creative at how to sound-design safer sex.
“It’s not always going to be an A/B dialogue of, ‘Go get a condom,’” Loring explained. “We don’t want to take you out of the moment, but we want you to know it’s safe sex.”
That might mean that the sound comes from unwrapping an actual condom. The team has also played around with ways to reproduce the sound, such as crinkling paper into a microphone. “ I was drawn into stories that were geared toward women, genuine situations people could find themselves in. It’s different from most porn I’d seen ”
Leah Voysey, a 26-year-old voice actor from Brooklyn, New York, played Laura in “Hot Vinyasa.” Before working with Dipsea, Voysey had never listened to audio porn and does not consider herself a fan of the medium. As a working actor in New York, it was just another quirky gig to her.
“I had seen castings for adult content before, but this was the first time I ever submitted,” Voysey said. “I was drawn into stories that were geared toward women, genuine situations people could find themselves in. It’s different from most porn I’d seen.”
The current Dipsea team is all women, though the company’s co-founder said that could change in the future. Voysey feels that the gender make-up of staff helped ease her into the first scene.
“It was not as weird as I thought it would be,” Voysey said. “They were on the phone coaching us, and they made it sound normal when they said, ‘Say, ‘Oh, suck on my tits,’ this way.’” It also helps that Voysey records from the privacy of her home studio, directed by the Dipsea team in San Francisco.
Though she is not currently dating, Voysey has considered sending her story to potential dates as a kind of aural sexting. “I haven’t done it, but it’s been a thought—hey, I could use this in my dating life,” she laughed.
Earlier this month Lauren Speigel—the sister of Snapchat founder Evan—launched Quinn , a free, barebones platform where amateurs can upload short fiction and audio files. Spiegel, 22, told Allure that she founded Quinn after experiencing sexual dysfunction caused by anorexia.
“[I wanted] to make a product that makes sex more chill,” Spiegel told the site. “Why does the tone around sex have to be so weird? It's such a fun, happy part of life. Quinn is a daily dose of pleasure. Wake up, grab your coffee, use Quinn for 20 minutes.”
April Would has always had a distinctive laugh. When she’s out in public and finds something funny, people turn to see where her trill, high-pitched giggles are coming from.
As a child, she assumed people stared because her laugh was so loud. Now 31, a freelance audio porn performer and phone sex operator, Would wonders if people look because they recognize it from her recordings.
Would, who requested The Daily Beast use her performance name as she has not told family about her job, began listening to audio porn in 2017.
“What has always appealed to me the most about explicit material has been the sound over visual,” Would said. “A lot of times, I found audio distracting. So I thought: there is so much porn online, I bet there is a place where I can just listen.”
A late night Google search led Would to Reddit’s GoneWildAudio community. In these amateur audios, performers read scripts in the second-person, inviting the listener to visualize they are on the receiving end of every suck, moan, or kiss.
“Everything is left up to the imagination,” Would said. “It makes it a lot of fun, super immersive and really intimate.” After listening to the audios for about six months, Would decided to make her own with a voice recorder saved from her days as a reporter for a college newspaper.
At first, sitting in her apartment bathroom alone, doing one half of a porno, felt silly. “It took some getting used to,” Would explained. “I found a femme-dom, BDSM script, and I thought, ‘you’re acting.’ A switch flipped. After that, it was easy.” “ When I’m doing a blowjob sound, I can stick my tongue back and almost choke on my own tongue. I need to be careful, but it’s been my tongue forever so I am used to it ”
Along the way, Would discovered many hidden talents. As a child, she spoke with a lisp. A speech counselor said that her tongue was too big for her mouth. A preteen Would had reconstructive surgery, which left her producing extra saliva.
“When I’m doing a blowjob sound, I can stick my tongue back and almost choke on my own tongue,” Would said. “I need to be careful, but it’s been my tongue forever so I am used to it.”
When it comes time to bring in props, Would said that “You find things to suck on.”
She once tried to blow a dildo to make gagging noises, but her teeth scraped against the surface and made an unpleasant grinding sound. After more experimenting, Would found a different solution—but refused to divulge what she uses. “It’s a professional secret,” she said.
A former telemarketer, Would “always hated” her phone voice, because it sounded young to her. But on GoneWildAudio, where the freaky fare skews less “Let me grab a condom,” and more “Choke me daddy,” Would’s pleasant, easygoing, girl-next-door lilt drew fans—and paying customers.
After a year of posting for her own enjoyment, Would got a message from a listener. The man had written a script that he did not want to make public, and he offered her money to record it. Would was flattered, so she agreed to do it. He asked for another, and another. “I realized if he would pay me, probably a lot of other people would, too.”
Would began accepting clients who either had pre-written scripts or ideas they wanted her to conceptualize. She first charged $25 to read a story and $50 to write one herself, though she now charges $100 for the latter.
“I’ll get an email from a client with an idea, then we’ll get on the phone to talk,” Would explained. “If I like the script and it doesn’t make me uncomfortable—I have a pretty high threshold—I’ll do it.” It takes her around two and a half weeks to complete a job.
Though Would refrained from speaking about any scenarios that might be on her ‘no’ list, she considers her work “a way to be sexy without getting objectified.”
Would tried juggling her side hustle with a full-time, “dead end” office job for a year. She decided to go freelance when she moved into a cheaper apartment. Now, Would is a one-woman erotica machine, writing, performing, editing, and managing clients all by herself.
“I don’t really think of the material as sexual anymore, because I do it so much,” she said. “One side effect of my job is that I don’t listen to audio porn anymore. When I listen to other people’s posts, I start to feel guilty—‘This person is posting once a week and I’m not posting at all.’ I also wonder, ‘How do they make that sound? How do they do that?’”
Another occupational hazard: “Apparently, [audio porn] has made me a lot chattier during sex,” Would admitted. That said, she tries to compartmentalize what goes on inside her studio with the real stuff. “I never feel like sex is work or masturbation is work. I do all of these recordings standing up, fully clothed, in a dark closet. And the amount of burps I have to edit out of these things—it’s incredible.”
Though Would likes to keep her personal life private for the sake of a fun mystery, she admitted there are some pratfalls when it comes to telling potential partners about her job. “ Sometimes a guy will get way too into it, want to listen and hear every detail. Like, dude, this is my day job. This isn't your porno ”
On first dates, she keeps things vague, saying she works in audio production. Once she does divulge, there is always the chance someone will be too excited.
“Sometimes a guy will get way too into it, want to listen and hear every detail,” Would groaned. “Like, dude, this is my day job. This isn’t your porno.”
Though Would is proud of her success and ability to make a living freelancing, she is constantly afraid of her family finding out what she does. “That is the most stressful thing about it. I’m sure I’ll come out eventually, and I’m not scared to tell them because they’re very loving, but it’s awkward. But I want to share my accomplishments with my family.”
One married, 45-year-old performer who requested total anonymity said that she manages motherhood with catering to the deepest desires of her 3,000 subscribers.
“I won’t speak to my children about it, but my husband supports it 100 percent,” the woman said. “I don’t see an end in sight. I’ll keep going as long as I’m having fun and can make the time to do it. It’s a good creative outlet for me.”
Gaelforce, a YouTuber with over 60,000 subscribers, lives and works in west Ireland. He asked The Daily Beast to use his performance name because he “likes to let the listener decide who Gael is.”
Like Would, Gaelforce began performing after feeling “fed up” with visual porn. “I found it too fantastical,” he wrote over email. “So I ran a search for ‘female moans’ on Google, and found a piece by an anonymous user. I was blown away. Without the visual, I was able to create my own scene, create the lady who was moaning [in my head].” “ I think people find lots of comfort in it. It frees you from the pitfalls of visual porn ”
Gaelforce’s voice has a cooing lull, and it does not hurt that he possesses an easy-to-fetishize Irish accent. His close-miked audios rarely register above a soft whisper. The plots feel made-for-Harlequin, with subjects ranging from a sensitive boyfriend “ pampering ” his menstruating girlfriend to one hour of “ rain and snuggle sounds .”
For his more PG-rated “ sleep with me ” audios, Gaelforce lies down and hits “record” while he slowly breathes in and out. The result is an hour-long performance of him in bed, a sort of white noise for lonely hearts who want to feel like they are going to bed alongside a lover. (Realistic snores, of course, are edited out.)
“I think people find lots of comfort in it,” Gaelforce said. “It frees you from the pitfalls of visual porn. You’re not looking at the body of the actors and comparing yourself. You’re not searching their expressions for sincerity, or bound by the environment, or wardrobe, or positions. A genuine moan is a powerful thing.” "
"Jaylon McKenzie, 8th Grade Football Phenom Featured in Sports Illustrated, Killed Outside St. Louis",www.thedailybeast.com,Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert),05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jaylon-mckenzie-8th-grade-football-phenom-featured-in-sports-illustrated-killed-outside-st-louis,"‘HE DREAMED SO BIG’ Jaylon McKenzie, 8th Grade Football Phenom Featured in Sports Illustrated, Killed Outside St. Louis The middle schooler had attended an eighth-grade dance before heading to an after-prom party with friends. 05.05.19 4:45 PM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photo Courtesy of the family
Jaylon McKenzie had a bright future. Last November, the eighth-grade football phenom was profiled in Sports Illustrated ’s “Six Teens Who Will Rule the Future in Sports.” Soon after, he’d reportedly received verbal scholarship offers from The University of Illinois and the University of Missouri. McKenzie had big dreams: to earn a college scholarship, to make the NFL, and to move to Los Angeles and play for the Chargers or the Rams.
But those dreams were cut short Saturday night, police say, when the 14-year-old was shot dead while attending a post-prom party in Illinois.
“It’s so hard to fathom that someone took my baby from me because he dreamed so big,” Sukeena Gunner, McKenzie’s mother, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Sunday. “I can just remember him coming into my room and telling my husband to call his name. ‘We have a 5-6 running back, Ja -lonnnn McKenzieeee.’ And he would run into the room after his name was called.”
Gunner told the Post-Dispatch that the Mason-Clark middle schooler had attended an eighth-grade dance earlier in the night, before heading out to the after-prom party in Venice, Illinois with his friends.
Police said that at about 11:40 p.m., officers responded to reports of shots fired on the 600 block of 3rd street. When police arrived on the scene, they found McKenzie and a 15-year-old girl had been shot. McKenzie died shortly after arriving at a hospital. The girl is reportedly still in critical condition.
Gunner told the Post-Dispatch that she found out her son had been shot when she heard one of his friends was trying to contact her. She called her son’s phone, and a friend picked up and told her the news. She says witnesses told her that McKenzie was struck by a stray bullet while he was trying to flee a fight.
The Illinois State Police did not respond to a request for comment. No arrests have yet been made in the case.
The East St. Louis School District 189 confirmed in a Sunday statement that a “few” students had been shot over the weekend. Although the details remained unclear, the school said, “We do know that our youth, families, and school staff have dealt with a number of tragedies and incidents of violence this year. We request space and time for them to appropriately grieve and come to terms with this latest impact of violence.”
A week before his death, McKenzie announced that he’d received a verbal scholarship offer from the University of Illinois; in December, he said he’d received one from the University of Missouri.
“Outside of basketball, outside of football, he was just a great kid,” Al Lewis, who coached McKenzie for the Southwest Illinois Jets basketball team, told KSDK News . “If he walked up here—he can’t walk up here now, but if you were to be with him, you wouldn’t have known. You wouldn’t have known that Sports Illustrated was covering him, you wouldn’t have known that he had two offers from Illinois in Missouri. Because he’s just the smiling kid, the jokester, the prankster, that everyone grew to love outside of the sports.”
“He was a superstar in life,” Lewis added, “and somebody great that we’re gonna miss dearly.”
In the Sports Illustrated profile , the running back, receiver, and defensive back was described as drawing “national attention” when he caught 5 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns during the NFL’s 8th Grade All-American Game in Canton, Ohio. He’d also rushed for 1,546 yards and 21 touchdowns for his local football team, the East St. Louis Jr. flyers.
When asked about his dreams for his future, McKenzie told Sports Illustrated that he wanted to follow in the footsteps of Adoree’ Jackson, a cornerback and return specialist for the Tennessee Titans who hails from the same St. Louis suburb. He dreamed of moving to L.A., and playing for the Chargers or the Rams.
“He wanted to walk across the stage to accept his contract in the NFL,” Gunner told the Post-Dispatch . “He told me, ‘We’re going to make it, mama, we’re going to be good, mama.’ That was his dream. And I believe it would have come true if someone had not taken my baby away from me.” READ THIS LIST"

At least 40 people were killed Sunday when a Russian plane made a fiery crash landing at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, according to Russian officials.
The Russian Aeroflot carrier plane had reportedly departed from Moscow, en route to the northern city of Murmansk. But video shows the plane quickly returning at about 7:30 p.m. local time, skidding across the Moscow runway with the back half engulfed in flames and billowing thick clouds of black smoke.
It’s not yet clear why the fire started. The Associated Press notes: some local reports say that the plane caught fire before turning back; others claim that the crash landing could have ignited the plane’s engines. The airport backs the latter claims, saying the hard emergency landing sparked the blaze and that the plane turned back due to other technical problems.
The plane was reportedly carrying 73 passengers and 5 crew members. Elena Markovskaya, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Investigative Committee, said early Monday local time that 41 of those people died, and 37 survived. But Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova later said that 38 people had survived, The Associated Press notes.
The Investigative Committee told The Associated Press that four other people were injured; the country’s Emergencies Ministry reported that six had been hospitalized.
Horrified passengers on nearby flights took to social media with harrowing photos and videos of engulfed plane.
Once the plane stopped on the tarmac, some passengers could be seen escaping on the plane’s inflatable yellow slides.

Scouted: Go on Vacation to Appreciate the World. Organize Your Suitcase Like You Appreciate Your Clothes.,www.thedailybeast.com,jillian.lucas@thedailybeast.com (Jillian Lucas),05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/packing-cubes-compression-pouches-and-more-ways-to-organize-a-suitcase,"Scouted By The Beast
As someone who only very recently fell in love with packing cubes , I have to say that it’s like night and day. Previously, I employed the roll and tuck method, keeping my clothes tightly bound in spiral packages. But that lead to unraveling and ultimately my suitcase was a heap of wrinkled clothing. Packing cubes nestle neatly into each other in the most satisfying way.
If you’re anything like me, you’ll need some help when it comes to turning your suitcase into the perfect Tetris board. Here are a handful of things to add to your packing routine so that you can keep your clothing and accessories in their places.
Stow-N-Go Portable Luggage System Suitcase Organizer , $30 on Amazon: Here’s a serious question: How many of us actually use the dressers in hotel rooms? This clever system kills two packing birds with one stone. It fits neatly into a carry-on and can expand to be hung in a closet, which means you can organize all of your things and easily access them without having to dig through a suitcase.
TRIPPED Travel Gear Compression Packing Cubes , $18 on Amazon: We can always use more space when we’re traveling and utilizing compression technology is a great way to do that. These cubes have a dual-zipper system, one that closes the bag to keep your belongings secure, and another that you can use to squeeze out the air and free up some extra space.
Hunter Toiletry Bag , $35 from Dagne Dover: This toiletry bag features a removable zippered interior pouch, an interior slip pocket, and elastic loops for razors, lip balms, fragrance and more. And because it’s made from waterproof and washable neoprene, any loose caps or rogue spritzes will be an easy cleanup.
Gonex Large Packing Cubes, Double-Sided , $21 on Amazon: Normal packing cubes are basically a necessity at this point, but if you want true organization, these double-sided ones will make sure you can keep your clean and dirty laundry separate. You can even use them to plan out an entire day’s outfit, so you don’t end up wrinkling all your clothing while trying to get dressed.
YAMIU Travel Shoe Bag , $10 on Amazon: You may think that shoes can stand on their own, but if you keep them tucked into a bag, they won’t stray from their designated space. This best-selling set of two will keep any kind of shoe, from an extra pair of sneakers to a spiked stiletto for a night out, neatly arranged in your bag.

In “The Last of the Starks,” the fourth episode (and third-to-last!) of Game of Thrones ’ eighth and final season, our heroes have gathered for a celebration to celebrate Arya Stark’s gravity-defying heroism in the Battle of Winterfell and toast the fallen.
Jaime, Tyrion, Pod and Brienne engage in a fun lil’ Westerosi spin on “Never Have I Ever,” with the newly minted knight confessing she’s a virgin, much to the interest of the Kingslayer. The Hound has a nice bonding moment with the equally cynical Sansa, the savviest person left standing . And life of the party Tormund Giantsbane’s traded in giant’s breast milk for ale, chugging it out of a Viking horn. He’s even managed to get a rise out of pussy-whipped Jon Snow who, despite his royal reservations, appears to relish others singing his praises.
The only person who doesn’t seem to be having a good ol’ time is Daenerys Targaryen, salty over all the adulation toward Jon (given his lineage/claim to the throne) and skeptical of Sansa’s maneuvering.
Perhaps it was because instead of partaking in the booze, the Mother of Dragons was instead sipping Starbucks coffee:
Yes, as you can plainly see, the makers of Game of Thrones left a Starbucks coffee cup in front of Dany during the Battle of Winterfell celebration—in multiple shots.
For one of the most meticulously crafted shows in TV history ( just ask George W. Bush ), it’s either an outrageous oversight or nice little Easter egg for eagle-eyed fans.
It’s anyone’s guess, really."

HBO At this point, we are all Ghost: disappointed, a little worse for wear, and wondering what the hell everyone is thinking. Melissa Leon 05.06.19 1:35 AM ET
“ See? You’re not the only one who’s clever,” Daenerys mutters to Tyrion at the start of an episode that shows how a baffling majority of Game of Thrones ’ heroes , and at points even the show’s creative brain trust, are anything but.
The world-shifting events of “The Last of the Starks” —the death of Daenerys’ dragon Rhaegal, the departures of beloved characters, the revelation of Jon’s parentage to his sisters, and the manipulation of that information—feel strangely limp in execution. That’s a consequence perhaps of the show’s whiplash-inducing pivot right back to the war over a chair, so soon after a conflict with much higher stakes and seven seasons of build-up fizzled out so anticlimactically with the Battle of Winterfell .
Nothing about where this episode ends is unfamiliar—we’ve watched Daenerys, seemingly the underdog, glare down powerful enemies and threaten to burn it all down so many times before. Watching her do it to Cersei might have packed an extra punch as the showdown the series has plotted for years. Instead, the scene’s dynamics seemed plucked from any number of near-identical interactions; little that’s come before seemed to weigh on it or affect either woman’s behavior.
The Cersei and Dany of this scene are essentially unchanged from the Cersei and Dany who met in the Dragonpit too many hours of screen time ago for such a lull in characterization. All that’s changed is one thing, and it has nothing to do with their personalities. It’s left to Varys to spell it out in one line several minutes earlier: In terms of military power, “the balance has grown distressingly even.” Sure, there’s one instance of bloodshed: one of the show’s more underdeveloped characters, Missandei, loses her head so that Cersei (and the show) can prove already-familiar points— the Lannister queen is a villain and Daenerys is angry. Little changes beyond that.
Politicking, scheming, and backstabbing was once what this show did best, with every interaction dense with potential for surprising implications down the road. Now, with only two hours and some-odd minutes left in the series, character logic has begun to unravel, with egregious mistakes and head-scratching denouements being made left and right with little consequence or justification beyond the plot prescribing weird lapses in judgment.
Nuance died in Westeros when the show ran out of George R.R. Martin’s source material to guide its path to the end. And sometimes that was fine. Episodes like “The Long Night” proved the show hasn’t lost its knack for hair-raising spectacle, and still boasts some of the strongest, most magnetic performances on TV.
Still, Game of Thrones once trained viewers to expect a path far less simplistic (and, so far, unsatisfying) than the one now seemingly laid out in front of us. There’s still time for a game-changing bombshell that might come close to feeling of a piece with a show built on the subversion of expectations. But at this point in its herky-jerky march to the end—speeding past certain milestones, dragging its feet across others—we are all Ghost: staring at our heroes in confusion, a little worse for wear, wondering what the hell everyone is thinking. ‘That’s Not Me’: A Memoir By Arya Stark
If there is one emotional throughline of the episode, it’s in characters like Arya and Jaime making decisions about what kind of people they will be in this new, post-White Walker world.
In Arya’s case, it’s not a tough question. Giddy from the high of being promoted to lord of Robert Baratheon’s ancestral home (Storm’s End), a lovestruck Gendry proposes to the Night King slayer —a sweet proposition he phrases in the worst way possible in light of, you know, everything about Arya. He asks her to be his “lady” and live her life at Storm’s End, like this isn’t the girl he first met in muddied boys’ clothing with a sword and a murderous vendetta. She lets him down easy: “That’s not me,” she says, echoing what she once told her dad about his own plans to marry her off, and recalling her last face-to-face with her direwolf Nymeria.
Instead, she hitches a ride south to King’s Landing with the Hound (a road trip I’d be eager to see, which is why I’m positive we’ll see none of it), since both have unfinished business there. The Hound is aiming for a death match with The Mountain . Arya, meanwhile, might mean to kill Cersei. Considering how expertly she rid us of the Night King and 100,000 undead soldiers, the show will have to come up with a foolproof reason for why Arya can’t just slip into the Red Keep and slit the Lannister queen’s throat—right? The Lannisters Are Going to Hell for Hurting Brienne’s Feelings
The firelit feast at which Dany anoints Gendry a new lord is its own microcosm of tensions, if only because it’s difficult not to expect some wild, bloody betrayal to spoil a Game of Thrones celebration like this. Nothing that disastrous unfolds—apart from the jarring sight of a Starbucks cup left in front of Daenerys ; seriously, who let this happen?—though Tyrion does commit a cardinal sin: he hurts Brienne’s feelings.
Tormund, Jaime, Tyrion, and Brienne play what amounts to a Game of Thrones trivia drinking game, quizzing each other on their backstories and preferences, in the warmest of the episode’s many small moments of connection at Winterfell. (Moments like this one in the first half of this episode recall what made “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” so fulfilling; it’s the second half that loses its way.) Tyrion gets too personal with Brienne, pressing her on her virginity and sending her away from the table in disgust.
Jaime follows her into her room and, in what at first seems like just icing on the cake of their most erotic moment so far (when he knighted Brienne), they finally do what we’ve all been rooting for since Season 3: they make out. While the rest of the North’s forces scatter and Daenerys brings the fight to King’s Landing, Jaime stays behind. It’s a short-lived, peaceful glimpse of the life he could have, if only he’d quit Cersei: nights spent with the woman who brings out the best in him and who deserves the world.
One of late-season Game of Thrones ’ weaknesses is how little we now hear and see of what goes on inside characters’ heads; they make decisions in one moment then reverse those decisions in the next, or they get caught in some unstoppable stream of plot in which they stop acting like people at all. With the show’s increasingly wobbly pacing, that means whiplash-inducing plots like Jaime committing to Brienne, Jaime hearing that Cersei has provoked all-out war, and Jaime then leaving Brienne brokenhearted, rejecting his own seasons-long redemption arc—all in the span of maybe 15 minutes. Imagine the emotional impact if we’d lived with that hope then had it dashed over several episodes.
About Brienne… The sight of the strongest, most principled warrior woman on the show reduced to tears over a man might strike some as regressive. But the particulars of this scene struck me a different way. Begging a loved one not to relapse into self-destructive behavior, trying and failing to convince them that they deserve better, that they can be loved, and that there’s a life for them beyond what they knew—and failing at it—does not make Brienne weak. It just makes her (and Jaime) human. (I’ll also say it’s not remotely unrealistic for an amazing, accomplished woman like Brienne to be let down by some dude she thought the world of!)
Brienne sobbing as Jaime rides off is a raw, crushing moment. But there’s enough history between these two, in my eyes, for Brienne to be seen as more than just a lover spurned. (That title goes to Tormund, actually.) The show can feel these days like it’s pulling its punches, but this was a bit of that brutal realism it was once known for.
Anyway, if a certain castles-and-riches-obsessed knight (hi, Bronn) assassinates either of the Lannister men after their crimes against Brienne, I can no longer say they didn’t have it coming. The Worst-Kept Secret in Westeros Gets Out
The people of the North seem to have no idea that Jon Snow spent the Battle of Winterfell swirling blindly on the back of a dragon, then yelling uselessly into the maw of a fire-breathing zombie. Instead, everyone back-pats him, shotguns mugs of ale with him, and treats him like the hero the show always has, however questionable his actual victories. It’s quite literally enough to drive a woman mad.
Dany is a ruler used to being treated like a savior, though she hasn’t received a fraction of that worship post-Night King. In a move she calculates will make her seem more likable and score her an ally in a Westeros stronghold, she gives Gendry Storm’s End—and looks disappointed when no one rushes to warm up to her. David Nutter, this episode’s director, does a stomach-churning(ly great) job of emphasizing Dany’s isolation at the Winterfell feast. She looks small and alone in the background as old friends clink cups all around her. We slip for a moment into her dazed perspective as she sees that, even now, Jon Snow is still these people’s chosen leader.
Emilia Clarke sells Dany’s desperation perfectly when she later corners him and commands him never to tell anyone about his Targaryen lineage. She knows the North would rather see him on the throne (in practice, he’s effectively undone his reputation as a great leader over the past two seasons, but no one here is living in reality anymore) and that this secret would enable them, despite however much Jon says he doesn’t want it, to install him as king after Cersei’s out of the way. All he has to do not to ruin her life is keep quiet.
But Jon, like Ned before him, keeps secrets about as well as he devises battle strategies—that is, he’s awful at it. Bound by a sense of obligation to his family, he lets Sansa and Arya in on the secret after they pinky-swear not to tell. Within minutes, Sansa tells. Why wouldn’t she? She’s one of many who mistrust Daenerys’s quest for more power—and she knows that by telling Tyrion, Varys will know soon, too. That works to her advantage. She really is the savviest person in Westeros . Is Tyrion OK?
The show has sidelined Tyrion and Varys for so long that it’s nice to see these two former master manipulators sharing a meaty scene again. It’d have been better if both of them seemed in their right minds.
Varys has always served his notion of “the realm”—the common folk of Westeros, with backgrounds like his own, who deserve a ruler who puts their interests first. Tyrion, however, is acting...oddly. He brushes off Varys’s concern about Dany’s “state of mind,” along with the suggestion that because Jon Snow doesn’t want the throne, he’s the best choice of ruler. It’s either him or the queen the show is painting as increasingly unbalanced, unhappy, inflexible, and desperate—we’re supposed to make the leap to potentially “mad” from there—yet he chooses his queen.
The show’s tiresome insistence on painting women in power as depraved, lonely maniacs aside, Tyrion works overtime to blind himself to the obvious here, in ways that make sense and in others that don’t. He floats the idea of Jon and Dany marrying and ruling together. When faced with the sticky little matter of incest, he hand-waves Varys’s concern away and insists Dany will make “the right choice,” so long as her advisers are by her side. Varys isn’t buying it, though, and seemingly jumps ship. What he’s plotting will be a welcome twist, I hope, and set up a compelling Jon vs. Dany last leg of the show.
Tyrion, on the other hand, is losing his edge. He may or may not be in love with Daenerys , but even if he were, it barely excuses how adamant he is about seeing her rule. It also doesn’t justify his gonzo appeal to Cersei for mercy, as if he doesn’t know better. He’s this episode’s best example of people acting wildly out of character. Who is this and where is the real Tyrion? I Can’t Believe Euron Greyjoy Is Still on This Show
If you bet at the start of this season that Euron Greyjoy would accomplish what a thousands-year-old supernatural force couldn’t and take down Rhaegal the dragon, congrats! You’re the only winner here.
Euron’s sneak-attack on Dany’s army as they sail from White Harbor back to Dragonstone comes straight out of nowhere—who told? Was it Varys? Bronn?—yet registers with little in the way of shock or emotion. A wrinkle of the nose, maybe. A mild sense of confusion over why this obnoxious, oily latecomer to the game is getting so much screen time, definitely. But no one is afraid of Euron Greyjoy. He’s nowhere close to a compelling villain. Why is he still here? (More, how could Daenerys not spot those ships from so high up?)
The show has gone from regarding him the way Cersei does, as a necessary inconvenience, to installing him as a major player, however unconvincing the execution. He’s more plot device than human, to the point that I’m skeptical the show will even let him deduce the obvious: if Cersei is really pregnant with his child, how would Tyrion already know about it?
She’s not, of course. Cersei guzzling down wine in the Season 8 premiere cast doubt on whether she’s still pregnant with Jaime’s child, or if she ever was. (There’s that whole matter of Maggy the Witch’s prophecy , though who knows whether the show’s thrown all its prophecies out the window right now.) Giving her Euron Greyjoy’s sweat-baby would be a step too far. Cersei’s plotting something, anything, I hope, to make the wars over the Iron Throne interesting again."
Volterra: The Haunting Origins of Tuscany’s Iconic Hill Town,www.thedailybeast.com,,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/volterra-the-haunting-origins-of-tuscanys-iconic-hill-town,"A REAL WITCH HUNT Volterra: The Haunting Origins of Tuscany’s Iconic Hill Town Volterra may be best known for its beauty and as the fictional place where the Volturi live in the ‘Twilight’ series, but it was also the location of Italy’s version of Salem. 05.06.19 5:07 AM ET DEA/M. Borchi/Getty
VOLTERRA–Nearly four centuries before the Salem Witch trials saw more than 200 women accused of sorcery in America, the witch , as described in Greek and Roman mythology, Aradia, was born a mortal on August 13, 1313, in the cliff-top town of Volterra in the heart of what is now Tuscany. She was sent to Earth by her mother Diana, the goddess of wild animals and wilderness, and was fathered by Lucifer, and her spirit is very much alive today.
Around the time she reached adolescence, strange things started to happen in the village. The constant smell of sulfur permeated the air, and steam would rise from fissures in the alabaster cliffs on which the town was built. Rock formations and caves that had been previously unknown revealed themselves, and in one, called the Rock of Mandringa, a fresh water spring suddenly gurgled to life. By day, this spring provided water for the villagers to wash their clothes and carry up to the town. But every Saturday at midnight, as the Christians were readying to celebrate the sabbath, the rock was where Aradia taught the witches her craft.
In these ancient times, seismic activity was common, but accurate record keeping was not, and if logic were to prevail over legend, all that was happening could easily be attributed to tectonic plate activity below the surface. But it was much easier to blame Aradia for practicing sorcery and witchcraft, and for creating the fissures from which the thermal gases and sulfur-laced waters emerged.
The Catholic church soon intervened and sent the witch Aradia into exile in one of the caves below the village, where her calls and cries can apparently still be heard today when the wind is just right. As legend has it, Aradia’s witches spread across Europe.
One such witch was Elena of the nearby village of Travale, where the hillsides belched thick plumes of sulfur gases caused, most likely, by seismic activity, but blamed almost entirely on Elena’s witchy powers. So strong was her eerie essence—and so afraid were the villagers—that she was eventually tried for heresy and practicing witchcraft, along with hundreds of other women thought to be operating in her evil orbit.
The devices used for their torture, which include spike-lined closable sarcophagus cages and stretching frames, are located in the nearby medieval torture museum of San Gimignano.
Witches, of course, are the stuff of legend, and visiting Volterra is not complete without a hike near the witches’ caves below the city. There are hundreds of miles of trails that pass by the very steaming fissures that were attributed to witchcraft half a millennium ago. Take the one past the Rock of Mandringa and see if you can still hear the witches’ screams.
Not surprisingly, the geothermal activity has led to the creation of a number of posh resort spas. But take the lead from the Italians, who often indulge in roadside wonders. Maps that show the most active—and seasonally safe—springs are available in the central tourist office in Volterra’s main square. Sure, it means you may have to change in the car, but there is nothing more amazing than having a thermal spring all to yourself.
Of course, witches and thermal springs aren’t all that this iconic hill town has to offer. The city is known for the alabaster cliffs on which it is built and it is no surprise that the town is teeming with alabaster workshops and little shops selling handicrafts that range from cheap trinkets to exquisite designs that can cost hundreds—or more. The town’s two main museums are also filled with ancient sculptures carved from the stones.
Volterra was built on the foundations of an Etruscan village that was destroyed in a massive earthquake in the 12th century. Remnants of the fortification walls that date back to the 5th century B.C. are still visible, as are the ancient gates of the city. The Porta dell’Arco was the main gate to the city and the Porta Diana is named after the goddess who sent the first witch to the mortal world. The eerie legend of the witches of Volterra is one that most visitors take with a grain of salt—which, incidentally, is what locals toss over their shoulder whenever they feel they may have been inadvertently cursed. But, believer or not, there is no way to escape the myth and the folklore that envelopes this unique Tuscan village, especially when you feel a gust of wind, or catch a whiff of sulfur."

Going 10 Rounds With Top Bartender Jesse Held,www.thedailybeast.com,noah.rothbaum@thedailybeast.com (Noah Rothbaum),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/going-10-rounds-with-jesse-held-who-helped-launch-new-minneapolis-restaurant-ps-steak,"Going 10 Rounds With Top Bartender Jesse Held Jacqueline Byers/Courtesy of Jester Concepts Talented Minneapolis bartender Jesse Held tackles our speed round of questions. Noah Rothbaum 05.06.19 5:12 AM ET
W hat do you like to drink after a shift? “Honestly, a glass of (still) rose has always been a calming way to end a hectic night. For some reason, a crisp glass of wine silences the ringing in the ears and reduces the body buzz of an electric night of service.”
What is the all-time best dive bar jukebox song? “So tough to answer, but it has to be the best sing-a-long ever that all generations can connect with. My answer has to be “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen. That song brings out everyone’s rock star alter ego.”
After all these years bartending and creating drinks, do you still enjoy going out to bars? “It’s a different experience now than it was years ago when I would go out to a bar. I really do enjoy getting out every once in a while to see what new things the next generation of bartenders is coming up with. At this stage of my career/life, going out to a bar is less about drinking, and more about the complete experience.”
Name the first good drink you ever drank and where you had it. “The first ‘real’ cocktail I had and vividly remember being served was a Sazerac , in a white wine glass, at Town Talk Diner by Adam Harness. It completely changed the way I looked at cocktails and what cocktails should be. It also set the wheels in motion for me to really grab ahold and deeply learn classic cocktail foundations.”
What book on cocktails or spirits is your go-to resource? “There are so many great books out there, but as of today, I’d say my ‘go to’ book is the Death & Co. series ( Death & Co: Modern Classic Cocktails and Cocktail Codex: Fundamentals, Formulas, Evolutions ). It’s a great source to bring me back to center and gives me a great refresher to then teach other younger bartenders about the craft.”
What’s your favorite cocktail and food pairing? “Easy answer for me…a classic Martini (2 parts Tanqueray 10 Gin, 1 part Dolin Dry Vermouth, 2 dashes Regans’ Orange Bitters) and fried chicken wings. No idea why or how that happens, but a Martini for me is the pinnacle of cocktails. It’s what every cocktail wants to become and can pretty much go with any food…it just so happens it’s really good with a fried chicken wing! Who knew?”
What drink are you most proud of creating? “Hands down it’s the Parlour Old Fashioned. It might seem like a really elementary cocktail to be proud of, but the combinations of bourbon, rye, sugar, and bitters that I came up with took me a year to perfect. And now, because I took the time to really perfect that cocktail, our bar sells more than 35,000 of them per year and it now has a life of its own within the local cocktail community.”
Is there one person (dead or alive) you’d like to make a cocktail for? “Great question! Marilyn Monroe. I’d love to be her bartender for the night. Her journey and life has always fascinated me.”
What’s your favorite shot-and-a-beer combination? “Maker’s Mark Bourbon and Miller High Life. Go on, it’s OK to judge me. I’m very comfortable in my own skin after this many years.”
What is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you’re traveling for business? “I guess, at this stage of my career, I feel like I could bartend behind any bar with any kind of tools (or lack thereof). I could adapt cocktails based on the bar environment I found myself in. So, my answer isn’t necessarily a tool but is still important: Swim trunks. You never know if there will be an opportunity to soak in a hot tub, take a dip in the ocean or pool, or get stranded somewhere unexpected. It’s always good traveling practice to be prepared for relaxing.”

HBO’s ‘Chernobyl’ Exposes the Horrifying Scope of Soviet Deception,www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hbos-chernobyl-exposes-the-horrifying-scope-of-soviet-deception,"FALLOUT HBO’s ‘Chernobyl’ Exposes the Horrifying Scope of Soviet Deception The new five-part miniseries, premiering May 6, examines the Chernobyl nuclear disaster—and the brave people who sacrificed their lives to reveal the shocking truth. 05.06.19 5:12 AM ET HBO
The Chernobyl nuclear disaster was the screw-up to end all screw-ups, playing a part in more than 93,000 deaths and turning the northern Ukrainian region uninhabitable. Yet as HBO’s Chernobyl reveals, even more deadly than the radiation released by the accident were the lies that caused it in the first place—and, afterwards, stymied efforts to contain and combat it.
Director Johan Renck and writer Craig Mazin’s five-part miniseries—a coproduction with Sky, debuting on May 6—is a dramatized look at the catastrophe and its equally harrowing fallout. “What is the cost of lies?” intones nuclear physicist Valery Legasov (Jared Harris) in a 1988-set introduction. “If we hear enough lies, then we can no longer recognize the truth at all. What can we do then?” It’s a question he’ll answer at story’s conclusion, but not now, because after completing his confessional audio recordings in his drab kitchen and hiding his collection of tape cassettes in a nearby alley, Legasov returns home, feeds his cat, enjoys a few last puffs of his cigarette, and hangs himself.
No matter that a KGB chief climactically argues that this tale has no villains, there’s plenty of blame to go around, and following its prologue, Chernobyl —whose raft of British-accented Russians take a bit of getting used to—cuts straight to April 26, 1986, and the cataclysm itself. In the control room of nuclear reactor number four, Anatoly Dyatlov (Paul Ritter) roundly criticizes underlings as morons while wholly refusing to believe that anything serious has occurred. Rather than grapple with the facts at hand, he assumes the facility’s alarms and alarming console readouts are signs of a minor issue—and certainly nothing as grave as a nuclear core explosion, which he, and many men and women who subsequently appear, deems impossible.
There was no apparent reason for the core’s detonation, especially since those at the reactor’s helm hit the manual shut-down button. Still, Dyatlov’s unwillingness to see things as they are turns out to be a mistake with horrifying consequences. Men are sent into radioactive areas to investigate and handle the situation, returning with corrosive burns—if they return at all. Firefighters, including Vasily (Adam Nagaitis), who bids farewell to wife Lyudmilla (Jessie Buckley) in the wee hours of the morning, are sent to the scene to quell the raging fire, where they come into contact with toxic elements. And locals in nearby Pripyat gather on a railway bridge to watch the column of light shooting upwards from the site, as flakes of radioactive debris fall around them like snow. That overpass would, in later years, come to be known as “The Bridge of Death,” because all who visited it during that fateful period would perish.
As Chernobyl recounts, Anatoly wasn’t the only one who turned a willfully blind eye to reality. Chernobyl bigwigs gather in a bunker to comfort themselves with Anatoly’s heartening reports, clinging to this misinformation rather than reacting accordingly. In that conference, an elder statesman goes so far as to proudly, and excitedly, proclaim: “We will all be rewarded for what we do here tonight. This is our moment to shine.” There’s a chilling pun buried in that comment, which is quickly proven to be literally false thanks to the outspoken analysis of Legasov (Harris), a dismayed professor who’s summoned by lifelong Party member Boris Shcherbina (a white-haired Stellan Skarsgård) to a committee meeting headed by Mikhail Gorbachev (David Dencik).
Legasov and Shcherbina’s rapport forms the crux of Chernobyl ’s early installments, as the former delivers warnings that Shcherbina—like his all-news- must -be-good-news Party brethren—is averse to hear. That changes once both visit Chernobyl itself, where the building rooftops are littered with lethal graphite (which could have only come from the core), radiation levels are shockingly high, and men are emerging from the wreckage resembling charred corpses. Chernobyl infuses this material with funereal terror, drenching its drama in blacks and grays, and employing slow-motion images of soil, water and air to suggest that nature itself has been poisoned (much of it set to ominous repetitive tones). The show casts the incident as akin to the apocalypse, and those populating the immediate and surrounding areas—whether exhibiting radiation-sickness symptoms or not—as the walking dead.
Harris’s rational scientist and Skarsgard’s rigid Soviet official prove to be initially dissimilar, but Chernobyl superbly elucidates their dawning understanding that some actualities—including their own cancer-riddled future—are indisputable, and thus must be faced. The esteemed actors bring nuanced, complicated baggage to their protagonists, who are navigating a bureaucracy uninterested in failure, and so too does Emily Watson as Ulana Khomyuk, a nuclear authority (and composite character) who aids Harris in his quest to contain the Chernobyl tragedy as well as deduce its underlying cause. Together, the show’s headliners lend the action gravity and humanity, and they’re aided in their work by Jessie Buckley as Vasily’s distraught spouse, and Barry Keoghan as one of the 600,000 conscripts sent to clean up the Chernobyl “Exclusion Zone,” which in his case involves murderous animal-control duty.
Chernobyl often plays as a real-time nightmare, detailing the logistics of the meltdown—including the deployment of miners (who toil in the nude, due to the heat) to bolster the plant’s concrete foundation. At the same time, via Legasov’s explanations to Shcherbina, it delivers a lucid primer on nuclear fission and reactor operation. That balance remains assured throughout, although its focus soon becomes not just the specific measures devised to prevent further mind-boggling ruin (at one point, Gorbachev is informed that Ukraine and Belarus, home to 60 million, is in danger of becoming a century-long hot zone), but the arduous struggle to ensure that the underlying failures responsible for this event are acknowledged and fixed.
By its finale, Chernobyl has transformed from a story about plant-operator faults to one about systematic deception on the part of the stubborn, arrogant, blind and foolish Soviets, whose communist culture—demanding absolute loyalty to the Party, which is always perfect and infallible, even when facts say otherwise—compelled everyone to cover up the truth lest they be vilified as nation-besmirching traitors. It’s that environment which Renck and Mazin’s haunting miniseries damns as the ultimate culprit for Chernobyl, which averted a worse tragedy only thanks to a precious few, like Legasov and Shcherbina, who embraced the truth—no matter how ugly—and then heroically sacrificed themselves for the greater good.

Can A.I. Help Stop Bee Extinction?,www.thedailybeast.com,Neel V. Patel,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/can-ai-help-stop-bee-extinction,"Can A.I. Help Stop Bee Extinction? Colony collapse disorder has been a mystery. But artificial intelligence might just stop bees disappearing. 05.06.19 5:07 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty
Jerry Bromenshenk has been at the forefront of the bee colony collapse. He’s seen harrowing scenes, some that he will never forget.
“I have seen stockpile yards of 10,000 colonies, ready to go into almonds in California, lose anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of the colonies in less than two weeks,” the bee expert from the University of Montana in Missoula said. “It was like a wave running through the yard, from one end to the other. In all cases, the bees just disappear from the hives.”
But Bromenshenk believes there’s a solution that might finally give apiarists a reprieve and end the horror once and for all: artificial intelligence. New A.I. tools might finally give apiarists a chance to get to the bottom of what’s ailing beehives around the world—and more importantly, give them a chance to proactively mitigate, and prevent entire colonies from disappearing almost overnight.
Bees might seem like a buzzing nuisance, but they’re a vital part of life on this planet. One-third of every mouthful of food is tied to successful pollination, much of which is carried out by pollinators like bees.
But this precious pollination cycle is in danger. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) was formally identified in a 2006 report detailing the sudden and unexcited loss of bees. CCD strikes when seemingly thriving bee colonies with plenty of food stores and artificial hive frames on farms with eggs, larvae, and pupae empty themselves of adult bees with a matter of days, leaving behind—at best—a queen and a handful of bees in the hive, with no evidence of dead and dying bees on the bottom boards or in front of the hives.
The list of possible culprits varies: microbial and viral diseases; invasive pests; environmental stressors brought on by climate change; poor nutrition and the toxic effects of pesticides; and modern crop hybrids that are unattractive or too low in nectar, among others. Some of these factors are thought to interact and exacerbate CCD.
“To date, we still do not fully understand CCD,” Bromenshenk told The Daily Beast.
So Bromenshenk paired up with a friend, Robert Seccomb, to develop an A.I.-powered app called Bee Health Guru that could study bee colonies, keep beekeepers apprised of hive health, and identify the sorts of nuanced factors that portend a collapse event—giving beekeepers a chance to remedy the situation and save their hives.
“A human can do everything that our A.I. system can do; however, it would take an exceptional human,” Seccomb told The Daily Beast. “Machine learning excels in tirelessly processing large amounts of complex data in a short time.
“In tackling the CCD problem, we cannot expect A.I. to be the magic bullet for a solution,” Seccomb said. “However, it may find those patterns we humans could miss, especially when faced with large data sets and complex sets of variables. A.I. is supremely qualified for this flood of data in ways humans have a hard time keeping up.”
One of those complex reservoirs of data is in the sound a swarm makes—and it’s the core application behind Bee Health Guru, which formally launched on May 1. Bromenshenk and Seccomb have taught the app’s A.I. how to track the sound waves and anticipate future changes to the swarm, days or even weeks before that behavior actually manifests. In tracking those changes with other variables, a beekeeper might suddenly have a sense of how to plan for those swarm changes ahead of time, or outright nip those changes in the bud, and stabilize the beehive. These changes could be as big as the sudden loss of a queen, or as subtle as a bacterial infection that’s slowly spreading through the hive.
To that end, A.I. is not just a faster alert system—it’s also predictive of what might happen without intervention.
Other groups are also looking into measuring sound, as well as collecting data on other metrics that can reveal changes to hive health, including brood temperatures, ambient temperatures, hive weight, humidity, and swarm behaviors.
One of these groups is headed by multinational tech company Oracle. The company has collaborated with the World Bee Project and the University of Reading in the U.K. to produce an apiary monitoring system comprising six smart sensors that collect a slew of different data, including feet and wing movement in worker bees, the weight of the hive’s honey, humidity, ambient temperatures, local weather and pollution levels, and—like Bee Health Guru—swarm sound. Oracle deployed these systems last fall, in hives across the U.K., Australia, and Israel.
Bee Health Guru can provide personalized data to individual beekeepers, but A.I. also opens up avenues in sharing and scaling data in order to highlight local, regional or global trends that could lead to CCD—and this is where Oracle and the World Bee Project really hope to make an impact.
John Abel, Oracle’s vice president for cloud and innovation in the U.K., Ireland and Israel, is bullish on the way these programs, when connected, can collect different layers of data and pinpoint patterns of beehive health that emerge. The A.I. isn’t just effective in highlighting small changes in, say, swarm sound—it can go the distance in showing how changes in swarm sound at one end of a continent may be a harbinger of hive problems at the other. It could use data from Portugal to explain what’s happening in Sweden.
“The great thing about the bees is that they give you an indication of how good you make a sustainable landscape,” Abel said. “It gives you a good insight into how good your ecosystem is.”
It’s really just a matter of making these tools more readily available to apiarists around the world. Oracle is working to launch more of its systems around the world. Bee Health Guru formally launched on May 1, along with a Kickstarter campaign aimed at helping the company scale up.
And there are many other players in this space looking to make an impact. While the footprint of these tools is small in comparison to the world’s 80 million hives, it’s growing. It has to—our way of life depends on it. READ THIS LIST"
Joe Biden Has to Do More Than Name-Drop Obama to Win Black Voters,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-has-to-do-more-than-name-drop-obama-to-win-black-voters-due-to-his-past-criminal-justice-record,"JUSTICE Joe Biden Has to Do More Than Name-Drop Obama to Win Black Voters A quarter-century after the passage of a landmark crime bill Biden championed, criminal justice advocates are calling on him to undo that legacy to win their support. 05.06.19 5:06 AM ET Sean Rayford/Getty
Former Vice President Joe Biden’s initial pitch to Democratic voters was aimed squarely at the Rust Belt working class, but on a weekend trip through South Carolina, the early frontrunner for the party’s presidential nomination pivoted to courting black voters in the Palmetto State, highlighting his role in the Obama administration and warning of voting restrictions that hark back to the days of Jim Crow.
“Last year, 24 states introduced or enacted at least 70 bills to curtail the right the vote. And guess what—mostly directed at people of color,” Biden told the crowd at a community center in Columbia, South Carolina on Saturday. “We have Jim Crow sneaking back in.”
“You know when everybody has an equal right to vote, guess what—they lose. They lose,” Biden continued, referring to Republicans, whose victories in statewide elections in nearby Georgia and Florida last year sparked accusations of systematic voter suppression . “Folks, it’s just absolutely wrong.”
By highlighting the importance of expanding voter access, as well as his long relationship with President Barack Obama—in his speech, Biden referred to Obama as “my buddy” and “my friend” multiple times before joking that “I shouldn’t be so casual”—Biden pitched himself as a candidate with a broader coalition of supporters beyond the white working class. But the former vice president’s history as an architect of the modern criminal justice system has activists and academics concerned that Biden hasn’t sufficiently addressed the legacy of mass incarceration in marginalized communities.
Biden, who served in the U.S. Senate for three decades, was a driving force behind the implementation of aggressive criminal justice policies in the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in the writing and passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 , which he himself dubbed the “1994 Biden Crime Bill” in 2015.
Now, 25 years after the passage of this landmark bill, criminal justice advocates say the policy led to mass incarceration that disproportionately affected black communities and are calling on him to undo that legacy in order to win their support.
“He’s in a precarious situation,” said Dr. Keneshia Grant, a professor of political science at Howard University whose research focus is the political impact of black migration in the United States. “He absolutely has to be saying things like, ‘people’s attempts to disenfranchise you is like Jim Crow,’ but that creates a difficult situation for him.”
“The ’94 crime bill helped shape crime policy for almost the next 20 years,” said Nicole D. Porter, director of advocacy at the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based nonprofit that seeks to address racial disparities in the criminal justice system. “It was adopted at a time when the approach to crime was very punitive—there was little resistance to adopting tougher penalties at the federal and at the state level, particularly in communities that were undergoing disinvestment.”
The legislation, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, was the largest crime bill in American history, and included a (since expired) ban on assault weapons, the Violence Against Women Act, and created guidelines for states to track sex offenders. But the bill included controversial provisions, including a so-called “three strikes” provision, the elimination of Pell Grants for incarcerated inmates, and provided nearly $10 billion for the construction of new prisons. The bill also increased incentives for states to sentence criminals to longer sentences, leading to an era of mass incarceration: More than 2 million Americans are currently imprisoned.
“It’s not that he was swept up on the tough on crime—he drove the train. He was chair of the Judiciary Committee, he wrote a lot of these bills,” Michael Collins, director of national affairs for Drug Policy Action, told The Daily Beast. “The ‘War on Drugs’ has always been a war on people of color—we knew that back in the 1990s, and it didn’t stop Joe Biden then, and this is why we have this mass incarceration mess right now.”
Biden’s legacy on criminal justice may complicate efforts to capitalize on high initial approval ratings among black voters, who make up more than half of registered Democrats in South Carolina.
“He’s going to have to run a very issue-oriented campaign if he’s going to win black voters in South Carolina. He can’t just show up and say, I was Barack Obama’s vice president, because that ain’t going to work,” former South Carolina state legislator Bakari Sellers, who has endorsed Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for president, told The Daily Beast.
“I find it ironic that Hillary [Clinton] got pure hell for the ’94 crime bill when Joe Biden actually wrote the ’94 crime bill,” Sellers said. “He’s going to have to answer those questions, and he’s going to have to answer with policy points… He has to reconcile with his record, and he’s not answering those questions now.”
Advocates were quick to point out that as the Democratic consensus on criminal justice has changed, so too have Biden’s views—to a point.
“Biden has followed the politics on this issue,” Porter said. “As vice president in 2010, he anchored a reform... to scale back the 100-to-one crack cocaine-to powder disparity.”
The former vice president has indicated that there are certain positions he has taken on crime that he now disavows. At the National Action Network’s Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in January, Biden said that on criminal justice reform, “I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I’ve always tried,” alluding to the crime bill as “a big mistake when it was made.”
But undoing the legacy of “tough-on-crime” legislation, criminal justice reform advocates said, requires more than an apology.
“A stopped clock can be right twice a day, but when you look at the totality of Biden’s career, he has been one of the top cheerleaders in the War on Drugs,” Collins said. “The only reason we’re seeing any contrition here is because he’s running for president—if he was retired, we wouldn’t be seeing apologies or any of these explanations.”
If Biden is serious about mitigating his role in the modern carceral state, Sellers said, he’ll begin detailing concrete policy proposals to “unravel some of the damage that he’s done.”
“Moving forward, when he does talk about criminal justice, he’s going to have to talk about it in ways that are first, apologetic, and two, super clear about policy proposals to mitigate the effects of his past positions,” Grant echoed.
To “account for the harm done in this country during the era of mass incarceration,” Porter suggested the elimination of mandatory minimums across the board, redirecting resources to focus on crime prevention and helping people who exit the prison system successfully enter into society, and full sentencing parity in drug possession cases—as well as provisions making such changes retroactive.
“It would take 75 years for the country to get back to the incarceration rates of the early ’80s” at current rates of release, Porter said, which means that undoing mass incarceration requires policies “as substantial and muscular as the politics that drove the punitive reforms in the ’80s and ’90s.”
The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the former vice president’s views on such proposals by press time.
There is historical precedent for a president undoing the damage caused by previous positions and policies, Grant said, citing the case of President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act into law.
“Lyndon Johnson starts out as a legislator who is not particularly helpful in the civil rights movement,” Grant noted. “Now when you think about him and think about his evolution on race, you can point to the Civil Rights Act to say, this is something he did to make up for his past or change his trajectory.” "

T he bullet hole is still in the ceiling of William Burroughs’ bathroom, and his Datsun is still rusting in the bushes outside his home in Lawrence, Kansas, John Cameron Mitchell said. Burroughs’ bed still stands in his small bedroom. “It’s a tiny Midwestern house, barely holding itself together, and it’s adorable,” said Mitchell.
Mitchell and composer Bryan Weller spent two weeks working on their musically influenced podcast drama, Anthem: Homunculus , at Burroughs’ home, welcomed by James Grauerholz, Burroughs’ bibliographer and literary executor.
“Burroughs’ spirit hovers over our piece,” Mitchell said. “It’s a cautionary spirit also entwined with mortality and apocalypse. His wry, paranoid, hysterical voice suffuses everything.”
In its 10 episodes and 31 songs, Anthem: Homunculus —produced by Topic and released on Luminary—focuses on a man called Ceann, who has a tumor and who launches a public appeal for funds for treatment. The story expands into a complex, strange, beautifully realized portrait of a life.
In all he does, Mitchell said, “I like to throw a bomb or two, but they’re love bombs, not smash-ups. They’re more like flares than explosives.”
An actor, playwright, screenwriter, and director, the Tony Award-winning Mitchell is most famous as co-creator of Hedwig and the Angry Inch , which began life as an Obie-winning off-Broadway show (with music and lyrics by Stephen Trask), before becoming a 2001 movie (written, directed by and starring Mitchell), which won Mitchell the Best Director award at that year’s Sundance Film Festival, as well as a raft of other awards and a Golden Globe nomination.
Mitchell also directed the 2006 movie Shortbus , which showed explicit sex; has collaborated on projects spanning music, theater, and film; has starred in TV shows including Girls ; and presently plays Aidy Bryant ’s villainous boss in the comedy Shrill .
Mitchell is also reminding audiences of Hedwig right now. He is currently mid-tour performing The Origin of Love: The Songs and Stories of Hedwig , which will come to New York City’s Town Hall over the Stonewall Riots 50th anniversary weekend next month. Later, Mitchell will discuss his father revealing his closeted bisexuality to him, and why he feels LGBT people are turning on each other like “rats in a cage” in the Trump era.
“I’m really enjoying the Origin tour,” Mitchell said in his gentle, lilting voice when we met one recent afternoon at Topic’s offices. “I tell stories and also get crazy. I love to continue to tell stories. I’m not that interested in being Hedwig again. I just love words and passing them on.”
In Anthem , Ceann lives in a trailer in Junction City, Kansas, that once belonged to Hedwig. Mitchell himself once lived in the town. Around Ceann unspools a complex and painful portrait of family and personal times past.
Anthem sounds beautiful, an immersive bewitching soundscape, and features such stars as Glenn Close , Patti LuPone, Cynthia Erivo, Denis O’Hare, Laurie Anderson , and Marion Cotillard. Bridget Everett plays “an amalgam of two cool crypto-lesbian teachers who taught me about [Harold] Pinter and psychology.”
Mitchell set Anthem in Junction City, about 40 miles from Burroughs’ home, “the most interesting thing for hundreds of miles.” He appreciates Midwestern directness, “sly intelligence,” economy of speech, and dry humor, especially as they all remind him of his Scottish relatives (his mother is originally from Glasgow).
“Ceann is me if I never left that small town,” said Mitchell. “My dad was in the army (he was a major general). We moved to 15 or so places. But Junction City was interesting because it was more diverse, it had a high crime rate because of the servicemen. I pubesced at its Catholic school. And it’s where my brother Samuel died, and I discovered I was gay. I keep coming back to it.
“This is the autobiography of me that never was, the alternate me. If I stayed there I would probably still be creative but not share it. I’d be working at a library or as a teacher, slipping some liberal things into lessons, then getting fired.”
There are a lot of people like Ceann in small towns, Mitchell said. “They don’t have a recourse to leave, they are beaten down by guilt and failure. They have frailties.”
Ceann’s parents are based on Mitchell’s. His mother had emigrated from Scotland as a teacher, and met Mitchell’s father at an officers’ club in Colorado. “They were fun people, dancing, good-time folks. They loved each other a lot.” (His father had Alzheimer’s and died five years ago; his mother now has Alzheimer’s.)
As a young boy, Mitchell attended a boarding school in North Berwick, Scotland, “which was quite a miserable experience. British kids are meaner than any. My sense of humor comes from Britain, but less cutting.” Humor, because of his power to disarm, is the healthiest dramatic form, Mitchell thinks.
Mitchell first imagined Anthem as a sequel to Hedwig . “She’s probably a non-binary professor in a small Midwest college teaching German philosophy and rock and roll, and she’s fine.” The sequel began with Hedwig dealing with a health crisis. “But there was not much conflict,” said Mitchell, laughing. “ When my boyfriend died I thought I was responsible too. He was an addict. That death really was the impetus for this whole piece. ”
Ceann has a brain tumor, said Mitchell, because “we’re all going to have one. My mom is dealing with diseases of the brain.” Referring to Susan Sontag’s 1978 book, Illness as Metaphor , he sees Ceann’s tumor as an undeveloped version of himself that is killing him. Also, “In his fucked up Catholic mind, he is dying for his sins”—something Mitchell can identify with, not just because of the death of Samuel.
“When my boyfriend died I thought I was responsible too,” said Mitchell. Jack Steeb, a musician with Trask’s band, died in 2004. “He was an addict. That death really was the impetus for this whole piece.”
“Growing up with loss my whole life and then losing my boyfriend to addiction, and the metastasizing guilt and grief in Anthem ’s case becomes cancerous flesh,” he said. Eventually, in Anthem , the tumor itself sings.
“I really believe this piece helped me a lot with this guilt,” he said. “Art has always been a comfort and catharsis for me. I hope I’ll be able to think of a new chapter in my life after this.”
Ceann's father in Anthem hits his son at one point. I asked Mitchell if his father was violent.
“There was a darkness within him. I think it came from self-hatred of his queer side. In Anthem , his son kisses him on the lips. Something happens. My dad did hit us. It was only one time, but I can’t forget it. My dad beat himself up, and all those tensions exploded. “ When I came out, my dad let me know he was actually bisexual and before he met my mom he’d been with guys, and then he did what he termed ‘the right thing.’ He did love my mom, but in his time and place there was no place to be gay. ”
“The time he hit us he punched my head into a wall, and like in Anthem he had a ring that cut my forehead. He was horrified. It never happened again. It was just the tip of the iceberg of some rage. Then he mellowed out a lot. He was always loving—just tied up inside.”
In what way? Mitchell said, “When I came out, my dad let me know he was actually bisexual and before he met my mom he’d been with guys, and then he did what he termed ‘the right thing.’ He did love my mom, but in his time and place there was no place to be gay. That was a shock.”
Did his father ever have sex with men after his marriage? “I don’t think so,” said Mitchell. “I think he was quite a man of faith and commitment for better and worse. I think he got quite rigid and angry at times. He was a loving guy, but he probably didn’t like himself in some ways.”
People found Mitchell’s father to be charismatic and funny. “When I did come out, my dad was very supportive, even though he was closeted in his bisexuality. He supported gays in the military in the ’90s. He was proud of me. He had rebelled against his own father to find his own happiness, and he was proud I had done the same in my own way.”
Mitchell said they were an unhappy family. “My brother Samuel died, and we couldn’t talk about it. I was 14. He was 4. He had a heart problem and it was a sudden thing. Mom loved Samuel very much, but she didn’t have a lot of maternal skills. She had to take care of her own siblings during the war, so with us she not very touch-y. British people of that era were not cuddly.”
Mitchell puts on an English accent. “Just get on with it.” Then a Glaswegian one: “I never saw a banana till I was 12.” “You’ve had your tea, go to bed.” “I do my messages all day.” “ We were all feeling guilt because we’re Catholic. Somehow we had caused his death. Truly, we all thought we were responsible. The wages of sin. ”
After Samuel died, Mitchell said, “I didn’t have a way to process my grief. We moved around so much I didn’t have friends for long. I couldn’t talk about my feelings. I certainly couldn’t talk about being gay. Talking about my brother dying was reduced to, ‘He’s an angel.’ I didn’t know what to do with that ‘angel.’
“We were all feeling guilt because we’re Catholic. Somehow we had caused his death. Truly, we all thought we were responsible. The wages of sin. And it was a narcissistic thing, too.”
Mitchell said his father was proud to watch him direct films, as it echoed his own military boss-job. His mother was “more a creature of religion. The pope and all the rules kept her going. She couldn’t reconcile that with my being gay. It was very hard for her.” She was an anti-abortion activist, “and then Fox News made her think global warming was a hoax,” and its homophobia helped harden her attitudes against Mitchell himself.
The one positive aspect of Alzheimer’s for both his parents is that her “very loving essence” emerged. “For the last few years she has been in a very sweet state, and knows who I am with some prompting.”
His father died five years ago; her mother’s condition meant she had forgotten that he died and the circumstances of his death the day after it occurred. She now lives with a caregiver, and Mitchell needs to raise money for her care, which he hopes to do through Anthem and his Hedwig tour.
When he was younger, Mitchell’s mother felt she had sacrificed her career for her husband’s. “She was a woman of projects: anti-abortion, painting. She was a good teacher, she wasn’t the best mom,” he said. She once directed Mitchell in Noel Coward’s Hay Fever : “She didn’t give me the part I wanted, but gave me the part I should have got.”
Growing up, Mitchell had crushes on guys and was a dedicated reader of gay-themed literature, cherishing works by Oscar Wilde, Coward, and John Rechy. He started having sex just as AIDS hit, and “luckily was safe from the very beginning. If I’d been a bit older, I’d be dead.”
Death was always in the wings,” Mitchell said. “My brother had died. It was always there. When I was young I wondered if I died now would I regret anything, which always made me want to take certain risks, because I realized life was short.
“There were times in the AIDS period when I asked myself, ‘Am I ready to die now?’ And I thought, ‘Yes, I’m doing what I need to do.’ It’s so weirdly good to be able to say, ‘Am I ready to go?’ I think everyone should ask that periodically. ‘What have I done? What can I do?’”
As a student, Samuel Beckett was Mitchell’s favorite playwright. He eventually met his literary idol in Paris. Writing had been his first love in high school, he studied theater at Northwestern, and worried he would be drafted into the Army as then-President Reagan had reintroduced draft registration in Mitchell’s senior year.
“What was I going to do? USO? In effect, Hedwig is a USO act.”
His acting took off, then writing and directing. He never separated either discipline. He won an Obie Award and Drama Desk nomination for his role in The Destiny of Me , Larry Kramer’s 1992 sequel to The Normal Heart .
When Mitchell first conceived of Hedwig in 1994, he began performing in drag alongside figures like Mistress Formika, Lady Bunny, Jayne County, Justin Vivian Bond, and Anohni, formerly Antony of Antony and the Johnsons. Trask was the leader of the house band at the SoHo club Squeezebox, where Mitchell performed.
Mitchell was concerned he would be seen as not paying his dues, but found that he was embraced, “and I took the form to another place which I hope helped some of them think outside the box.” “ If you put out something imaginative, empathetic, and make it as good as you can make it, it will make those kinds of people want to work and hang out with you. Everything is a personal ad, a message in a bottle. ”
He didn’t consider its longevity. “I don’t think you should ever consider the thing you’re making could have a long life because then it changes what you’re making. The only rule is to make it as good as you can. If you put a half-ass thing out into the world, don’t be surprised if half-ass people want to hang out with you. If you put out something dishonest, then dishonest people will find you attractive. If you put out something imaginative, empathetic, and make it as good as you can make it, it will make those kinds of people want to work and hang out with you. Everything is a personal ad, a message in a bottle.”
He didn’t see “a cent” from the movie (Broadway was a different matter). He doesn’t know if Anthem could become a TV series, film, or musical. He has enjoyed doing it because a podcast is a “cheap way of working with great actors.” It’s like Hedwig in that it was made as a labor of love rather than calculated career move.
“Drag and punk rock were not lucrative back then,” Mitchell said, laughing. When he himself took on the role of Hedwig on Broadway in 2015 (leading to a Special Tony Award), he made lots of changes, which he’s sure must have driven his co-stars mad, “but I wrote this, I can do what I want,” he said, mock-diva-ishly.
He has been as exacting making Anthem as he was with Hedwig ; sounds rearranged to be just so, just as he once stained his jeans with tea bags to make an authentic ’80s color for Hedwig. He is, he said, “an easygoing perfectionist. You have to be super-prepared in order to let go and improvise, otherwise it gets too messy.”
In both Hedwig and Shortbus , Mitchell courted controversy and challenged convention, even the then-LGBT pop-culture conventions of assimilation.
“I was always never a mainstream person, even within gay culture. I am too much of an outsider. I enjoyed throwing entertaining bombs into the theater world and into the queer world.”
He preferred Little Richard and David Bowie over standard disco. “‘Queer’ is everything, not a marketable niche. I get really annoyed when outsiders imitate their oppressors, and even eroticize their oppressors.” “ This wasn’t porn. Porn is what you jerk off to. Sex is bigger than that. Gender is bigger than that. If drag loosened me up, I think everyone should do drag. ”
When gay men label themselves as “straight-acting,” said Mitchell, or valorize “masculine” over “feminine” gays, it’s a particularly twisted self-patrolling in the service of the dominant culture. “ Hedwig cured me completely,” said Mitchell. “It made me realize people being comfortable in their own skin is hot. Sex apps are full of fem-phobia and inherent racism. These are not preferences but aversions, prejudices , which we are taught.”
Mitchell also emphasizes he is not “a big fan of censorship, PC or otherwise.” The conservatives who protested Shortbus ’ sex scenes didn’t understand, he said, that it was “dishonest” to cut the act of sex from a sex scene to suddenly segue to clean sheets and the next morning. “This wasn’t porn. Porn is what you jerk off to. Sex is bigger than that. Gender is bigger than that. If drag loosened me up, I think everyone should do drag.”
While Hedwig was heralded by some as a trans icon, Mitchell said modestly that he never “presumed to make a trans statement,” especially as in the scheme of the piece the main character was forced into gender reassignment surgery against their will. The story embraces both the power of the mask and armor of drag alongside the scars from abandonment and ignorance, “a bitterness and victimhood seething through the whole show.”
Mitchell is single, and dating “someone who’s nice.” During the making of Anthem , he didn’t have sex. “My libido plummeted. But now it’s back and I’m having fun.” At the beginning of his gay life, Catholicism and the era of AIDS meant sex “felt bad, bad bad. One of the reasons I made Shortbus was to examine the specifically American version of erotophobia. It’s human, ridiculous, loving, and sad.”
He and friends set up his party, Mattachine, at New York City’s oldest LGBT pub, Julius, 11 years ago to be open to all kinds of LGBT people. It is named after the brave, pre-Stonewall campaigners of the Mattachine Society. “ As Trump laughs we’re doing his work for him. We’re rats in a cage. We’re trapped in his world to an extent. We can’t do much about it for now, so we start to legislate and purify. It comes from a good source, but it can also limit and separate. We need allies. ”
Mitchell said that rigid LGBT cultural politics frustrated him. “I chafe at that side of PC stuff that comes from a place of true grievance, but then gets carried away by rules and a lack of context.” He doesn’t agree, he said, with “those who say that drag queens cannot lip-sync to the songs of a singer whose race they do not share. You can keep going with that and start banning yourself into...” He paused. “The only safe form now is autobiography, and even then only with consent and trigger warnings. Without the imagination empathy dies.
“I feel like people are separating themselves from their natural allies and friends. As Trump laughs, we’re doing his work for him. We’re rats in a cage. We’re trapped in his world to an extent. We can’t do much about it for now, so we have started to legislate and purify. It comes from a good source, #MeToo culture comes from trying to correct things that need to be corrected: harassment, rape culture, and misogyny. Those abusers need to be stopped. But it can also limit and separate. We need allies.”
As with #MeToo, Mitchell applauds movements of redress and empowerment, while hoping that “defining yourself as a victim has to be transitional to get to the next stage. If you stay defined as a victim it still traps—and has full control over—you, and you’re a slave to it. I don’t believe in censorship. I believe you have to talk about it all. You really do.
“I'm all for getting Harvey Weinstein and other alleged offenders ‘out of school,’ but—and maybe it’s my Catholic thing—I also hope people can change and learn, and cancel culture doesn’t allow for that. It negates the possibility of redemption and change and learning. That’s why restorative justice campaigns are so powerful.”
Next, Mitchell is developing a TV show, very much of the moment, in which democracy is eyed with suspicion by both right and left. Mitchell’s show will investigate what new forms of community and government could be viable.
He looks an incredibly young 56, but he has always been an old soul. “Even as a kid I sometimes felt like I was impersonating a child. One of my goals is to find that child part again and let it out more now. I know who I am and like myself.”
Mitchell is also a member of the Radical Faeries , although hasn’t attended a gathering for a while. “At their best these are mixed, wonderful sanctuaries where everybody is welcome. At their worst they are hippie circuit parties. Meth and cocaine have started infiltrating the gatherings. I see them as distillations of consumerism and capitalism.” Mitchell prefers hallucinogenics like Ayahuasca and Iboga.
Death doesn’t feel as close as it did when he was younger. “I’m more afraid of something like Alzheimer’s and losing the plot. It’s more debility than death that scares me. Dying with dignity, how we die comfortably and with volition, is something I think about.” “ As the Alzheimer’s pared away at that poisonous cladding my mother had, her real self came through: this wifey from Glasgow who’s fun and sweet and still a bit of a queen. She can still cut you with a look. She’s still very powerful, even though she is half in the other world now. ”
Mitchell has made enough money for his mother’s care for the rest of this year. “She’s declining, so she may not have much time left,” he said. He is happy that his parents went to “a place of peace and love, and that we fixed our relationships which Rupert Murdoch and Pope Benedict destroyed.”
Does he really hold Fox News and the Catholic Church in a large part responsible for these fractured relationships?
“Yes, and you see it all over the place: people not able to talk to their parents, estrangement, and polarization. The good thing was, as the Alzheimer’s pared away at that cladding my mother had, her real self came through: this wifey from Glasgow who’s fun and sweet and still a bit of a queen. She can still cut you with a look. She’s still very powerful, even though she is half in the other world now.”
It’s obviously been painful watching Alzheimer’s attack his parents, but it has also helped Mitchell let go of all the issues he had with them, “or you just stay trapped forever.” Mitchell said he no felt longer trapped, so expect more controversies and cultural explosions, detonated with love."
Inside the Abandoned Beatles Ashram in India,www.thedailybeast.com,Mona Gable,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-beatles-ashram-in-rishikesh-inside-the-abandoned-compound,"THERE ARE PLACES I REMEMBER Inside the Abandoned Beatles Ashram in India Hulton Archive/Getty The Beatles all tried to find Nirvana here on their trip to India, as did Mia Farrow and other celebrities. But the ashram turned out a bust, and for decades has been left alone. Mona Gable 05.06.19 5:05 AM ET
R ishikesh beckons. Nestled in the verdant foothills of the Himalayas, the holy town in north India sparkles like a jewel in the hazy afternoon sky. To get there, I have to cross a narrow suspension bridge called Lakshman Jhula. It sways above the sacred jade waters of the Ganges, which is believed to wash away all sins.
As I step onto the bridge, it feels like all of humanity has converged here. The pathway is jammed with motorbikes, seekers, tourists, backpackers and yogis, sadhus in saffron robes. Cows amble toward me. Monkeys stare. Men spit. On the opposite side, ashrams and temples hug the river where worshippers pray, chant, and bathe. With their bright colors and fanciful shapes, they look like something a child would create.
I have come to Rishikesh, a world-renowned yoga center, on a pilgrimage of sorts. I am here to find the Beatles Ashram. In February 1968, the Beatles ventured to this remote corner of India to study Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, its founder.
I was a teenage girl then, in love with George, his sad, dark eyes and soulful guitar playing. The band journeyed to India at the height of their celebrity. Bereft at the death of their manager Brian Epstein, and bickering among themselves, the four British musicians hoped to find spiritual guidance.
They did not, alas, find nirvana. Ringo left after about 10 days, unsettled by the spicy food. Paul soon followed. Two months later, George and John abruptly fled, after the guru’s materialism and less-than-holy sex life became evident. But not before writing many of their songs for the collection that came to be known as The White Album : “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,” “Blackbird,” and “Dear Prudence,” after Mia Farrow’s sister, Prudence, who stayed at the ashram then. Mia did, too.
For decades the ashram was abandoned, its gates shuttered, its forest grounds unkempt. Fans and lovers occasionally stole in to scrawl their names in the empty buildings. Then, a few years ago, inspired by the rise in ecotourism, the property inside Rajaji National Park was reopened to visitors. A small café was added, and a gallery to showcase photography of the Beatles’ 1968 visit.
I did not know where the ashram was, and had no address. So Sunita, a river guide at Atali Ganga, the stunning eco-lodge where I stayed, agreed to take me.
As we make our way through the narrow lanes, we weave around stray dogs, blaring taxis and knots of tourists. We pass cafés, ashrams teaching yoga classes and meditation, centers offering Ayurvedic healing.
Every March, thousands of yogis descend on Rishikesh for the International Yoga Festival. Even now, in early December, there is almost too much to see, to take in. As we walk through the heart of town, I get constantly distracted.
In one open-air stall, I buy a fistful of colorful cotton scarves for $2 apiece. I walk past a small shop selling organic Indian spices, and duck in to smell them. In another, I flip through CDs of contemporary Indian music. In a store filled with semi-precious gemstone jewelry and religious totems, a Tibetan man sits on a stool holding a baby, swaddled in fleece. I kneel down and smile at her. I leave with a pair of Tibetan copper bells.
Street vendors and restaurants serving vegetarian dishes are plentiful. Alcohol and meat are not allowed in Rishikesh. Cows are deemed so holy that, in some regions of India, Hindu extremists have murdered farmers for killing the animals. Cows are everywhere. Lying across storefronts. Roaming the lanes. Snoozing in doorways. Some have their horns painted royal blue.
After walking south through the city for an hour, the chaos fades as we enter a peaceful residential area. We walk on a stone path skirting the Ganges, turn a corner onto a dry river bed. Then suddenly we are at the ashram gates. Save for the forest guard in the kiosk, and an Indian couple, the place is deserted. I pay the entrance fee of 600 rupees, and walk uphill past a stone wall painted with gold and scarlet butterflies.
The ashram sprawls across 14 acres, a legacy of nature, art, and the spiritual counterculture of the 1960s. The place is spooky, beautiful. Peacocks wander the grounds. The only sound is their cries, or the rustle of monkeys in the sal forest. Cobwebs float inside the desiccated buildings. The Indian government plans to renovate them, but not much has been done.
I enter a massive, high-ceilinged lecture hall and gasp. The walls are covered in pop art, graffiti, images of the Maharishi, and murals of the Beatles painted by street artist Pan Trinity Das and a group of friends, over several visits to the ashram beginning in 2012. This is the magical Beatles Cathedral Gallery , a frequent stop for their fans in India. I stand in the hall, close my eyes and listen. It’s been more than 50 years since the musicians came to Rishikesh. John and George are long gone. But it feels like their spirits remain.
When the Maharishi envisioned the ashram, using land leased from the Uttar Pradesh Forest and Wildlife Department, he didn’t exactly scrimp. There’s a post office, a communal kitchen, a printing press, residence halls, a meeting room where disciples played music, meditated and chanted. George practiced sitar in a glass-domed gazebo. The Maharishi lived in a compound above the Ganges.
The most striking buildings are the stone meditation huts—84 of them—sprinkled across the leafy grounds. They look like gray eggs. Inside some of them, steps lead down to another floor. For an hour, I wander in and out of the huts, spellbound. In one, I sit cross-legged in the wide-open doorway and contemplate who might have meditated here. Remnants of fixtures litter the floor. Inside, the paint on the once vibrant walls is cracked, faded. One, painted orange, makes me think of “marmalade skies.”
Before night falls, I make one last stop, at the gallery exhibiting photographs of the Beatles during their time at the ashram. Taken by Paul Saltzman, the author of a 2018 book called The Beatles in India , the photos are mostly group shots of the band, posing with Cynthia Lennon, Jane Asher, Pattie Harrison Boyd, Mia Farrow, Donovan, and other devotees. They look so young, George and John, Ringo and Paul, in their loose white shirts and pants, a garland of marigolds around their necks, their faces serious. In one group picture, the Maharishi sits above them, his hands clasped in his lap. He has long gray hair, a white beard, and a slight smile on his lips. I wonder what the guru is thinking? He died in his sleep in the Netherlands in 2008, a week after relinquishing his role as leader of the TM movement, the whispers over his sexual misdeeds and materialism largely forgotten. He was given a state funeral at his ashram in Allahabad, India, overlooking the Ganges.
I wish I could have visited the ashram when the Beatles were here. But in some ways, it wouldn’t have been as meaningful as my vigil there decades later. I wouldn’t have yet endlessly listened to “Norwegian Wood,” or the other timeless songs they composed during their stay. "
Bernie 2.0: Sanders Decides to Play Rough This Time,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-20-senator-decides-to-play-rough-for-the-2020-presidential-race,"GAME ON Bernie Sanders Decides to Play Rough This Time The senator is playing to win, drawing sharp contrasts with his opponents far more quickly and aggressively than he did four years ago. 05.06.19 5:05 AM ET Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty
In just the last month, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) unloaded a blistering attack on a leading Democratic think tank. He went after former Vice President Joe Biden on a number of policy fronts. And one of his top congressional surrogates accused Mayor Pete Buttigieg of intellectual dishonesty.
It’s a new, more aggressive look for Team Sanders. The senator who four years ago was known as a gruff but endearing candidate running a democratic-socialist, ideas-driven campaign has decided to bare his fangs more quickly this time, in hopes that it may actually win him the nomination.
“[T]he senator learned… many lessons from 2016,” Nina Turner, a national co-chair of Sanders’ 2020 campaign told The Daily Beast, “and one of those lessons is to show what separates you very clearly from the rest of the people running.”
It’s an effort, aides and associates say, born from the new role he occupies in Democratic politics. With his name ID having skyrocketed after his last run—and having assumed the role of the ideological pied piper of the left— Sanders himself said he no longer feels he needs to take the time to introduce himself or his ideas to voters.
“I think we start off with the advantage that many people know where I’m coming from,” the Senator told The Daily Beast in a recent interview, “that all of these issues—health care is a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, addressing climate change, dealing with a broken criminal justice system and a broken immigration system, protecting a woman’s right to choose—these are not new ideas for me.”
Four years ago, Sanders faced a far different landscape. When he entered the presidential contest in 2015, he was seen as an also-ran; the improbability of his bid underscored by the oddity of its launch: a press conference off to the side of the Capitol building.
Though he was an insurgent, Sanders early on often declined to go on the attack, particularly on topics he deemed superficial. During the first debate in October 2015, he was asked about Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State.
“Let me say something that may not be great politics,” he said, in what would become one of the early defining moments of the primary. “But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.”
As the primary wore on, the soft touch disappeared. Sanders took jabs at Clinton for her paid speeches to Wall Street, her praise of Henry Kissinger , and her vote for the Iraq War, among other things. But within the larger Sanders’ orbit, some questioned whether the primary contest—and even the general election—would have played out differently if he had gone after Clinton earlier and more aggressively.
“Inside the campaign, we were all in agreement,” Mark Longabaugh, a top strategist on the 2016 campaign, told The Daily Beast. “[But] there were commentators on the outside of the campaign, other political players who criticized us for not criticizing her on emails. There were people on the outside who were basically saying, ‘You need to engage her on this and take her down on this because if she’s our nominee, the Republicans are going to kill her on this.’ And that was the flak we were getting from the outside.”
Four years later, there is no candidate with email issues for Sanders to address. But there is a much deeper field, with a group of nominees all seeming to gravitate toward similar ideological planks. And, unlike with Clinton, Sanders seems inclined to mix things up even earlier.
Among his campaign hires are a number of veterans of the online left who led the efforts in the early aughts to challenge the Democratic Party from within. They include veterans of the anti-war movement and of now-Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont’s unsuccessful campaign to unseat Joe Lieberman in the 2006 election (Lamont won the primary but Lieberman won the general election as an independent). They also include David Sirota, an unapologetic liberal known for challenging the ideological commitment of fellow Democrats, including fellow presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, whom Sirota sharply criticized before formally joining the Sanders campaign.
Sirota has kept quiet since then. But the Sanders campaign has not. Last month, it sent a scathing letter to the Center for American Progress accusing the think tank of “using its resources to smear” him and two of his Senate colleagues in the race. Shortly thereafter, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a congressional ally who serves as a campaign co-chair for Sanders, tweaked Buttigieg on Twitter for a comment he made seeming to draw comparisons between Sanders and Trump supporters. Buttigieg, who famously wrote an essay praising Sanders when he was a high-school student, subsequently said the two politicians have “radically different” philosophies.
But the biggest contrasts Team Sanders has drawn so far have been with Biden . In the past week, the Senator has gone after his fellow septuagenarian for his record on trade and his support for the Iraq War. He said in a recent CNN interview that Biden had failed to stand up to China on trade and had facilitated some of the trade deals that had—in Sanders’ estimation—led to the hollowing of American manufacturing.
This Sunday, in an interview with ABC News , Sanders dismissed the idea that Biden could match his progressive bona fides. “I don’t think there’s much question about who’s more progressive,” he declared.
Sanders and Biden haven’t always been at odds. The two men shared kind words about each other in the past and have found themselves recently agreeing on the need to end U.S. involvement in the civil war in Yemen. And Sanders’ defenders note that his critiques are statements of fact and that he’s not the only one to jab the former VP. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), has similarly gone after Biden in the past.
But Sanders’ willingness to go so directly at Biden so early in the campaign also speaks to his team’s desire to send an early message that he is not simply running a feel-good style campaign this time. It’s a message that came from the candidate himself, according to campaign manager Faiz Shakir.
“It is important, especially in a field as large as this field this time around, for the Senator to lay out for the American people why he is uniquely situated and what makes him different than all the candidates running in the race,” Turner said. “He is by far the only presidential candidate where we have consistency. It is important that people not get totally caught up on who like and more caught up on who is going to be the one to unrig the rigged system.”"

After what seemed like the longest wait, there is finally a Royal baby, a boy, as just announced by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on Instagram.
“It‘s a Boy!” the post was headlined. “Their royal highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to announce the birth of their child.”
The baby was born Monday at 5.26 a.m. British time, and weighs 7 lbs. 3 oz. Harry said he and Meghan were still mulling a name for the boy, and that they would introduce the baby to the public in two days time.
There is something simple to this story: joy for new parents Meghan Markle and Prince Harry . And then there is something in the birth, and all the hullabaloo around it, that was there also when Harry and Meghan got married: change .
Already, in the couple’s planning around the birth, in how they want to bring their child into its unique world, we have seen a very different way of doing things. Meghan and Harry have made it clear, as evidenced in the birth announcement itself, that they are doing things their way.
Royalty is about ceremony and symbol, about handshakes and smiling. If you are a young royal, this means going around Britain and the world, breathing your own life into a willfully antic brand.
If you believe the royals have purpose, if you are a royal fan, this frenzied circus of history, glamour and social good is appealing. That the Royals stand for history and a particularly British kind of class privilege is also attractive to fans; to non-fans it seems arcane, absurd, and a symbol of the very worst aspects of class and conferred privilege. The royal family lives in palaces; they are a strange performance of fairy tale in a world that supposedly long ago stopped believing in them.
The relationship of Harry and Meghan has elements of a fairy tale about it; as with Kate Middleton there is the non-royal marrying into the Firm. But Meghan is different from Kate; she is clearly more opinionated and eloquent. She wants to be out in the world, actively campaigning for whatever change and awareness her chosen charities symbolize.
In how they have brought their first child into the world, Harry and Meghan have defied royal and media convention. There was to be no posing on hospital steps. There was no kowtowing to the usual demands of a royal baby-obsessed media.
Harry and Meghan made it clear that they were doing things at their own speed and discretion, and it seems entirely likely that they will continue to do so when bringing up their first child. Expect a desire for privacy and a determination to bring their child up on their terms rather than royal tradition and modern media expectation.
The excitement around this baby will be stoked and nurtured by royal fans themselves; and in confronting this behavior—set on repeat for each royal birth—Harry and Meghan have, however deliberately, injected some sanity into the bizarre carnival. They have become more private as the din around them has grown louder. Their unwillingness to play the royal birth game is significant and revealing of their own brand of royal autonomy. “They already know the luxuries and constraints of royal life; they know the boundaries and expectations they are operating within, and yet they are also keen to test whatever elements of those boundaries and expectations don’t work for them”
Both could be mindful of dark precedent. Harry witnessed the combined effects of the fishbowl nature of royal life and media intrusion in the experience of his mother. He and William both feel that Diana was hounded by the media, and observe the institution balefully.
Harry and Meghan are clearly determined to build the safest, sanest, and healthiest environment for their child. They already know the luxuries and constraints of royal life; they know the boundaries and expectations they are operating within, and yet they are also keen to test whatever elements of those boundaries and expectations don’t work for them.
Royal watchers have already seen how Meghan and Harry are using their Instagram account as their own news feed. Prior to the baby’s birth, the public backed their desire for privacy.
And yet they know they are not a regular family. For all their mistrust of the media, they are both expert media players. Attractive, charming, and determined to make a difference in the world (through the charities and causes they support), Harry and Meghan and their first child are a new kind of royal unit.
Harry may be the spare to William’s heir, but he knows that he has his own power that may even outstrip his big brother’s. His marriage to Meghan increases the currency of that power. She is American, and so has a given immediate access point to American royal watchers, old and young.
The fact that she is bi-racial, and that this should still be radical and historic in the Royal Family in 2019, is telling enough. But Meghan has written before about racism in America and her biracial identity, indeed has written about both things powerfully in Elle in 2015 .
Harry and Meghan are a little more free in what they can do, and what voices they can have in the world, than throne-awaiting William and Kate. Meghan herself is not a pliant royal wife. Prior to her marriage, she had an impressive resumé of campaigning and activism. She is likely more intelligent and politically astute than her husband. Not for them a life of ceremony and protocol; Harry and Meghan are motivated by a committed belief in social justice. “Harry and Meghan have their own power, and they know it. They also know that the future of the royal brand lies with them”
They are also, as the pre-birth and birth of their child showed, simply unwilling to play by the old rules of the game. But they will also not be consigned to a supporting act role, or available jesters. The formation of their own royal court makes their intent to craft a globally-dominant brand apparent.
Harry and Meghan have their own power, and they know it. They also know that the future of the royal brand lies with them. They know that this means a balance of tradition and modernity; expect walkabouts, flowers and hugs, and also radicalism.
See how they have behaved with the birth of this first child as a test run. Harry and Meghan are doing things their own way, and in so doing they are initiating a new era of royalty—and maybe even being royal. READ THIS LIST"

A new royal baby is on the way; Meghan Markle is in labor , Buckingham Palace have announced.
The palace said that Meghan “went into labor in the early hours of this morning” and that Harry was by her side.
It was not revealed whether Meghan was having the baby at home or at hospital, or whether she had been induced.
There have been persistent rumors that she has planned a home birth. Harry and Meghan recently moved into a renovated ten-bedroomed house near Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage.
A further announcement is due to be made “soon” the palace said, prompting some to speculate that the baby had already been born, including the royal correspondent for the Daily Mail.
Harry and Meghan have been criticized and applauded in equal measure for what they called “a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.”
They said that an announcement revealing the baby’s gender will be made a after the child has been safely delivered.
Although home births only account for around 2.3 per cent of births in England, that number was almost zero a decade ago.
Statistically, home birth does increase the risk of serious problems for the child–from five in 1,000 for a hospital birth to nine in 1,000 for a home birth.
Meghan has reportedly opted to sideline the queen’s team of male obstetricians, Alan Farthing and Guy Thorpe-Beeston , and is thought to have hired a private midwife and doula.
One name linked to this role is a doula named Lauren Mishcon, the wife of Oliver Mishcon, whose grandfather headed up attorneys Mishcon de Reya, the firm that represented Princess Diana during her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.
Media and the more enthusiastic members of the public were today gathering in a tent village in Windsor Great Park, alongside the Long Walk, where, just under a year ago, Harry and Meghan made their iconic post-wedding carriage ride.
Speculation that the couple are having a baby girl has intensified after Meghan’s friend Serena Williams appeared to accidentally refer to a ‘she’ when talking about a pregnant close friend’s baby , and bookmakers have made the name Diana the hot favorite.
Harry and Meghan are definitely not expected to make a public appearance with their new baby, however they will pose for photographs in the grounds of Windsor Castle with their child at some point over the next few days. READ THIS LIST"

CBS This Morning co-hosts, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell denied there was a rift between them and hit out at critics Monday morning as a major CBS shakeup was announced.
“The news should rarely be about us, sometimes it isn’t true,” King said, during a segment on the show. She decried reports that she had “insisted” O’Donnell leave the morning show—she will take over as host of CBS Evening News.
“I have no beef with you. You have no beef with me,” King said to O’Donnell, citing Tina Brown who claimed such reports were sexist.
Anthony Mason and Tony Dokoupil will join Gayle King as co-hosts on the CBS This Morning program, which has launched King to star status after a string of high-profile interviews this year. John Dickerson will move to 60 Minutes .
King explained that CBS President Susan Zirinsky had promised changes when she took over earlier this year. “She could have wielded a weed whacker,” and all of them could have been out on 57th Street, hailing taxis. “This is a business about ratings, and if things don’t work they make changes.”
O’Donnell said King and Oprah Winfrey had advised her not to listen to those “in the cheap seats. It’s not the critic that counts.”
She told King, “You have made me better in everything I’ve done.”
“I’m not sure about that,” said King.
“Accept the compliment,” laughed O’Donnell.
O’Donnell will become the new anchor and managing editor of CBS Evening News starting this summer. She will replace Jeff Glor, who had a relatively short stint in the news anchor’s chair previously occupied by Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, Katie Couric, and Scott Pelley.
“Bravo, Nora,” said King. The future of Glor is up in the air. King said, “Jeff is a fantastic journalist and trusted colleague. His conversation with CBS News continues. We hope very much he continues to work here. It will be his decision.”
Zirinsky announced sweeping changes across its popular news programs, marking what she called a “new era” for the troubled network.
O’Donnell will also be lead political anchor for CBS’s storied magazine program 60 Minutes. O’Donnell said the move was “incredibly humbling... I’m going to give this everything I’ve got. I don’t stand on the shoulders of my colleagues, they carry me on their backs.”
“Walter Cronkite once said, ‘I can’t imagine a person being a success who doesn’t give this game of life everything he’s got.’ I am going to give this everything I’ve got.”
Zirinsky said in a statement Monday: “This is a start of a new era for CBS News ... Our job is to reveal America to itself through original reporting, strong investigative journalism and powerful political coverage.”
Zirinsky took over the helm of the network in January after CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager and CBS CEO and Chairman Les Moonves were both let go over sexual-harassment scandals. READ THIS LIST"
Cory Booker Proposes National Gun-Licensing Program,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cory-booker-proposes-national-gun-licensing-program,"‘BRING A FIGHT TO NRA’ Cory Booker Proposes National Gun-Licensing Program As part of his multi-pronged gun-control policy proposal. 05.06.19 7:03 AM ET BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI
Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who recently promised to “bring a fight to the NRA like they have never ever seen before,” on Monday morning introduced a sweeping gun-violence prevention plan that centers around a national gun-licensing program, the most comprehensive and far-reaching of any candidate in the Democratic presidential field.
“My plan to address gun violence is simple—we will make it harder for people who should not have a gun to get one,” Booker said in a statement, pledging to take executive action on the first day of his desired presidency.
“As president, we will make commonsense changes to our gun laws such as requiring a license to purchase a gun that includes universal background checks, banning assault weapons, and closing the loopholes that allow domestic abusers and people on terrorist watch lists to get their hands on a gun,” he continued. “I am sick and tired of hearing thoughts and prayers for the communities that have been shattered by gun violence—it is time for bold action.”
In introducing the plan, his campaign pointed to states like Massachusetts which has a gun-licensing program , as an example of the potential for the policy’s success at the national level, noting that data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the state had significantly lower gun deaths per capita in 2016 than neighboring New Hampshire, which did not have as stringent gun laws.
Under the plan, Booker proposes that an individual could seek out a license at a local office, comparing it to applying for passport renewal. Upon doing so, they would submit fingerprints, sit for an interview, and show completion of a certified gun-safety course. The FBI would then verify all the submitted materials and run a comprehensive background check before issuing the federal gun license. The license would then be valid for up to five years “with regular, automatic checks to flag non-compliance with license terms,” according to the plan.
While the licensing program is the largest plank of the plan, Booker also proposes repealing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a 2005 law that provided protection for firearms manufacturers and dealers from liability; requiring handgun microstamping to allow law enforcement to identify the source of bullets used in crimes; and closing the so-called “boyfriend loophole,” which allows current or former unwed dating partners to purchase or own a gun even if convicted of domestic violence. The closing of that loophole is a major part of new language proposed for the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act .
Booker also wants to close the “ Charleston loophole, ” which was similarly addressed in House legislation earlier this year and refers to the means by which mass murderer Dylann Roof was able to acquire firearms. Booker also proposes banning assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks, the last of which was banned by the Trump administration. Finally, the senator also wants to increase funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), limit gun buyers to one handgun per month, and call on the IRS to conduct an investigation of the National Rifle Association’s tax status.
The 2020 Democratic contenders have gotten more aggressive on gun control in the wake of a series of high-profile mass shootings, with Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) building his campaign around the issue and others fielding questions and discussing it at campaign events throughout the country.
Before Booker announced his proposal on Monday, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) was the only other candidate to roll out a specific gun-control policy plan.
Last month at a CNN town hall , she pledged to take executive action if Congress failed to pass “reasonable gun safety laws” within the first 100 days of her presidency. Harris said she’d mandate “near-universal background checks” by requiring anyone who sells five or more guns per year to run a background check on all gun sales; revoke the licenses of manufacturers and dealers who break the law, with the hope that PLCAA will be repealed by Congress; reverse the Trump administration’s definitional change of “ fugitive from justice ,” which she said allowed thousands with outstanding warrant arrest to buy guns; and close the “boyfriend loophole.”"

Firefighters were not immediately able to open the back doors of the car where the child was strapped into a car seat. Sources have told New York news outlets that the doors were chained from the inside. The child’s father was found in a nearby pond with severe burns. He has been taken into custody at a hospital. Two BBQ-grill-size propane tanks were found near the car. The child’s parents were in a custody battle, according to the New York Daily News . There were also reports that the father had been investigated for domestic violence. "

Pope Francis on Sunday warned that emigration, low birth rates and the rich-poor divide pose real threats against the European continent and were likely to cause a new “ice curtain,” using a turn of phrase on Winston Churchill’s famous line referring to the “iron curtain” that divided Europe after World War II. The pope is on a three-day visit to Bulgaria and Macedonia to try to mend divisions between the Orthodox Christian churches in the region, which have remained divided after a split in 1054, according to Reuters. “Bulgaria, like so many other countries of Europe must deal with what can only be called a new winter,” Francis said. “The demographic winter that has descended like an ice curtain on a large part of Europe, the consequence of a diminished confidence in the future.” Pope Warns Emigration, Low Birth Causing ‘Ice Curtain’ Cheat Sheet ®"

Israel and Hamas Wage a Deadly ‘Eurovision War’ as Rockets From Gaza Threaten Rock and Roll in Tel Aviv,www.thedailybeast.com,Noga Tarnopolsky,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/israel-and-hamas-wage-a-deadly-eurovision-war-as-rockets-from-gaza-threaten-rock-and-roll-in-tel-aviv,"HEAVY METAL Hamas Started a War Over Eurovision, the Song Contest That Gave Us ABBA Hamas calculated that Netanyahu’s political weakness would force him to bargain ahead of the vaunted international song contest. Many Israelis fear Hamas may be right. 05.06.19 11:48 AM ET MOHAMMED ABED/AFP Getty
ASHKELON, Israel—Three out of the four Israelis killed during the weekend war between Israel and Hamas were hit by rockets that landed in this beach town, which has the sixth-largest population in Israel.
It was the heaviest bombardment from Gaza since the 2014 war, with almost 700 rockets launched into Israel in 48 hours, leading to a strange cacophony: the silence of the empty city, the rustle of the breeze coming in from the Mediterranean, the wail of sirens, the tremble and roar of explosions, the whistle of missiles flying overhead and the non-stop muffled booms of Israel’s miraculous Iron Dome anti-missile system buffeting the ancient city like an external heartbeat.
The mini-war ended Monday at 4:30 a.m. in an internationally brokered ceasefire agreement that neither side acknowledges.
About 23 Gazans were killed by Israeli bombardments, which followed an incident Friday when, according to the Israeli army, a sniper targeted, shot, and wounded two Israeli soldiers stationed at the border.
The Israeli military usually emphasizes Hamas’ responsibility for any incident emanating from Gaza. The group, closely affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, has ruled the Gaza Strip for a dozen years. But this time the Israelis chose to underline the claim that Palestinian Islamic Jihad, (PIJ) a rival militia, had targeted its troops.
The point was made so insistently, and so ham-fistedly, that radio announcers were forced to ask military spokespeople what “ gep ”—the Hebrew pronunciation of PIJ, a military acronym—meant.
Set adrift into a chaotic messaging arena, veterans drafted to work in the military spokesman’s bureau were explicitly told not to highlight the civilian casualties.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has no spokesman, and despite his usual propensity for compulsive video posting and unembarrassed abuse of live television broadcasts, he has yet to say a single word to Israelis.
In its Monday editorial, entitled “Why Netanyahu Keeps Mum” the daily newspaper Haaretz noted that four Israelis “have paid with their lives for Netanyahu’s no-policy policy.”
“He knowingly lies when he offers military action as the ultimate solution,” the editorial states. “Netanyahu, who boasts of his expertise in maneuvering political pressure to his benefit, can and must initiate a bold diplomatic move and present to Hamas, through Egypt, a worthy plan that will liberate Israelis from the threat in the south.”
This is unlikely to happen.
Netanyahu, who won a closely contested re-election last month, has yet to piece together a governable coalition, and faces a deadline far more threatening to him than Hamas or even the anger of Israeli voters: Avichai Mandelblit, his own attorney general, who is scheduled to indict the prime minister on several corruption charges in only two months.
Netanyahu’s potential coalition partners fall into two camps: those who will not sit in a cabinet led by an indicted prime minister—a situation without precedence in Israeli history—and those for whom the looming indictments constitute the perfect leverage to try to wring radical promises from him.
After 12 years of misery and stagnation, the Islamist factions in Gaza also know what makes Israel tick.
Hamas leader Yahyeh Sinwar spent 22 years in Israeli jails and is fluent in Hebrew. He can’t choose the members of Israel’s next government, but he could “ramp up the pressure on Israel, knowing it cannot escape its commitments, both domestic and international,” wrote Elior Levy , the Palestinian affairs analyst for the daily Yediot Ahronot .
“The timing of this round could not be better for [Sinwar], with Israel about to mark Memorial Day, celebrate its 71st Independence Day, and host the prestigious Eurovision Song Contest, which if canceled, will reflect badly on the country and impact Israel’s economy and tourism.”
You read that right: the Eurovision Song Contest, a major global event almost unknown in the United States, is scheduled to take place in Tel Aviv between May 12 and 18.
Eurovision is the biggest, kitschiest, brassiest reality show— and launchpad for ABBA in 1974 —and casus belli you never heard of.
Last week, before violence erupted, the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar quoted Gazan militias claiming that Israel’s failure to implement tacit understandings aimed at easing the blockaded enclave’s economic misery would lead to increased attacks on the border and “rockets raining on Tel Aviv that will wreck Eurovision.”
Palestinian Islamic Jihad openly threatened Eurovision, which, in addition to the offense of occurring in Israel this year, is a celebration of everything PIJ hates: loud, profane music, tiny, sparkly clothes, men and women in joint revelry and worst of all, gay men.
Among other preparations, the City of Tel Aviv and the food crowdsourcing startup EatWith have organized a “Proud Shabbat Dinner” for Eurovision visitors, where for only $12 you will be invited to partake of an “LGBTQ friendly Shabbat dinner at a host family’s home.”
Israel’s south is Netanyahu country, and residents of the urban north are often frustrated by the stalwart support Bibi, as the prime minister is known among Israelis, receives from the battered border communities. In one of hundreds of angry Facebook posts, one user wrote “Dear residents of the south, while you’re running to the bomb shelters just don’t forget Bibi gives good speeches in English.”
At an almost empty café in Ashkelon, manager Shem-Or Shaya said that “some kind of significant military engagement is needed.” Netanyahu, he said, should be made to keep his promise that “life in Tel Aviv has the same value as life here.”
Ashkelon Mayor Tomer Galam, wearing a bulletproof vest, addressed residents from a factory in which two laborers were killed by a rocket. Eliyahu Gvili, a 75-year-old retiree who came to see the scene, said his message to Netanyahu was “hold firm.”
But he also pleaded, “Don’t listen to everyone who is calling for war. No military operation. We don’t want it. The life of a single young soldier isn’t worth losing over Gaza. Let the missiles fly over here and kill us old guys.”
The 2014 war lasted for six weeks. Over 2,000 Gazans were killed, and Israel lost 67 soldiers, mostly young draftees the age of Gvili’s grandchildren, as well as six civilians.
In Maariv , a conservative newspaper, Netanyahu biographer Ben Caspit summed up the truncated, apparently purposeless battle over the weekend by concluding that “the prime minister has no idea what he is doing in Gaza.”
Israel, which “negotiates with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad while under fire as a matter of routine,” he wrote, “is subject to extortion, and is terrified of the possibility that Eurovision will be canceled or the Independence Day ceremony will be marred.”
Israel’s Independence Day, including a marquee event at which Netanyahu must speak in public, takes place on Thursday, May 9.
In Israel Hayom , which is a house organ for Netanyahu’s rule like Fox News is for Donald Trump’s, the political analyst Yossi Yehoshua blasted the prime minister under the fiery headline, “A Hostage to the Eurovision.”
Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Eurovision are holding the army back from responding to 700 incoming rockets “with the necessary force,” Yehoshua argues
The reason Israel is subject to extortion, “is the Eurovision Song Contest, a trap that restricts Israel from responding strongly, since any large-scale attack by the Israeli air force could exacerbate the rocket fire from Gaza and prevent the European delegations from arriving at the competition in Tel Aviv.”
No matter that most of the competitors are already in country, touring and Instagramming their Israel adventure.
Concerned by mounting criticism of an interim government allowing its citizens to die in choreographed rocket-fire provoked by a song contest, Israel's minister of regional cooperation, Tzachi Hanegbi, told a Sunday radio program a fib: that no ceasefire negotiations were underway.
The competition, he added, was not a factor in the government’s thinking.
“Eurovision, which is a cultural event, cannot be a concern,” he said. “In general, Israel doesn’t have an interest in launching a full-scale military campaign… but it wouldn’t occur to me that in a cabinet meeting, or a security forum, they would consider a musical event, an entertainment event.”
As Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations raced to formulate a cease-fire agreement, Gilad Erdan, Israel’s police minister, asserted that “Eurovision is not a factor from our point of view.”
Netanyahu’s Eurovision nightmare is far from over, however.
On Monday, United Torah Judaism, one of the parties he needs if he will lead Israel’s next government, abruptly canceled a meeting with the prime minister on the grounds of “the Sabbath desecration during the Eurovision.” READ THIS LIST"
‘The View’ Confronts Crenshaw for Defending Trump on Charlottesville: ‘Why Do You Apologize for Him?!’,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-view-confronts-dan-crenshaw-for-defending-trump-on-charlottesville-why-do-you-apologize-for-him,"BOTH SIDES ‘The View’ Confronts Crenshaw for Defending Trump on Charlottesville: ‘Why Do You Apologize for Him?!’ ‘There are not good people on both sides,’ Behar exclaimed to the Texas Republican, who insisted Trump did not say what he said. 05.06.19 1:54 PM ET The View/ABC
Appearing on The View on Monday, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) was challenged by hosts Joy Behar and Sunny Hostin when he claimed that President Trump never referred to white nationalists or neo-Nazis as “very fine people” during his response to the deadly 2017 Charlottesville rally.
Towards the end of his multi-segment Monday morning interview, the Texas Republican was asked about his vocal criticism of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Crenshaw, in case you forgot, helped spark conservative outrage against Omar last month, resulting in increased death threats against her when he attacked her for out-of-context remarks about 9/11.
Meghan McCain asked Crenshaw why he felt Democrats were “reluctant to call [Omar] out,” prompting the GOP congressman to reply that it was because “we’re playing a team sport today.”
“We just had a long discussion about how Republicans feel about Trump,” Crenshaw added. “I think you’re seeing the same issues play out on the Democrat side with somebody on their own team and they’re not sure how to handle it even though might, behind closed doors, disagree with what she’s saying.”
Co-host Joy Behar then jumped in, noting that Omar is a new congresswoman before contrasting conservatives’ reaction to her with the president’s Charlottesville response.
“On the right, what we have is the President of the United States in Charlottesville saying there are good people on both sides and people are yelling ‘Jews will not replace us.’ There are not good people on both sides,” she exclaimed.
Crenshaw interrupted, claiming that “in the same sentence” the president said that he was “definitely not referring to white nationalists.” (This, however, is not entirely true, as the president insisted there were “very fine people” on the side of a rally organized entirely by white supremacists and neo-Nazis.)
“Why do you apologize for him?!” Behar shot back, causing Crenshaw to double down on his defense, telling her she needed to “read what he actually said.”
Hostin, meanwhile, claimed that Trump didn’t admonish white supremacists in the same sentence but rather in a fumbling later statement.
As they continued to argue about whether or not Trump condemned white nationalists, McCain rallied to Crenshaw’s defense, saying she didn’t “think it matters” because “bigotry and any kind of statements like these should be called out.”
As for Crenshaw’s assertion that Trump said he wasn’t referring to white nationalists during his Aug. 15, 2017 remarks, this really comes down to hair-splitting and not looking at the comments in a larger context.
“Excuse me, they didn’t put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group,” Trump said at the time. “But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.”"

Nature is in the worst shape in all of human history and we’re the ones responsible for it.
“Boy, we are in trouble,” said Sir Robert Watson, chairman of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as he described an “ominous” global picture in which “the health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever.”
He was introducing a landmark 1,500-page United Nations report in Paris on Monday. The assessment states that 1 million of the 8 million known plant and animal species on Earth are now at risk of extinction—many within decades, a rate “unprecedented in human history.”
“We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health, and quality of life worldwide,” Watson added.
Hundreds of scientists and authors from more than 50 countries spent three years compiling the report, which is set to be published in its entirety this year.
Here, the most troubling findings: The ‘Web of Life’ on Earth Is Fraying
More than 40 percent of amphibians, 33 percent of coral reefs, and more than a third of all marine mammals on the planet are now threatened with extinction.
That comes with financial consequences, according to the report: The loss of wild bees and other pollinators has put $577 billion in annual crop production at risk.
“Ecosystems, species, wild populations, local varieties and breeds of domesticated plants and animals are shrinking, deteriorating or vanishing. The essential, interconnected web of life on Earth is getting smaller and increasingly frayed,” said Josef Settele, who co-chaired the assessment. “This loss is a direct result of human activity and constitutes a direct threat to human well-being in all regions of the world.” Humans Are Causing It
By farming, fishing, mining, and logging, humans have turned the world into a more dangerous place for every species.
“We have reconfigured dramatically life on the planet,” said Prof. Eduardo Brondizio , of Indiana University.
Urban areas the world over have more than doubled in size since 1992, driving up pollution. Plastic pollution alone has increased tenfold and greenhouse-gas emissions have doubled since 1980, according to the report. The report points to several human causes of accelerating species extinction rates, including exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution, and invasive alien species.
“300-400 million tons of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge, and other wastes from industrial facilities are dumped annually into the world’s waters, and fertilizers entering coastal ecosystems have produced more than 400 ocean ‘dead zones,’” areas so deprived of oxygen they cannot reliably support marine life, the assessment claims. Most Global Sustainable Development Goals Will Fall Short
The world is unlikely to meet 80 percent of the sustainable development goals adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015 because of current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystems. Those 2030 goals—related to poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans, and land—all will be directly affected by the loss of biodiversity anticipated by the report. Without Drastic Change, Negative Trends Will Continue Through 2050
Thanks to climate change and increasing land use these extinction trends will continue through at least 2050 at their current trajectory.
“We need to change the way we think about what a good life is, we need to change the social narrative that puts an emphasis on a good life depending on a high consumption and quick disposal,” Prof. Sandra Diaz, one of the co-chairs of the report, told the BBC .
“We need to shift it to an idea of a fulfilling life that is more aligned with a good relationship with nature, and a good relationship with other people, with the public good.” It’s Not Too Late
The new U.N. report followed another assessment six months ago from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which cautioned that the world has less than 12 years to avoid catastrophic levels of global warming.
“It is not too late to make a difference, but only if we start now at every level from local to global,” Watson said. “Through ‘transformative change,’ nature can still be conserved, restored and used sustainably—this is also key to meeting most other global goals. By transformative change, we mean a fundamental, system-wide reorganization across technological, economic, and social factors, including paradigms, goals, and values.” READ THIS LIST"
New Break in Maddie McCann Case Centers on Killer Pedophile,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/madeleine-mccann-detectives-closing-in-on-new-lead-in-portugal-disappearance,"exclusive REUTERS/Chris Helgren
On May 12, Kate McCann will place a “sweet” 16 birthday gift in her missing daughter Madeleine’s bedroom in Leicester, England. The room has been left untouched since the child disappeared from the Ocean Club resort in Praia Da Luz, Portugal, in 2003, and the poignant ritual is one that the still-grieving mother believes will one day pay off. She hopes her missing daughter will come home to open up all the presents that have been left there over the years.
McCann may have more hope this year than in many years past, though perhaps only to provide closure to the 12-year mystery of her daughter’s disappearance. Investigators in Portugal and the U.K. say they are homing in on two of the strongest leads they have found in recent years.
The first lead is a more thorough investigation into German pedophile Martin Ney, who, Portuguese authorities have confirmed to The Daily Beast, told a prison inmate in Germany something only McCann’s kidnapper could know.
Ney, 48, is serving a life sentence in a German prison for the murder of three prepubescent boys between 1992 and 2001. He is also under investigation for the suspected murder of two other children, whose bodies have never been found, and the sexual abuse of a dozen others. He resembles the photo composite released by Portuguese police based on witness accounts at the time McCann disappeared.
Ney’s lawyer would not confirm to the The Daily Beast whether he has been questioned in the McCann affair, but Clarence Mitchell, the McCann family spokesman, told The Daily Beast that police had, in fact, talked to him. “It might be him and he fits the profile, he is a known predatory pedophile,” he said. “There is a degree of credibility it is Ney, but we cannot speculate.”
Ney’s modus operandi in stealing the children was to don a black balaclava and sneak into their rooms while they slept when their parents had stepped out. He often sedated the children to remove them quietly, according to the court documents that led to his convictions. He was working at a homeless center run by an evangelical church in the same area where McCann disappeared while her parents ate at a tapas bar with friends a few hundred feet away from Maddie’s bedroom.
But Portuguese authorities say it is more likely a second suspect they are investigating—an alleged accomplice of Ney—will prove more useful.
After watching the Netflix documentary The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann in March, a female worker who had long retired from the Praia Da Luz resort recognized a man—now a suspect—in the grainy footage. She said she had seen him with a man she is sure was Ney.
The woman, whose name is being kept private for her own safety while the investigation continues, had a run-in with the unnamed suspect, who she says she caught stealing from the Ocean Club resort. When she confronted the man, he threatened her, according to an investigator with the Policia Judiciaria in Portugal.
Now, police think the new suspect may have been working with Ney as part of a sex-trafficking ring that preyed on children in the area at the time. A number of resort employees have given evidence over the years that they recognized both Ney and someone who is now believed to be the second man in and around the resort.
The second man, who was still working in the area, has been brought in for questioning, according to a source with the Portuguese police. The Daily Beast confirmed the lead with two separate sources who are working with both the British and Portuguese authorities.
The Netflix series was produced with the cooperation of both Portuguese and British authorities, whose Operation Grange investigation into the disappearance began in 2011 and is still ongoing. The eight-part series focused on a disturbing child-sex-trafficking ring that was operating in the area around the time McCann disappeared. The McCanns did not cooperate in the series, but are said to have been relieved that it did not pin their daughter’s disappearance on them. For a time, they were suspects in the case before being cleared after lead prosecutor Goncalo Amaral felt they were involved. Amaral, who was removed from the case, went on to write a best-selling book, The Truth of the Lie , that backed up his suspicions about the McCanns’ involvement in their daughter’s disappearance.
If the sex-trafficking ring lead turns out to be a solid lead, it does not bode well for finding McCann alive. Most victims of child sex trafficking do not survive the ordeal if they are not rescued immediately.
McCann, if alive, will turn 16 on May 12—far too old for the type of pedophile ring that Ney ran. But if she was taken by Ney and the other suspect, or their associates, they alone may be able to shed light on what happened to her and give her grieving parents continued hope, or the closure they deserve."
Swarthmore Students Launch Hunger Strike to Protest Fraternities,www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/swarthmore-fraternity-scandal-students-continue-protests-with-hunger-strike,"ESCALATION Swarthmore Students Launch Hunger Strike to Protest Fraternities The strikers are also demanding accountability for how they say protesters were treated during a demonstration at the office of the college’s president. Emily Shugerman 05.06.19 1:12 PM ET
Frustrated by the administration’s response to their protests, students at Swarthmore College started a hunger strike in hopes of getting fraternities permanently banned from campus.
Five students began their strike at 11 a.m. Monday, after more than a week of protests outside the Phi Psi fraternity house and college President Valerie Smith’s office. The protests were set off by the leak of internal Phi Psi documents that showed brothers using racist, sexist, and homophobic language and referencing a “rape attic” in a neighboring fraternity.
Both Swarthmore fraternities voluntarily disbanded last week, after student protesters drew national attention by camping outside of the Phi Psi house. But the hunger strikers say they want the administration to shut down the organizations permanently—and they won’t eat until that demand is met.
“A verbal response from the fraternities is not enough to guarantee an end to fraternity violence on this campus,” hunger-strike participant Tiffany Wang told The Daily Beast.
The group wants the fraternity leases terminated and the houses reallocated to other groups on campus. Smith has said she will base her decision about the fraternities on the recommendations of the Student Social Events and Community Standards Task Force that met with her Friday.
But the hunger strike encompasses more than the original fraternity protests. The students—who are not part of the original Coalition to End Fraternity Violence—say they want an apology for how protesters were allegedly treated during their demonstration at President Smith’s office.
The students say they were denied access to food and restrooms and threatened with arrest—an escalation from how the school has handled peaceful protesters in the past. They claim one student was pushed to the ground by a public safety officer while trying to deliver food.
In a statement to the Swarthmore community on Thursday, Smith claimed students were always free to leave and had access to every public restroom in the building, excluding those in the “secure area” surrounding her office. She added that campus security had been called “due to safety and egress concerns, and to help ensure a smooth resolution to the day’s events.”
“Unfortunately, a confrontation occurred when a student attempted to open a hallway door to allow more students access to the office,” she said. “We are thankful that neither the student nor the campus public safety officer was seriously harmed.”
A school spokesperson denied any students were threatened with arrest.
The hunger strikers are calling for the resignation of Director of Public Safety Michael Hill, and for a promise that the administration will not use force or call police on nonviolent student protesters in the future. They say this is necessary to protect the right to protest on campus.
“They’ve really escalated in cracking down on what is a completely peaceful protest,” hunger strike participant Anya Slepyan said of the administration. “If that becomes the new norm for civil disobedience at the college that means only people who are willing to risk arrest can protest.”"

Joy Behar and Meghan McCain Finally Agree on Something, Fist-Bump to Show It ‘The View’ audience erupted in applause as they were treated to a first glimpse of the frequent foes finally getting along. 05.06.19 12:29 PM ET The View/ABC
Regular viewers of daytime gabfest The View are accustomed to seeing co-hosts and ideological opposites Joy Behar and Meghan McCain derail the show almost daily as they personally tear into each other . That’s why Monday’s opening segment came as a shock, as viewers were treated to the pair fist-bumping and declaring their full agreement with each other.
Covering Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s assertion that he doesn’t want to get into a “mud-wrestling match” with President Trump while also labeling the president a “clown,” the panel quickly found itself divided on whether Biden should get dirty with the insult-tossing former reality-TV host-turned-president.
Co-host Abby Huntsman worried what it “says about us” if the former veep feels like he needs to “get in the mud with Trump, adding that she hopes he doesn’t as his “campaign has been about sewing this country back together.”
As fellow host Whoopi Goldberg called Biden a “scrapper” who won’t “back up,” McCain—who has thrown her full support behind the ex-veep, a family friend of hers—jumped into the fray to tout Biden’s willingness to punch back.
“He will go Wilmington, Delaware on his ass so quick,” she exclaimed about the longtime Delaware senator. “I’m ready for a fight. I’m ready for somebody to counter-punch in a way that will be effective.”
“Me too!” Behar excitedly added as the crowd roared in approval.
McCain went on to say Biden would keep it “classy because Joe is a classy guy” but that she looks “forward to the fight all day every day” and that “it’s going to be incredible.”
Behar, meanwhile, noted that she likes it when candidates return fire with fire.
“His base, Trump’s base, likes it when he makes up these names,” she said. “Crooked Hillary... They go to those MAGA rallies and they love them. Joe Biden’s base, I’m one of them. I like it too. On that side, go right back at him I’m a street fighter. I’m from Brooklyn. Go right at him!”
As the audience erupted in applause, McCain reached across the table and gave her frequent foe a fist-bump.
“I’m a fighter too!” McCain shouted.
Co-host Sunny Hostin, however, disagreed with the duo, saying that she was also from Brooklyn and that Biden could stay classy, debate on policy, and not “get in the mud.”
“Sometimes you do!” McCain replied as the table then got into a full debate on how Biden should deal with Trump.
Eventually, Behar said that they are dealing “with the most shameless person that has ever been in that office,” prompting McCain to express shock that they are in “total agreement.”
“You gotta play dirty to get dirty,” the former Fox News personality exclaimed. “It is a dirty game! Politics is not the place you go when you want to feel soft and warm. Especially in the Trump administration.”"
‘A Kind Soul’: New Mexico Fishing Guide Died in Moscow Plane Crash That Killed 41,www.thedailybeast.com,Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-plane-crash-jeremy-brooks-new-mexico-fishing-guide-died-in-crash-landing,"R.I.P. ‘A Kind Soul’: New Mexico Fishing Guide Died in Moscow Plane Crash That Killed 41 Jeremy Brooks, 22, had recently graduated from college in Colorado Springs and taken a job as a fishing guide in Russia. 05.06.19 3:15 PM ET Tatyana Makeyeva/Reuters
Jeremy Brooks, a 22-year-old fishing guide from Santa Fe, New Mexico, had recently scored a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: a job at a Russian fishing lodge.
Brooks, who picked up his first fly-fishing rod when he was just 7 years old, prepared diligently for the coveted position. He spent a month in Washington State learning to cast with a new rod he bought specifically for the job, his best friend, Marco Rossetti, told the Santa Fe New Mexican .
But soon after arriving in Russia, Brooks’ dreams were cut short: On Monday, family and friends identified him as the sole American who died when a Russian plane crashed and burned on a Moscow runway Sunday evening.
“He was always so positive, just a kind soul,” his friend and former boss, Ivan Valdez, said, according to the New Mexican . “He had a kindness about him that just everyone was attached to and loved.”
Valdez, who hired Brooks to work at his fly-fishing shop and guide service when he was just 16, added: “He’s like a son to me. I can’t believe he’s gone. He’s the best person you could ever meet.”
Brooks had just graduated from Colorado College with a major in environmental studies, the New Mexican reports. Local ABC affiliate KOAT7 added that he was “well-known” as a fishing guide in Tesuque, where he lived.
Valdez, whom Brooks’ family reportedly asked to handle media inquiries, said that the U.S. Embassy has confirmed Brooks’ death.
Rossetti, told the New Mexican that Brooks was traveling to Russia to work at “the most prestigious fly-fishing lodge in the world.”
“It costs about $15,000 for a week of fishing, and to get the position that he got is unheard of,” Rossetti said. “That’s not an easy job to get. I think there’s only two or three Americans who have ever guided there.”
The Aeroflot plane carrying Brooks, which was traveling from Moscow to the northern city of Murmansk, quickly doubled back toward Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport after taking off, according to flight-tracking data.
Video shows the Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet S100 trying and failing to land smoothly on the tarmac. After striking the runway and bouncing back up a few times, the plane crashed down, engulfing the rear half in flames. As the burning plane skidded across the runway, black columns of smoke floated to the sky.
Once the plane stopped, passengers could be seen escaping on the plane’s inflatable yellow slides. Only 37 passengers on the flight survived, Russian officials said Sunday night. Forty-one people, including Brooks, did not.
It’s not yet clear what caused the plane to crash. The pilot, Denis Evdokimov, reportedly said Monday that the plane was struck by lightning soon after takeoff, cutting off communications with air-traffic control. Officials said Monday that the plane’s black boxes had been recovered—and that they were considering inexperienced piloting, technical failure, and poor weather as potential causes of the deadly crash.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday morning that one American had perished in the crash but did not name the victim.
“We join @USEmbRuPress @USEmbRu in expressing sincere condolences to the families of all who were lost or injured in yesterday’s tragic plane fire at Sheremetyevo airport, including one U.S. citizen,” Pompeo tweeted .
Rossetti told the New Mexican that Brooks “just loved everyone for who they were.”
“There wasn’t a bar that he would go into and not introduce himself to the bartender and start hanging out and making friends with everyone,” he said, adding, “He supported and encouraged everyone.”
In a 2016 interview posted on Valdez’s company’s website, Brooks said he started fly fishing when he was just 7 years old.
“Every single day I’m grateful that I picked up a fly rod when I did,” he said, adding that “it’s a love that has meant everything to me for the majority of my life.”"
Inside Ozwald Boateng's Triumphant Womenswear Debut at Harlem's Apollo Theater,www.thedailybeast.com,alaina.demopoulos@thedailybeast.com (Alaina Demopoulos),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-ozwald-boatengs-triumphant-womenswear-debut-at-harlems-apollo-theater,"RENAISSANCE MAN Inside Ozwald Boateng's Triumphant Womenswear Debut at Harlem's Apollo Theater The British tailor hit Harlem for the debut of his womenswear collection and a celebration of black culture. 05.06.19 4:02 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photos Getty
It should come as no surprise that Savile Row designer Ozwald Boateng, long known for his sharp, British-with-a-twist tailoring, throws a commanding runway show.
But add some challenges to the mix—untraditional runway staging at Harlem’s Apollo Theater , a downpour outside leading to some soggy spectators—and the triumph of Boateng’s show becomes all the more impressive.
Perhaps the biggest surprise was that the night’s theme of “ AI ” found with zero robots on the runway. In a short film projected onto the famous stage just before the show began, Boateng explained that the initials stood not for artificial intelligence, but a trifecta of “authentic identity,” “artificial intelligence,” and “ancestral identity.”
Boateng, a first-generation British son of Ghanaian immigrants, opted to debut his debut womenswear collection on his own terms. In show notes, the former Givenchy creative director wrote of finding inspiration in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s.
“Keeping up with tradition is good, but I have always held a strong belief that traditions have to evolve otherwise they will eventually die,” Boateng, 52, wrote.
As models walked to the center of the stage then made a lap around the “runway” that were aisles of the theater orchestra section, it was easy to pick up the reverence Boateng has for vintage designs.
Along with obvious sartorial nods to the 1920s, the designer took cues from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. To keep things less costume-y and more current, historical references were juxtaposed with sleek, timeless suiting, giving the entire scene a futuristic vibe. (Again: robots.)
In the unisex show, both men and women wore Black Panther -esque berets tilted to the left. Some were put over printed keffiyehs that flowed with each step.
As expected from a tailor like Boateng, the night became a parade of soome very smart suits. The best were saved for women.
One model’s right trouser leg had a slick, straight silhouette, while her right one fanned out into skirt-like pleating. Another wore a pristine white jumpsuit that would have been a little too angelic were it not for two pointy pant creases that toughened things up. “The night’s homage to black culture included a soundtrack that was impossible to not seat dance to, with remixed tracks from James Brown, Prince, and an encore from opera singer John Holiday”
There were also traditionally feminine styles, too, for men and women. One showstopper that came in the middle of the night was a printed maxi with a skirt layered over the top. Boateng paired it with a jade peacock headdress Josephine Baker would have scooped up in a heartbeat.
Another structured suit for men got the gender-fluid treatment with a long, purple skirt overlay.
The night’s homage to black culture included a soundtrack that was impossible to not seat dance to, with remixed tracks from James Brown, Prince, and an encore from opera singer John Holiday.
Boateng recently dressed Idris Elba for his April wedding to Sabrina Dhowre; the newlyweds sat front row on Sunday night. Also present was the model Adut Aketch, skin pristine after a 24 karat gold mask facial she got to prep for the evening (and, of course, Monday’s Met Gala ).
The singer Justine Skye also made an appearance in a faded tangerine pantsuit. Boateng utilized a similar rusty hue for many of his designs, making one wonder if burnt copper is the new hot pink .
Some vestiges of a typical fashion show remained. A long line stretched outside the Apollo, guest standing in the rain, blocking the entrance to a nearby Red Lobster. Predictably, there was some door drama with ticket barcodes. The show did not start until more than an hour after its 7pm call time.
Minor details, really, in the face of the meaning behind Boateng’s afrocentric show, which celebrated fashion on the designer’s own terms. Not only did Boateng eschew the traditional fashion calendar , but he held his extravaganza the night before the Met Gala.
The move took some chutzpah, sure, but the designer proved he has the ability not only to fill Apollo on such a busy night, but bring the audience to its feet, too."

Amateur Sleuth Investigates Murder of Young Mom—and Winds Up Dead,www.thedailybeast.com,kate.briquelet@thedailybeast.com (Kate Briquelet),05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ellie-marie-washtock-investigates-murder-of-young-mom-michelle-oconnelland-winds-up-dead,"MYSTERY DEEPENS Amateur Sleuth Investigates Shooting of Young Mom—and Winds Up Dead The mother of Michelle O’Connell believes Ellie Washtock was targeted for looking into her daughter’s 2010 shooting death. This week, authorities ruled Washtock’s death a homicide. 05.06.19 6:04 PM ET Larry W. Smith
A private citizen in Florida who was investigating the controversial death of a young mother was discovered fatally shot at home earlier this year. Now authorities have ruled the amateur sleuth’s death a homicide.
The body of Ellie Marie Washtock, a 38-year-old parent of two who identified as both male and female, was found inside their residence at Laterra Condominiums in St. Augustine, News4Jax reported . Washtock’s 15-year-old son made the gruesome discovery on Jan. 31 around 7:30 a.m.
At the time, Washtock was looking into the 2010 shooting death of Michelle O’Connell—a 24-year-old single mom who was killed soon after breaking up with her boyfriend, Deputy Jeremy Banks of the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office.
For nearly nine years, authorities have said O’Connell died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, a fatal injury caused by Banks’ service weapon. But her relatives don’t believe that O’Connell would take her own life, and they’ve claimed that Banks was physically abusive toward her.
O’Connell’s mysterious case was featured on ABC’s 20/20 last year, and examined by Frontline on PBS and The New York Times .
The St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office and medical examiner ruled O’Connell’s death—at Banks’ suburban St. Augustine home—a suicide, as did multiple other medical examiners and one special prosecutor appointed by then-Gov. Rick Scott.
Banks, who called 911 on the night O’Connell allegedly shot herself, said he was in the garage when he heard a gunshot and rushed inside to find O’Connell.
The deputy maintains his innocence and remains an officer with the department. In the 20/20 episode, Banks’ attorney said O’Connell’s death has “ruined his life” and that his neighbors “walk up and down the street at 2:00 at night and will scream at him, ‘murderer.’”
Washtock had reportedly started looking into O’Connell’s case last year. After Washtock’s death, O’Connell’s mother, Patty, told Action News Jax she believed the researcher was closer to uncovering the truth about what happened to her daughter.
“[Washtock] said if that happened to me, I’d want someone to fight for me,” Patty told the local TV station in March of this year.
“In my mind, [Washtock] was just murdered,” Patty added. “I think they just busted in there and killed him.”
In February, Patty told First Coast News she believed Washtock was targeted over his investigation into O’Connell’s death.
“He was finished with his work, he was confident we would prove Michelle was murdered,” Patty told the local station.
According to the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office, the fact that Washtock identified as both male and female “delayed a positive identification from the medical examiner’s office.” The victim also went by the names Eli and Craig Washtock.
Washtock’s neighbor, Alec Laughlin, told Action News Jax that he knew the victim as “Eli.”
“He knew that somebody was coming for him, so he rented the place downstairs, didn’t tell anybody, let his kids stay there, and he stayed in his regular place,” Laughlin told the news outlet. “So, he knew it was coming.”
In August, Eli Washtock requested crime scene photos from the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office via a public records request. The agency released a disk as part of that request, News4Jax reported.
A representative of the medical examiner’s office told The Daily Beast they would not release the autopsy report because the case is under investigation.
The Putnam County Sheriff’s Office didn’t return calls or emails seeking comment.
Sheriff’s spokeswoman Allison Waters-Merritt told The St. Augustine Record , “There was a lot of speculation whether it was a suicide or a homicide, so we were waiting on that.”
“So we are moving forward with this as a homicide, and we’re just asking the public for any additional information,” she said.
According to previous reports , the medical examiner was waiting on dental records to positively identify Washtock as the victim.
Patty O’Connell, via Facebook, mourned Washtock as “another son.”
“My thoughts: This was a planned killing,” Patty wrote . “What caused him to be unrecognizable? The work of a brutal killer.”
In one Facebook comment, Patty said Washtock was tracking “every move Michelle O'Connell’s killer made.” She said Washtock told her the suspect, who was in a sheriff’s patrol car, once ran “Eli and son off the road.”"

Jeremy Brooks, a 22-year-old fishing guide from Santa Fe, New Mexico, had recently scored a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: a job at a Russian fishing lodge.
Brooks, who picked up his first fly-fishing rod when he was just 7 years old, prepared diligently for the coveted position. He spent a month in Washington State learning to catch with a new rod he bought specifically for the role, his best friend, Marco Rossetti, told the Santa Fe New Mexican.
But soon after arriving in Russia, Brooks’ dreams were cut short: On Monday, family and friends identified him as the sole American who died when a Russian plane crashed and burned on a Moscow runway Sunday evening.

Red Sox manager Alex Cora told the Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo Dia that he will not be attending his team’s celebratory event at the White House Thursday, due to Trump’s handling of Hurricane Maria disaster relief. “Even though the United States Government has helped, there’s still a long road ahead and that is our reality,” Cora said. “I’ve used my voice on many occasions so that Puerto Ricans are not forgotten and my absence [from the White House] is no different. As such, at this moment, I don’t feel comfortable celebrating in the White House.” Cora joins six players on the World Series team who have also said that they won’t be attending the celebration. After the hurricane tore through the island in September 2017, killing an estimated 2,975 people , Trump slammed disaster relief efforts, claiming that Puerto Rico should be “very happy” with the funds it’s already received.

Politics Editor Vernon Loeb Out at The Atlantic—the Latest in a Long String of High-Profile Exits,www.thedailybeast.com,Maxwell.Tani@thedailybeast.com (Maxwell Tani),05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-atlantic-politics-editor-vernon-loeb-out-the-latest-in-a-long-string-of-high-profile-exits,"SET ADRIFT Politics Editor Vernon Loeb Out at The Atlantic, the Latest in a Long String of High-Profile Exits The iconic magazine is flush with cash and new hirings, but many of its most prominent writers have departed in recent months. 05.06.19 7:16 PM ET Robert Alexander/Getty
One of The Atlantic ’s top editors left the magazine last week—the latest in a recent string of high-profile departures from the hundred-year-old-publication.
Politics editor Vernon Loeb left The Atlantic on Friday, less than a year after he was hired to oversee the magazine’s politics section. Loeb confirmed his departure in a statement to The Daily Beast.
""I enjoyed my time at The Atlantic . I felt really privileged to work there,” he said in an email. “I left to follow a passion of mine and have taken a job as senior editor for investigations, enterprise and innovations at Inside Climate News, the Brooklyn-based non-profit that won the Pulitzer several years back for national reporting.""
Loeb was brought on last summer as part of a wave of new hires at the multi-platform outlet. The hiring spree was fueled by a recent influx in funding from businesswoman and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, whose investment company Emerson Collective purchased a majority stake in the publication in 2017. The Atlantic said last year that it planned to hire 100 new staffers, with more than half of those new hires going into the editorial department.
But, despite the influx of cash, the publication may be experiencing some growing pains. While the outlet continues to hire—at a time where many media outlets have experienced dramatic cutbacks—several of the company’s most high-profile staffers have made their way out the door.
A number of prominent female reporters have left the publication: National-security reporter Natasha Bertrand exited for a gig at Politico; expert Russia reporter Julia Ioffe joined GQ; and White House correspondent Rosie Gray returned to BuzzFeed News earlier this year. TIME magazine also poached two of T he Atlantic ’s staff writers in the past 18 months.
Ta-Nehisi Coates, an iconic essayist on race and culture in America, left the magazine last year without taking a position elsewhere. His exit was a huge editorial blow for the magazine, but also set off some conflict inside the Washington, D.C. newsroom.
Coates left The Atlantic just two months after a transcript was leaked to HuffPost showing him and editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg discussing at an all-staff meeting the firing of conservative columnist Kevin Williamson. Sources told The Daily Beast that the article sparked an informal leak hunt by senior managers, a move which irritated some staff.
Anna Bross, a senior communications director for The Atlantic , said none of the recent departures were connected or reflected negatively on the organization.
""It is our policy not to comment on the particulars of individual personnel matters. Each of the examples you raised represents a small handful of departures over an 18 month period, in a newsroom of 150,"" Bross said. ""The people you've mentioned left for highly individual reasons, and to draw any larger conclusions is irresponsible and frankly ridiculous.""
Loeb’s hiring was announced last June in an interview with the Washington Post , in which he specifically cited the appeal of the The Atlantic ’s vast financial resources.
“I have … spent decades at this point working for shrinking newspapers and to suddenly go work for a news organization that’s aggressively and ambitiously expanding was almost mind-bending for me,” Loeb told Post media critic Erik Wemple at the time."

CBS News Chief Susan Zirinsky: ‘I Had to Keep My Focus on the Endgame’ With Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell,www.thedailybeast.com,lloyd.grove@thedailybeast.com (Lloyd Grove),05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cbs-news-chief-susan-zirinsky-i-had-to-keep-my-focus-on-the-endgame-with-gayle-king-and-norah-odonnell,"Travel RESULT CBS News Chief Susan Zirinsky: ‘I Had to Keep My Focus on the Endgame’ With Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell CBS News boss Susan Zirinsky said ‘none of the noise mattered’ over her high-profile staff shakeup. Jeff Glor’s future remains unclear after he was booted from the ‘Evening News.’ 05.06.19 10:04 PM ET Shannon Finney/Getty
CBS This Morning star Gayle King might find “a lot of bad press coming from inside the building…very disturbing to me,” as she complained on the air during Monday’s episode, without citing the New York Post ’s claim last week that King had forced her longtime cohost Norah O’Donnell off the broadcast.
But King’s new boss, veteran news producer Susan Zirinsky, insisted that she is unfazed by all the leaking and lurid publicity that has accompanied her first public moves as the recently-named president of CBS News.
“Look, I had to tune out the noise to keep my focus on the end game,” Zirinsky told The Daily Beast in a wide-ranging interview, a few hours after announcing sweeping personnel and structural changes at CBS This Morning , the third-place network morning program, and at the also-ran CBS Evening News , which O'Donnell will soon take over anchor duties from Jeff Glor.
King will become lead anchor on CBS This Morning . The other anchor on the morning show, John Dickerson, will move to 60 Minutes as a correspondent.
On Monday’s show, in what observers called a highly unusual bit of ad-libbing—on a day when CBS News would have clearly benefited from message discipline—King went off-script and pointedly criticized newsroom colleagues who apparently talked to the New York Post ; she even cited the poor ratings that had occasioned the on-air shakeups—which some took as a swipe at Dickerson and Glor.
“I’ve never seen somebody do that publicly on national TV,” said a CBS News veteran who asked not to be further identified. “Basically she told three million viewers, most of whom never even head of Page Six , that people are fighting with each other and leaking bad press about CBS News. But why? It makes CBS look like a loony bin, and it’s laying land mines for more trouble.”
But Zirinsky insisted otherwise.
“In the end, none of [the noise] matters,” said Zirinsky, who spent some of last week toiling to calm frayed nerves in her news division over the coming staff shakeups.
“It didn’t derail me. It didn’t sway me,” Zirinsky said about the tabloid-ready melodrama. “I knew what the truth was. I stayed on point to get to the end, to finish the plan—and that’s what’s happened.”
Saying she is “excited” and “inspired” by her new responsibilities, Zirinsky said she felt she had to act decisively, after only two months on the job, because “people needed to feel there was a plan and a purpose.”
The changes include taking King’s longtime cohost O’Donnell off the morning show and, beginning this summer, installing her as anchor and managing editor of the network’s flagship weeknight newscast and moving it to Washington—while booting Glor off the show with no clear destination. “The outpouring of support from you has been everything—so thank you for that. I like to think we’re all guided by something bigger than one moment and one broadcast. I have always wanted to do work that matters, and still do. This is something that will never change”
“You may have heard about changes taking place here at CBS News—about moves that impact colleagues, the unmatched Evening News team and me,” Glor, looking subdued, told viewers in a pretaped comment at the end of Monday night’s newscast.
“The outpouring of support from you has been everything—so thank you for that. I like to think we’re all guided by something bigger than one moment and one broadcast. I have always wanted to do work that matters, and still do. This is something that will never change.”
Adding that he’ll have “far more to share with all of you” in the future—“It will be great, I promise,” Glor said—he made no specific mention of his impending departure from the newscast or career plans, other than to say “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Glor’s comments were greeted with a long ovation in the studio, said a witness.
Zirinsky told The Daily Beast that she has offered Glor another newsroom position that she didn’t identify, but that he has yet to accept. Glor has more than a year left on his CBS contract, but it’s unclear how long he will continue to anchor the newscast, or whether he will even stay with the network. “He’s taking it day by day,” said the source, adding Glor hopes to stick it out at least till Friday.
Zirinsky, who praised Glor’s work ethic and willingness to travel at a moment’s notice to cover breaking news, insisted that she had told him from the beginning that she was considering major changes. But Glor was left with the impression that he was very much in the running to keep the anchor chair.
Glor, who was appointed to replace Scott Pelley by Zirinsky’s predecessor, David Rhodes, had been helming the evening newscast for the past year and half.
He had an emotional session earlier Monday afternoon with his CBS Evening News coworkers after flying in from Arizona’s Grand Canyon, where he had been shooting a segment for the show, and rushing into the newscast’s offices on West 57th Street for a delayed staff meeting.
According to a source, Glor apologized for keeping everyone waiting, said he was “grateful for the amazing team” he‘d had the privilege of working with, and choked up.
During the meeting, Glor made sure to wish the “the best of luck” to his replacement, O’Donnell; on Monday’s installment of CBS This Morning , however while King and Dickerson had praised Glor’s journalism and stewardship of the newscast, O’Donnell didn’t speak his name.
“I will be fine, you will be fine,” Glor reassured his apprehensive colleagues.
“I apologize for looking like shit,” he joked to the staff after his long plane ride, adding that he had to go “freshen up” for Monday night’s show.
In the fall, O’Donnell is planning to relocate from New York to anchor the CBS Evening News from her old stomping grounds of Washington, D.C., where she spent years as a White House and Capitol Hill correspondent and her husband, Geoff Tracy, owns a restaurant chain.
O’Donnell will also receive the title of chief political anchor. “The truth is that Washington is the center of gravity for everything that’s happening, almost everything that impacts everyone in the country and everyone in the world…and by taking the show and moving it there we will be holding the government accountable”
“I felt we needed a game change on the Evening News , and the idea of moving the show to Washington was my first thought,” Zirinsky told The Daily Beast. “I’m very close to [retired CBS veteran and former Face the Nation and Evening News anchor] Bob Schieffer, and we just talked about it…I was very sensitive that this not be [about] an insular Washington, but the truth is that Washington is the center of gravity for everything that’s happening, almost everything that impacts everyone in the country and everyone in the world…and by taking the show and moving it there we will be holding the government accountable.”
Zirinsky said that once she decided to move the evening newscast to the nation’s capital—with a bifurcated staff that straddles Washington and New York—O’Donnell was her first choice to be anchor and managing editor.
“She’s covered the White House, she’s covered Capitol Hill, she’s covered six campaigns. It felt like she was the right person. She has a big brain.”
Zirinsky, named the first woman to run CBS News at moment when the network has been plagued by embarrassing publicity concerning an allegedly pervasive corporate culture of sexual harassment and discrimination, insisted O’Donnell’s gender was not a factor in her promotion.
“We put the right person in the job,” she said. “It wasn’t an agenda item.”
Zirinsky said she considers the Washington move a “long-term,” not a temporary, change; so far staffers, especially the production crew, are in the dark concerning how they will be affected by the geographical shift. It will be a massive departure from a nearly six decades of tradition in which the CBS Evening News and the other two broadcast networks’ weeknight newscasts have always been anchored from New York.
Zirinsky, who only since March 1 has been running the network news division where she began her storied broadcast career 47 years ago as a weekend production assistant in the CBS Washington bureau, declined to discuss what, by most accounts, is the near-doubling of King’s salary—an increase to somewhere reportedly in the $11 million range—with O’Donnell’s pay raise, after her reported demand for “Gayle money,” supposedly a close second.
“I’m not going anywhere near that question,” Zirinsky said when asked about the salary speculation. While CBS News traditionally has paid its top talent significantly less than the star salaries at ABC and NBC, “I have had great support from [CBS Corp.’s acting chief executive] Joe Ianiello, [who replaced alleged sexual harasser Leslie Moonves] and it’s interesting, in this company, they really feel that CBS News is the jewel in the crown of the network as a whole,” Zirinsky added.
Former Face the Nation anchor Dickerson will, as well as joining 60 Minutes , play a role in the network’s political and 2020 campaign coverage. “John Dickerson is a writer. He is a thoughtful guy…60 Minutes is such a good fit, and his political acumen on all our election specials”
Meanwhile, longtime CBS News veteran Anthony Mason and newcomer Tony Dokoupil will slip into the co-host chairs previously occupied by O’Donnell and Dickerson beginning on May 20.
Zirinsky acknowledged that Dickerson, who had been gaining traction and making news as anchor of Face the Nation , seemed less than effective on the weekday morning show, but predicted he would do well at 60 Minutes .
“John Dickerson is a writer. He is a thoughtful guy… 60 Minutes is such a good fit, and his political acumen on all our election specials…will be phenomenal,” she said. Calling Dickerson a “political guru,” Zirinsky added: “We really felt he didn’t get that chance on CBS This Morning .”
As for Tony Dokoupil, Zirinsky praised his “authenticity,” and extolled Anthony Mason’s versatility and “magical chemistry” with the 64-year-old King."

Seth Meyers on Why Trump Fears Robert Mueller’s Congressional Testimony If the president believes Robert Mueller ‘totally exonerated’ him, why is he so scared of what he might tell Congress? 'Late Night' host Seth Meyers on why Trump fears Robert Mueller's congressional testimony. NBC
During his latest “A Closer Look” segment Monday night, Seth Meyers expressed disbelief that President Donald Trump decided to have a friendly, hour-long phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin this past week in the midst of an “unprecedented stand-off with Congress” over his administration’s handling of the Mueller report.
But the Late Night host was equally concerned with Trump’s revelation that Putin “sort of smiled” when he agreed with the president that there was “no collusion.”
“How did you know he was smiling?” Meyers asked Trump. “Did you try to call him and accidentally hit the FaceTime button, grandpa?”
“Now, given that Trump and his attorney general William Barr have repeatedly lied about the Mueller report, Democrats in the House have asked for Mueller himself to come testify,” the host added. “So naturally, Trump freaked out on Twitter.”
After quoting the Sunday afternoon tweets in which the president wondered aloud if Democrats are “looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion,” Meyers first mocked Trump for somehow seeming “100 years old and seven years old at the same time.”
“Second, I thought you said Mueller exonerated you, why don’t you want him to testify?” he said, adding, as Trump, “‘I’m afraid he’ll make me look too innocent. I have to maintain some of my criminal mystique.’”"

Tarpley Hitt 05.06.19 9:49 PM ET
T he bulk of Monday, April 28, 2008, passed rather unremarkably for Michelle Murphy. The 26-year-old Santa Monica resident woke up beside her boyfriend of two months in the apartment she shared with a roommate. She left for work at 8 a.m. and returned around 6:45 p.m. She washed her bedsheets. She went out for a mani-pedi, saw the shop was closed, and walked straight home. She jumped rope and ran sprints in the alleyway behind her apartment. She showered, ate dinner, watched TV, and went to bed around 10:30. She woke up less than an hour later with a thin man straddling her in bed, stabbing her in the chest, shoulder and arm.
Monday morning, eleven years and eight days after the attack, Murphy took the witness stand at a courthouse in Downtown Los Angeles. Now 36, with her brown hair cut to her shoulders, Murphy had come to testify in the trial of 43-year-old Michael Gargiulo, the so-called “Hollywood Ripper,” who authorities believe murdered three women between 1993 and 2008 and staged the attack that left Murphy with stitches on eight parts of her right arm and permanent nerve damage in her hand. Murphy’s testimony was the first in a list of more than 250 possible witness—including actor Ashton Kutcher, who dated one of the victims back in 2001—for a trial expected to last as long as six months.
“I woke up with someone on top of me, stabbing my arm,” she told the jury on Monday. “I could tell it was a knife. I thought it was serrated. I grabbed at the knife...with both hands. I wrapped my hands around the blade...I was trying to hold the knife and get some leverage to stop him from stabbing me. I was still being stabbed. I was just trying to wiggle around to keep from getting hit.”
The night she was stabbed, Murphy’s roommate had been gone for several days, visiting family in Poland. Her boyfriend was at his house. It was hot, so she slept without pajamas. She left the fan on and the window open—that was how the assailant slipped in, climbing up from the alleyway and cutting the screen. Murphy said she struggled during the attack, grabbing onto the blade, and pulling her legs up to her chest to kick off the attacker. She said she was screaming, and asking over and over “why he was doing this.” The assailant did not answer her, she said.
When Murphy kicked him onto the floor, the intruder leapt up and ran out of the room, down the hall, and toward the front door. Murphy ran after him, dripping blood over her sheets, comforter, and wall-to-wall carpeting. When she reached the living room, the attacker spoke for the first time. “I’m sorry,” Murphy recalled him saying. “I’m sorry.
Gargiulo has pleaded not guilty to two charges of homicide and one charge of attempted murder in California. Following the trial, he will be extradited to Illinois for a third murder charge. Attorneys for the District Attorney’s Office have said that, if convicted, they will pursue the death penalty, despite the fact that California governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order in March placing a moratorium on capital punishment. California has not executed an inmate since 2006, but the state voted against abolishing it as recently as three years ago, and prosecutors have continued to request it, growing their death row population to 737 prisoners.
An air-conditioner repairman whom prosecutors have dubbed a “serial sexual-thrill killer,” Gargiulo allegedly moved around the country, targeting his young, female neighbors. In court documents, prosecutors claim the pattern began back in 1993, when a 17-year-old Gargiulo lived in a suburb of Chicago. At the time, he was friends with the brother of Tricia Pacaccio, an 18-year-old girl who had recently graduated from high school and was preparing to matriculate at Purdue University on an engineering scholarship. At 1 a.m. one night, Pacaccio had dropped a friend off at home, before continuing to her own house. Her father found her on their stoop the next morning, with stab wounds on her shoulder, neck and chest. “ But when Kutcher came to pick her up, he told investigators, Ellerin had not come to the door. ”
The case remained unsolved nearly eight years later, when one of Gargiulo’s neighbors, Ashley Ellerin, a 22-year-old fashion student and stripper, was found in her apartment with 47 stab wounds to the throat. The manic attack had nearly separated her head from her body. Ellerin had made plans that night to go to a Grammy Awards after party with Ashton Kutcher—then at the height of his That ‘70’s Show fame—whom she had been seeing at the time. But when Kutcher came to pick her up, he told investigators, Ellerin had not come to the door.
Both cases remained unsolved four years later, when Gargiulo moved to an apartment in El Monte, California. In 2005, his neighbor, 32-year-old Maria Bruno, was attacked in her home as she slept. Police found her “quite literally butchered,” with stab wounds to the throat much like Ellerin’s. Bruno’s breasts had been cut off and left in the room with her body. During the investigation of Bruno’s murder, detectives found a blue surgical bootie with samples of Bruno’s DNA. They later found similar booties in Gargiulo’s apartment.
In court Monday morning, another witness named Gustavo Bone, Gargiulo’s business partner and the founder of a company called Gus the Plumber, said that these booties were part of the company’s standard uniform when working in someone’s home.
Bone began working with Gargiulo in 2006, after interacting with him in the L.A. home repairs circuit for several years. Bone’s plumbing business had not done any heating or air-conditioning work, and he saw the partnership as a good way to expand the business. “He was very professional,” Bone said of Gargiulo. “I was happy with him. He was well-groomed.”
Meanwhile, Murphy told the jury Monday that, in the months before the final alleged attack, she occasionally saw Gargiulo in the shared alleyway where they parked their cars. She drove a dark Mazda Protegé; he drove a white conversion van with a large business decal reading: “Gus The Plumber.” Gargiulo would wave at her from the driver’s seat, Murphy said. He did this as many as 10 times—possibly more than 20—but they never interacted in any other context.
In court, prosecutors played a recording of an emergency dispatcher returning Murphy’s 9-1-1 call that night. At 11:46 p.m., Murphy answered the phone in tears. “I was asleep,” she said. “All I know is that they were tall. I think they had a hoodie…He was standing in the dark. He had on pants…He was probably maybe at the most 5’11, and thin. He broke into my window. He broke the screen…I saw his back, that’s all I saw.” The dispatcher asked if she could walk to the door; the police had arrived. “Give me a sec,” she said, unlatching the door to the officers outside. “ Help .”
The night of the attack Murphy also called her boyfriend, Vincent—now her husband—who testified after her on Monday. “I would describe her as hysterical,” he told the jury. “I recall her telling me that she had woken up to someone on top of her, that she was able to force him off, that he had run out…I remember telling her to call 9-1-1 and exit the apartment and go to Wilshire Boulevard. At the time, I thought it was a highly-trafficked area and there would be people on the street. I hung up and got in my car driving towards her.” Later, Vincent would pick Gargiulo and another man out of six suspect photos, saying the repairman looked familiar, although he couldn’t say how.
Murphy’s roommate, Olga Denirjian, another witness on Monday, told the jury she saw the same six photos, but could not recognize any of the men. Olga, notably, rarely frequented the alley behind the apartment that the girls shared with Gargiulo. Unlike Murphy, who kept a parking space there, Denirjian usually parked her car out front. Denirjian told the court that she had not heard of the attacks until days after the fact, when she returned from Poland. Neither girl spent the night in their apartment ever again."
