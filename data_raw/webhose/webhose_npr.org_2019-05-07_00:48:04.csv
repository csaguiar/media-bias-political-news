Severe weather that moved across the southern U.S. on Saturday left at least eight people dead, injured dozens of others and ravaged numerous homes in its path.
Two children, ages 3 and 8, were killed in eastern Texas when a tree fell on the car in which they were traveling. Angelina County Sheriff Greg Sanches said in a statement that the children, who were in the car with their parents during the storm, were pronounced dead on the scene.
""They were at the wrong place at the wrong time,"" Capt. Alton Lenderman of the Angelina County Sheriff's Office told The New York Times. ""The tree fell just as they were going under it.""
In central Texas, approximately a dozen people were injured in Franklin where a tornado was confirmed by the National Weather Service, according to The Dallas Morning News.
In a preliminary damage report, the National Weather Service assigned the tornado an EF-3 rating, saying peak winds reached around 140 mph in Franklin.
About 100 miles northeast of Franklin, at least one suspected tornado swept through an outdoor event at the Caddo Mounds State Historic Site. Cherokee County Judge Chris Davis said one woman died of critical injuries, according to The Associated Press , which reports about two dozen additional injuries there.
The sheriffs office from nearby Houston County told KLTV that one woman was found dead near her home on Highway 21 West.
Video from the area showed damage to houses with roofs ripped off.

World War II pilot Dick Cole, the last surviving member of the Doolittle Raid, died last week at age 103.
Cole was renowned aviation pioneer Jimmy Doolittle's co-pilot in April 1942 on what was regarded as a suicide mission – the first counterattack against the Japanese mainland after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The raid caused Japan to contract its forces and start a battle with the United States over Midway Atoll, a small ring shaped island between North America and Asia. This battle, which the U.S. won, shifted the tide of the war into America's favor.
A memorial service for Cole will be held at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas on April, 18 — exactly 77 years after the raid occurred.

Dick Cole after one of his interviews with author Laura Hillenbrand in September 2018. Courtesy of David Mackintosh
Laura Hillenbrand, the author of Seabiscuit and Unbroken , knew Cole and wanted to write a book about him.
""[the pilots] were very likely to die ... and everyone had the opportunity to back out. Not a single man did,"" including Cole, Hillenbrand told NPR's Scott Simon for Weekend Edition . Interview Highlights
On why the mission was so dangerous
The United States was really knocked back by Pearl Harbor. And after that, the Japanese were just on a winning streak. And the United States could do nothing about it because they had no land base from which to launch bombers and go after Japan. And they had what I think is kind of an insane idea, which is they were going to take 16 B-25s, which are medium-sized bombers. They were going to hoist them onto the carrier Hornet, sail it out off the Japanese coast and launch them ... They had a plan that was going to take the planes over Japan, bomb Japan and then head on to friendly bases in China. And Japanese boats spotted their task force way early. They had to launch right at that moment. And they did. And the men knew they did not have enough fuel to make it.
On what happened to Lt. Col. Dick Cole during the mission
They flew over Japan, and they looked down. Cole remembered seeing people waving up and smiling at them as they flew over. They thought they were friendly planes ... They headed out over the China Sea, and they started to run out of fuel. And a tail wind caught them and carried them over the Chinese coast. And then their fuel ran out in the darkness in a wild thunderstorm over the mountains of China. And Cole had to jump out of the plane. He had never even practiced parachuting. He'd had no training at all. And he just dove out of the plane headfirst.
He walked for a day, and he found a building with a nationalist Chinese flag hanging over it. And a soldier was there — a Chinese soldier — and invited him in. And, the man took him to a dark room, and there was Jimmy Doolittle ... And from then, it was a race to get out of where they were because the Japanese were hunting them.
On why the mission was a success
The Japanese were so confident that they were spreading out over the globe and not concentrating their forces. And when this raid happened, that terrified them. And they contracted their forces. And they decided to take aim for Midway Atoll, which, if they could claim it, would give them a land base, making America more vulnerable and making themselves safer. And essentially, the raid lured them into that. We had the Battle of Midway. The United States won it triumphantly. And it turned the course of the war. So these guys - these 80 men on 16 planes - turned the course of history with that little raid.
On Cole's life after the war
He was a - kind of an institution at the Doolittle Raider reunions that were held every year. And they had a tradition there. The city of Tucson had made up 80 silver goblets inscribed with the names of the 80 men from the raid. And the names were written on one side right-side up and another side upside down. And each year, the men would privately gather and drink brandy in a toast to whoever had passed away the previous year. And then that man's goblet would be turned upside down. And there was one goblet that was still upright. And it actually still is now. But there's going to be a ceremony to turn over the very last one because they're all gone now.

The toll of chronic stress isn't limited to emotional suffering. High stress can set the stage for heart disease.
In fact, research shows that those of us who perceive a lot of stress in our lives are at higher risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems over the long term.
Shots - Health News This Is Your Stressed-Out Brain On Scarcity The latest evidence comes from a new study of siblings in Sweden. Researchers identified about 137,000 people who had been diagnosed with stress-related disorders; the diagnoses included post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress following a traumatic event, such as the death of a loved one or a violent episode. Then, the researchers identified about 171,000 of their brothers and sisters who had similar upbringings and genes — but no anxiety disorder.
Next, they compared the siblings' rates of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, cardiac arrest and blood clots, over a number of years.
The Swedes who had a stress disorder, it turns out, had significantly higher rates of heart problems compared to their siblings.
""We saw [about] a 60 percent increased risk of having any cardiovascular events"" within the first year after being diagnosed, says researcher Unnur A Valdimarsdóttir of the Karolinska Institute, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Iceland. Over the longer term, the increased risk was about 30 percent, Valdimarsdóttir says.
Shots - Health News Forest Bathing: A Retreat To Nature Can Boost Immunity And Mood The findings, published in the current issue of the medical journal BMJ , ""are quite consistent with other studies,"" says Simon Bacon of Concordia University, who studies the impact of lifestyle on chronic diseases. He points to other studie s that show depression, anxiety and stress increase the risk of cardiovascular events. He wrote an editorial that is published alongside the study .
So, when is stress just a normal part of life — something we all just need to deal with — and when does it become so problematic that it sets the stage for disease? Part of the answer depends on how we respond to stress, the scientists say, and on our own internal perceptions about how much stress we're feeling.
We've all experienced the fight-or-flight stress response.
""Imagine you're walking down the street and someone jumps out and gives you a scare,"" says Bacon. What happens? Your heart rate increases and your blood pressure climbs. ""You have that immediate activation,"" Bacon says. In the short term, this temporary response is good. It gives you what you need to flee or take action.
The problem comes if you start to experience these stress response ""activations"" even when there's not an imminent threat.
""When people have stress disorders, these systems are being activated at all the wrong times,"" Bacon says. For instance, with PTSD, ""you can get very exaggerated stress responses just thinking about something that happened.""
Shots - Health News Dialing Back Stress With A Bubble Bath, Beach Trip And Bees People who experience chronic stress seem to be at highest risk of health problems.
""Over the long term, repeated, persistent [stress] responses will activate the immune system and contribute to inflammation,"" says Dr. Ernesto Schiffrin , a physician and professor of medicine at McGill University. He says inflammation can set the stage for atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries . Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood to your heart and body. When the arteries narrow, this limits blood flow — increasing the likelihood of a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event.
Since we can't wave a magic wand and make stress disappear, what are the best coping options? There's no magic bullet, but day-to-day habits can help tamp down stress.
Schiffrin says he gives his patients this advice: Eat in a healthy way, attempt to have good relationships, have a good attitude, spend time in nature, and exercise. ""I think exercise is critical,"" Schiffrin says.
Let's take a closer look at each of these.
Exercise: When researchers analyzed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data from more than a million adults in the U.S., they found that people who exercised reported fewer days of bad mental health compared to those who didn't exercise. And, as we've reported , there was an extra 'boost' in mental health linked to playing team sports. But whether you choose a simple walk, forest-bathing , or a group activity, who doesn't feel a little better after moving their body? Cultivate friendships: Loneliness is an epidemic . And, as we've reported, a recent survey found 2 in 5 respondents reported lacking companionship or said they felt isolated from others. Yet, spending time with friends can really boost our mood. No matter your stage of life, signing up for a group activity or volunteering are good options for getting and staying engaged in the community around you. Learn meditation or relaxation techniques: Mindfulness meditation has been shown to tamp down the stress response and even help reduce blood pressure among people who can maintain the habit. As we've reported , one study found that meditation helped 40 out of 60 patients reduce their blood pressure enough to reduce some of their medications. Eat well: There is indeed a link between food and mood. As we've reported , a diet full of refined carbohydrates and sugar (the sort you'll find in packaged snacks and sodas) can lead to a metabolic roller coaster that can influence your mood, too. On the other hand, a Mediterranean-style diet — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fish — can leave you feeling nourished. Seek help for anxiety disorders: These day-to-day habits may help reduce the amount of stress you feel, but for people with stress disorders such as PTSD, it may be best to reach out to a professional for help. ""People should treat their mental health issues,"" says Bacon. You don't have to ""grin and bear it."" Mental health professionals have lots of tools. ""You don't want to put yourself in a position where you could make your health worse by not doing anything,"" Bacon says."

Trump Administration Considers Transferring Immigrants to 'Sanctuary Cities' : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304646/trump-administration-considers-transferring-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities,"Trump Administration Considers Transferring Immigrants to 'Sanctuary Cities' Trump Administration Considers Transferring Immigrants to 'Sanctuary Cities' 6:57 Embed Embed
Hogan Gidley, White House principal deputy press secretary, talks with NPR's Michel Martin about President Trump's proposal to relocate detained migrants to so-called sanctuary cities.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to start the program with the latest on an idea apparently being considered by the White House - to transfer detained asylum seekers and other would-be immigrants in so-called sanctuary cities. Several news organizations had reported last week that the idea had been floated within the Trump administration and then rejected. But on Friday, the president told reporters he is actually considering this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We might as well do what they always say they want. We'll bring the illegal - really, you call them the illegals. I call them the illegals. They came across the border illegally. We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it.
MARTIN: White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is here with us now to tell us more.
Mr. Gidley, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
HOGAN GIDLEY: Thank you so much. It's great to be with you.
MARTIN: As I indicated, the White House has had several conflicting statements about this when it was first reported. The White House in a statement knocked it down. Then the president on Friday said what we just heard him say. And then Sarah Sanders this morning said that this is a real proposal. What changed from Thursday night, when the White House said that this proposal was dead, to Friday, when the president said that it isn't? What happened?
GIDLEY: Well, we had looked at it before, and obviously, there were some challenges we faced that prevented us from moving forward on any real steps to make this happen. And then the president actually came to us and said, listen - I think this is a really good idea. We already have so many people pouring into this country in record-setting numbers - 100,000-plus just last month alone. And the problem is Democrats won't work with us to fix the current laws. And so they tell us, you cannot keep family units detained. You cannot keep family units - or they don't want us to keep family units on the Mexico side of the border while they await their day in court.
And you can't detain them here. So if you can't deport them, and you can't detain them, the only option is to release them. The problem is we consistently release these family units in the same communities - into San Diego, San Antonio, Yuma, Phoenix, El Paso, all along the southern border. And they should not be forced to bear the brunt of policies that they have no control over.
MARTIN: OK...
GIDLEY: So we looked at it and said, where are the logical places to spread the wealth, if you will? And places like San Francisco, for example, or a sanctuary city - they are designed and set up specifically to have people there who aren't here legally. That's what their stated goal is. So there's no reason we shouldn't be looking at a...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...Way to give them exactly what they want.
MARTIN: You mentioned impediments or obstacles. I'm not quite sure what the word you just used was. But it's been reported that the Cabinet-level agency which would be responsible for implementing this has had its own legal counsel reject this for legal reasons. He said it's illegal specifically to transfer people into specific areas for political retribution. On what legal grounds does the White House believe you can transfer people to specific areas of the country in order to retaliate against their political leadership?
GIDLEY: Well, wait a second. (Laughter) I just got through telling you that's completely a false premise. First of all, we already send them to specific places. The problem is we send them to the same specific places repeatedly. So you've got to spread it out a little bit. It's not political retribution. If anything, you should consider it on the Democrat side to be an olive branch. You've asked us to work with you on some things we've put forth, time after time, solution after solution. They will not come to the table.
So the logical answer is to give them something they want. Democrats say that if you even think about rejecting people into this country illegally that you are somehow racist. So the question then becomes, do Democrats want to allow these people to be shipped into their communities? That's what they said they wanted. It's not political retribution. It's a solution to a problem we face along the southern border.
MARTIN: Who are these entities who are specifically saying that we would like you to move these immigrant families or would-be immigrant families or would-be asylum seekers elsewhere? Who are these entities who are saying that to you?
GIDLEY: Sure...
MARTIN: Because we are getting different information from different political leaders. So who exactly is telling you that this is what they think the administration should do?
GIDLEY: Our contention is the conversations we have on the same towns along the southern border, as I just mentioned. NGOs, non-government organizations, are telling us they don't have enough resources to actually address the people that are being influxed (ph) into these communities. Democrats won't give us enough money to keep them along the border in detention facilities, won't give us enough ICE beds, won't give the resources we need to house them down along the southern border.
So the only thing remains is to send them into other locations across the country who are, again, specifically designed to handle it. It shouldn't be political retribution or considered such. What it should be is the Democrats beating down the gates at the White House trying to get in here to say, thank you, Mr. President. We have long said these people deserve the right to be here even though they're here illegally.
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: And anybody who disagrees is a racist. We want them in our communities. We've said so.
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: How do we work with the administration...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...To make sure they are transported safely into these sanctuary cities?
MARTIN: Two more questions for you. There is a bipartisan proposal, which was proposed by Xochitl Small Torres (ph), who represents New Mexico, and Dan Crenshaw, who's a freshman from Texas, and Will Hurd, who is a veteran from Texas. He's also the only Republican currently representing a border district. They have a bipartisan proposal which would offer a different option - which would offer additional support to border agents at the border, additional judges, additional immigration judges to process these asylum seekers and so forth. Is the White House considering this proposal - which is bipartisan, as we said?
GIDLEY: We are considering all proposals that would work to alleviate this problem, especially ones that are bipartisan, as you mentioned. I can't speak directly to that particular piece of legislation as I've not seen it, and I don't know exactly if we've taken a stand one way or the other. But until they pass something like that, these are all hypotheticals. Anybody who's willing to come forth and present a solution to the problem, we're happy to sit down and listen.
MARTIN: And before we let you go, I think many people might wonder why, when the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House for the first two years of this administration, if this is as significant a crisis as the White House says it is, why the issue wasn't addressed then legislatively.
GIDLEY: Yeah, that's a great question you'd have to ask Republicans. Don't think they're unscathed here for what they didn't accomplish. There's no doubt. Now, part of that is, as you know, the political realities exist that we didn't have a filibuster-proof Senate. So we could have gotten some of these things through had they gone nuclear. Obviously, that's something that Leader McConnell didn't want to do. But the fact is, they should have done a lot more.
But that's in the past. What we have now is a Democrat-controlled House, and they've got to work with us if they say they want to protect the American people. They voted for border walls and barriers in the past. They voted for measures along the southern border to give them resources...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...In the past. Even Barack Obama in 2014 called this a crisis from the Rose Garden. It's only gotten...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...Worse. So it's time to get some solutions out there so we can protect the American people.
MARTIN: That was Hogan Gidley, deputy White House press secretary.
Mr. Gidley, thank you so much for speaking to us.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says he will visit Seoul ""in the near future,"" amid an ongoing summit with South Korea's Moon Jae-in in which he also renewed pledges to shut down a primary missile launch site and a key nuclear weapons complex if the U.S. takes ""corresponding"" measures.
Kim's remarks about traveling to Seoul were made during a news conference in Pyongyang with the South Korean president. It would be the first-ever visit to the South Korean capital by a North Korean head of state.
In their third summit, Kim and Moon also laid out plans to draw down forces along their heavily fortified border and announced an agreement for their athletes to compete as a single team at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and to submit a joint bid to host the games in 2032.

In addition, the two leaders agreed that before the end of the year, they would participate in groundbreaking ceremonies to link railways along the east and west coasts of the Korean peninsula.
Moon said that the two sides agreed that the Koreas should become a ""land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats."" Kim called the agreement ""a leap forward"" toward peace between the two historically bitter rivals. In A Break From Recent Precedent, North Korean Anniversary Parade Features No ICBMs
In it, defense chiefs from Pyongyang and Seoul said they would establish ""buffer zones"" between their land and maritime borders to reduce the possibility of accidental military clashes. They also agreed to withdraw 11 guard posts from the Demilitarized Zone along the 38th parallel that acts as the de facto border between the two sides, who remain technically at war more than six decades after the Korean conflict ended without a peace treaty. Opinion: Moon Jae-In Can Put U.S.-North Korea Negotiations Back On Track. Here's How
North Korea would also shut down its Dongchang-ri missile engine testing and launch facility and allow the process to be monitored by international observers.
The North promised to dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear weapons facility as far back as 2007 and the significance of shuttering the two facilities is not clear. The North has demonstrated a capability for using mobile launchers to fire its ballistic missiles and some observers believe Pyongyang maintains secret nuclear facilities in addition to Yongbyon. Kim Hosts South Korea's Moon For Summit Talks In Pyongyang
Although it was not clear what ""corresponding"" U.S. steps North Korea expected as a condition to make good on the promise to shut down Yongbyon, President Trump, in a tweet just after midnight, appeared to deem the summit a success, calling it ""Very exciting!"" Kim Jong Un has agreed to allow Nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations, and to permanently dismantle a test site and launch pad in the presence of international experts. In the meantime there will be no Rocket or Nuclear testing. Hero remains to continue being — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2018 ....returned home to the United States. Also, North and South Korea will file a joint bid to host the 2032 Olympics. Very exciting! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2018
Even so, lasting rapprochement between the two Koreas has proved elusive in the past, with hopes for peace degenerating into renewed recriminations and saber rattling following two previous summits in 2000 and 2007.
Although Trump has remained optimistic about improved relations between Washington and Pyongyang, the initial euphoria following the Singapore summit in June — after which the president declared that North Korea was ""no longer a nuclear threat"" — quickly wore off. Follow-up meetings between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials failed to produce concrete results, and Pyongyang quickly returned to its bombastic anti-American rhetoric.
As The Associated Press notes of the agreement, ""... while containing several tantalizing offers, it appears to fall short of the major steps many in Washington had been looking for — such as a commitment by Pyongyang to provide a list of the North's nuclear facilities, a solid step-by-step timeline or an agreement to allow international inspectors in to assess progress or discover violations.""
Moon on Wednesday acknowledged, ""there will be challenges and trials, but the more we overcome them the stronger we will become.""
""We are not afraid of future challenges,"" he said.
Harry Kazianis , director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest in Washington, tells NPR that keeping the lines of communication open between North and South is paramount.
""If we are going to have change in the Korean Peninsula, if we're not going to have a war, you need to have some sort of political framework where all sides will keep talking,"" Kazianis says.
In a reference to some of Trump's harshest threats against the North before tensions finally eased, Kazianis says as long as dialogue continues, ""if there are rough patches, if there are problems, we can talk our way through and not go back to fire and fury."""
Playwright Suzan-Lori Parks Handles Heavy Themes In Racial Drama 'White Noise',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304695/playwright-suzan-lori-parks-handles-heavy-themes-in-racial-drama-white-noise,"Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks is back with a new controversial play that centers on a group of four interracial friends who get caught up in a contract that gets out of hand.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
And finally today, playwright Suzan-Lori Parks. She's one of the most productive and acclaimed people working in theater today, and she's known for pulling off remarkable feats like writing 365 plays in 365 days or finding humor and tragedy in a play about a black Lincoln impersonator who works in whiteface - that's ""Topdog/Underdog"" - for which she won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize.
Now she's back with a new play, and it's another high-wire act. It's called ""White Noise,"" and it focuses on a group of four people who've been friends since college. Misha is a black rising YouTube star who's decided to make blaxplaining (ph) to white people her thing. Ralph, Misha's boyfriend, is a white university professor with a trust fund. Dawn is a white lawyer with social justice on her mind, and she's dating Leo, a black artist who's been suffering with insomnia since childhood.
And yes, race does matter because in the beginning of ""White Noise"" we learn that Leo's insomnia keeps him up at night, so sometimes he walks. And late one night while walking, he's attacked by police. And that incident causes him to come up with an outrageous plan. And Suzan-Lori Parks is with us now from New York.
Thank you so much for being with us.
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: Thanks for having me on the show - so exciting (laughter).
MARTIN: And I just have to say that, you know, one of the pleasures of seeing a play early on is that you don't know anything about it. You can just walk in without knowing anything, and then your mind is blown. And I just have to say that there's - I feel badly, but there's no way to talk about this play without one spoiler.
PARKS: Yeah, sure.
MARTIN: So if you're listening, and you don't want to know, now's the time to get a cup of tea. Having said that, do you want to tell what the outrageous plan is?
PARKS: Yeah. So his outrageous plan, right - and it's - well, that's the whole thing about spoilers. But it's like ""Oedipus."" You know, we all know what happens. It's how it happens and why that hopefully will continue to be interesting even after we learn that - yeah, so Leo's outrageous plan, his far-out idea - he wants to feel safe, protected and respected, and he's really run out of options.
And so he lands on this idea that he will voluntarily enslave himself to his best friend Ralph for a period of 40 days. And he will just do basically what turns out to be a 40-day internal meditation on a theme. He says he will go to a, quote-unquote, ""low place."" And after that, hopefully, he will be truly free. And that's his plan.
MARTIN: And it's crazy (laughter). And...
PARKS: Yeah, it's...
MARTIN: So...
PARKS: ...Cray-cray (ph). It's - yeah.
MARTIN: Yes.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: So Leo is played wonderfully by Daveed Diggs.
PARKS: Yes.
MARTIN: And people probably know Diggs best for his dual role as Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson in ""Hamilton.""
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: Let me play - this is the one clip I'm going to play...
PARKS: Oh, cool.
MARTIN: ...Which Leo is trying to explain how he came up with this plan. And I'm going to warn people here that there's language that some might find offensive. And here it is.
(SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, ""WHITE NOISE"")
DAVEED DIGGS: (As Leo) Back in the day, a guy like me would be walking someplace, and he would get stopped by the law, some law enforcement individual. And there would be a whose nigger are you, nigger moment. And a guy like me would be, like, I belong to Mr. So-and-so. And the law would be, like, oh, if you are master so-and-so's property, then you cool with us, and go on ahead with your black self. And a guy like me would go on because he was owned - because the brother was the property of the man. He was safe because he was...
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Don't say it.
THOMAS SADOSKI: (As Ralph) A slave.
DIGGS: (As Leo) Bingo.
MARTIN: OK. How on earth...
PARKS: How on earth...
MARTIN: ...Did this come to you?
PARKS: Well, it was - it's very simple. You see, there was this play in 2014 called ""Father Comes Home From The Wars."" Yeah. And I wrote it. So I was sitting in the Anspacher, the very theater where we are world premiering ""White Noise."" And there is a moment in that play, the ""Father Comes Home From The Wars"" play, which takes place in the 1860's in America where the main character, Hero, is imagining the future. And he's trying to imagine what it's going to be like to be free.
And if he is free - if I'm free, I think he says - I'm paraphrasing - you know, and I'm walking down the street, say I'm coming home from work, and I got stopped by the patrollers, and they'll say, who do you belong to? And I'll say, well, I belong to myself. And he wonders if that will be enough for them to - the patrollers to let him, you know, go on home. And his friend that he's talking to, Smith, doesn't know if that's going to be enough to have him feel safe, protected and respected.
And so watching that moment in the play night after night after night in 2014, I said, oh, wow. I'm going to write a play about the future. And I started writing ""White Noise"" from there.
MARTIN: Wow. That - first of all, there's so many difficult ideas in this. I don't want to give it away because it's both fascinating and cringe-inducing. I mean, it's like this real-life, real-time experiment.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: And one of the things that's both fascinating and cringe-inducing - there's so many things - but how quickly Ralph takes to the role...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...Of being Leo's master.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: What are some of the things that fascinated you?
PARKS: Well, one of the things that I hold dear and that I told the actors and I tell them every day - but I told them on the first day of rehearsal, and I just wanted them to know how much I love deeply each of the characters and how the world that they live in, the world which is much like the world we live in today - the world has pushed each of these four characters into a corner - into an opposing corner, if you will. And I want them to work through their stuff. And for me, that's one of the most important things about the play.
And it surprises me, I guess, how during the rehearsal process, which was very deep and intense but without unnecessary drama. And we had some intense discussions about who we are and race and privilege and what does that mean. And a lot of times, it wasn't easy. But we had them. We had to.
MARTIN: You know, other things that fascinated me - I was looking back over some of the reviews and interviews that you've done over the years. One of the things that fascinated me was how many of the things that you wrote about in prior plays that people felt were just crazy or outrageous or over-the-top have now become...
PARKS: (Laughter).
MARTIN: ...True. Like, for example, in ""Topdog/Underdog""...
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...It was a - you know, one of - it's a two-character play, and one of the characters is a Lincoln impersonator, but he's performed...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...By an African-American actor who performs in whiteface.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: And, lo and behold...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: Here we are...
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...All these years later. We're having this huge political scandal in Virginia because white politicians were...
PARKS: Oh, yeah.
MARTIN: ...Understood to be wearing blackface.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: And I just wonder, how is this for you? I don't know if you read the reviews, but to have...
PARKS: Well...
MARTIN: ...Things that you've written about, people think, oh, that's crazy. That would never happen. And then...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...It is happening.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: I'm just wondering if you're having a moment. Or what do you...
PARKS: (Laughter) I'm having - at every moment, I have a moment. You know what I'm saying? (Laughter) I mean, it's like - I feel that if we listen deeply, we are going to see what's going on. What's going on is what has been going on for a long time. So it's not about, like, prophecy or anything. It's just watching and listening and paying attention - you know, things that we're encouraged to do. But there's also humor. I mean, I have to tell you...
MARTIN: It's true.
PARKS: The names of the four characters - it's Leo, Misha, Ralph and Dawn. So if you've heard of the ""Ninja Turtles"" - you know, the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""...
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: ...So Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael. So there I - That's where I got their names from. So my son loves the ""Ninja Turtles,"" right? So he has the ""Ninja Turtle"" figurines. And I'm, like, that's the name of the characters from my play.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: And I start laughing so hard, he's, like, mommy, why are you laughing? And my husband goes, because you're about to go down deep.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: And I'm, like, yeah. That's what I do. Before you take a dive down deep, I tell myself a joke. So Act 1 of the play is - of ""White Noise"" is filled with jokes, lots of jokes. And then act two, we go deeper. There's still a lot of jokes in Act 2, but we go deeper. We go deep, deep, deep, walking on the nerve endings of the audience - ow.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: It's - you're laughing. See? It feels good, doesn't it?
MARTIN: Yeah.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: Before I let you go, I want to ask about that James Baldwin quote that you have at the top of the script.
PARKS: Oh, yeah.
MARTIN: You actually had the opportunity to study with him in college.
PARKS: I did.
MARTIN: And...
PARKS: I did. Oh, bless his heart.
MARTIN: And the quote reads, ""not everything can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."" Yeah.
PARKS: Leo quotes that - half-quotes that in the play. He says, like the brother said, nothing can be changed until it's faced. All right. He doesn't quote the first part of the text. So he believes that by continuing to work toward a beautiful solution that that beautiful solution will come to have his own humanity recognized - that that is a possibility. He believes that. And yeah, so do I.
MARTIN: That's Suzan-Lori Parks. Her latest play, ""White Noise,"" is showing at the Public Theater in New York until May.
Suzan-Lori Parks, thank you so much for talking with us.
PARKS: This is awesome. Thank you so much for having me.

#NPRPoetry Month: Lauren Alleyne,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304688/-nprpoetry-month-lauren-alleyne,"It's National Poetry Month, and for our series #NPRPoetry, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with poet Lauren Alleyne. Alleyne combed Twitter for her favorite original poems.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Now it's time for one of our favorite things - poetry. Every year in April, Poetry Month, we ask listeners to share original tweet-length poems. And each week this month, we are reading through your submissions. We've been honored to have a number of award-winning poets combing through submissions with us. And joining us this week is Lauren Alleyne. She is the assistant director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center at James Madison University, where she also teaches English. And she's with us now from Raleigh, N.C. Lauren Alleyne, thank you so much for talking to us.
LAUREN ALLEYNE: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So you've picked some poems that caught your eye. Why don't you read us one?
ALLEYNE: I would love to. I would like to read a poem from Patricia Caspers (ph).
MARTIN: OK.
ALLEYNE: Each breath you wheezed became our rosary. As we carried you across the empty hospital parking lot and I thought about the small mystery inside of you, struggling to hold on to this life, this body machine, it's everything I know of God.
MARTIN: Oh, boy. That kind of packs a punch, doesn't it?
ALLEYNE: It really does.
MARTIN: What struck you about this one?
ALLEYNE: I think that there is some sort of alchemy that happens with, like, the perfect image that captures a perfect moment in the perfect language, right? And so that idea of the body machine that happens at the end and then the surprising turn - it's everything I know of God - I think sort of captures in a way that maybe any other kind of language couldn't that feeling of mystery that is part of what it means to be humans. I just thought it was captured so wonderfully in that poem.
MARTIN: Tell us another one.
ALLEYNE: Absolutely. Let's see. Winter, the woods, my brother running away in moonlight the color of marrow. His 200 and some-odd bones hiding warm beneath his skin, tucked tender in his ears, whole and fresh until those few short sharp last breaths.
MARTIN: And that was by Nancy Stone (ph).
ALLEYNE: Yes.
MARTIN: What struck you about this one?
ALLEYNE: Even in this conversation, I can tell I'm always drawn to the body. And the specificity of the poem and those 200 odd bones, right, the short, sharp breaths. I think, again, the way the language is able to capture that exhaustion, that movement, the dynamism in the language itself, to me, that's the miraculous nature of the poem. And that was captivating for me.
MARTIN: We kind of came up with the tweet-length as a conceit. I mean, you know, who are we kidding? We just, you know, we just made that up just because of the brevity of it. We also thought it would kind of make it fun for people to participate. But what do you think about it? I mean, do you like the brevity of it? Does this appeal to you?
ALLEYNE: I am a fan of form in poetry - fixed forms. I love the sonnet. I love the villanelle. I love the Sistine. I love the Rondel. I love the Bop. All of these, like, rules that help for me make a container that you can pour something that is often bigger than you have words to say, right? And I also just think it's fun. Like, I like games. I like puzzles. I like, you know, systems. And so to me, the character limit is a system. Like, what can you do within this space that makes meaning and that makes beauty? And I think that's just the challenge of any poem, really.
MARTIN: Want me to play one that - we were able to get one of the contributor to record this one for us. This one is by Jay Sturner, and here it is.
JAY STURNER: All the right words have gathered on my tongue to form a parade, but my teeth are the walls, and my fractured ego is the rain.
MARTIN: You picked this one, too, I just want to say.
ALLEYNE: I did.
MARTIN: You know, again, it's the body, but what else did you like about this?
ALLEYNE: One of the things I think that can really, for me, make a poem is when I see the poet in the poem, and the poet in a poem in a way that is vulnerable and human and complicit sometimes. And I think that's the thing I really enjoyed about that poem is that it was really sort of revealing the poet's awareness of his own failure to be better, right? Like, you know, here is a perfect thing to say, but I can't get out of my own way. So I think that idea of being vulnerable, to being wrong in the poem is brave. And I feel like I love to see that bravery show up in a poem.
MARTIN: So how did you start writing poems?
ALLEYNE: I'm from Trinidad. And there's a wonderful song form there, the Calypso. And I used to write Calypsos for my sister. Those were my earliest, earliest poems.
MARTIN: So finally, before we let you go - and thank you again for reading these poems with us this week and enjoying them along with us. Do you have some advice for people who maybe are still a little shy about getting started and putting some thoughts to paper?
ALLEYNE: Absolutely. I think the poem is one of the most democratic forms of art. It's a pencil and paper. And if we enter it as a mode of play and exploration, rather than the production of literature, I think we give ourselves permission to discover. And also, I think be fine with having fun and not producing a New Yorker-worthy NPR-worthy poem, right?
You know, I tell people all the time - it's my students - I'm like, listen, you have a pencil. You have a pen. And you think, I am perfectly equipped to make a perfectly good poem. But you have 10 fingers, and you might walk up to a piano and you don't think you can place Chopin. So, like, allow yourself to play the chopsticks of poetry, right? Just go and write a haiku. And you're just playing in language. And then maybe something comes from that.
MARTIN: That's Lauren Alleyne. She is the assistant director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center and the author of ""Difficult Fruit"" and ""Honeyfish."" And she was kind enough to join us from Raleigh, N.C. Lauren Alleyne, thank you so much for talking with us today.
ALLEYNE: My pleasure.
MARTIN: And if you'd like to hear your original poem on the air, tweet it to @npratc with the hashtag #nprpoetry. Every week, for the rest of the month, a professional poet like Lauren will join us on the air to talk about some submissions that caught his or her eye. Poems must be 140 characters or less.

Understanding Changes To The Tax Code,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304674/understanding-changes-to-the-tax-code,"Understanding Changes To The Tax Code Understanding Changes To The Tax Code Embed Embed
Kay Bell, a writer for the Don't Mess With Taxes blog, talks with NPR's Michel Martin about changes in the tax code this year.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
I sincerely hope this isn't the first time you're hearing this, but the deadline for filing your annual tax return is tomorrow. And this is the first tax season that will be affected by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
With the new changes to the tax code, it feels like we're all first-time filers this year. So to catch up with the changes and what they mean, we've reached out to Kay Bell. She is a financial journalist. And she writes the blog ""Don't Mess With Taxes,"" which she says translates taxes into money saving English. And she's with us now from - where else? - Austin, Texas. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
KAY BELL: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So let's jump in. What is different about taxes this year since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? What will people notice the most?
BELL: The first thing they will notice is there is a new form. Lawmakers promised us a postcard-sized tax return. It's not quite there. It's a little bigger than a regular postcard. But there's only one smaller form now instead of what used to be three forms. The bad thing about that is that in addition to this one smaller form, there are now six different schedules. So depending on what your tax situation is, you might have to file several different forms whereas in the past, maybe you only had one 1040 that you had to deal with.
MARTIN: Who benefits from the not quite a postcard, almost a postcard? And who is subjected to all those different schedules?
BELL: Well, you know, taxes are intensely personal. So you might have to fill out just the small form, whereas if in the past, you used the 1040ez, you'll use the new simple 1040 and be done with it. But if you had income other than W-2 income from an employer - say you had a side job, a gig job driving for one of the car services on the side - you're going to have to fill out one, two, maybe three forms. So it's a little more complicated. But they say it was a tradeoff to get us to a lower tax rate and broader tax - income tax brackets. So most of us end up paying less tax in the end.
MARTIN: Now, you talk with a lot of CPAs for your blog. What are they telling you about what their customers are telling them?
BELL: Well, they have some customers that are not happy that they're not getting as big of a refund as they used to. And there's a long story as to why that happened. Those who file early tend to be people who expect larger refunds. And when that didn't happen this year, we heard about it. You know, they complained loudly and on social media.
And the problem is that when the new tax law went into effect, it changed the withholding, which meant a lot of people - most people - got more money back in their paychecks. Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't notice it or they had other expenses that went up and absorbed this little bit of increase or they just didn't think about it because nobody thinks about taxes really until they get around to filing their return.
In addition to tax refunds being a little bit smaller, we're seeing that people aren't filing as quickly this year. And in fact, the IRS says they expect around almost 15 million people to file for an extension this year. And that's almost 5 million more than usually file for an extension every tax season.
MARTIN: So finally - so I'm guessing because, you know, your Twitter bio says that you are a tax geek, what's it been like for you this last couple of months of tax season? Are your friends and relatives, like, showing up at your house at odd hours with their forms...
BELL: It's been great. I mean...
MARTIN: ...Looking really upset? What's it like for you?
BELL: It's been great. I love it. I mean, taxes are nerve-racking anyway. Then you add change, which any kind of change, even if you want it, is frustrating. So you add those two together, and it can get really hectic. But I've been doing this for a long time. It's fun to see some changes made. And there are some good changes in this tax bill.
But it has been crazy. And people are a little worried. They just want to make sure they understand it, you know? Nobody wants to make the IRS mad. They want to make sure that they are getting all they can out of the new tax laws and that they are getting what they deserve.
MARTIN: That's Kay Bell. She is a journalist. She writes the blog ""Don't Mess With Taxes."" And she was kind of to join us from KUT in Austin, Texas. Kay Bell, thanks so much for talking to us.
BELL: Thank you.

Breaking Down The Hollywood Dispute Between Writers And Agents,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304681/breaking-down-the-hollywood-dispute-between-writers-and-agents,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Kim Masters, editor-at-large for The Hollywood Reporter , about the ongoing dispute between writers and agents.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
And now we turn to Hollywood to check in on the dispute between writers and talent agents. After groups representing both parties failed to reach an employment agreement, the Writers Guild instructed members to cut ties with their agents. That group represents thousands of writers, and the dispute could stall production of scripted TV shows and movies. Here to tell us what this means is Kim Masters. She's an editor at large at The Hollywood Reporter.
Kim Masters, welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again.
KIM MASTERS: My pleasure.
MARTIN: Can you just tell us as briefly as you can how we got to this point?
MASTERS: There has been a process called packaging that goes back more than 40 years. It's become an institution in this industry. And packaging means - this is primarily a thing now with television writers - when an agency puts together elements of a show and sells it to a studio, the studio pays the agency a fee directly. And this has various effects that the writers are now completely fed up with. They argue that the agents who are getting paid by the studios have a conflict because their job is to represent the writer and not make deals for themselves with the studios.
And they say that this causes writers to be underpaid. Oftentimes, writers don't even know that they're part of a package. They say that if you're developing a TV show, these fees that the studio is paying the agencies can cut the budget for your own TV show, diminishing your chances for success, because you can't necessarily hire the actor you want or get the location you want.
MARTIN: I think people could see their point. For example, if you were in a real estate transaction, and if you hired somebody to represent you, to then find out that that person was actually the person selling the house, for example - you would experience that as a conflict. So what do the agents say about that? What has their position been about that?
MASTERS: Well, what the agents give up in this scenario of packaging is you normally would pay a 10 percent commission to your agent for getting you a job, and you don't pay if the packaging fee is involved. So the agents are saying this helps lower-level writers because they can make more money. But the writers argue that this is more than offset by the potential conflicts that these agents have collecting fees from the studios.
And they point out and argue that their compensation has gone down in recent years overall. One of the writers said how he had walked through an art gallery at his agency. These agencies have all of this wealth and accoutrements and try to look very, very successful. But at this point, the writers are looking at all of those signs of success and saying, wasn't some of that money supposed to be mine?
MARTIN: So the Writers Guild leadership wrote to members saying that they are about to enter unchartered waters. What are some of the repercussions of this that we might see? Recognizing I'm asking you to speculate here since - as by definition, it's uncharted - what do you think might happen? What are people concerned about?
MASTERS: Well, guild members as of now are expected to fire their agents. It is pilot season, so the shows are staffing up right now. And what the writers are trying to do is figure out alternate means to communicate about what jobs are available and help people find jobs without involving agents.
MARTIN: Is there any entity or group working to resolve this?
MASTERS: Right now, we are looking at what seems like impasse. These are very divergent interests right now. The agents feel they must produce. They certainly don't want to give up these very, very lucrative packaging fees. Sometimes they make more than the writers from TV shows created by the writers. So this is really kind of an existential struggle, and I'm not sure how I see the way out.
MARTIN: That's Kim Masters, editor at large for The Hollywood Reporter.
Kim, thank you so much for joining us.
MASTERS: Oh, thank you for having me.

AG Barr Prepares To Release Redacted Mueller Report,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304667/ag-barr-prepares-to-release-redacted-mueller-report,"Attorney General William Barr is preparing to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It summarizes years of investigation into 2016 election interference.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Back now to one of the stories that has consumed the nation's capital - the Mueller report. It will soon be here, at least a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It's expected in the next couple of days - that according to Attorney General William Barr.
And while fights over the report probably will continue, the release is the culmination of investigations that go back nearly three years, reaching across continents and into President Trump's inner circle. NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas takes us back to the beginning.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: The investigation began in late July of 2016, when the FBI quietly opened its probe into possible links between the Trump campaign in Russia. That investigation, codenamed Operation Crossfire Hurricane, remained a closely held secret through the end of the 2016 campaign. It was not until March of 2017 - two months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States - that the American public would learn about the probe when then-FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JAMES COMEY: I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
LUCAS: That announcement triggered what would become a bare-knuckle political fight on Capitol Hill. Democrats pointed to a lengthy list of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, wondering whether they meant that Trump's aides had worked with the Kremlin as it interfered in the election. Republicans, in contrast, took aim at those investigating the president and his associates. But it was a decision by the president himself in early May that would truly turn official Washington on its head.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Breaking news tonight. President Trump has fired FBI Director James Comey. A stunning move...
LUCAS: Eight days later, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to oversee the rush investigation. The man picked to lead the probe was Robert Mueller, a decorated Vietnam veteran and former FBI director who had served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.
Mueller quickly pulled together a high-powered investigative team. It included some of the Justice Department's best lawyers, top-notch attorneys from private law firms and dozens of experienced FBI agents. Over the next 22 months, the special counsel's team quietly issued nearly 3,000 subpoenas and executed some 500 search warrants and interviewed around the same number of witnesses.
Most importantly, Mueller's team produced results. Thirty-four individuals, including 25 Russian nationals as well as three Russian entities, were indicted in the investigation. Mueller secured guilty pleas from seven people, including Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the president's first national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Each new indictment shook the nation's capital.
And as the months dragged on, the investigation loomed over the Trump White House. The president frequently lashed out at the FBI, the Justice Department, Mueller and his probe.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion.
It's a witch hunt. That's all it is. There was no collusion.
It's a total witch hunt. I've been saying it for a long time.
It's all a made-up fantasy. It's a witch hunt.
The witch hunt continues.
LUCAS: In January, Trump's longtime informal adviser Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks. That fueled speculation about Mueller's final move. Were more indictments in the pipeline? Would the president himself or his family be ensnared?
By this time, much of the political fight around the probe centered on what would happen to Mueller's final report on the investigation. Democrats and most Republicans agreed - the American public should be able to see for itself what Mueller had found.
The ultimate decision though would be in the hands of the new attorney general, William Barr. At his confirmation hearing, Barr told lawmakers he wanted to be as transparent as possible.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the special counsel's work. My goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.
LUCAS: Late last month, Mueller submitted his report to Barr. The attorney general took a weekend to review the materials, and then sent a four-page letter to Congress with the top-line conclusions. It was good news for an anxious White House. Barr's letter said Mueller's team did not find that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. It also said that on the question of obstruction of justice, the special counsel did not conclude that the president committed a crime. But it also did not exonerate him.
President Trump and his allies declared victory. Democrats demanded to see Mueller's full report and all of the underlying documents. Here's the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ADAM SCHIFF: This report is going to have to be made public. And of equal importance, the underlying evidence is going to have to be shared with Congress because that evidence not only goes to the issue of criminality, but it also goes to the issue of compromise.
LUCAS: House Democrats have raised questions about whether Russia holds financial or some other form of leverage over Trump. And they have threatened to subpoena the full report and underline investigative materials. Barr so far has promised only to provide Congress and the public with a redacted version.

In a surprise comeback, Tiger Woods wins his first major title in more than a decade.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Today in Augusta, Ga., what seemed impossible just a few years ago became a reality. Tiger Woods, who seemed a longshot to win another golf tournament - let alone another major championship - did just that, winning his fifth Masters by one stroke. It was his 15th major title and his first in almost 11 years.
Joining us now to tell us more about it is NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Tom, welcome.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Thank you. Hi, Michel.
MARTIN: So this story is all over social media. It's all over the world. People are tweeting about what they were doing the last time he won - my personal favorite, that Destiny's Child was beginning their final world tour. But Tiger has won a few times before - a few. So what makes this different?
GOLDMAN: Oh, boy. Well, you know, because a couple of years ago, Tiger Woods said he could barely walk. I think that's what makes this significant. He thought his career might be over. His back problems were debilitating. So the talk of winning - of winning a major seemed farfetched to say the least. But then he had fusion surgery - that was his fourth back surgery - and it worked.
And last year, he started his climb back. He built to a victory in the prestigious TOUR Championship in September of last year. And that proved he could win again. And today, he proved he could win a major again. It's the first major victory since 2008 - the 2008 U.S. Open - first Masters win since 2005. And the 14 intervening years are the longest gap between victories in Masters history.
And Michel, amazingly, this rekindles the question of, can he beat Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major championships? Eleven years ago, when he won No. 14 - that U.S. Open in 2008 - it seemed like a matter of when and not if that would happen. But to come back now and again start this talk about Tiger catching Jack, we just never saw it coming.
MARTIN: How did he do it today? Tell me - because it was a wild tournament overall. I mean, at one point, like, there were five guys in contention, like, five people tied. You know, the whole thing was wild. So how did he do it today? How did he pull it off?
GOLDMAN: It was amazing. At first, I should say he won coming from behind, which is a first. This is his first major that he's won without having at least a share of the lead going into the final round. And he started today's final round two shots behind the leader, Italy's Francesco Molinari.
Woods was kind of slow getting going, but he said afterwards that he just kept plodding - he used that word a bunch of times, plodding. And Molinari look great early on. He was sinking clutch putts. But then on hole 12, the par three in famed Amen Corner, Molinari put his tee shot in the creek in front of the green. And that changed the complexion of the tournament right there.
As Woods said later, it let a bunch of people back into the tournament. Really good players, some of the best in the world, like Brooks Koepka, who won two majors last year, world No. 2-ranked Dustin Johnson, they surged. But through it all, Woods played steady. And the last few holes, he did better than steady. He had three birdies - one under par - in his last six holes. And he won by a stroke.
MARTIN: We have about a minute left, Tom. So does this mean something for men's golf? I know that there's this whole question of, like, the Tiger effect and all of this. And, you know, he hasn't been on the scene except as a - sort of a sad sidebar in recent years. Does this mean something for men's golf overall for the sport?
GOLDMAN: I think it does. You know, Woods and his tremendous success years ago spawned a new generation of young athletic golfers with complete games. The golf out there is really good. And today, all those young golfers he spawned, he beat them in the biggest tournament when the pressure was greatest and when they were all playing really well. And so he again is on top, which I think is maybe disconcerting for the young guns who thought Woods was going to kind of fade off into the sunset. Not yet.
MARTIN: Exciting for the over-40 set overall, right? Now tell the truth, Tom. You're going to watch it again right now, aren't you?
GOLDMAN: I am.
MARTIN: All right. That's NPR's Tom Goldman. Tom, thank you.
GOLDMAN: You're welcome.

Can Julian Assange Legally Be Extradited To The U.S.?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304653/can-julian-assange-legally-be-extradited-to-the-u-s,"Can Julian Assange Legally Be Extradited To The U.S.? Can Julian Assange Legally Be Extradited To The U.S.? Embed Embed
NPR's Michel Martin speaks with John Bellinger, former State Department legal adviser, about the possibility of Julian Assange being extradited to the United States.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're returning now to the story of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who's been indicted on a single count of conspiracy. This weekend, we've been asking what Assange's arrest means in the debate over national security versus press freedom. Now we want to take a look at the question of extradition. We've asked John Bellinger to help us with that. He was the State Department's legal adviser under President George W. Bush, and he's with us now.
Mr. Bellinger, thank you so much for joining us.
JOHN BELLINGER: Nice to be with you, Michel.
MARTIN: I understand that there is a U.S.-U.K. extradition treaty which says that someone cannot be extradited from the U.K. for, quote, unquote, ""political offense."" How is that defined? And does that mean something for this case?
BELLINGER: That's right. There's a extradition treaty that entered into force during the Bush administration. It's been in effect for about 10 years. And it defines the crimes for which individuals can be extradited from the U.S. or from the U.K. And it says that an individual may not be extradited for a political offense, but that's not defined. But historically, under international law, a political offense is an offense against the state such as espionage or sedition or treason.
MARTIN: Would it be fair to assume that Julian Assange's defense will try to make the case that this is all political?
BELLINGER: Oh, absolutely. That's going to be one of their chief defenses, I'm sure. And that's one of the reasons I suspect that the charges by the Justice Department were very carefully tailored not to charge him under our espionage laws but instead to charge him with conspiracy to hack into a computer so that he's not being charged with a political offense. But, of course, his defense lawyers are going to say that this is really all political, it's politically motivated, and that he's really being charged with a crime against the United States.
MARTIN: I understand that there's a hearing. An extradition hearing will be held in the U.K. on May 2. You know, what will that entail? What will we see?
BELLINGER: His defense lawyers will, I'm sure, make a number of arguments, including not only that this really is a political offense. But I'm sure they will argue also that he was a journalist performing a journalistic function. It does appear - although we don't know - that the U.K. government is already working together with the U.S. government and supports the extradition.
MARTIN: So who is the ultimate decision-maker here? And what is that person likely to be guided by, if you have any sense of that? For example, is there any precedent that either side could point to that might give us a sense of how this might proceed?
BELLINGER: Well, there'll be several levels inside the U.K. judicial system. There'll be a hearing before a judge in the U.K. and then probably through an appellate level in the U.K. And then, if history is any indication, if Mr. Assange loses, he could then keep appealing all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights saying that his human rights have been violated. Historically, the British have extradited numerous individuals to the U.S. Although many of them and their defense counsel have argued that they would face unfair or improper trials in the U.S., most of those have been extradited.
But in a few cases in the past, there have been individuals whose extradition from the U.K. to the U.S. have been denied. In this case, this will really be, I think, a battle royal because Assange and his lawyers will argue very forcefully that I'm sure particularly the Trump administration is coming after him for political reasons.
MARTIN: So, as you mentioned earlier, Assange has only been charged with one count of conspiracy. If he's extradited to the U.S., could he face other charges here? And is that something that his lawyers might raise?
BELLINGER: Additional charges may be added before his extradition is sought. But after he is extradited, then the U.S. cannot change the charges later on. That would violate a treaty provision called the rule of specialty. So he could only be tried for the charges for which he is extradited.
MARTIN: That's John Bellinger. He was the State Department's legal adviser under President George W. Bush. He now heads the Global Law and Public Policy Practice Group at the law firm Arnold & Porter.
Mr. Bellinger, thanks so much for talking to us.
BELLINGER: Thanks, Michel. It's always a pleasure.

Jo-Marie Burt (@jomaburt) is a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America and an associate professor of political science at George Mason University.
Guatemala's ongoing political crisis is having a devastating impact on its people, fueling unrest in the streets and increasingly driving asylum-seekers to migrate to the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, with the country's Congress poised to pass a bill that would free war criminals, there's no clearer sign that rule of law in Guatemala is undergoing a slow, ugly collapse that could spur even more migration to the United States.
The proposed legislation, which Guatemala's Congress is expected to debate imminently, would free more than 30 military officials convicted of crimes against humanity and more than a dozen others awaiting trial on such charges. It would also prohibit all future investigations into other cases of grave human rights crimes committed during the country's brutal 36-year civil war that ended in 1996.
Should this amnesty bill pass, not only would it undo decades of work to provide justice to victims of wartime atrocities, it would represent an unequivocal return to the reign of impunity long sought by the powerful, military-backed networks of corruption that the United States has invested significant resources into dismantling.
Guatemala's civil war and resulting genocide was fueled by U.S. Cold War support for regimes that, no matter how brutal against their own populations, were seen as protecting U.S. interests. United Nations investigators found that 200,000 people died, the vast majority at the hands of the Guatemalan army. Four out of every five victims were indigenous. Four hundred indigenous villages were wiped off the face of the earth.
Impunity was the norm for many years, even after the conflict ended and peace accords were signed in 1996. But over the past 10 years, thanks to the persistent demands of victims and new generations of prosecutors and judges unencumbered by past fears, Guatemala has made impressive strides in bringing war criminals to justice.
To date, Guatemalan courts have convicted 33 military officials, military commissioners and paramilitaries for a series of human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, massacres, torture, sexual violence and sexual slavery. Courts have also convicted one guerrilla leader for a 1988 massacre. Killings Of Guatemala's Indigenous Activists Raise Specter Of Human Rights Crisis
Among those convicted are powerful men like Benedicto Lucas García, former chief of the army general staff, trained at the infamous U.S. Army School of the Americas and the architect of Guatemala's bloody counterinsurgency policy. In May of last year, he was sentenced to 58 years in prison for crimes against humanity and the aggravated sexual assault of political activist Emma Molina Theissen, as well as the enforced disappearance of her 14-year-old brother.
Guatemala's Congress is now poised to reverse all of this progress. Last month, lawmakers approved moving to vote on proposed legislation that would free all those convicted or awaiting trial for human rights violations within 24 hours of its promulgation. It would also ban all future prosecutions related to wartime atrocities.
Signing the amnesty bill into law would have a grievous and widespread impact. It would further decimate the little trust that surveys show Guatemalans place in their state institutions. It would re-traumatize victims. It could put the lawyers, judges and families who have made the fight for accountability their life's work at risk of retaliation, as recently expressed by United Nations human rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet.
What's especially concerning is that this push to let war criminals walk free is happening amidst a broader effort to make impunity the norm for elites, as corrupt officials seek to kick out an international anti-corruption body and restore their unfettered power and privilege over Guatemalan society. Food, Peace Building, Legal Aid: What Trump Would Cut From Central America
This all-out assault against the rule of law in Guatemala is being spearheaded by President Jimmy Morales, who came to power in 2015 after massive anti-corruption protests brought down the sitting president, vice president and dozens of other government officials. Morales' campaign slogan seemed primed for the moment: ""I am neither corrupt nor a thief.""
Yet when U.N.-backed anti-corruption body the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known by its Spanish initials CICIG, and the Attorney General's Office sought to investigate Morales and his party, the National Convergence Front, for illicit campaign contributions, Morales launched an offensive against the commission. Last August, surrounded by dozens of military officials, Morales announced that he was not renewing the CICIG's mandate, which was set to expire in September 2019, and barred its chief, Iván Velásquez, from returning to the country. In January, he announced he was shuttering the CICIG's doors entirely. He has repeatedly defied court orders to allow the commission to continue its work through the end of its mandate, pushing Guatemala to the brink of a constitutional crisis.
Morales has a personal dog in this fight. He has avoided impeachment charges over the alleged campaign finance crimes so far, but these violations have also brought election authorities close to dismantling the party that brought him to the presidency. Investigators have also brought charges against his brother and his son for corruption.
But the assault on the CICIG transcends President Morales. It involves the very corrupt structures, rooted in the military old guard, that the CICIG was created to eradicate in the first place, and that stand to benefit significantly should Congress pass the amnesty law. 'I'm A Survivor Of Violence': Portraits Of Women Waiting In Mexico For U.S. Asylum
In fact, Morales' victory in 2015 was the result of an alliance with powerful ex-military officials, business elites and evangelists. Investigations by the CICIG and the Attorney General's Office into representatives from these different special interest groups has spurred the campaign to rid the country of the CICIG and undercut the autonomy of key democratic institutions, including the Attorney General's Office and the courts.
Many of the former military officials close to President Morales have been implicated in or face trial for conflict-era human rights violations.
One example is Edgar Justino Ovalle Maldonado. One of several ex-military officials who founded the National Convergence Front in 2008, Ovalle recruited Morales to be its presidential candidate in 2015. As head of the party, Ovalle was elected to Congress in 2015 and wielded tremendous power as Morales' closest adviser. That shielded him from prosecution when investigators sought his arrest in January 2016 on charges of crimes against humanity , in relation to the enforced disappearance of at least 565 victims at the height of Guatemala's civil conflict. It is one of the largest cases of enforced disappearance in Latin America. However, after Ovalle's immunity was lifted in late 2017, he went into hiding and remains a fugitive.
Other former retired militaryofficials charged in that disappearances case have also either fled Guatemala or are still awaiting trial in the country. If the amnesty law passes, investigators would have to drop all their cases.
Approval of the amnesty bill would put Guatemala in violation of international law, which prohibits amnesties, statutes of limitations or other mechanisms designed to protect human rights violators from prosecution. It would also undermine a decade of progress in reckoning with a violent past and building Guatemalans' faith in democratic institutions like the Attorney General's Office and the courts, which are the foundation of the rule of law and democratic governance.
The U.S. government has strongly supported criminal prosecutions of war crimes in Guatemala. U.S. Congress members and the State Department should tell Guatemala in no uncertain terms that they must not grant amnesty for war criminals. Doing so paves the way for a new reign of impunity, one that will imperil the peace, hobble rule of law and exacerbate migration."

The world's largest plane by wingspan took its first flight on Saturday above the Mojave Desert in California.
With a wingspan wider than the length of an American football field, the plane features six turbofan engines, a dual fuselage design and was made using parts from two Boeing jets, according to The New York Times.
The Stratolaunch, as the plane is called, is designed to carry rockets to an altitude of 35,000 feet, at which time they would ignite and launch into orbit, according to The Verge . The rockets would carry commercial satellites into space.
The plane was built by Stratolaunch Systems, which was created in 2011 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. By launching rockets, satellites and other spacecraft from the sky, the company is betting it will be able to avoid the types of delays that ground launches are prone to, such as bad weather.

During the test flight that lasted more than two hours, the plane reached an altitude of 17,000 feet and a top speed of 189 mph, according to the company.
""I'm really excited today to share that we have successfully flown the Stratolaunch aircraft for its first test flight this morning,"" Stratolaunch CEO Jean Floyd said during a press briefing. ""It was an emotional moment for me to personally watch this majestic bird take flight and to see Paul Allen's dream come to life in front of my very eyes."" Allen died in October.

The company says it wants to begin launching rockets from the Stratolaunch by 2020 at the earliest, according to Reuters. But while it works toward that goal, it also faces competition from the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance.
With a wingspan greater than the length of an American football field, the Stratolaunch successfully completed its first test flight Saturday morning. Stratolaunch Systems hide caption toggle caption Stratolaunch Systems
Though the company isn't ready to launch anything just yet, Saturday's flight was considered a success by many, including test pilot Evan Thomas.
""The flight itself was smooth, which is exactly what you want the first flight to be,"" Thomas said at the briefing. ""And for the most part, the airplane flew as predicted, which is again exactly what we want.""

David Peinado/NurPhoto via Getty Images A plan under consideration by President Trump to transfer detained immigrants to ""sanctuary cities"" should be viewed as an overture to Democrats, not political retribution, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
""It's not political retribution,"" Hogan Gidley, the White House deputy press secretary, told NPR . ""If anything, you should consider it on the Democrat side to be an olive branch.""
But according to a report published by The Washington Post on Thursday, the plan to send detained immigrants who are in the country illegally to sanctuary cities was seen by some White House officials as a way ""to retaliate against President Trump's political adversaries.""
Initially, White House and Homeland Security officials said the plan had been scrapped, but on Friday, President Trump confirmed the report , telling reporters, ""We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it.""
On Sunday, White House officials sought to turn the focus on Democrats. Speaking on ABC News' This Week, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the preferred solution would be for Democratic leaders in Congress to work with the White House to ""stop this awful crisis that is taking place at our border.""
Cracking down on illegal immigration has been a central theme of the Trump presidency, and in his interview with NPR, Gidley said Trump is trying to make good on that promise through the sanctuary cities plan.
Gidley said the White House has put forward multiple proposals to stem the flow of illegal immigration, but Democrats have not ""come to the table.""
""So the logical answer is to give them something they want,"" said Gidley. ""Democrats say that if you even think about rejecting people into this country illegally, that you are somehow racist. So the question then becomes, do Democrats want to allow these people to be shipped into their communities?""
Gidley specifically singled out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco district as one potential destination.
""We looked at it and said, where are the logical places to kind of spread the wealth, if you will, and places like San Francisco, for example, or a sanctuary city, they are designed and set up specifically to have people there who aren't here legally,"" he said. ""That's what their stated goal is, so there is no reason we shouldn't be looking at a way to give them exactly what they want.""
Last week, Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for Pelosi, told The Washington Post , ""The extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated. Using human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.""
The proposal has already faced questions about its cost and legality. Responding to those questions, the president tweeted on Saturday that the U.S. government ""has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities.""
Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2019 On Sunday, Democrats denounced the proposal as a political tactic. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said the president was using the plan to energize his base.
""My understanding is that it is not legal. There is no budget for that purpose,"" Cardin said. ""This is clearly a political move for the president. He is using the immigrants as pawns in a political game of chess.""

Do You Love Lying In Bed? Get Paid By NASA To Do It For Space Research : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713303712/do-you-love-lying-in-bed-get-paid-by-nasa-to-do-it-for-space-research,"Enlarge this image South Korean President Park Geun-hye walks past a NASA logo during a tour at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP South Korean President Park Geun-hye walks past a NASA logo during a tour at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
Patrick Semansky/AP If you have ever wanted to get paid to lie in bed, then this job is for you: NASA, the European Space Agency and the German Aerospace Center are offering $18,500 for people to lie in bed for two months.
The job is based in Cologne, Germany, and it's part of a study designed to better understand how the body adapts to weightlessness. The agencies are currently looking for people who are female, between the ages of 24 and 55 and who speak German. The official name of the study is Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study.
But there's a catch.
Those chosen for the job will have to stay in bed 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 60 straight days. That means no getting up for bathroom breaks, bathing or meals. And the money, well, it comes out to just shy of $13 an hour.
Jennifer Ngo-Anh with the European Space Agency says she doesn't believe that will deter everyone from participating.
""A lot of people are intrigued about the idea of contributing to advance knowledge that helps us to really have humans live and work in space for extended periods of time,"" Ngo-Anh says.
Besides lying in bed for 60 days, there are other days for orientation, rest and rehabilitation at both ends of the study. The total time period someone has to be available for the study is 89 days, plus several follow up examinations in the years after the study.
People are already participating in phase one of the study and the researchers are now looking for candidates for phase two.
But before you apply, be warned: For the study, volunteers will have to lie in bed with their heads tilted slightly downward. Ngo-Anh says that's to help recreate conditions of spaceflight.
Joe's Big Idea Young Astronomer Uses Artificial Intelligence To Discover 2 Exoplanets Space Earth Sees First Image Of A Black Hole ""When volunteers lie in bed with their heads tilted roughly six degrees below the horizontal, then a lot of the effects that spaceflight has on the human body can be simulated or being reproduced,"" Ngo-Anh says. ""It is not to annoy volunteers, but it is actually to test countermeasures.""
Volunteers will also be exposed to artificial gravity to test if it can be a countermeasure to the effects of spaceflight. If the study finds that exposure has a positive effect, it may be used as an official countermeasure for future spaceflight missions.
If volunteers are hoping to get some exercise while on the job, fret not. Ngo-Anh says her organization has tested everything from jumping in bed to cycling in bed, plus other contraptions that can be mounted to the beds.
So, if you still think this job is for you, sign up while you still can .

Playwright Suzan-Lori Parks Handles Heavy Themes In Racial Drama 'White Noise',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304695/playwright-suzan-lori-parks-handles-heavy-themes-in-racial-drama-white-noise?station=KXJZ_FM,"Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks is back with a new controversial play that centers on a group of four interracial friends who get caught up in a contract that gets out of hand.
And finally today, playwright Suzan-Lori Parks. She's one of the most productive and acclaimed people working in theater today, and she's known for pulling off remarkable feats like writing 365 plays in 365 days or finding humor and tragedy in a play about a black Lincoln impersonator who works in whiteface - that's ""Topdog/Underdog"" - for which she won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize.
Now she's back with a new play, and it's another high-wire act. It's called ""White Noise,"" and it focuses on a group of four people who've been friends since college. Misha is a black rising YouTube star who's decided to make blaxplaining (ph) to white people her thing. Ralph, Misha's boyfriend, is a white university professor with a trust fund. Dawn is a white lawyer with social justice on her mind, and she's dating Leo, a black artist who's been suffering with insomnia since childhood.
And yes, race does matter because in the beginning of ""White Noise"" we learn that Leo's insomnia keeps him up at night, so sometimes he walks. And late one night while walking, he's attacked by police. And that incident causes him to come up with an outrageous plan. And Suzan-Lori Parks is with us now from New York.
Thank you so much for being with us.
SUZAN-LORI PARKS: Thanks for having me on the show - so exciting (laughter).
MARTIN: And I just have to say that, you know, one of the pleasures of seeing a play early on is that you don't know anything about it. You can just walk in without knowing anything, and then your mind is blown. And I just have to say that there's - I feel badly, but there's no way to talk about this play without one spoiler.
PARKS: Yeah, sure.
MARTIN: So if you're listening, and you don't want to know, now's the time to get a cup of tea. Having said that, do you want to tell what the outrageous plan is?
PARKS: Yeah. So his outrageous plan, right - and it's - well, that's the whole thing about spoilers. But it's like ""Oedipus."" You know, we all know what happens. It's how it happens and why that hopefully will continue to be interesting even after we learn that - yeah, so Leo's outrageous plan, his far-out idea - he wants to feel safe, protected and respected, and he's really run out of options.
And so he lands on this idea that he will voluntarily enslave himself to his best friend Ralph for a period of 40 days. And he will just do basically what turns out to be a 40-day internal meditation on a theme. He says he will go to a, quote-unquote, ""low place."" And after that, hopefully, he will be truly free. And that's his plan.
MARTIN: And it's crazy (laughter). And...
PARKS: Yeah, it's...
MARTIN: So...
PARKS: ...Cray-cray (ph). It's - yeah.
MARTIN: Yes.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: So Leo is played wonderfully by Daveed Diggs.
PARKS: Yes.
MARTIN: And people probably know Diggs best for his dual role as Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson in ""Hamilton.""
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: Let me play - this is the one clip I'm going to play...
PARKS: Oh, cool.
MARTIN: ...Which Leo is trying to explain how he came up with this plan. And I'm going to warn people here that there's language that some might find offensive. And here it is.
(SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, ""WHITE NOISE"")
DAVEED DIGGS: (As Leo) Back in the day, a guy like me would be walking someplace, and he would get stopped by the law, some law enforcement individual. And there would be a whose nigger are you, nigger moment. And a guy like me would be, like, I belong to Mr. So-and-so. And the law would be, like, oh, if you are master so-and-so's property, then you cool with us, and go on ahead with your black self. And a guy like me would go on because he was owned - because the brother was the property of the man. He was safe because he was...
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Don't say it.
THOMAS SADOSKI: (As Ralph) A slave.
DIGGS: (As Leo) Bingo.
MARTIN: OK. How on earth...
PARKS: How on earth...
MARTIN: ...Did this come to you?
PARKS: Well, it was - it's very simple. You see, there was this play in 2014 called ""Father Comes Home From The Wars."" Yeah. And I wrote it. So I was sitting in the Anspacher, the very theater where we are world premiering ""White Noise."" And there is a moment in that play, the ""Father Comes Home From The Wars"" play, which takes place in the 1860's in America where the main character, Hero, is imagining the future. And he's trying to imagine what it's going to be like to be free.
And if he is free - if I'm free, I think he says - I'm paraphrasing - you know, and I'm walking down the street, say I'm coming home from work, and I got stopped by the patrollers, and they'll say, who do you belong to? And I'll say, well, I belong to myself. And he wonders if that will be enough for them to - the patrollers to let him, you know, go on home. And his friend that he's talking to, Smith, doesn't know if that's going to be enough to have him feel safe, protected and respected.
And so watching that moment in the play night after night after night in 2014, I said, oh, wow. I'm going to write a play about the future. And I started writing ""White Noise"" from there.
MARTIN: Wow. That - first of all, there's so many difficult ideas in this. I don't want to give it away because it's both fascinating and cringe-inducing. I mean, it's like this real-life, real-time experiment.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: And one of the things that's both fascinating and cringe-inducing - there's so many things - but how quickly Ralph takes to the role...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...Of being Leo's master.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: What are some of the things that fascinated you?
PARKS: Well, one of the things that I hold dear and that I told the actors and I tell them every day - but I told them on the first day of rehearsal, and I just wanted them to know how much I love deeply each of the characters and how the world that they live in, the world which is much like the world we live in today - the world has pushed each of these four characters into a corner - into an opposing corner, if you will. And I want them to work through their stuff. And for me, that's one of the most important things about the play.
And it surprises me, I guess, how during the rehearsal process, which was very deep and intense but without unnecessary drama. And we had some intense discussions about who we are and race and privilege and what does that mean. And a lot of times, it wasn't easy. But we had them. We had to.
MARTIN: You know, other things that fascinated me - I was looking back over some of the reviews and interviews that you've done over the years. One of the things that fascinated me was how many of the things that you wrote about in prior plays that people felt were just crazy or outrageous or over-the-top have now become...
PARKS: (Laughter).
MARTIN: ...True. Like, for example, in ""Topdog/Underdog""...
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...It was a - you know, one of - it's a two-character play, and one of the characters is a Lincoln impersonator, but he's performed...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...By an African-American actor who performs in whiteface.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: And, lo and behold...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: Here we are...
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...All these years later. We're having this huge political scandal in Virginia because white politicians were...
PARKS: Oh, yeah.
MARTIN: ...Understood to be wearing blackface.
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: And I just wonder, how is this for you? I don't know if you read the reviews, but to have...
PARKS: Well...
MARTIN: ...Things that you've written about, people think, oh, that's crazy. That would never happen. And then...
PARKS: Right.
MARTIN: ...It is happening.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: I'm just wondering if you're having a moment. Or what do you...
PARKS: (Laughter) I'm having - at every moment, I have a moment. You know what I'm saying? (Laughter) I mean, it's like - I feel that if we listen deeply, we are going to see what's going on. What's going on is what has been going on for a long time. So it's not about, like, prophecy or anything. It's just watching and listening and paying attention - you know, things that we're encouraged to do. But there's also humor. I mean, I have to tell you...
MARTIN: It's true.
PARKS: The names of the four characters - it's Leo, Misha, Ralph and Dawn. So if you've heard of the ""Ninja Turtles"" - you know, the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""...
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: ...So Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and Raphael. So there I - That's where I got their names from. So my son loves the ""Ninja Turtles,"" right? So he has the ""Ninja Turtle"" figurines. And I'm, like, that's the name of the characters from my play.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: And I start laughing so hard, he's, like, mommy, why are you laughing? And my husband goes, because you're about to go down deep.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: And I'm, like, yeah. That's what I do. Before you take a dive down deep, I tell myself a joke. So Act 1 of the play is - of ""White Noise"" is filled with jokes, lots of jokes. And then act two, we go deeper. There's still a lot of jokes in Act 2, but we go deeper. We go deep, deep, deep, walking on the nerve endings of the audience - ow.
MARTIN: (Laughter).
PARKS: It's - you're laughing. See? It feels good, doesn't it?
MARTIN: Yeah.
PARKS: Yeah.
MARTIN: Before I let you go, I want to ask about that James Baldwin quote that you have at the top of the script.
PARKS: Oh, yeah.
MARTIN: You actually had the opportunity to study with him in college.
PARKS: I did.
MARTIN: And...
PARKS: I did. Oh, bless his heart.
MARTIN: And the quote reads, ""not everything can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."" Yeah.
PARKS: Leo quotes that - half-quotes that in the play. He says, like the brother said, nothing can be changed until it's faced. All right. He doesn't quote the first part of the text. So he believes that by continuing to work toward a beautiful solution that that beautiful solution will come to have his own humanity recognized - that that is a possibility. He believes that. And yeah, so do I.
MARTIN: That's Suzan-Lori Parks. Her latest play, ""White Noise,"" is showing at the Public Theater in New York until May.
Suzan-Lori Parks, thank you so much for talking with us.
PARKS: This is awesome. Thank you so much for having me.

#NPRPoetry Month: Lauren Alleyne,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304688/-nprpoetry-month-lauren-alleyne?station=KXJZ_FM,"It's National Poetry Month, and for our series #NPRPoetry, NPR's Michel Martin speaks with poet Lauren Alleyne. Alleyne combed Twitter for her favorite original poems.
Now it's time for one of our favorite things - poetry. Every year in April, Poetry Month, we ask listeners to share original tweet-length poems. And each week this month, we are reading through your submissions. We've been honored to have a number of award-winning poets combing through submissions with us. And joining us this week is Lauren Alleyne. She is the assistant director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center at James Madison University, where she also teaches English. And she's with us now from Raleigh, N.C. Lauren Alleyne, thank you so much for talking to us.
LAUREN ALLEYNE: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: So you've picked some poems that caught your eye. Why don't you read us one?
ALLEYNE: I would love to. I would like to read a poem from Patricia Caspers (ph).
MARTIN: OK.
ALLEYNE: Each breath you wheezed became our rosary. As we carried you across the empty hospital parking lot and I thought about the small mystery inside of you, struggling to hold on to this life, this body machine, it's everything I know of God.
MARTIN: Oh, boy. That kind of packs a punch, doesn't it?
ALLEYNE: It really does.
MARTIN: What struck you about this one?
ALLEYNE: I think that there is some sort of alchemy that happens with, like, the perfect image that captures a perfect moment in the perfect language, right? And so that idea of the body machine that happens at the end and then the surprising turn - it's everything I know of God - I think sort of captures in a way that maybe any other kind of language couldn't that feeling of mystery that is part of what it means to be humans. I just thought it was captured so wonderfully in that poem.
MARTIN: Tell us another one.
ALLEYNE: Absolutely. Let's see. Winter, the woods, my brother running away in moonlight the color of marrow. His 200 and some-odd bones hiding warm beneath his skin, tucked tender in his ears, whole and fresh until those few short sharp last breaths.
MARTIN: And that was by Nancy Stone (ph).
ALLEYNE: Yes.
MARTIN: What struck you about this one?
ALLEYNE: Even in this conversation, I can tell I'm always drawn to the body. And the specificity of the poem and those 200 odd bones, right, the short, sharp breaths. I think, again, the way the language is able to capture that exhaustion, that movement, the dynamism in the language itself, to me, that's the miraculous nature of the poem. And that was captivating for me.
MARTIN: We kind of came up with the tweet-length as a conceit. I mean, you know, who are we kidding? We just, you know, we just made that up just because of the brevity of it. We also thought it would kind of make it fun for people to participate. But what do you think about it? I mean, do you like the brevity of it? Does this appeal to you?
ALLEYNE: I am a fan of form in poetry - fixed forms. I love the sonnet. I love the villanelle. I love the Sistine. I love the Rondel. I love the Bop. All of these, like, rules that help for me make a container that you can pour something that is often bigger than you have words to say, right? And I also just think it's fun. Like, I like games. I like puzzles. I like, you know, systems. And so to me, the character limit is a system. Like, what can you do within this space that makes meaning and that makes beauty? And I think that's just the challenge of any poem, really.
MARTIN: Want me to play one that - we were able to get one of the contributor to record this one for us. This one is by Jay Sterner (ph), and here it is.
JAY STERNER: All the right words have gathered on my tongue to form a parade, but my teeth are the walls, and my fractured ego is the rain.
MARTIN: You picked this one, too, I just want to say.
ALLEYNE: I did.
MARTIN: You know, again, it's the body, but what else did you like about this?
ALLEYNE: One of the things I think that can really, for me, make a poem is when I see the poet in the poem, and the poet in a poem in a way that is vulnerable and human and complicit sometimes. And I think that's the thing I really enjoyed about that poem is that it was really sort of revealing the poet's awareness of his own failure to be better, right? Like, you know, here is a perfect thing to say, but I can't get out of my own way. So I think that idea of being vulnerable, to being wrong in the poem is brave. And I feel like I love to see that bravery show up in a poem.
MARTIN: So how did you start writing poems?
ALLEYNE: I'm from Trinidad. And there's a wonderful song form there, the Calypso. And I used to write Calypsos for my sister. Those were my earliest, earliest poems.
MARTIN: So finally, before we let you go - and thank you again for reading these poems with us this week and enjoying them along with us. Do you have some advice for people who maybe are still a little shy about getting started and putting some thoughts to paper?
ALLEYNE: Absolutely. I think the poem is one of the most democratic forms of art. It's a pencil and paper. And if we enter it as a mode of play and exploration, rather than the production of literature, I think we give ourselves permission to discover. And also, I think be fine with having fun and not producing a New Yorker-worthy NPR-worthy poem, right?
You know, I tell people all the time - it's my students - I'm like, listen, you have a pencil. You have a pen. And you think, I am perfectly equipped to make a perfectly good poem. But you have 10 fingers, and you might walk up to a piano and you don't think you can place Chopin. So, like, allow yourself to play the chopsticks of poetry, right? Just go and write a haiku. And you're just playing in language. And then maybe something comes from that.
MARTIN: That's Lauren Alleyne. She is the assistant director of the Furious Flower Poetry Center and the author of ""Difficult Fruit"" and ""Honeyfish."" And she was kind enough to join us from Raleigh, N.C. Lauren Alleyne, thank you so much for talking with us today.
ALLEYNE: My pleasure.
MARTIN: And if you'd like to hear your original poem on the air, tweet it to @npratc with the hashtag #nprpoetry. Every week, for the rest of the month, a professional poet like Lauren will join us on the air to talk about some submissions that caught his or her eye. Poems must be 140 characters or less.

Breaking Down The Hollywood Dispute Between Writers And Agents,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304681/breaking-down-the-hollywood-dispute-between-writers-and-agents?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Kim Masters, editor-at-large for The Hollywood Reporter , about the ongoing dispute between writers and agents.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
And now we turn to Hollywood to check in on the dispute between writers and talent agents. After groups representing both parties failed to reach an employment agreement, the Writers Guild instructed members to cut ties with their agents. That group represents thousands of writers, and the dispute could stall production of scripted TV shows and movies. Here to tell us what this means is Kim Masters. She's an editor at large at The Hollywood Reporter.
Kim Masters, welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again.
KIM MASTERS: My pleasure.
MARTIN: Can you just tell us as briefly as you can how we got to this point?
MASTERS: There has been a process called packaging that goes back more than 40 years. It's become an institution in this industry. And packaging means - this is primarily a thing now with television writers - when an agency puts together elements of a show and sells it to a studio, the studio pays the agency a fee directly. And this has various effects that the writers are now completely fed up with. They argue that the agents who are getting paid by the studios have a conflict because their job is to represent the writer and not make deals for themselves with the studios.
And they say that this causes writers to be underpaid. Oftentimes, writers don't even know that they're part of a package. They say that if you're developing a TV show, these fees that the studio is paying the agencies can cut the budget for your own TV show, diminishing your chances for success, because you can't necessarily hire the actor you want or get the location you want.
MARTIN: I think people could see their point. For example, if you were in a real estate transaction, and if you hired somebody to represent you, to then find out that that person was actually the person selling the house, for example - you would experience that as a conflict. So what do the agents say about that? What has their position been about that?
MASTERS: Well, what the agents give up in this scenario of packaging is you normally would pay a 10 percent commission to your agent for getting you a job, and you don't pay if the packaging fee is involved. So the agents are saying this helps lower-level writers because they can make more money. But the writers argue that this is more than offset by the potential conflicts that these agents have collecting fees from the studios.
And they point out and argue that their compensation has gone down in recent years overall. One of the writers said how he had walked through an art gallery at his agency. These agencies have all of this wealth and accoutrements and try to look very, very successful. But at this point, the writers are looking at all of those signs of success and saying, wasn't some of that money supposed to be mine?
MARTIN: So the Writers Guild leadership wrote to members saying that they are about to enter unchartered waters. What are some of the repercussions of this that we might see? Recognizing I'm asking you to speculate here since - as by definition, it's uncharted - what do you think might happen? What are people concerned about?
MASTERS: Well, guild members as of now are expected to fire their agents. It is pilot season, so the shows are staffing up right now. And what the writers are trying to do is figure out alternate means to communicate about what jobs are available and help people find jobs without involving agents.
MARTIN: Is there any entity or group working to resolve this?
MASTERS: Right now, we are looking at what seems like impasse. These are very divergent interests right now. The agents feel they must produce. They certainly don't want to give up these very, very lucrative packaging fees. Sometimes they make more than the writers from TV shows created by the writers. So this is really kind of an existential struggle, and I'm not sure how I see the way out.
MARTIN: That's Kim Masters, editor at large for The Hollywood Reporter.
Kim, thank you so much for joining us.
MASTERS: Oh, thank you for having me.

MARTIN: So let's jump in. What is different about taxes this year since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? What will people notice the most?
BELL: The first thing they will notice is there is a new form. Lawmakers promised us a postcard-sized tax return. It's not quite there. It's a little bigger than a regular postcard. But there's only one smaller form now instead of what used to be three forms. The bad thing about that is that in addition to this one smaller form, there are now six different schedules. So depending on what your tax situation is, you might have to file several different forms whereas in the past, maybe you only had one 1040 that you had to deal with.
MARTIN: Who benefits from the not quite a postcard, almost a postcard? And who is subjected to all those different schedules?
BELL: Well, you know, taxes are intensely personal. So you might have to fill out just the small form, whereas if in the past, you used the 1040ez, you'll use the new simple 1040 and be done with it. But if you had income other than W-2 income from an employer - say you had a side job, a gig job driving for one of the car services on the side - you're going to have to fill out one, two, maybe three forms. So it's a little more complicated. But they say it was a tradeoff to get us to a lower tax rate and broader tax - income tax brackets. So most of us end up paying less tax in the end.
MARTIN: Now, you talk with a lot of CPAs for your blog. What are they telling you about what their customers are telling them?
BELL: Well, they have some customers that are not happy that they're not getting as big of a refund as they used to. And there's a long story as to why that happened. Those who file early tend to be people who expect larger refunds. And when that didn't happen this year, we heard about it. You know, they complained loudly and on social media.
And the problem is that when the new tax law went into effect, it changed the withholding, which meant a lot of people - most people - got more money back in their paychecks. Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't notice it or they had other expenses that went up and absorbed this little bit of increase or they just didn't think about it because nobody thinks about taxes really until they get around to filing their return.
In addition to tax refunds being a little bit smaller, we're seeing that people aren't filing as quickly this year. And in fact, the IRS says they expect around almost 15 million people to file for an extension this year. And that's almost 5 million more than usually file for an extension every tax season.
MARTIN: So finally - so I'm guessing because, you know, your Twitter bio says that you are a tax geek, what's it been like for you this last couple of months of tax season? Are your friends and relatives, like, showing up at your house at odd hours with their forms...
BELL: It's been great. I mean...
MARTIN: ...Looking really upset? What's it like for you?
BELL: It's been great. I love it. I mean, taxes are nerve-racking anyway. Then you add change, which any kind of change, even if you want it, is frustrating. So you add those two together, and it can get really hectic. But I've been doing this for a long time. It's fun to see some changes made. And there are some good changes in this tax bill.
But it has been crazy. And people are a little worried. They just want to make sure they understand it, you know? Nobody wants to make the IRS mad. They want to make sure that they are getting all they can out of the new tax laws and that they are getting what they deserve.
MARTIN: That's Kay Bell. She is a journalist. She writes the blog ""Don't Mess With Taxes."" And she was kind of to join us from KUT in Austin, Texas. Kay Bell, thanks so much for talking to us.
BELL: Thank you.

AG Barr Prepares To Release Redacted Mueller Report,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304667/ag-barr-prepares-to-release-redacted-mueller-report?station=KXJZ_FM,"Attorney General William Barr is preparing to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It summarizes years of investigation into 2016 election interference.
Back now to one of the stories that has consumed the nation's capital - the Mueller report. It will soon be here, at least a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It's expected in the next couple of days - that according to Attorney General William Barr.
And while fights over the report probably will continue, the release is the culmination of investigations that go back nearly three years, reaching across continents and into President Trump's inner circle. NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas takes us back to the beginning.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: The investigation began in late July of 2016, when the FBI quietly opened its probe into possible links between the Trump campaign in Russia. That investigation, codenamed Operation Crossfire Hurricane, remained a closely held secret through the end of the 2016 campaign. It was not until March of 2017 - two months after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States - that the American public would learn about the probe when then-FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JAMES COMEY: I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
LUCAS: That announcement triggered what would become a bare-knuckle political fight on Capitol Hill. Democrats pointed to a lengthy list of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, wondering whether they meant that Trump's aides had worked with the Kremlin as it interfered in the election. Republicans, in contrast, took aim at those investigating the president and his associates. But it was a decision by the president himself in early May that would truly turn official Washington on its head.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Breaking news tonight. President Trump has fired FBI Director James Comey. A stunning move...
LUCAS: Eight days later, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to oversee the rush investigation. The man picked to lead the probe was Robert Mueller, a decorated Vietnam veteran and former FBI director who had served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.
Mueller quickly pulled together a high-powered investigative team. It included some of the Justice Department's best lawyers, top-notch attorneys from private law firms and dozens of experienced FBI agents. Over the next 22 months, the special counsel's team quietly issued nearly 3,000 subpoenas and executed some 500 search warrants and interviewed around the same number of witnesses.
Most importantly, Mueller's team produced results. Thirty-four individuals, including 25 Russian nationals as well as three Russian entities, were indicted in the investigation. Mueller secured guilty pleas from seven people, including Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the president's first national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Each new indictment shook the nation's capital.
And as the months dragged on, the investigation loomed over the Trump White House. The president frequently lashed out at the FBI, the Justice Department, Mueller and his probe.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion.
It's a witch hunt. That's all it is. There was no collusion.
It's a total witch hunt. I've been saying it for a long time.
It's all a made-up fantasy. It's a witch hunt.
The witch hunt continues.
LUCAS: In January, Trump's longtime informal adviser Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks. That fueled speculation about Mueller's final move. Were more indictments in the pipeline? Would the president himself or his family be ensnared?
By this time, much of the political fight around the probe centered on what would happen to Mueller's final report on the investigation. Democrats and most Republicans agreed - the American public should be able to see for itself what Mueller had found.
The ultimate decision though would be in the hands of the new attorney general, William Barr. At his confirmation hearing, Barr told lawmakers he wanted to be as transparent as possible.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the special counsel's work. My goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law.
LUCAS: Late last month, Mueller submitted his report to Barr. The attorney general took a weekend to review the materials, and then sent a four-page letter to Congress with the top-line conclusions. It was good news for an anxious White House. Barr's letter said Mueller's team did not find that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. It also said that on the question of obstruction of justice, the special counsel did not conclude that the president committed a crime. But it also did not exonerate him.
President Trump and his allies declared victory. Democrats demanded to see Mueller's full report and all of the underlying documents. Here's the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ADAM SCHIFF: This report is going to have to be made public. And of equal importance, the underlying evidence is going to have to be shared with Congress because that evidence not only goes to the issue of criminality, but it also goes to the issue of compromise.
LUCAS: House Democrats have raised questions about whether Russia holds financial or some other form of leverage over Trump. And they have threatened to subpoena the full report and underline investigative materials. Barr so far has promised only to provide Congress and the public with a redacted version.

Tiger Woods Wins 2019 Masters,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304660/tiger-woods-wins-2019-masters?station=KXJZ_FM,"In a surprise comeback, Tiger Woods wins his first major title in more than a decade.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Today in Augusta, Ga., what seemed impossible just a few years ago became a reality. Tiger Woods, who seemed a longshot to win another golf tournament - let alone another major championship - did just that, winning his fifth Masters by one stroke. It was his 15th major title and his first in almost 11 years.
Joining us now to tell us more about it is NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Tom, welcome.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Thank you. Hi, Michel.
MARTIN: So this story is all over social media. It's all over the world. People are tweeting about what they were doing the last time he won - my personal favorite, that Destiny's Child was beginning their final world tour. But Tiger has won a few times before - a few. So what makes this different?
GOLDMAN: Oh, boy. Well, you know, because a couple of years ago, Tiger Woods said he could barely walk. I think that's what makes this significant. He thought his career might be over. His back problems were debilitating. So the talk of winning - of winning a major seemed farfetched to say the least. But then he had fusion surgery - that was his fourth back surgery - and it worked.
And last year, he started his climb back. He built to a victory in the prestigious TOUR Championship in September of last year. And that proved he could win again. And today, he proved he could win a major again. It's the first major victory since 2008 - the 2008 U.S. Open - first Masters win since 2005. And the 14 intervening years are the longest gap between victories in Masters history.
And Michel, amazingly, this rekindles the question of, can he beat Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major championships? Eleven years ago, when he won No. 14 - that U.S. Open in 2008 - it seemed like a matter of when and not if that would happen. But to come back now and again start this talk about Tiger catching Jack, we just never saw it coming.
MARTIN: How did he do it today? Tell me - because it was a wild tournament overall. I mean, at one point, like, there were five guys in contention, like, five people tied. You know, the whole thing was wild. So how did he do it today? How did he pull it off?
GOLDMAN: It was amazing. At first, I should say he won coming from behind, which is a first. This is his first major that he's won without having at least a share of the lead going into the final round. And he started today's final round two shots behind the leader, Italy's Francesco Molinari.
Woods was kind of slow getting going, but he said afterwards that he just kept plodding - he used that word a bunch of times, plodding. And Molinari look great early on. He was sinking clutch putts. But then on hole 12, the par three in famed Amen Corner, Molinari put his tee shot in the creek in front of the green. And that changed the complexion of the tournament right there.
As Woods said later, it let a bunch of people back into the tournament. Really good players, some of the best in the world, like Brooks Koepka, who won two majors last year, world No. 2-ranked Dustin Johnson, they surged. But through it all, Woods played steady. And the last few holes, he did better than steady. He had three birdies - one under par - in his last six holes. And he won by a stroke.
MARTIN: We have about a minute left, Tom. So does this mean something for men's golf? I know that there's this whole question of, like, the Tiger effect and all of this. And, you know, he hasn't been on the scene except as a - sort of a sad sidebar in recent years. Does this mean something for men's golf overall for the sport?
GOLDMAN: I think it does. You know, Woods and his tremendous success years ago spawned a new generation of young athletic golfers with complete games. The golf out there is really good. And today, all those young golfers he spawned, he beat them in the biggest tournament when the pressure was greatest and when they were all playing really well. And so he again is on top, which I think is maybe disconcerting for the young guns who thought Woods was going to kind of fade off into the sunset. Not yet.
MARTIN: Exciting for the over-40 set overall, right? Now tell the truth, Tom. You're going to watch it again right now, aren't you?
GOLDMAN: I am.
MARTIN: All right. That's NPR's Tom Goldman. Tom, thank you.
GOLDMAN: You're welcome.

Can Julian Assange Legally Be Extradited To The U.S.?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304653/can-julian-assange-legally-be-extradited-to-the-u-s?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with John Bellinger, former State Department legal adviser, about the possibility of Julian Assange being extradited to the United States.
We're returning now to the story of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who's been indicted on a single count of conspiracy. This weekend, we've been asking what Assange's arrest means in the debate over national security versus press freedom. Now we want to take a look at the question of extradition. We've asked John Bellinger to help us with that. He was the State Department's legal adviser under President George W. Bush, and he's with us now.
Mr. Bellinger, thank you so much for joining us.
JOHN BELLINGER: Nice to be with you, Michel.
MARTIN: I understand that there is a U.S.-U.K. extradition treaty which says that someone cannot be extradited from the U.K. for, quote, unquote, ""political offense."" How is that defined? And does that mean something for this case?
BELLINGER: That's right. There's a extradition treaty that entered into force during the Bush administration. It's been in effect for about 10 years. And it defines the crimes for which individuals can be extradited from the U.S. or from the U.K. And it says that an individual may not be extradited for a political offense, but that's not defined. But historically, under international law, a political offense is an offense against the state such as espionage or sedition or treason.
MARTIN: Would it be fair to assume that Julian Assange's defense will try to make the case that this is all political?
BELLINGER: Oh, absolutely. That's going to be one of their chief defenses, I'm sure. And that's one of the reasons I suspect that the charges by the Justice Department were very carefully tailored not to charge him under our espionage laws but instead to charge him with conspiracy to hack into a computer so that he's not being charged with a political offense. But, of course, his defense lawyers are going to say that this is really all political, it's politically motivated, and that he's really being charged with a crime against the United States.
MARTIN: I understand that there's a hearing. An extradition hearing will be held in the U.K. on May 2. You know, what will that entail? What will we see?
BELLINGER: His defense lawyers will, I'm sure, make a number of arguments, including not only that this really is a political offense. But I'm sure they will argue also that he was a journalist performing a journalistic function. It does appear - although we don't know - that the U.K. government is already working together with the U.S. government and supports the extradition.
MARTIN: So who is the ultimate decision-maker here? And what is that person likely to be guided by, if you have any sense of that? For example, is there any precedent that either side could point to that might give us a sense of how this might proceed?
BELLINGER: Well, there'll be several levels inside the U.K. judicial system. There'll be a hearing before a judge in the U.K. and then probably through an appellate level in the U.K. And then, if history is any indication, if Mr. Assange loses, he could then keep appealing all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights saying that his human rights have been violated. Historically, the British have extradited numerous individuals to the U.S. Although many of them and their defense counsel have argued that they would face unfair or improper trials in the U.S., most of those have been extradited.
But in a few cases in the past, there have been individuals whose extradition from the U.K. to the U.S. have been denied. In this case, this will really be, I think, a battle royal because Assange and his lawyers will argue very forcefully that I'm sure particularly the Trump administration is coming after him for political reasons.
MARTIN: So, as you mentioned earlier, Assange has only been charged with one count of conspiracy. If he's extradited to the U.S., could he face other charges here? And is that something that his lawyers might raise?
BELLINGER: Additional charges may be added before his extradition is sought. But after he is extradited, then the U.S. cannot change the charges later on. That would violate a treaty provision called the rule of specialty. So he could only be tried for the charges for which he is extradited.
MARTIN: That's John Bellinger. He was the State Department's legal adviser under President George W. Bush. He now heads the Global Law and Public Policy Practice Group at the law firm Arnold & Porter.
Mr. Bellinger, thanks so much for talking to us.
BELLINGER: Thanks, Michel. It's always a pleasure.

Trump Administration Considers Transferring Immigrants to 'Sanctuary Cities',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713304646/trump-administration-considers-transferring-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities?station=KXJZ_FM,"Hogan Gidley, White House principal deputy press secretary, talks with NPR's Michel Martin about President Trump's proposal to relocate detained migrants to so-called sanctuary cities.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to start the program with the latest on an idea apparently being considered by the White House - to transfer detained asylum seekers and other would-be immigrants in so-called sanctuary cities. Several news organizations had reported last week that the idea had been floated within the Trump administration and then rejected. But on Friday, the president told reporters he is actually considering this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We might as well do what they always say they want. We'll bring the illegal - really, you call them the illegals. I call them the illegals. They came across the border illegally. We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it.
MARTIN: White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley is here with us now to tell us more.
Mr. Gidley, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
HOGAN GIDLEY: Thank you so much. It's great to be with you.
MARTIN: As I indicated, the White House has had several conflicting statements about this when it was first reported. The White House in a statement knocked it down. Then the president on Friday said what we just heard him say. And then Sarah Sanders this morning said that this is a real proposal. What changed from Thursday night, when the White House said that this proposal was dead, to Friday, when the president said that it isn't? What happened?
GIDLEY: Well, we had looked at it before, and obviously, there were some challenges we faced that prevented us from moving forward on any real steps to make this happen. And then the president actually came to us and said, listen - I think this is a really good idea. We already have so many people pouring into this country in record-setting numbers - 100,000-plus just last month alone. And the problem is Democrats won't work with us to fix the current laws. And so they tell us, you cannot keep family units detained. You cannot keep family units - or they don't want us to keep family units on the Mexico side of the border while they await their day in court.
And you can't detain them here. So if you can't deport them, and you can't detain them, the only option is to release them. The problem is we consistently release these family units in the same communities - into San Diego, San Antonio, Yuma, Phoenix, El Paso, all along the southern border. And they should not be forced to bear the brunt of policies that they have no control over.
MARTIN: OK...
GIDLEY: So we looked at it and said, where are the logical places to spread the wealth, if you will? And places like San Francisco, for example, or a sanctuary city - they are designed and set up specifically to have people there who aren't here legally. That's what their stated goal is. So there's no reason we shouldn't be looking at a...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...Way to give them exactly what they want.
MARTIN: You mentioned impediments or obstacles. I'm not quite sure what the word you just used was. But it's been reported that the Cabinet-level agency which would be responsible for implementing this has had its own legal counsel reject this for legal reasons. He said it's illegal specifically to transfer people into specific areas for political retribution. On what legal grounds does the White House believe you can transfer people to specific areas of the country in order to retaliate against their political leadership?
GIDLEY: Well, wait a second. (Laughter) I just got through telling you that's completely a false premise. First of all, we already send them to specific places. The problem is we send them to the same specific places repeatedly. So you've got to spread it out a little bit. It's not political retribution. If anything, you should consider it on the Democrat side to be an olive branch. You've asked us to work with you on some things we've put forth, time after time, solution after solution. They will not come to the table.
So the logical answer is to give them something they want. Democrats say that if you even think about rejecting people into this country illegally that you are somehow racist. So the question then becomes, do Democrats want to allow these people to be shipped into their communities? That's what they said they wanted. It's not political retribution. It's a solution to a problem we face along the southern border.
MARTIN: Who are these entities who are specifically saying that we would like you to move these immigrant families or would-be immigrant families or would-be asylum seekers elsewhere? Who are these entities who are saying that to you?
GIDLEY: Sure...
MARTIN: Because we are getting different information from different political leaders. So who exactly is telling you that this is what they think the administration should do?
GIDLEY: Our contention is the conversations we have on the same towns along the southern border, as I just mentioned. NGOs, non-government organizations, are telling us they don't have enough resources to actually address the people that are being influxed (ph) into these communities. Democrats won't give us enough money to keep them along the border in detention facilities, won't give us enough ICE beds, won't give the resources we need to house them down along the southern border.
So the only thing remains is to send them into other locations across the country who are, again, specifically designed to handle it. It shouldn't be political retribution or considered such. What it should be is the Democrats beating down the gates at the White House trying to get in here to say, thank you, Mr. President. We have long said these people deserve the right to be here even though they're here illegally.
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: And anybody who disagrees is a racist. We want them in our communities. We've said so.
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: How do we work with the administration...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...To make sure they are transported safely into these sanctuary cities?
MARTIN: Two more questions for you. There is a bipartisan proposal, which was proposed by Xochitl Small Torres (ph), who represents New Mexico, and Dan Crenshaw, who's a freshman from Texas, and Will Hurd, who is a veteran from Texas. He's also the only Republican currently representing a border district. They have a bipartisan proposal which would offer a different option - which would offer additional support to border agents at the border, additional judges, additional immigration judges to process these asylum seekers and so forth. Is the White House considering this proposal - which is bipartisan, as we said?
GIDLEY: We are considering all proposals that would work to alleviate this problem, especially ones that are bipartisan, as you mentioned. I can't speak directly to that particular piece of legislation as I've not seen it, and I don't know exactly if we've taken a stand one way or the other. But until they pass something like that, these are all hypotheticals. Anybody who's willing to come forth and present a solution to the problem, we're happy to sit down and listen.
MARTIN: And before we let you go, I think many people might wonder why, when the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the White House for the first two years of this administration, if this is as significant a crisis as the White House says it is, why the issue wasn't addressed then legislatively.
GIDLEY: Yeah, that's a great question you'd have to ask Republicans. Don't think they're unscathed here for what they didn't accomplish. There's no doubt. Now, part of that is, as you know, the political realities exist that we didn't have a filibuster-proof Senate. So we could have gotten some of these things through had they gone nuclear. Obviously, that's something that Leader McConnell didn't want to do. But the fact is, they should have done a lot more.
But that's in the past. What we have now is a Democrat-controlled House, and they've got to work with us if they say they want to protect the American people. They voted for border walls and barriers in the past. They voted for measures along the southern border to give them resources...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...In the past. Even Barack Obama in 2014 called this a crisis from the Rose Garden. It's only gotten...
MARTIN: OK.
GIDLEY: ...Worse. So it's time to get some solutions out there so we can protect the American people.
MARTIN: That was Hogan Gidley, deputy White House press secretary.
Mr. Gidley, thank you so much for speaking to us.
GIDLEY: Thank you so much for the time.

Steve Bannon Documentary Lets Former Chief Trump Aide Make His Case,www.npr.org,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/702887015/i-m-gonna-get-crushed-trump-aide-steve-bannon-pleads-his-case-in-the-brink,"Klayman spent months of 2017 and 2018 tracking Bannon to a succession of lairs, many in luxurious European locales. (One such suite, walls aching with art, overlooks a Venetian waterway over which looms the St. Mark's Basilica.)
""I'm gonna get crushed in this film,"" Bannon wails at one point. ""She's gotten every five-star hotel...""
At times he speaks straight to the camera, making pronouncements about the righteous American working-class uprising that ushered Trump into the Oval Office. More often, he is seen gazing out windows into the middle distance, muttering soliloquies — wistful but always self-aware. Does he forget he's on camera? YouTube
""Steve Bannon is always performing for every person who is in the room,"" Klayman says. ""Even when he's alone.""
Why do people submit to such invasions of privacy? At a screening in Washington on Tuesday night, Klayman introduced her co-producer, Marie Therese Guirgis, who turns out to have produced, among other things, the cooperation of the film's subject.
Guirgis had worked for Bannon during his years as a film producer a decade ago. She liked him; he trusted her. Next thing you knew, Bannon was agreeing to have Klayman quietly present, shooting and recording as he went about his business.
Klayman says she made a conscious decision: ""I would let him underestimate me and never let myself underestimate him."" In China, A Persistent Thorn In The State's Side
The real art in such cinema verite is often in the editing, and Klayman (known for her film on Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei ) has cut this film with drive, perception and purpose. We are with her subject in his highs and lows, great moments, small, manic moods and dark ones.
Adding a certain sense of faded luster in the film are the friends and hangers on we see, from a nephew who brings Bannon his Coke or kombucha to Trump sycophant Sam Nunberg (""I got Trump onto Twitter"") to the former Goldman Sachs president, John Thornton, who hangs out and encourages Bannon to be the intellectual entrepreneur for the populist-nationalist uprisings of our time.
In one remarkably unguarded moment, Bannon rebukes Nunberg for calling Trump a friend. ""When you reach [Trump's] level you don't have grundoons for friends,"" Bannon says, sitting across from Nunberg on a private jet. ""Guys like you and Corey [Lewandowski] and [Roger] Stone think you're his friends."" In 'Everything Trump Touches Dies,' Few Are Spared
In the end the portrait of Bannon, the one-time publisher of Breitbart who ran the final months of Trump's 2016 campaign, is neither empathetic nor sympathetic. It is unsparing with its subject and his evident sadness.
We see the Bannon who segued from campaign chief to ""chief strategist"" in the White House, holding that title for most of 2017. But we also see the Bannon who took the fall for the political disaster following the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va.
Trump tried to straddle that crisis by saying there were ""good people on both sides."" It didn't work, and Bannon was soon a civilian again.
Since his banishment from the White House, Bannon has given interviews to journalists and memoirists and sought to find his own space in the world of politics that was redefined by his former boss.
He takes great pride in the Trump victory, and he takes his share of credit for it. In fact, he seems semi-obsessed with Trumpian energy and formula that worked in 2016. He shows real depression over the idea of losing the Republican majority in the House in the 2018 midterms.
He warns all who will listen in the fall of 2018 that a Democratic majority in the House will control the appropriations process (as they have) and block funding for the border wall (as they have) and potentially move to impeach (which they still might). He is especially fixated on the fate of the wall, which he calls ""the key to the whole Trump presidency.""
When the November 2018 election results come in, Bannon seems discouraged at the prospect that his timetable will now need some adjusting. But it is, he allows, a historical process with an open-ended time frame.
""This is a global revolution,"" he muses. ""And I'm just very lucky to be at the vanguard."" Steve Bannon Sets Sights On Europe With Planned New Political Project
Being the tip of that spear not only appeals to Bannon but gives him a mission for his post-Trump life. He is building a ""global movement"" against globalism , no irony intended. And his definition of globalism includes immigration, the European Union, trade deals, multinational peacekeeping missions and all those elitists he calls ""the Davos crowd.""

Much of the film depicts Bannon's networking with a ragtag assortment of European Trump wannabes. The more major figures of nationalism and right-wing populism, such as France's Marine Le Pen or Hungary's Viktor Orban, are seen only in stock film clips and stills. The participants in Bannon's various conclaves are more on the level of Nigel Farage (an impresario of Brexit in Great Britain) and various nativists and right-wing activists from Western Europe.
At one point, Bannon kvetches about prototypes for the website and literature of his organization, which he wants to call ""The Movement."" The designs look cheap, not ""classic"" enough. He denounces and browbeats his subordinates by cell phone.
In the film, Bannon is interviewed by Paul Lewis, a writer for The Guardian . Lewis appeared with Klayman and Guirgis on Tuesday night in Washington, and acknowledged Bannon's claim of intercontinental importance. Nonetheless, Lewis insists, Bannon is simply not a factor in European populism. What Bannon is, Lewis adds, is ""very effective at portraying himself as enormously important to that movement.""
In the end, that may well have been Bannon's intent in cooperating in the making of The Brink . But the story the film tells is ultimately quite different. The film is scheduled for general release on March 29. Facebook"

That's when his father, an executive at a boy's clothing company, asked him to go on an important business trip to Asia. It was that trip that propelled him into the world of men's apparel. In 1973, the first Men's Wearhouse opened in Houston with little fanfare. But by the mid-80s, George Zimmer managed to carve out a distinct niche in the market – a place where men could buy a good quality suit, at ""everyday low prices,"" along with all the shirts, ties, socks, and shoes they need. With George as the face of the brand, Men's Wearhouse became a multi-billion dollar empire with hundreds of stores across the U.S. But then, in 2013, a bitter battle forced him to give it all up.

HBO We're recapping the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones ; look for these recaps first thing on Monday mornings. Spoilers, of course, abound.
Welcome back, everyone. It's been two years since last we gathered around the flickering electronic hearth to feast our eyes on this world, and these characters, many of whom – I'm thinking here of the dragons and the ice-zombies mostly – would happily feast on our eyes. Because Winter is Here, and it's shaping up to be a long, cruel one, and Sansa didn't pack away enough provisions for everyone.
This first episode back is stuffed to the gills with great big thick chunks of plot – reunions, recriminations, spilled secrets – because the show's sprinting toward the close and there's no time to waste. I mean, sure, the Euron scenes drag on forever, but that's because Euron is so one-note and dull that time slows as you approach him. He's an event horizon of boring, is our leather-panted sea slug.
But everything else? Zipping along at a pace that surprised me, though I knew we've been nearing the exit for the fireworks factory for some time. Again and again, we get set-ups for the kind of conflicts that, in seasons past, would simmer over the course of four or five episodes. Now, instead, they boil over in the very same scene they're introduced. It's not immersive, no – but it's efficient.
Let's begin.
Opening credits! With a considerable upgrade! First off, that spinning sun-mobile thingy that flies over the clockwork map of Westeros has traded its galloping Baratheon stag for a Targaryen dragon immolating the Wall. We zoom down over the map, through the gaping breach in the Wall (nice touch). There's a neat effect of encroaching ice as we approach a location we've never visited before – Last Hearth. Then it's off to Winterfell, which has gotten a serious makeover – and so has our point-of-view, which takes us through the castle and down into the crypts. We soar down to King's Landing, also looking freshly spiffy, and into the catacombs complete with a few facsimiles of Qyburn's ballista and some dragon skulls. We finish in the throne room, as the Iron Throne itself rises out of the floor and pokes out its pokey swords like it's a frilled lizard in courtship display.
Pop Culture Happy Hour Which Characters Will Lose The 'Game Of Thrones?': A Chronicle Of Many Deaths Foretold We're in a small town just outside of Winterfell's walls. A young kid is running frantically – we're meant to think he's in danger, running from White Walkers, perhaps – but it turns out he's not running away from something, he's running toward it. The something in question: He wants to get a glimpse of the endless line of Unsullied, marching through town on their way to Winterfell. Arya is among the townsfolk lining the street – she looks impassive, they look worried and resentful.
Also on the march: Daenerys and Jon Snow, The Hound (Arya's face falls at the sight of him), Gendry (slight smile), Tyrion and Varys, bickering contentedly, as is their wont, Grey Worm and Missandei. So, most of the call sheet, basically. Also? Not for nothing? Two great big honkin' dragons, which do a screeching flyby, buzzing the townsfolk, who scatter like startled antelope, if antelope wore ratty cloaks and looked like they smelled like feet.
Both Arya and Sansa, who stands atop the Winterfell battlements, get the chance to goggle at their first sight of a dragon. There's an emotional reunion between Jon Snow and Bran Stark, though Bran being Bran, the emotion in question is Jon's. At one point Sansa shoots Jon a look like, ""No, yeah, Bran's weird now, bro. And Arya's got her own trippy death-cult vibe going on now, too, just you wait.""
Sansa welcomes Daenerys to Winterfell, albeit coolly — nay, icily; she's still sore that Jon swore fealty to Daenerys, giving up his title of King in the North. Also peeved: young Lyanna Mormont, unless that hilariously intense scowl on her face means she needs to get more fiber. Daenerys opts for a butter-wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth opening salvo, but they are interrupted by Bran, who brings everyone up to speed: The Wall is down, the dragon that she lost fighting the Night King is now the kind of dead that's un-, and the White Walkers are on the move.
(See what I mean? Eleven minutes in, and the characters have learned all the information that we know. Efficient.)
In Winterfell's Great Hall, they decide to send word to the other Houses of the North to take refuge in Winterfell, and dispatch li'l Lord Umber off to his family's castle, Last Hearth (from the credits!) to retrieve them. Jon sends for the men of the Night's Watch as well. Lyanna Mormont seizes the moment to call Jon out on abandoning his crown in favor of Daenerys, because ""calling folk out"" is Lyanna Mormont's entire, magnificent deal.
Jon attempts to defend himself, but only succeeds in sending the scruffy assemblage to muttering ""peas-and-carrots, peas-and-carrots."" Tyrion tries to weigh in, but as soon as he mentions that the Lannister army is on its way to join the good fight, the muttering blossoms from ""peas and carrots"" into an entire Birds Eye frozen vegetable medley.
Gendry heads to the Winterfell forges with wagons loaded with dragonglass while Tyrion has an awkward, wry and respectful reunion with Sansa. Some air gets cleared between them — enough for him to see that she's been changed by everything she's been through. (""Many underestimated you,"" he says. ""Most of them are dead now."") Sansa correctly surmises that Cersei lied about sending the Lannister armies to help and mocks Tyrion for believing the lie in the first place.
The show has placed Sansa in a tough position here at the start of the final season. She resents Jon's partnering with Daenerys and is not afraid to get salty about it; this makes her an obstacle in the Dany-Jon-Tyrion story path. So to make sure we stay on Sansa's side, the producers do things like have Tyrion remind her (us) that people underestimate her, and make her able to see things that Tyrion can't. Good for Sansa, but it does seem like they could have found a way to build up Sansa as a savvy leader without making Tyrion look stupid.
In the Winterfell Godswood, another reunion: Arya sneaks up on Jon, acting all cool and distant and Faceless Mannish, before dropping her guard and offering a glimpse of an Arya we haven't seen in years. He asks if she's ever used Needle, the sword he gave her back in Season 1. She, um, has. (Has he not been debriefed by Sansa? Or did Sansa figure ""Our little sister is a skilled assassin who collects and wears dead people's faces"" is the kind of news Jon should get from the source?)
Jon starts to complain about Sansa, only to get slapped down: ""She's the smartest person I've ever met,"" says Arya, and g z okAY we GET it, show .
Down in King's Landing, Queen Cersei receives the news that the Wall has fallen with that same close-mouthed, lizardlike, humorless smile she greets most things with, and she welcomes Euron Greyjoy and his Iron Fleet, which has ferried 20,000 mercenaries (""The Golden Company,"" in point of fact), 2,000 horses and — to the Queen's disappointment — exactly zero elephants across the Narrow Sea. (The Golden Company is led by the symmetrically featured, swoopy haired bohunk Captain Strickland, whose name reads less ""George R.R. Martin fantasy character"" and more ""Delta co-pilot,"" but let that go.)
Euron Greyjoy is also here, because he's got to be somewhere, I suppose. First he gloats and smarms over his captive Yara Greyjoy, who seems as over him as I am. Next, he prattles on before the Iron Throne, where Cersei cuts him down to size before inviting him up to her room, mystifyingly enough. Knew she was evil, but I thought she had taste .
Bronn cavorts with a trio of sex workers who can't seem to stop talking about how weird it is that dragons are back, which seems like the kind of thing that would happen. He's then given new marching orders from Cersei, by way of Qyburn – he's to hunt down his former besties Jaime and Tyrion Lannister and kill them with a very familiar crossbow.
There's a post-coital scene between Euron and Cersei that, yes, has a lot of Euron in it, but this unpleasant fact is largely ameliorated because it also features Cersei guzzling red wine and smiling that smile, which will always be peak Cersei, and for which I will always be here.
Theon rescues his sister Yara; she decides to head back to the Iron Islands to wait there, in case Daenerys loses her battle in the North and needs to retreat to somewhere safe from the Army of the Dead, who, famously and conveniently, cannot swim. (No word on whether they can boat, though. I mean, they managed to work together to haul a full-size dead dragon out of an icy lake – they can definitely pilot a Sunfish.)
Pop Culture Happy Hour 'Game Of Thrones' Season 7 Finale: 'We've Been Here For Some Time' Theon heads up to Winterfell to join the fight, because his redemption arc needs a button.
At Winterfell, several of the other Houses are showing up for the fight. Davos Seaworth raises the possibility of a marriage between Jon and Daenerys. ""They do make a handsome couple,"" says Tyrion. ""Nothing lasts,"" says Varys.
(Team Varys, always, again, some more.)
This is followed — again, astonishingly quickly — by the sight of Jon Snow hauling his mopey yet no less exquisite butt onto Rhaegal the dragon's back and taking the beast for a spin. Or getting taken for a spin, technically.
Look, we knew it was gonna happen, but how many of us had ""minute 34 of Episode 1"" in the pool? It feels like the show's burning through the stuff it knows we're expecting so it can start doing the stuff we aren't.
We get a three-minute ""Whole New World"" sequence as Daenerys and Jon swoop and sway through the air, alighting beside a picturesque waterfall to make out – while the dragons look on ... warily? Approvingly? Distrustfully? Hornily? It's tough to tell with dragons.
Back at the forge, Gendry supplies the Hound with a dragonglass ax, and there's a tense reunion between the Hound and Arya, who suddenly appears behind him like some kind of tiny, fantastically eyebrowed Batman. She does that a lot. Arya commissions Gendry to build her a weapon. Watch this space.
Not all of the Houses are agreeing to retreat to Winterfell. Sansa is still seething about Jon and Daenerys, and you'd be forgiven if you found your eyes starting to roll at any point during her dressing down of Jon. But look at it this way – coming as it does here, now, we're only gonna get one episode's worth of it. If this was back in Season 5, this whole Resentful Sansa thing would fuel a six-episode arc. You know it would. The scene ends with Sansa asking Jon if he bent the knee (ugh) to save the North, or because he loves her.
And here I'd so hoped we'd left ""bend the knee,"" as a phrase, back in Season 7. Lord knows they beat it to death back then. But then, dead things don't tend to stay dead in Westeros nowadays.
Daenerys and Jorah visit Sam in the Winterfell library, to thank him for curing Jorah last season. Their talk comes around to the subject of Sam's father and brother, the late Randyll and Dickon Tarly, whom you'll recall Daenerys, not for nothing, flash-fried in dragon breath last season. She comes out and tells Sam what she did without wasting any time (because six episodes and counting, guys let's go let's go let's go ), and Sam reacts. And reacts and reacts and reacts. John Bradley, stealth MVP of Game of Thrones , strikes again: He's got a lot to play in this scene; you can watch his baseline comic mien giving way to waves of successive emotions, as shock and anger and sorrow play across his features.
Sam runs into Bran in the Winterfell courtyard; Bran urges Sam to tell Jon about his true lineage right away. It's clear that Bran has acquired the Three-Eyed Raven's bossiness as well as his impassivity.
Sam finds Jon in the Winterfell crypts and tells him the truth: He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, and the true heir to the Iron Throne. And following Sam's conversation with Daenerys, he's become convinced that Jon deserves to rule the Seven Kingdoms more than she does, as Jon has demonstrated restraint and mercy countless times, while Daenerys ... fricasseed Sam's father and brother, for example. (To be fair, Tyrion did warn her not to.)
Tormund and Beric, looking astonishingly hale and hearty after the Wall crumbled around them last season, enter the ruins of Last Hearth, home to li'l Lord Umber. Clearly something very bad has gone down here, but there are no bodies to be found (hint). They run into Dolorous Edd and a few men from Castle Black; together, they find the dismembered body of li'l Lord Umber, stuck to the wall and arranged in the spiral formation we've come to associate with White Walkers. Suddenly it screams, they scream, they light it on fire, and this whole piece of business is disturbing.
Back at Winterfell, which should really be the name of the episode, Bran is still waiting in the courtyard. Waiting, we learn, for the rider on horseback who arrives and wearily removes his hood: a newly beardy Jaime Lannister looks around and catches the eye of the boy he tossed from a tall tower, years ago."

The Justice Department says it plans to release special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Thursday morning. Here's what you need to know.
What is it?
Mueller was appointed in the spring of 2017 to investigate whether President Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian interference in the 2016 election .
The fact of the interference itself had been long established, and last month Attorney General William Barr told Congress that Mueller did not find that Trump's campaign was involved with it .
Barr also told Congress that Mueller didn't establish that Trump broke the law in trying to frustrate the investigation — but neither did Mueller's office ""exonerate"" the president.
National Security Mueller Report Doesn't Find Russian Collusion, But Can't 'Exonerate' On Obstruction Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded for themselves, based on the special counsel's findings, that Trump would not face obstruction-of-justice charges.
With that established, what's the point of the report?
What the document is expected to reveal are the factual findings and legal analysis that underpinned the conclusions already shared by Barr.
Politics READ: The Justice Department's Summary Of The Mueller Report Trump and Republicans have welcomed Barr's summary , which they say vindicates the president and gave them a surge of momentum into the burgeoning 2020 election season.
Democrats say they can't be sure Barr isn't providing political cover for Trump, pointing to skepticism he voiced about Mueller's inquiry before he was nominated to be attorney general. Trump's opponents say they can't be sure what to make of Mueller's findings until they see the findings firsthand.
National Security Barr: Mueller Report Out Within 1 Week; IG Report On Russia Inquiry This Summer How long is it?
Nearly 400 pages, ""exclusive of tables and appendices,"" Barr told Congress.
Will it be Mueller's complete report?
No. Barr told members of Congress that he has been working with the special counsel's office to redact four kinds of information.
First, grand jury material, which is secret under the law . Second, foreign intelligence that could compromise the sources and methods from which it originated, which American spies want to protect.
National Security All The Criminal Charges To Emerge From Robert Mueller's Investigation Third, Barr said he would redact information about ongoing cases or investigations — those taking place elsewhere in the Justice Department now that the special counsel's work is complete.
National Security Greg Craig, Onetime White House Counsel, Charged In Ukraine Case Charges unsealed last week against Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks, and Greg Craig , a former White House counsel, made clear that legal aftershocks will continue even though the big political quake in Washington apparently has passed.
And fourth, Barr told Congress, is ""information that implicates the privacy or reputational interests of peripheral third parties who were not charged."" The Justice Department should not reveal derogatory information about people whom it isn't accusing of breaking the law, he said.
Who is covered under that exception?
""People in private life,"" the attorney general told senators. ""Not public officeholders.""

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Could Barr try to protect political allies of the president?
Democrats say they're worried he might.
""It seems to me that's an exception you can just drive a truck through,"" Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii, told Barr last week.
National Security Citing 'Spying' On Trump, Barr Says He Is Looking Into Origins Of Russia Inquiry Trump's opponents accuse Barr of working not as an independent arbiter but as a servant of the president. Democrats were furious, for example, when Barr called the surveillance conducted of Trump's campaign in 2016 ""spying"" — after the Russian government had launched its disinformation war on the presidential campaign.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., complained that Barr was ""going off the rails"" and that she didn't trust him. She'll trust only what she reads from Mueller.
Didn't the government conduct ""spying""?
Yes and no. The dispute is over that term.
National Security Get Caught Up On The Russia Investigation: The 'Collusion' Question The FBI and Justice Department conducted surveillance of Trump's campaign in 2016 as they investigated the election interference. What Republicans have charged since is that some officials may have abused their powers and violated the rights of at least one American.
Law enforcement officials have denied that and defended their practices.
Barr and key Republicans in the Senate, including the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., say they want answers to questions about how and why decisions were made in 2016.
Barr told members of Congress that another report is coming out this summer, after the Mueller report, that could provide some answers about that question.
National Security The Mueller Report Is Getting A Lot Of Attention. Here's How We Got Here And Barr has launched his own informal review about the origins of the Russia investigation, meaning that this saga may continue to be not only about what Trump and his camp did but about what investigators and Justice Department officials did too.
Could Mueller's report answer some of these questions?
Maybe, although Barr's implication is that it doesn't.
Why, for example, didn't officials brief Trump's campaign in 2016 about the contacts they were discovering between people in his camp and Russians ? How did the FBI use confidential informants in trying to discover what Trump's campaign was doing?

Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Other questions the report might address:
What Trump knew
One topic it might explore is what Trump and his top lieutenants in 2016 knew and when.
National Security What Else Could Robert Mueller's Report Reveal About Trump And Russia? Barr said that Mueller didn't establish that Trump's campaign conspired with the Russians. But did Trump himself ever get word about the offers of help that were coming in from Russians or their agents, including those to his son Donald Trump Jr.?
If so, did Trump believe them and actively decide not to accept what was being offered — or did Trump just ignore them altogether?
How else did Russia interfere?
National Security The Russia Investigations: What You Need To Know About Russian 'Active Measures' Americans have learned a lot from Mueller's office about the methods by which Russia interfered in the election. The best-known schemes include agitation on social media aimed at amplifying disagreements among Americans and the cyberattacks that stole data that was then released to embarrass political targets.
National Security 6 States Hit Harder By Cyberattacks Than Previously Known, New Report Reveals Others schemes that haven't received as much attention have been established too.
Will Mueller's report uncover any other types of interference that haven't yet been made public?
The obstruction question
National Security What You Need To Know About The Russia Investigations: Alleged Obstruction Barr and Rosenstein said they've concluded that Trump won't face obstruction-of-justice charges. What did investigators uncover about what actions he took? How close was the call for the leaders of the Justice Department?
What does Mueller think?
Where did Mueller come down on all this? What recommendations did he make — if any — about charges for Trump? Did he defer that to the leaders of the Justice Department, or did he intend for conclusions about his findings and analysis to be reached by members of Congress?
Barr says to expect some insights about all this: The report ""sets forth the special counsel's findings, his analysis and the reasons for his conclusions,"" the attorney general wrote to Congress.
Barr's letters about the work of the special counsel investigation have taken the wind from the sails of Democrats who had been pushing for impeachment proceedings against Trump.
Politics Democrats Demand Full Mueller Report, Lay Out Argument For Continued Investigations Members of Congress could resume that battle, however, if Mueller's raw findings lead Trump's opponents to conclude he acted wrongly or abused his office, separate from Mueller's or Barr's reading of relevant criminal law.
All these questions, legal wrangling, redactions — will this report make sense?
Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, asked Barr that very question.
""Are we going to get the gist of this, or is it going to be, you know, [reading a section] on January 2015 and then you have to flip 15 pages to find the next text?"" Schatz asked.
Barr said the Justice Department would do better than that.
""You will get more than the gist.""

William Barr To Play Key Role in Mueller Report Aftermath : NPR,www.npr.org,Ron Elving,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712299463/mueller-report-release-will-likely-escalate-tensions-between-trump-and-congress,"Enlarge this image Attorney General William Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Attorney General William Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers.
Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The news world is ravenously awaiting the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference.
But Attorney General William Barr's two trips to the Capitol last week strongly suggest that the version of the report he releases will only whet the appetites of many in Congress and beyond for more information.
That means the tension between President Trump and Congress is likely to escalate into a constitutional confrontation involving the competing authorities of at least two branches of government.
As these storm clouds gather, Barr has signaled that he will play a rather different role from recent predecessors who were caught between warring executive and legislative powers in this lawyerly version of Game of Thrones .
National Security Barr: Mueller Report Out Within 1 Week; IG Report On Russia Inquiry This Summer Barr clearly intends to be at the center of the storm. And perhaps he has meant to be so ever since he sent a 19-page critique of the Mueller investigation to the Justice Department nearly a year ago, calling its approach to obstruction-of-justice charges "" fatally misconceived .""
That memo was a precursor to the four-page letter that Barr sent to Congress last month after reviewing the Mueller report. In that letter, Barr looked at the Mueller report's inconclusive statement on obstruction and determined that there was no case for obstruction.
Mueller explicitly said his report was not exonerating the president on obstruction, but Barr decided it was. And last week, Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not want to discuss that element of the conflict at hand.
That prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to say Barr was acting more like an attorney for the president than as the attorney for the United States.
Not every observer will go that far, but Barr must have known he was opening himself up for exactly that kind of attack. In past crises of this kind, his predecessors as attorney general have often tried to either find a middle ground or distance themselves from the mortal combat between occupants of the White House and the Capitol.
Typically, they have had close ties to the president who appointed them, yet most have looked to position themselves on higher ground — or what at least appeared to be safer ground.
Take Barr's luckless immediate predecessor, Jeff Sessions. As a multiterm Republican senator from Alabama, Sessions was the first in his chamber to endorse Donald Trump for president. That got him a formal role in the Trump campaign and, after the election, the Cabinet job he had always wanted most — attorney general.
National Security Citing 'Spying' On Trump, Barr Says He Is Looking Into Origins Of Russia Inquiry But Sessions' time in his dream job was cut short. It turned out that he and his boss had failed to communicate on the matter of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the probe the FBI had already begun. To the president's surprise, Sessions felt he had to respect Justice Department rules and recuse himself from the Russia probe because he had been part of the Trump campaign.
This left his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, to appoint a special counsel to run the probe after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey .
That's how Mueller came on the scene, deepening and widening the investigation into the Russian efforts and many tangential issues as well. Unable to stop Mueller, Trump turned his rage on Sessions for his decision to recuse himself. The Alabamian endured months of public criticism, personal insults and Twitter rants, only to be unceremoniously forced out right after the 2018 midterm elections.
Sessions' predecessor was President Barack Obama's second attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who was in office when the Russia probe began and when the FBI was also looking into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.
In the more normal course of things, that FBI report would have gone to Lynch, who would have determined whether to prosecute. But Lynch turned the matter over to FBI Director Comey, at least in part to avoid the blowback from her own ties to the Clintons. (Former President Bill Clinton had briefly met with her privately on an airport tarmac in the spring of 2016.) Comey declined to recommend prosecution in that case, but he also leveled a broadside at Clinton for ""extremely careless"" handling of the matter. Later, just weeks before the election, he briefly indicated that his investigation might be reopened (he subsequently said no new evidence had been found to necessitate reopening the case).
Law Greg Craig, Ex-White House Counsel, Expects Charges In Ukraine Case, Lawyers Say President George W. Bush had problems with his attorney general picks too. The first, former Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, set off on a number of crusades of his own, then balked at his boss' efforts to use U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on potential terrorists inside the country. (He was bolstered in that reluctance by his deputy, who was Comey.)
In 2005, Bush named his second attorney general, longtime Texas crony Alberto Gonzales. But Gonzales ran into trouble carrying out what appeared to be White House orders to purge U.S. attorneys around the country who failed to find voter fraud cases to prosecute after being told it was a priority. Gonzales resigned in September 2007, after Democrats had taken over both chambers of Congress and launched a series of hearings.
As president, Bill Clinton had one attorney general, Janet Reno, for all eight of his years in office. But Reno was often remarkably independent, not least in appointing a special counsel in 1994 to investigate Clinton's real estate deals in Arkansas. Her first appointee found little to prosecute, but Congress reauthorized the probe and a panel of federal judges appointed a new special counsel named Ken Starr, who took the probe in new directions.
One of those directions turned up former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, who said she had a sexual affair with the president. Clinton's denials and testimony to a grand jury led to his impeachment by the House in 1998. While Reno had not appointed Starr or otherwise directly contributed to Clinton's impeachment, she could scarcely be seen as his fiercest defender.
The classic case of a president's fraught relationship with his attorneys general had to be Richard Nixon and the five men who served him in that capacity. The first was his old law partner, John Mitchell , who had the job for three years before resigning to run Nixon's re-election campaign.
That campaign turned out to include burglaries and other forms of ""dirty tricks"" that begot the upheaval known as the Watergate scandal. Mitchell would eventually serve 19 months in federal incarceration for his role in the original Watergate burglary and cover-up.
Nixon's second attorney general, Richard Kleindienst , inherited the burgeoning scandal and was considered a team player. But he also let the Watergate investigation go forward. He resigned in the spring of 1973 as the evidence began to point back at the president himself.
Nixon then appointed Boston Brahmin Elliot Richardson as attorney general in hopes of easing the pressure on Watergate. But Richardson brought in Archibald Cox as special prosecutor. Cox was a dogged investigator who would soon subpoena the tape recordings from Nixon's Oval Office. Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Cox, and Richardson resigned instead, as did his deputy, William Ruckelshaus (these events on one October weekend in 1973 were known as the Saturday Night Massacre).

Tiger Woods won his fifth Masters title on Sunday, marking an incredible comeback from injury and personal hardship that ended a nearly 11-year championship drought.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Sunday was the final round of the 2019 Masters golf tournament. But watching what happened, you could not help feeling like some sort of time traveler - right? - maybe going back 15 or so years when Tiger Woods ruled the game. Well, turns out he's the ruler again. Woods won the Masters yesterday for the fifth time. It's the first major championship in nearly 11 years, his first Masters victory in 14, and it completes really one of the most dramatic comebacks in sports history. And joining me now is NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Hi, Tom.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Hi, David.
GREENE: Let's start right at the end of Sunday right after Tiger won. I mean, he was about as emotional as we've ever seen him really, right?
GOLDMAN: Yeah. You know, he was screaming, raising his arms - and not just on the green where he sank the last putt but walking this gauntlet of adoring fans and even fellow players on his way to the scoring room. We've rarely seen this. He's often guarded with a shield up, but he was particularly emotional with his two young kids, who were waiting for him next to the final green. He said after the round, this was a chance for them to see their dad win a major and get a sense of what golf means to him and what he means to golf. Here he is.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TIGER WOODS: Prior to this comeback, they only knew that golf caused me a lot of pain. If I tried to swing a club, I'd be - end up on the ground. And I struggled for years, and that's basically all they remember.
GREENE: I mean, remind us about the path he's been on. There's been a lot of injury. There's been a lot of pain.
GOLDMAN: How long do we have, David? Yeah. Of course, the injuries, the surgeries, including four back surgeries - the last one a fusion operation, which really saved his career. And on his way back to health, there was the 2017 DUI arrest, which he blamed on mismanaging his pain medications. And then, of course, before that when news flashed that he had a car accident outside his home - and that, of course, was the first event in what became a tawdry sex scandal. It blew up his marriage, seriously damaged his carefully crafted public image. So, yes, after this long, long road, you can understand yesterday's reaction.
GREENE: Let's talk about the day of golf at Augusta yesterday. I mean, there were other players who had a shot to win this. It wasn't just him.
GOLDMAN: No. It was amazing. I mean, it just - yeah, it was. And the back and forth and, you know, six or seven players with a chance to win. It was the first major where he didn't lead or have a share of a lead going into the final round, so he had to come from behind. And he didn't exactly explode out of the gate. He struggled early before finding a rhythm. And then ultimately, he withstood all those players around him, surging up the leaderboard. And he told reporters that last year's British Open, where he led in the final round - that actually helped him yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WOODS: I just kept saying, I've been here and not that long ago. Just go ahead and just keep playing your game. Keep plodding along. And keep doing all the little things correctly, keep missing the ball in the correct spots. You know, be committed to it when, you know, the wind's puffing up and down. Be committed to the shot and the shot shape. And I was.
GREENE: Tom, we used to talk about Tiger Woods maybe breaking Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major wins. I mean, that conversation just went away for a long time.
GOLDMAN: Yeah.
GREENE: Is it back on the table?
WOODS: It is. As long as he stays healthy and the back stays healthy, I think it is. He reminded us yesterday he's been a contender late in the last three major tournaments. He's 43. He's still in fantastic shape. You know, with the science now behind training and diet, this could go on and maybe even soon. The next two majors - next month's PGA Championship, June's U.S. Open - are on courses where Woods already has won. He's got the muscle and mental memory, so look out.
GREENE: NPR's sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Thanks, Tom.
GOLDMAN: You're welcome.

After some stinging losses in local elections, Turkey's ruling party is trying to revive the economy. But that'll be difficult as long as President Erdogan doesn't want to share power.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
It's about the economy for Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His government is turning its focus to boosting the economy after faring poorly in recent local elections in Turkey's biggest cities. But fixing Turkey's economy could require Erdogan to do something he is not exactly known for, loosening control. Here's NPR's Peter Kenyon.
PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Steady economic growth has been one of the keys to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's continued political success. But these days, the picture is less rosy. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth - a sign of a possible recession - forced the government to downgrade its economic outlook and promise to tackle the economy as a top priority. But when Erdogan's treasury and finance minister, his son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, recently announced a series of economic reforms starting with the banking sector, the public reaction was lukewarm. Murat (ph), a 35-year-old Istanbul customs broker, says he's willing to speak if his last name isn't used. He thinks the government is overselling its ability to bring about economic improvement. He says the government needs revenue, and he's afraid he knows where they'll go looking for it.
MURAT: (Through interpreter) The first phase, as usual, would be to target the working class. The taxes will go even higher. We're really not expecting serious structural reforms.
KENYON: He says the government has been too reactive and short-term in its thinking. For instance, when people started complaining about rising food prices, the government set up tents where it sold produce at a loss, further damaging retailers. Instead, Murat says, they should be looking for more long-term solutions.
MURAT: (Through interpreter) It is unheard of, these prices. So they have to start with agriculture. We were a food export country. Now we've become an importer. So agriculture, and also the industrial and tourism sectors, they need attention.
KENYON: Candidates from Erdogan's ruling party suffered some stinging defeats in last month's municipal elections. But it's not clear how quickly the government can turn things around. Economist Atilla Yesilada says promises of economic reform may sound good, but Turkey already has a largely business-friendly system in place. He says reforms are unlikely to amount to much, as long as Erdogan and his government remain free to exert political pressure on Turkish institutions such as the judiciary and central bank.
ATILLA YESILADA: It is not that we need reform. We need a change in mentality. We need to understand that this is a country based on institutions and rules.
KENYON: That's a fundamental problem, says Yesilada. Real reforms, like making the independence of Turkey's central bank part of the constitution, would mean limiting Erdogan's power, something that doesn't seem to be on the agenda.
YESILADA: He needs to understand that for him and Turkey to have a bigger pie, he needs to share some of his powers. You can't really change Turkey's fate by pouring money over favored industries.
KENYON: Yesilada also thinks Erdogan is courting trouble by allowing tensions with Washington and NATO to increase, primarily by trying to buy Russian anti-aircraft missiles at the same time they're seeking American F-35 fighter jets. Losing the American warplanes is only one potential downside, he says. Turkey risks provoking a concerted campaign of international pressure that could trigger another currency crisis, at which point, he says, the country could find itself in economic trouble.

"After Death Threats, Pelosi Wants Rep. Omar's Security Stepped Up",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387987/after-death-threats-pelosi-wants-rep-omars-security-stepped-up,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Capitol Police will examine threats to Rep. Ilhan Omar's security, following a tweet from President Trump blasting her for comments she made about the Sept. 11 attacks.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Minnesota member of Congress Ilhan Omar says she's received more death threats that came after President Trump shared a video on his Twitter feed. This video included comments that Omar made during a speech on civil liberties, comments that were mixed in with graphic 9/11 footage of the World Trade Center.
NPR congressional reporter Susan Davis is following this story. She's in our studios. Sue, good morning.
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: What did Ilhan Omar actually say about 9/11? What were her actual words?
DAVIS: So the original context of this was a March 23 speech in which she was speaking to a Muslim civil rights group. And she was speaking in the broader context of Muslim bigotry in the country, particularly after 9/11.
INSKEEP: Anti-Muslim bigotry.
DAVIS: Anti-Muslim bigotry after 9/11. And she said that the group was founded in part because they had recognized that - and this is the phrase that is the center here, is - some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. The some people did something, of course, is in reference to the 9/11 attackers. And her critics, particularly on the right, have said that that's just a rather cavalier and disrespectful way to talk about what happened that day.
INSKEEP: I guess her defense is that she says she was trying to highlight that 9/11 was being used for this purpose to discriminate against people. But the criticism is that she was not speaking strongly enough about what a horrible attack it truly was.
DAVIS: Correct. And then this was elevated, of course, because the president takes this context of this and uses the platform of the presidency to tweet out in images that equate her with the 9/11 attacks. She has also been - separate from the president - the subject of other anti-Muslim bigotry attacks in which her image has been used against the Twin Towers.
INSKEEP: I guess we should be clear here. These are words being spoken about someone else's words being spoken. There's no actual policy here. There's no policy consequence. There's no discussion about the future of the country. But by choosing this topic, this remark from some days ago, the president is able to direct coverage at a particular person in a particular way. Why would Republicans want to do that - 'cause other Republicans have taken part - and why would Democrats respond as they have?
DAVIS: I think in her specific case, the reason why there's so much focus now is she's already been the subject of quite a bit of focus. She's a name and someone people recognize because she has prompted other earlier controversies this year for other comments she's made about the U.S.-Israel relationship. She has once apologized for making comments that were seen as anti-Semitic by many, including her Democratic colleagues.
So there is a pattern here that I think Republicans are trying to establish, as she is someone who holds views that is emblematic of the Democratic Party. Other progressive freshmen lawmakers, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have come to her defense and have said that they see a broader strategy here.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: We are getting to a level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color.
DAVIS: An incitement of violence. And their argument is that Republicans are raising up people like AOC, like Ilhan Omar, like Rashida Tlaib, who's another Muslim woman serving in Congress, and trying to use them to sort of fearmonger or play off of racial or religious bigotry to gin up the base.
INSKEEP: Is there some dilemma here for Democrats? Because as we've just heard, many are defending Ilhan Omar. But as you also noted, she is a person who's made remarks that she's had to apologize for, that she's been criticized for on other issues. Is it awkward at all for Democrats to come to her defense?
DAVIS: I think it is. But in this case, it was less difficult. There was a quicker and more robust defense of what she said. Because in the broader context of the point she was making, she was - they believe her. They agree with what she was saying, that anti-Muslim bigotry has been a problem in this country. I don't think any party likes when they are constantly having to defend or explain or apologize for the words of another member. I don't think that they like that pattern of being on the defensive about her. But in this instance, it was easier for them.
I will say all of the 2020 candidates, to varying degrees, have come out in her defense. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who initially kind of took a way to just weigh in in, has, of course, now called for the security review to protect not only the congresswoman but her family, as well as her congressional staff.
INSKEEP: Sue, thanks for the update.
DAVIS: You're welcome.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Susan Davis.

Supporters of Britain leaving the European Union say they are often vilified as racists or xenophobes. Some of them have formed a support group to share their opinions and provide a safe space.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Brexit voters are pretty mad these days. The United Kingdom was supposed to leave the European Union last month. Now the country might not leave until Halloween. And some Brexiteers say even though their side won the referendum nearly three years ago, they still feel stigmatized for their views. NPR's Frank Langfitt attended a Brexit support group in the English village of Horncastle.
WILL GROVER: What do we want?
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Brexit.
GROVER: When do we want it?
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Now.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Dozens of Brexiteers turned out one evening last week for a meeting of Leavers of Lincolnshire, a local chapter of ""leave"" voters here in the English midlands. They came to vent their anger at Britain's parliamentarians 140 miles to the south in London. Will Grover, a local councilor with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party, organized the event.
GROVER: Are you angry?
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Yes.
GROVER: Good. You should be. Your vote is being betrayed.
LANGFITT: Seventy percent of people in this part of Lincolnshire voted for Brexit, but British politicians can't agree on a deal to get out of the European Union. Grover says many members of Parliament refuse to honor the 2016 referendum and are trying to weasel out of Brexit.
GROVER: They have broken that contract. They do not respect you. Why should you respect them?
LANGFITT: Some people in Lincolnshire say they voted to leave to halt the influx of farm workers from Eastern Europe. Others say they want to take back control of lawmaking from Brussels. But Grover says Brexiteers are often derided as gullible xenophobes and hopes tonight's event provides a safe space.
GROVER: So you could come together and be proud to be a Brexiteer, to not be called an idiot, to not be called a racist, to not be told you didn't know what you were voting for. This is for you. This is for you to feel proud and unashamed of your views.
LANGFITT: Alfie Tomlinson, who's 19, took the stage and talked about the difficulties of being a vocal Brexiteer at the local university. Tomlinson runs a ""leave"" chapter at his school.
ALFIE TOMLINSON: A lecturer came up to us and said what we are doing is disgusting, racist and bigoted, and we should be ashamed. That, to me, just says everything - that you cannot have an alternative view, an alternative view which is the majority of this country.
LANGFITT: Peggy Reading, an associate lecturer at the university, blames Prime Minister Theresa May for the failure to deliver Brexit. And it's left her disillusioned with British democracy.
PEGGY READING: Nobody takes any notice of us. So why should we vote? That's very, very sad for this country.
LANGFITT: Do you feel like the vote's just being ignored?
READING: Yes. It's been shoved under the carpet. They know better than us. We're all thick, stupid. And that is not true.
LANGFITT: While working on campus, Reading says she keeps her Brexit views mostly to herself.
READING: I don't discuss it.
LANGFITT: And if you did, what would happen?
READING: I'd be ostracized.
LANGFITT: Reading found this evening's meeting relaxing and comforting.
READING: We sat down at the table. We didn't know anybody on that table. And we started to talk. And we all felt the same. That was absolutely great. Yeah, we can breathe.
LANGFITT: Brussels has given Britain until the end of October to agree on a way to leave the EU. When I asked Reading if she could remember a time when her country was this divided, she said, no, never, never ever. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Horncastle, England.

Bill Would Ban IRS From Creating Free Electronic Tax Filing System,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387973/bill-would-ban-irs-from-creating-free-electronic-tax-filing-system,"NPR's Rachel Martin talks to ProPublica reporter Justin Elliott about a bipartisan congressional measure which could ban the Internal Revenue Service from offering free online tax filing,
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
It's April 15, which means you have to file your taxes before midnight if you've not already done so. If you want to file online, you typically have to go through a private company like H&R Block or Intuit, the makers of TurboTax.
Why do you have to use them? Well, an agreement with the IRS and private tax prep companies prevents Americans from filing directly online with the IRS. And that rule could become permanent. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are trying to pass the so-called Taxpayer First Act, which would permanently bar the IRS from creating a free electronic tax filing system.
Rachel Martin talked with ProPublica reporter Justin Elliott about why this bill is needed.
JUSTIN ELLIOTT: One of the things this bill does is it codifies an existing agreement between the IRS and the private tax prep industry - so companies like the maker of TurboTax. And one of the things that agreement says is that the IRS will never create essentially its own version of TurboTax. So the IRS won't essentially compete with the industry. So what that means is that many Americans will have to continue paying, you know, $50 or $60 to use TurboTax or H&R Block instead of having essentially, like, a government option to file their taxes.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: So this has gotten bipartisan agreement, huh?
ELLIOTT: Yeah. I mean, it's a longstanding program, and it's also something that the industry has been lobbying for for a long time. And so H&R Block and Intuit had been pushing for this for years. And you know, they do offer a free option if you make below a certain income threshold. But very few people end up actually finding that, and a lot of people end up using the paid version.
So essentially, this bill would continue this deal between the IRS and the industry, under which the industry offers this free option but the IRS agrees to never create its own version of these, you know, tax prep services.
MARTIN: So essentially, that means Americans have fewer choices.
ELLIOTT: Yeah, exactly. And you know, one of the remarkable things that happened is after we wrote about this, people from other countries were sending tweets to me on Twitter saying that in Germany and Finland and other places, doing their taxes took, like, five minutes because the government actually provides their forms pre-filled out because the tax agency already has their salary data.
MARTIN: So is it safe to assume that there was just a lot of lobbying on the part of companies that get paid when consumers come in and say - these are too complicated for me to do. Can you do them?
ELLIOTT: Yeah. I mean, just H&R Block and Intuit - those are the two biggest - together, they spent over $6 million dollars lobbying on issues, including this one, last year - had been pushing for this to make it into law for many years now. And the current bill contains a lot of other provisions, including some that are supported by consumer advocates. And I think that's one of the reasons it's now getting bipartisan support and might make it into law.
MARTIN: But consumer advocates do support this?
ELLIOTT: Consumer advocates oppose this provision. But there's other totally unrelated provisions in the bill that, you know, speak to the IRS' debt collection practices, for example, that consumer advocates have supported. So, you know, that's one of the reasons, I'm told, that this bill is getting bipartisan support in Congress.
MARTIN: Justin Elliott with ProPublica, we appreciate it. Thanks, Justin.
ELLIOTT: Thanks a lot.

World's Largest Plane Takes Flight Over The Weekend,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387966/worlds-largest-plane-takes-flight-over-the-weekend,"Stratolaunch Systems successfully launched the first test flight of the Stratolaunch, a six-engine plane with a wingspan 385 feet wide — longer than a football field and any planes' wingspan.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So over the weekend, we saw a record-breaking launch that will hopefully change the way we send satellites into space.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The Stratolaunch took its first flight on Saturday. It is a six-engine plane with a wingspan of 385 feet. Three-hundred-eighty-five feet from one wing tip to the other, which makes it the world's largest plane if you measure it by wingspan. To put that in perspective, that is considerably wider than the length of a football field.
EVAN THOMAS: It was overall fantastic. I honestly could not have hoped for more on a first flight, especially of an airplane of this complexity.
INSKEEP: Evan Thomas is the pilot from Saturday's test flight in California's Mojave Desert - I guess we should say over the desert. He was speaking after the launch.
GREENE: Eventually, Stratolaunch hopes to use this oversized wingspan as a launching pad from 35,000 feet, at which point, the rockets carrying commercial satellites would take off into orbit. Now, while this weekend's test flight did not carry any rockets, it did carry a lot of weight for the company.
INSKEEP: The flight took place without Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft and Stratolaunch's founder. He died in October before getting the chance to witness this moment.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JEAN FLOYD: I'd never imagined the experience without Paul standing next to me. And even though he wasn't there today as the plane lifted gracefully from the runway, I did whisper a thank you to Paul for allowing me to be part of this remarkable achievement.
GREENE: That was Stratolaunch CEO Jean Floyd. The company says it wants to begin launching rockets from the Stratolaunch as early as next year.

Oil and gas companies will do seismic testing to see what's under the ocean floor, part of the Trump administration's push to expand drilling. Experts say that could harm some endangered animals.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The Trump administration wants to expand oil and gas drilling offshore. It's given a preliminary go-ahead for companies to carry out seismic testing to see what's down there. But what do those sound waves do to ocean life? Here's Craig LeMoult of member station WGBH.
CRAIG LEMOULT, BYLINE: Researcher Stormy Mayo searches the water from inside the cabin of a 44-foot boat. The radio crackles. And it gets a message from a spotter plane overhead.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We have about eight individual right whales, scattered about, going on long dives...
LEMOULT: Mayo's with the Center for Coastal Studies on the tip of Cape Cod. And much of his work focuses on the North Atlantic right whale.
STORMY MAYO: A population that numbers, probably, in the vicinity of 410 animals left. And the most troubling part of the story is that their numbers appear to be declining.
LEMOULT: As he talks, he keeps his eye on the water.
MAYO: There's something over there - way over there. See, yeah. There's a spout. Yeah.
LEMOULT: The boat heads in that direction. And then there it is. A right whale, about as big as the boat, floats to the surface and exhales.
(SOUNDBITE OF BLOWHOLE SPRAYING)
LEMOULT: Mayo says the greatest threats to right whales are ship strikes and entanglements in fishing lines. But he's increasingly worried about the oil and gas industry's desire to see what's under the Atlantic seafloor. In November, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reversed an Obama administration decision. It permitted five companies to use sound waves to explore for oil and gas between Delaware and Florida.
MAYO: Is seismic testing something that is likely safe? I don't think many of us believe that. We think seismic testing is damaging not just to whales but to much of the marine ecosystem.
LEMOULT: Chris Clark of Cornell University says seismic exploration is based on a very simple principle.
CHRIS CLARK: You make a very loud sound. And the sound energy travels through the water and enters the Earth's crust and then reflects off of things in the Earth's crust.
LEMOULT: That incredibly loud sound comes from an air cannon that goes off continually about every 10 seconds. Clark has recorded those blasts underwater.
(SOUNDBITE OF AIR CANNON FIRING)
LEMOULT: Clark worries seismic blasts could disrupt the basic activities of whales and a range of other marine life.
CLARK: Navigating, finding food, finding mates, detecting predators, maintaining social networks - all of this is done through sound, not through sight.
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALE VOCALIZING)
LEMOULT: Gail Adams of the International Association of Geophysical Contractors says seismic testing is used without negative impacts for research and in the development of offshore wind. And she says they make an effort to avoid whales.
GAIL ADAMS: We have people onboard the vessels that check for the presence of marine mammals and other marine species within a specified exclusion zone, that make sure that the area is free before we begin our operations. We have passive acoustic monitoring onboard that listens for the vocalization of marine mammals.
LEMOULT: And they consider migration patterns and breeding times. Scott Kraus, a right whale expert at the New England Aquarium, says that's not enough. He testified at a congressional hearing on the subject last month.
(SOUNDBITE OF CONGRESSIONAL HEARING)
SCOTT KRAUS: The mitigation strategies employed by - for all of these seismic activities are a little bit of a lipstick on a pig. That is to say they will prevent immediate mortality if a whale gets so close that it's going to get blown up.
LEMOULT: But he says they won't do anything to stop the disruption from the sound that can travel for hundreds of miles.
(SOUNDBITE OF AIR CANNON FIRING)
LEMOULT: Coalition of environmental groups and attorneys general from nine states have filed suit to stop seismic testing. So it may ultimately be up to the courts to determine what the ocean sounds like. For NPR News, I'm Craig LeMoult. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Politics In The News: Sanctuary Cities,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387952/politics-in-the-news-sanctuary-cities,"Heard on Morning Edition
David Greene talks to Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at National Review , about the president doubling down on his comment that he has the legal right to send undocumented migrants to sanctuary cities.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
President Trump's plan to drop detained immigrants off in so-called sanctuary cities appears on again, at least rhetorically speaking. Sanctuary cities now refer to jurisdictions that don't fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The Washington Post first reported on this idea. And critics saw it as a form of political retribution from the president.
The White House initially dismissed this as, quote, ""just a suggestion that was floated and rejected"" - rejected, it appears, by lawyers and officials within the administration. But then on Friday, the president tweeted that, quote, ""We are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities."" And now the White House appears to be doubling down. Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley spoke yesterday to NPR's Michel Martin.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
HOGAN GIDLEY: It's not political retribution. If anything, you should consider it - on the Democrat side - to be an olive branch.
GREENE: Conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg is here with us. He's senior editor with National Review. You often hear him on our program. Jonah, thanks for coming in.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Always great to be here.
GREENE: A political olive branch. What exactly is the White House argument here?
GOLDBERG: Well, the White House's argument is that somehow - that since Democrats won't make changes to the existing immigration laws, which I think the Republicans have - or the White House has a good reason to complain about some of that. We do have real problems - that this is somehow a way to deal with the crisis at the border in a way that is sort of asking Democrats to put up or shut up, since they're in favor of sanctuary cities and the rest. I want to be very clear. I think this may be one of the single most asinine moments in...
(LAUGHTER)
GOLDBERG: Modern American politics.
GREENE: That's saying a lot.
GOLDBERG: Yeah. I mean, well, you say in the beginning that this is - at least, it's rhetorically back on the table. Rhetorically gives it a very flowery, high-minded, almost Platonic status. This is the triumph of trolling in lieu of public policy, where the president assumes that the entire country agrees with his characterization of the refugees at the border as a bunch of predatory, dangerous criminals that are just massing on the border to invade the country.
GREENE: And polls do not show that most of the country believes that.
GOLDBERG: Right. And moreover, there's no data that suggests that that's what these people really are, right? And so then he says - the assumption is, OK, well, we're just going to give the Democrats what they want, and we're going to unleash these barbarians in their midst. First of all, if your concern is attracting more refugees, announcing that when you get to the border, you're going to get a free bus ticket to the very places these people are trying to get to will only heighten this. And even when you hear the president's defenders - some of them are close friends of mine - on TV, they always say, well, I don't think this is actually going to happen, but this is a brilliant sort of about-face or a brilliant reply to Democratic rhetoric.
GREENE: But what is the point if it's not going to happen? Like, what are we all talking about if even people who support this are saying, this is not going to happen?
GOLDBERG: I think it's fodder for Twitter. It's fodder for cable news talk shows. It's fodder for Trump to sort of get the headlines he likes from friendly outlets. But it is insane on almost every level to take it seriously. And it sort of puts the lie to this stuff about how we're supposed to take the president's rhetoric seriously but not literally - or whatever that, you know, famous phrase was. This is just simply an example of the president wanting a fun talking point that would actually lead to him betraying his central campaign promise, which was to halt the flow of immigrants into this country. He would be the greatest net importer of immigrants into this country if he followed through on this. And let's be clear. The places that these people at the border want to go are precisely the places he's threatening to send them for free.
GREENE: Or joining their family. They want to come into...
GOLDBERG: Sure.
GREENE: ...The country. So this would, in some ways - either they would go to cities that they might want to go to. Or they would only spend a few days in a sanctuary city. And I mean, it just makes - can I just step - I mean, just listening to you, it makes me wonder, should we even be talking about this this morning? Like, what is - is this news? How do Republicans in Congress, how do journalists deal with a president who, you know, in an - there's an immigration - substantively, these parties have not come to a comprehensive solution in years. So can the president just say what he wants to fill the vacuum?
GOLDBERG: Well, yeah. There is a very serious crisis. And there are serious people in the White House, in the Republican Party who want to deal with it. There are serious people in the Democratic Party who want to deal with it. But the leaderships are not going to figure - are not doing anything to do it.
On Friday, when the Washington Post story came out, everyone sort of tamped this down and said, this isn't a real story, as you suggested. But when the president reverses that and announces, no, no, no, this is very serious and we're taking it seriously, I don't see how the press has any choice but to talk about it and to take it somewhat seriously 'cause it's the president of the United States saying it.
GREENE: Could that work for the president, heading to 2020?
GOLDBERG: Yes, absolutely. Just as a talking point thing, we are living in this sort of Kabuki theater, you know, shadow puppet theater, where it's just the images on the wall that seem to matter more than any actual substantive policies. And whoever wins the battle for better talking points wins. So maybe it certainly could work because that seems to be the world that we're living in now.
GREENE: Jonah Goldberg is senior editor at National Review. Jonah, thanks for coming in, as always.
GOLDBERG: Great to be here. Thank you. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Winter is here. At least on HBO's Game of Thrones , which premiered its final season Sunday night. It was packed with uncomfortable reunions — unleashing massive implications for the story to come.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Winter is here - at least on HBO's ""Game Of Thrones.""
(SOUNDBITE OF ""'GAME OF THRONES' MAIN TITLE THEME"")
GREENE: The hit series aired the first of its six remaining episodes last night. And as NPR TV critic Eric Deggans reports, the highly anticipated season premiere was packed with uncomfortable reunions with massive implications for the story to come. And just a spoiler alert, this review is going to discuss many revelations from yesterday's episode.
ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: ""Game Of Thrones"" producers rewarded fans Sunday by reuniting characters they've waited many seasons to see together again in a story that mimicked the show's very first episode in lots of telling ways. In one scene, when Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister approaches his ex-wife, Sophie Turner's Sansa Stark, we saw two characters meet who hadn't been together since the show's fourth season in 2014.
Back then, Sansa was a naive, young girl, and Tyrion was trying to raise her spirits. Now, long after she ran away from him, Sansa feels wiser, sharper and smarter than both Tyrion and his sister/enemy Cersei, who's promised to send troops to aid them in a coming war.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""GAME OF THRONES"")
SOPHIE TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) Apologies for leaving like that.
PETER DINKLAGE: (As Tyrion Lannister) Yes. It was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.
TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) We both survived.
DIINKLAGE: (As Tyrion Lannister) Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do, but I promise you'll be safe.
TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) Cersei told you her army was coming north. You believed her.
DIINKLAGE: (As Tyrion Lannister) I believe she wants to survive.
TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
DEGGANS: I'm thinking she doesn't believe that anymore. The first half of Sunday's episode is filled with well-crafted, uneasy moments like this. Characters split apart in the show's early seasons come together again in scenes filled with tension and emotion. Their relationships have changed because the characters have changed, tempered by time and often by tragedy.
Newer fans convinced to check out the show by all the pre-finale hype might feel a little lost. It's tough to see characters having an emotional moment but not know entirely why it's happening. But for those who know ""Game Of Thrones'"" sprawling story, these were excellent moments conveyed with a minimum of dialogue and maximum of acting.
The other big story here is the romance between the show's hero, Jon Snow, and the Queen of the Dragons, Daenerys Targaryen. When Jon brings Daenerys to his northern stronghold of Winterfell with her army and two dragons to help fight a zombie army, his sister Sansa has one question that Daenerys answers pretty quickly.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""GAME OF THRONES"")
TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? What do dragons eat, anyway?
EMILIA CLARKE: (As Daenerys Targaryen) Whatever they want.
DEGGANS: The show's producers can be sneaky. In an episode that does a lot of table-setting, positioning characters and plots that will pay off later, we see Jon and Daenerys riding dragons together, falling in love. They seem the perfect power couple for this medieval fantasy world, with Daenerys poised to become queen of the realm with Jon's help. But there are hints that the Queen of the Dragons may be a little too ruthless a leader.
Then John's closest friend Samwell drops news that viewers learned last season. Jon's actually the son of Daenerys' older brother, giving him a stronger claim to the Iron Throne that she has spent the entire series chasing.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""GAME OF THRONES"")
JOHN BRADLEY: (As Samwell Tarly) You're the true king - Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.
KIT HARINGTON: (As Jon Snow) Daenerys is our queen.
BRADLEY: (As Samwell Tarly) She shouldn't be.
HARINGTON: (As Jon Snow) That's treason.
BRADLEY: (As Samwell Tarly) It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
DEGGANS: Lovers may become rivals. Siblings have become enemies. And a gigantic zombie army is marching south to kill everyone. Seems as if this final ""Game Of Thrones"" is off to an exciting and well-crafted start. I'm Eric Deggans.

Severe weather moves across the southern U.S. A possible tornado touched down in Troy, Ala., but officials there believe the state's experience with past storms may have helped to keep citizens safe.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
A line of storms, including tornadoes, ripped across the south from Texas to the mid-Atlantic in the last few days. At least eight people died, among them two children in Texas. None of those killed were in Troy, Ala., where officials believe that experience with past storms may have kept citizens safe. Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott reports.
KYLE GASSIOTT, BYLINE: Byron Straughn is a firm believer in weather radios. The 45-year-old says that's what kept him safe on Sunday morning when a possible tornado blew through his mobile home park in Troy.
BYRON STRAUGHN: I advise everyone to please purchase a weather radio and please get with someone that's knowledgeable and help you program it. And it will save you. Trust me.
GASSIOTT: Straughn's wife programmed his radio, and so he was in a shelter when the storm came through. It picked up one neighbor's single-wide home and dropped it on the roof of the home next door, where one of the occupants was sleeping. The cooking range from the first trailer ended up in the bedroom of the second trailer.
STRAUGHN: Trailer that's on top - the stove was sitting in his room when he woke up.
GASSIOTT: Mark Rose is a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Birmingham. He says the National Weather Service partners with companies that make weather radios to educate people on their use. He also says that phone alerts, as well as Facebook and Twitter, have been helping build awareness ahead of storms.
MARK ROSE: The social media aspect of it has really helped us get people's attention that these stronger systems are expected, you know, within the next several days.
GASSIOTT: And Rose's colleagues used Facebook to send a special message to churches before the Palm Sunday weekend telling them to designate someone to watch for severe weather that could happen when everyone is in church.
ROSE: Any kind of large building that may have a - you know, a fairly high roof, like a gymnasium in a school or a sanctuary in church, those types of facilities we advise people not to be in.
GASSIOTT: Jason Reeves is Troy's mayor. He credits what everyone has learned from the tornadoes that killed 23 people in Lee County, Ala., last month, with keeping his constituents safe.
JASON REEVES: Maybe some of our people actually paid more attention than they would have. You know, it's just so terrible when a tragedy of that magnitude has to remind us.

Trump Tells Asylum-Seekers That 'Our Country Is full.' Is It?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387924/trump-tells-asylum-seekers-that-our-country-is-full-is-it,"President Trump Tells Asylum-Seekers That 'Our Country Is Full.' Is It? President Trump Tells Asylum-Seekers That 'Our Country Is Full.' Is It? Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
Trump said, referring to immigrants from Latin America to the U.S., ""We can't take you. Our country is full."" David Greene asks David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution, how true that is.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
President Trump has kept the issue of immigration front and center recently. He's shaken up leadership at the Department of Homeland Security. He's promoting an idea that his administration's own lawyers and officials found troubling - the idea to drop detained immigrants in so-called sanctuary cities. And earlier this month at a Border Patrol facility in California, he offered this argument.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Whether it's asylum, whether it's anything you want - it's illegal immigration - can't take you anymore. We can't take you. Our country is full. Our area's full. The sector is full - can't take you anymore. I'm sorry - can't happen, so turn around.
GREENE: The U.S. is full, his argument is. Well, let's talk about that statement with someone who thinks and writes about economics in our country. It's David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center and a contributor to the Wall Street Journal. David, welcome back.
DAVID WESSEL: Good morning.
GREENE: What do you make of the statement that the United States is full?
WESSEL: Well, it's hard to know what the president means. It sounds more of an emotional appeal to people who feel the other. But taking it at face value, physically, are we full? Well, plenty of other countries are more densely populated than the U.S. And, in fact, there are nine U.S. states that lost population last year, including a couple of big ones - New York and Illinois. If you look at it economically, well, at the worst of the recession, there were six unemployed people for every job opening. Today there are more job openings than there are unemployed people. And the Federal Reserve tells us that there are what they call notable worker shortages in IT, manufacturing, trucking, restaurants and constructions.
But I think immigration isn't really about today. It's about the future. And given the aging of our society and the decline in the number of kids that each woman has in her lifetime, projections are that the native-born population of the U.S. won't grow at all after 2030. The only way the population will be growing is through immigration.
GREENE: And what are the implications of whether or not population grows or not when it comes to our economy?
WESSEL: Well, the way to think about this is really looking at the demography of the U.S. We are an aging society. By 2035, the demographers tell us there'll be more people over age 65 than children under 18. That's never before happened in the country's history. We're going to need workers, and we're going to need them not only to staff our businesses but to pay taxes to support those elderly and to take care of them.
So basically if we can't grow our own, we're going to have to import people. I mean, look at the Social Security system. The actuaries at Social Security tell us that the more immigrants we have - working-age immigrants, that is - the more payroll taxes going into the system, and the longer we'll be able to sustain the Social Security system without raising taxes on other people.
GREENE: So this narrative that immigrants take away American jobs, I mean, it sounds like that's an answer that is different than some people assume.
WESSEL: Well, look, if we didn't have immigrants, would more Americans have jobs? And I think the really honest answer to that is maybe. If employers find it hard to hire, maybe they'll raise wages, and maybe that'll draw some people off the sidelines of the economy. I mean, even though there are a lot more people working these days, still, among people between 25 and 54 - that's what economists call prime-age working people - nearly 1 in 5 is not working or looking for work today.
But it's also true that we know that there's some jobs - picking fruits and vegetables in California, caregiving for the elderly, nannies. There are folks - there are jobs here that seem to be much more attractive to immigrants, and they're staffing them. And of course, a large - a disproportionately large number of our entrepreneurs and scientists and technicians are people who came to this country from somewhere else. So it's kind of hard to say, but it's not an easy answer.
GREENE: David, can I just ask you about another statement we heard from the president more recently? I mean, he made the statement about, you know, quote, ""our country is full."" But as you think through the economic implications of the issue of immigration and what the president has said and his policies, he's talking about the country being full, but at the same time, moving detained migrants into sanctuary cities, these places that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. How do you even think about that idea from an economic perspective?
WESSEL: Look, it's hard to know whether the president is serious about that. I mean - really? - we're going to tell a bunch of people who want to come to the United States that the government is going to move them to San Francisco, or New York, or Chicago, or Seattle, or Boston or New Orleans, which are all sanctuary cities?
GREENE: Right.
WESSEL: If it actually happened, it would obviously be expensive. Someone would have to pay to - facilities to house them. And it's true that although working-age immigrants can add to our workforce, kids are expensive until they grow up. So it would be expensive if it's a serious proposal, but I'm not really convinced it is.
GREENE: David Wessel of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center. David, thanks as always.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Megan Stack, a former foreign correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, gave up a life of covering war and natural disasters when she had her first child in Beijing.
She quickly hired a nanny and soon realized how dependent she was on this woman — something she writes about in her book Women's Work: A Reckoning with Work and Home .
Stack spoke with NPR about the book — and the difficult decision to write about her own family.
""I would not have done it if I could have found another way to tell the story,"" she said. ""I had been through so many just sort of shocking experiences. ... I knew that I could never get that from someone else's house because you can never get that level of access and that kind of intimacy.""
In the interview, Stack reflects on hiring women to work in her home, coming to terms with the fact that they were leaving their own children to watch hers, and the role of men in domestic life.
On hiring someone to help with her first child in China
I think I sort of went into these relationships of hiring women to help me watch the kids — to help us, I should say, because I also have a husband ... who's part of this equation. ... But, realistically, I say myself because his job was travel-intensive. And when I remember that, especially that first year, he was often gone and he was working and he was just sort of coming and going. And I was very much in the house. And so I had this feeling that I had hired this woman who was coming to help me. You know that is, that is not a good way to think of it because it is part of the problem. ...
People kept saying to me ""You're so lucky that you're having your baby in China because help is affordable here."" I heard that phrase over and over again and it just had kind of gotten into my mind that this is the natural way that I'll be able to work on my book — and I'll have the baby and there'll be somebody coming. And Tom [my husband] will be at his job and I'll be home, you know, writing and not worrying about chores and it will be great. ...What it was actually going to feel like in reality and all of the things that would come along with that decision — I didn't anticipate them. I had never really thought about it. It was just not on my radar.
On considering domestic help to be family
I have consciously tried to avoid thinking of these women in those terms because I actually think there are a lot of problems attached to that framing. I feel competent with that now because now I've read people's doctoral theses where they did all this field work — and the sort of realities of domestic labor and how these jobs are carried out. The problem is, so now I'm conscious that when you say somebody is your family member, a lot of familiarity goes along with that — and a lot of labor protections tend to kind of go out the window.
Because you sort of say, well, she's here and you know we love her and she loves us and she loves the kids. She doesn't mind working the extra day off. She doesn't mind coming in even though maybe her family has something else to do — and you sort of impose. I think it often starts from a very good place and an honest place — and I understand that place because I have definitely felt that I loved the women who worked in my house, like I literally loved them. ... But the problem is when you put that on somebody who is actually your employee and who doesn't have the same power in the relationship, you are taking away more of their power, I think.
On the difference between how she and her husband viewed their first domestic hire
So [my husband is] trying to work all the time and [this combined with everything else] is a lot of pressure. I think when he was in that mode he was seeing [our first nanny], the woman who was working in our home, in a very transactional way. It was sort of like she's here so that you can get your work done. I can get my work done and everything has to function smoothly and to the extent that she can do that, that's great. And if she can't then, you know, maybe we should just replace her.
Whereas, I was in the house with this woman and I was very, very — I became very close to her and I felt very dependent upon her and she, in many ways, got tangled up. I write about this in the book. She was very involved in kind of my own sort of postpartum period and the sort of sense of, you know, how I could function as a mother. And the truth is, there was a time when she worked for me and I had the baby that I thought ""I'm only a good mother because [my nanny] is here."" And I really thought ""[when] she's gone, this is all going to fall apart.""
So I had this great love and gratitude. ... That sort of first year after my first child was born was very difficult for me and I really associated her with being able to function — and, sort of, emotional health. And she was tremendously helpful to me in many ways, so I saw her as much more: You know, she's not just a cog that is put into the machine and then if she's not working out, we'll just get another cog. I thought ""she is personally very crucial."" So we did have a divide. ...
Years went by, we both evolved in our thinking. We talked about these things a lot in our marriage — this was something that was an ongoing conversation. And I think that by the time ... the second woman in the book worked for us, I feel like we were sort of reversed where, I think, I became more transactional with her in a way. And Tom, my husband, was much more ... he had really this huge soft spot for her and was much more defensive of her. And, so, I think we went through different things at different times with different personalities — and just where we were in our own understanding of what we were doing.
On being so reliant on care-taking help — and fearing losing it
I think, for one thing, it was kind of the particularity of being in China and being so far from my family and, you know, I did have this feeling that I was sort of on my own and that maybe my husband would just get on a plane that week and not be around. So ... I was quite dependent on this woman who I trusted with my baby and it wasn't easy for me especially coming out of all the years of journalism and sort of studying all the horrible things. ... I had the feeling [that] I trust her and I don't know who else I would ever trust — because now I've sort of established in my mind that this woman is loving and wonderful with my son, but I can't just get someone else. So that was one thing. ...
And I was so desperate for work time which, in retrospect, seems a little crazy to me. But it felt very real at the time, the sense that I had to really fight every day to get these sort of hours of work time out of each day. And if I lost them, that felt like a real loss to me. It felt like I'm losing ground. I'm losing something not only the time and the progress in the manuscript but something existential — like I'm losing my place in the world. I'm losing my foothold on the work that will take me back out of this house. And that I'm just going to be in this house now as a mom — and I was really freaked out about all those issues.
On realization that the woman caring for her child was a mother, too, and had left her child to be a nanny
At first, I was just oblivious because I was so overwhelmed by my own state. Then I began to internalize it. I have memories of being shown photographs of her daughter. And the more I was understanding my reality as a mother ... I'm looking at other mothers, including [my nanny] , and thinking ""How are you handling this?"" Like how it would make me crazy if I had to leave my kid when he was a year and a half and go work in someone else's house.
So I think it was a slow process of first not really being aware of it, then becoming more aware of it and not wanting to think about it because it felt so dangerous to my status quo. ...
On discussing men's place in the conversation of domestic duties
I'm asking with this book where the men are in this conversation ... the question of child care and the household and the maintenance of the household. ... Tied to this is also the care of elderly people or the sick. Why all of those issues are just still very much kind of shoved onto the women — and we're sort of left to resolve them among ourselves. I think if there's no answer from men or from society at large, then we're just going to continue to kind of pass this work among ourselves as best we can.
It's always a woman ... it's something that the men are not really getting involved with and yet, and yet there is somehow this social expectation or maybe it's even a social pretension that women are going to be able to participate fully in the labor force at the same rate as men. And that's obviously, it's flawed. It's not going to work. We are going to continue to be hampered and held back by the things that we have to do in our houses until we manage to sort of involve men. And I think that is a huge challenge that we are facing — and I am not sure how we go forward into it. But I'm hoping to at least hear more conversation about it."
"For Anxious Kids, Parents May Need To Learn To Let Them Face Their Fears : Shots - Health News",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/15/711213752/for-kids-with-anxiety-parents-learn-to-let-them-face-their-fears,"Enlarge this image Joseph Calise, 9, plays on his iPad in his bedroom. Joseph used to get anxious whenever he was alone, even when taking a shower or at bedtime, so his parents, Jessica and Chris Calise, learned new parenting skills from the Yale Child Study Center. Christopher Capozziello for NPR Christopher Capozziello for NPR Joseph Calise, 9, plays on his iPad in his bedroom. Joseph used to get anxious whenever he was alone, even when taking a shower or at bedtime, so his parents, Jessica and Chris Calise, learned new parenting skills from the Yale Child Study Center.
Christopher Capozziello for NPR The first time Jessica Calise can remember her 9-year-old son Joseph's anxiety spiking was about a year ago, when he had to perform at a school concert. He said his stomach hurt and he might throw up. ""We spent the whole performance in the bathroom,"" she recalls.
After that, Joseph struggled whenever he had to do something alone, like showering or sleeping in his bedroom. He would beg his parents to sit outside the bathroom door or let him sleep in their bed. ""It's heartbreaking to see your child so upset and feel like he's going to throw up because he's nervous about something that, in my mind, is no big deal,"" Jessica says.
Jessica decided to enroll in an experimental program, one that was very different from other therapy for childhood anxiety that she knew about. It wasn't Joseph who would be seeing a therapist every week — it would be her.
The program was part of a Yale University study that treated children's anxiety by teaching their parents new ways of responding to it.
""The parent's own responses are a core and integral part of childhood anxiety,"" says Eli Lebowitz , a psychologist at the Yale School of Medicine who developed the training.
For instance, when Joseph would get scared about sleeping alone, Jessica and her husband, Chris Calise, did what he asked and comforted him. ""In my mind, I was doing the right thing,"" she says. ""I would say, 'I'm right outside the door' or 'Come sleep in my bed.' I'd do whatever I could to make him feel not anxious or worried.""
But this comforting — something psychologists call accommodation — can actually be counterproductive for children with anxiety disorders, Lebowitz says.
Shots - Health News For Children With Severe Anxiety, Drugs Plus Therapy Help Best NPR Ed Empowering Kids In An Anxious World ""These accommodations lead to worse anxiety in their child, rather than less anxiety,"" he says. That's because the child is always relying on the parents, he explains, so kids never learn to deal with stressful situations on their own and never learn they have the ability to cope with these moments.
""When you provide a lot of accommodation, the unspoken message is, 'You can't do this, so I'm going to help you,' "" he says.
Lebowitz wondered if it would help to train parents to change that message and to encourage their children to face anxieties rather than flee from them.
Currently the established treatment for childhood anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy delivered directly to the child.
When researchers have tried to involve parents in their child's therapy in the past, the outcomes from studies suggested that training parents in cognitive behavioral therapy didn't make much of a difference for the child's recovery. Lebowitz says that this might be because cognitive behavioral therapy asks the child to change their behavior. ""When you ask the parents to change their child's behavior, you are setting them up for a very difficult interaction,"" he says.
Instead, Lebowitz's research explores whether training only the parents without including direct child therapy can help. He is running experiments to compare cognitive behavioral therapy for the child with parent-only training. A study of the approach appeared in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry last month.
Jessica Calise received 12 weeks of Lebowitz's parent training as part of a follow-up study, the results of which are not yet published.
Enlarge this image Jessica and Chris Calise sit in their living room with their son, Joseph Calise. Christopher Capozziello for NPR Christopher Capozziello for NPR Jessica and Chris Calise sit in their living room with their son, Joseph Calise.
Christopher Capozziello for NPR Once a week, she drove from Norwalk, Conn., to Yale University for an hourlong session with a therapist. Like all the parents who went through Lebowitz's training program, Jessica began forming a plan with the therapist on how she and her husband would stop swooping in when Joseph became anxious.
The key to doing that, Lebowitz says, is to make children feel heard and loved, while using supportive statements to build their confidence. Parents need to ""show their child that they understand how terrible it is to feel anxious,"" he says. They need to accept that their child is ""genuinely anxious and not just being attention seeking,"" he adds.
The next step is to tell children that ""they can tolerate that anxiety and they don't need to be rescued from it."" This helps give them the strength to face their fears, Lebowitz says.
This approach was hard at first, says Joseph's father, Chris Calise. He's a construction equipment operator, roughly 6 feet tall, with a frame as solid as brick. ""The hardest hump for me was the way I was brought up,"" he says, rapping his fingers against the kitchen table. ""I always thought the way you do things [is to say], 'Get over it. You're fine. Suck it up.' But it was obvious what we were doing wasn't working.""
So, the parents committed themselves to a plan to get Joseph to feel comfortable sleeping and showering alone.
""It was baby steps first. I'd say, 'I'm not going to stay [outside the bathroom], but I'll come back and check on you in five minutes,' "" Jessica says. ""Then I would say, 'I know it's scary for you, but I know that you can do it. You're going to do great.' Just acknowledging the anxiety and providing the reinforcing statement.""
It was slow at first, Jessica says. But each time, as she'd been trained, Jessica would praise Joseph when he managed to pass the time on his own. ""[We'd] say like, 'Wow, you're a rock star! You were nervous and scared, but you did it, and you can do it,' "" she says.
And, slowly, Joseph started to spend longer amounts of time by himself, eventually sleeping on his own all night. ""It was about halfway through when you really started noticing big differences,"" Chris recalls. ""He was becoming more confident. He just did things on his own without us having to ask or tell him.""
Many parents in Lebowitz's recently published study had a similar experience. Nearly 70 percent of the 64 children who were assigned to the parent-training arm of the experiment had no anxiety by the end of the study.
""It is amazing. It is really exciting. These children had never met a therapist and were as likely to be cured of their anxiety disorder as the children who had 12 sessions of the best therapy available,"" Lebowitz says of the results of his recently published study.
The parent training seems to work because it lets children confront their anxieties while parents provide love and support from afar, says Anne Marie Albano , a psychologist at Columbia University who did not work on the study.
""You coach the child a bit but don't take over. It's helping the child stumble into their own way of coping and ride whatever wave of anxiety they're having,"" she says. ""That ultimately builds their confidence.""
Enlarge this image Joseph brushes his teeth before bedtime. Christopher Capozziello for NPR Christopher Capozziello for NPR Joseph brushes his teeth before bedtime.
Christopher Capozziello for NPR That suggests this parent training has a lot of potential to advance childhood anxiety treatment, Albano says. ""It is preliminary, but this paper is very exciting to me as someone who worked for 30 years in this field,"" she says. ""This treatment brings in the parents, finally, and focuses on the ways parents need [to stop] taking over, to break the cycle of anxiety in kids.""
Lebowitz's parent training is theoretically similar to traditional therapy, says Muniya Khanna , a psychologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and director of the OCD & Anxiety Institute in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the work. ""But, this gets at it from a different angle,"" she says. ""It targets lifestyle change and says, yes, if you change lifestyle and family life, it can have almost the same effect as changing the child's theoretical understanding about [anxiety].""
Khanna thinks that combining this parent program with traditional therapy might yield even better results, particularly for children who haven't responded to behavioral therapy alone. ""It's encouraging for families where kids may not be developmentally or emotionally ready to take on cognitive behavioral therapy,"" she says.
The study leaves many unanswered questions, Albano adds. ""This is only a short-term outcome. We need to follow up [with] the kids at six months, 12 months, even several years,"" she says. Not only does it remain to be seen if the benefits from the parent training persist as the child gets older, but more research will also need to be done to see if the same techniques will continue to work as children age into teenagers.

Christopher Capozziello for NPR Jessica and Chris Calise say that they even use the techniques they learned through the parent-training program with Joseph's twin sister and older brother, Isabella and Nicholas. ""It's important to validate your kids' feelings and show them that we care,"" Jessica says. ""I think this taught us to communicate better. I think it made us better parents, quite honestly.""
Joseph says he no longer feels anxiety about being alone. He doesn't enjoy it, ""but I'm OK with it,"" he says. He has learned to banish the frightening thoughts that would come when he was by himself and that kept him up at night. ""If I get a nightmare, I just change the subject to something happy,"" he says. ""Then I'm fine.""
New fears come up from time to time — like a recently discovered fear of heights. But with his parents' support, Joseph says, he's learning to face these too. ""I think I'll be OK,"" he says. ""I'll just try to do it.""

Kaitlin Scott/Courtesy Spotify and Apple playlists
There's a prevailing image of The Tallest Man of Earth — Swedish folk singer Kristian Matsson's musical moniker — of a wayward, sometimes homesick vagabond in the constant pursuit of adventure. Maybe it's the abstractions of nature that he's swooned about for so long, or the landscapes-as-album-art that sets his music in the passing daydreams of Americana nostalgia. He pines for the wild hunt, for the thrill of the trail — even in the midst of personal crisis, as was the case with 2015's lonesome Dark Bird Is Home.
So when I Love You. It's A Fever Dream. begins with a mundane drive to a hotel bar, it's a little unnerving. ""The end of night, I hum along / The driver's turning up the dancey song,"" he sings, the click of footsteps establishing the song's mise-en-scene . ""How many heartaches in this car, I wonder?"" It's still a Tallest Man On Earth song. Mattson plays a spindly guitar twirl, as a single horn encroaches over his window-gazing thoughts. The story's just a bit different now.
No longer is he a poet of travelogues and histories, spinning yarns that blur the line between the vastness of imagination and lived experience. With I Love You. It's A Fever Dream ., his first new album in four years, The Tallest Man On Earth tells the vast stories that comprise his inner self.
That doesn't mean he's closed off his sense of wonder, or that he's composing navel-gazing solitary dirges. Matsson seems to have figured out that the crests and valleys of our interiorities are just as beguiling as the vast expanses around us. He's touched upon this at times, in the most gutting moments in Dark Bird is Home , or in ""The Dreamer,"" the first plugged-in cut Mattson ever made and a fan favorite.
But here, as in ""The Dreamer,"" subtle poetics and extended metaphors are punctuated by lines of total clarity. ""I see stars in the sky / And I wish they'd return to be in me now,"" he sighs in ""The Running Styles Of New York,"" a cutting line that tethers the feeling of inadequacy to the judgmentless, boundless beyond. ""Make up for what I lack somehow / When it's all been too much.""
He returns to a similar motif on ""I'll Be A Sky."" ""I travel the fever road, I travel the clouds of my mistakes and sure I can drift away, but I'll just be around the corner of your love,"" he sighs on ""I'll Be A Sky,"" There's an evolution taking place, both lyrically and musically.
Matsson's always been something of an independent musician, but I Love You is his first as a wholly autonomous artist — singing, producing and recording the whole affair in his home. When he embarks on tour this year, he's bringing himself, a piano and a guitar. It feels like a personal challenge set upon himself, both to re-discover the sound that painted him as the preeminent Swedish one-man folkie reviving the genre and to update that sound over a decade after his initial breakthrough.
Where at times the newfound toolkit of Dark Bird is Home threatened to overshadow the singular beauty of Mattson and his guitar, the additions here never feel excessive or overly ornate. There's a lot of familiar terrain here. ""My Dear"" resembles a smoothed-up version of a scuffed-up demo, Matsson's picking as stunning as ever. It's bolstered by a faint screech of a violin. Twinkling bleeps abound on ""What I've Been Kicking Around,"" an otherwise unplugged affair that hearkens back to the heartstring-tug arrangements he mastered so early in his career.
Once we've reached the end, the title track lays bare Matsson's conclusion in the wake of a devastating divorce and death: ""But I keep the hope I carry, little things so I can love wherever I go now,"" he sings emphatically, drawing out the now over a solitary horn. All this is to say: Now that he's weathered the worst within himself, he's ready to venture forward once more."

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The history of a White House proposal for migrants suggests just how serious it is or is not.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
News reports last week revealed a Trump administration proposal that was made and rejected. Lawyers turned aside the plan to drop detained asylum seekers in so-called sanctuary cities. Now, White House officials said this was no longer an idea under consideration. But as soon as it was generating conversation, President Trump extended the news coverage for days by claiming that he's really considering this. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley spoke with NPR's Michel Martin yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
HOGAN GIDLEY: It's not political retribution. If anything, you should consider it - on the Democrat side - to be an olive branch.
INSKEEP: NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration and joins us now. Joel, good morning.
JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.
INSKEEP: Are there any details of this presidential proposal beyond his tweets?
ROSE: Not much. I mean, the president is talking about taking detained migrants who were apprehended at the southern border and transporting them to so-called sanctuary cities, which loosely are defined as jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities.
And as you say, the White House has sent spokespeople - I mean, spokespeople have been out over the weekend talking up this idea, arguing that there are huge numbers of migrants arriving at the border, which is true. We had more than 100,000 last month alone, which is the biggest monthly total in a decade. And the White House argues that communities along the border shouldn't be forced to bear the brunt of that, as they put it.
Democrats, meanwhile, are howling with outrage. The reaction of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf pretty much sums up her party's response. Here's Schaaf speaking to NPR's Weekend Edition.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LIBBY SCHAAF: This is about an outrageous abuse of power. The idea that you could use human beings, families, as instruments of political payback to exact retribution on your political enemies, this is not America.
INSKEEP: And we should be clear. The White House says this is an olive branch. The way that this has been framed on social media over the last few days by the president's supporters is this is a way to get back at Democrats. Setting aside the motivations, though, would it be legal to do this?
ROSE: The president argues that it would be. But it's been reported that lawyers inside the Department of Homeland Security had concerns about this proposal, and that's one of the reasons why it hasn't happened. Clearly, the president's critics and opponents would challenge this move in court if he actually does move forward with this proposal.
INSKEEP: Well, let's say it was found to be legal. Is it in any way practical to take a bunch of migrants on the border and just start dropping them off in San Francisco or whatever city has policies the White House doesn't like?
ROSE: The fact is that it would be an enormous logistical challenge, right? I mean, the Border Patrol and other immigration authorities have been saying loudly for months now that they are overwhelmed by these huge numbers of migrants, largely Central Americans who are fleeing from violence and poverty.
You know, if authorities are barely managing to get these people to cities on the border right now as it is, never mind transporting them, you know, hundreds or even thousands of additional miles - so it would be costly for sure. That's one of the reasons immigration authorities reportedly pushed back on this idea when it was floated initially. And also, from an operational perspective, it's not really clear how much this proposal would achieve.
INSKEEP: I'm sorry - what do you mean, an operational perspective?
ROSE: So there's the reality at the border that this proposal seems to overlook, which is that most of these migrants spend very little time in the cities where they're released by immigration authorities - maybe 48 hours, something like that. The vast majority of these migrants have a connection in the U.S. already, like a friend or a relative in some part of the country who can wire them the money for a bus ticket. And then they move on to Iowa or New York or LA or Virginia.
And certainly, this - the migrants are putting a strain on the nonprofit organizations that shelter and work with them near the border. But the idea that they remain there in these - or would stay in these sanctuary cities, that's just not how we're seeing it work right now on the ground.
INSKEEP: So we have a proposal here that would be emotionally satisfying for people who resent sanctuary cities, but would have no other practical effect. That's what you're reporting here, Joel.
ROSE: I - it's hard to see what it would accomplish. Yes.
INSKEEP: OK. NPR's Joel Rose, thanks so much.
ROSE: You're welcome.

INSKEEP: Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is saying she faces more death threats.
GREENE: Yeah. Her comments come after the president shared a video on his Twitter feed on Friday. This video included recent comments Omar made during a speech on civil liberties edited with graphic footage of the World Trade Center towers burning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked for a review of security measures intended to protect the Congresswoman, her family and her staff.
INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis, who's following this, is in our studios. Good morning.
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: More death threats, meaning she was already receiving death threats?
DAVIS: She has. You know, Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, she is the - one of the two first Muslim women serving in Congress. She is someone that has become rather familiar to a lot of people as a freshman lawmaker because she has already been the point of earlier controversies over comments she has made. And in the course of her short tenure in Congress, she has drawn a lot of attention and, yes, a lot of threats.
INSKEEP: Some of the comments were about Israel, about Jews, about power of American Jews in the United States and so forth. Now she made these comments about the aftermath of 9/11 and pressures that Muslims felt. And at one point, there was a phrase in there - some people did something - which was taken as her description of 9/11. How strong has the response been to that reference?
DAVIS: Well, it's interesting on the Democratic side because in this instance, I think you see so many more of her colleagues in her party coming to her defense - that the president, in using these words and juxtaposing her image against the 9/11 attacks, has, in their words, attempted to incite violence against her and that her comments, in the broader context of what she was saying, was talking about overall Muslim bigotry in the country following 9/11 and that she sees herself as an activist against those forms of bigotry.
INSKEEP: You said that Democrats are publicly - are vociferously defending her, in this case.
DAVIS: They have been more quick to defend her here, although it's interesting to see the debate inside the party over - they have been angry about who has been fastest to defend her and how quickly and how enthusiastically. And I think you've seen - Rashida Tlaib, who's a Democrat from Michigan, is the other Muslim woman in Congress. And she had a really interesting response in which she called out Democratic leaders for not doing enough and suggesting that they were tokenizing women of color in the caucus, where they're happy to use their images to promote diversity but not defend them.
And so the speaker, when she was asked about it, initially kind of deferred and said she wasn't ready to comment. Although, over the weekend, she obviously did call for the security review and call - excuse me - call on the president to take down the video, which he has not as of now.
INSKEEP: You've also got tape here from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another freshman member of Congress.
DAVIS: Well, Democrats see this as part of a more broader political strategy. And here's what she said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: We are getting to a level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color.
DAVIS: An incitement of violence. And her point was that the Republican Party uses images of people like her, like Ilhan Omar, like Rashida Tlaib and are trying to paint a picture of a party that is extreme or holds political views that is not in line with the country.
INSKEEP: Well, let's make that clear. The president, by highlighting Ilhan Omar, makes that the subject. This is about deciding what we're going to talk about, and the president determines that. Democrats - are they embracing Ilhan Omar as the face of their party, given some of her past controversial comments about Israel and so forth? Do they want her to be the face of their party?
DAVIS: I don't think they see her as the face of the party. But I certainly think that they see an attempt by the president and the Republican Party to make her that. And that is where you're going to see this debate going forward.
INSKEEP: Susan, thanks so much.
DAVIS: You're welcome.

INSKEEP: Winter has been coming for the characters on ""Game Of Thrones"" ever since the first season aired in 2011.
GREENE: Yeah. Last night, the most expensive, most watched, most accoladed scripted drama series in HBO history came one step closer to its end. The show aired the final episode of its eighth and final season.
INSKEEP: NPR TV critic Eric Deggans has been up all night reflecting on what was. Hey there, Eric.
ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi.
INSKEEP: OK, lot of hype going into last night. You were watching, I assume.
DEGGANS: I was watching, and I was enjoying it. I should first - we should first deliver a spoiler alert because I'm going to talk a little bit about what happened on Sunday's episode. But I thought it was one of those really good table-setting episodes where they kind of put characters and plot in place that you know are going to happen later. Fans of the show know that ""Game Of Thrones"" tends to do that with its first episode of the season.
And we saw a lot of characters come together that hadn't seen each other in a while. So there was a lot of emotional kind of reunions and a lot of history playing out and characters that were one way when they met each other early in the season, and they were - they had a very different dynamic later in the season. And of course, the hero, Jon Snow, found out that he's actually related to the woman that he's in love with, and he may have a really strong claim to the Iron Throne that rules the Seven Kingdoms. So, you know, there's that.
INSKEEP: OK, you got that. So we're talking to two different strands of people here, Eric, automatically - people who are watching ""Game Of Thrones"" and people who have been told this is so complicated that if you haven't started yet, don't even bother starting because it's just too much for you possibly to understand. But help those who are in that latter category. Why is this show so important, if you haven't been watching it?
DEGGANS: Well, I would say it's the most popular high-quality show on television. So it takes the production values of a major motion picture, like ""Lord Of The Rings,"" you know, sword-and-sorcery epic with lots of special effects, and it brings it to television. And you know, it also proved that a show with a really complex storyline, a show that has a lot of characters with names that sound the same and this very convoluted sort of history of characters bouncing off each other, that it could become really popular.
And a lot of shows that are this complex, when they get to their sixth or seventh season, they get so complex that even fans can't follow them anymore. But ""Game Of Thrones"" has managed to keep people engaged, keep everything interesting and exciting, even after all the similar names and even after taking off almost two years between the seventh season and this eighth season.
INSKEEP: Eric, I just want to note, we have houseguests, and they're ""Game Of Thrones"" people. And so we had to set up everything so they could watch right at 9 o'clock. And that was - I realized, wow, like, right at its...
DEGGANS: Yeah. Never happens.
INSKEEP: ...Actual, old-time appointment viewing...
DEGGANS: (Laughter).
INSKEEP: ...Like, of a sort that people kind of don't have to do anymore. This show is different.
DEGGANS: Well, in a way, it's different. I mean, there are several other shows that are like that. You know, there are several - excuse me, I'm sorry.
INSKEEP: That's all right.
DEGGANS: There are several other shows like that, shows that have - that air on HBO, on Showtime, on AMC. They also drop once a week. But this is a unique show. We will not see its like again. And people should enjoy it while they can because we've only got five more episodes to go.
INSKEEP: OK. Eric, thanks so much.
DEGGANS: Thank you.
INSKEEP: NPR's Eric Deggans.

Militia leader Ammon Bundy, famous for leading an armed standoff in Oregon, had a tender moment in November of last year. He recorded a Facebook post saying that perhaps President Trump's characterization of the migrant caravan on the U.S.-Mexico border was somewhat broad. Maybe they weren't all criminals, he said. ""What about those who have come here for reasons of need?""
Bundy did not say he was breaking with Trump. He just asked his followers to put themselves in the shoes of ""the fathers, the mothers, the children"" who came to escape violence. It was a call for a truce grounded in empathy, the kind you might hear in a war zone, say, or an Easter Sunday sermon. Still, it was met with a swift and rageful response from his followers, so overwhelming that within days, Bundy decided to quit Facebook. Keeping It Civil: How To Talk Politics Without Letting Things Turn Ugly
In an earlier era, Bundy's appeal might have resonated. But he failed to tune in to a critical shift in American culture — one that a handful of researchers have been tracking, with some alarm, for the past decade or so. Americans these days seem to be losing their appetite for empathy, especially the walk-a-mile-in-someone's-shoes Easter Sunday morning kind.
When I was growing up in the '70s, empathy was all the rage. The term was coined in 1908; then, social scientists and psychologists started more aggressively pushing the concept into the culture after World War II, basically out of fear. The idea was that we were all going to kill each other with nuclear weapons — or learn to see the world through each other's eyes. In my elementary school in the 1970s, which was not progressive or mushy in any way, we wrote letters to pretend Russian pen pals to teach us to open our hearts to our enemies. Does Empathy Have A Dark Side?
And not just enemies. Civil rights activists had also picked up on the idea. Kenneth Clark, a social scientist and civil rights activist, half-jokingly proposed that people in power all be required to take an ""empathy pill"" so they could make better decisions. His hope was that people with power and privilege would one day inhabit the realities of people without power, not from the safe, noblesse oblige distance of pity, but from the inside. An evolved person was an empathetic person, choosing understanding over fear.
Then, more than a decade ago, a certain suspicion of empathy started to creep in, particularly among young people. One of the first people to notice was Sara Konrath, an associate professor and researcher at Indiana University. Since the late 1960s, researchers have surveyed young people on their levels of empathy, testing their agreement with statements such as: ""It's not really my problem if others are in trouble and need help"" or ""Before criticizing somebody I try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place.""
Konrath collected decades of studies and noticed a very obvious pattern. Starting around 2000, the line starts to slide. More students say it's not their problem to help people in trouble, not their job to see the world from someone else's perspective. By 2009, on all the standard measures, Konrath found, young people on average measure 40 percent less empathetic than my own generation — 40 percent!
It's strange to think of empathy – a natural human impulse — as fluctuating in this way, moving up and down like consumer confidence. But that's what happened. Young people just started questioning what my elementary school teachers had taught me.
Their feeling was: Why should they put themselves in the shoes of someone who was not them, much less someone they thought was harmful? In fact, cutting someone off from empathy was the positive value, a way to make a stand.
So, for example, when the wife of white nationalist Richard Spencer recently told BuzzFeed he had abused her, the question debated on the lefty Internet was: Why should we care that some woman who chose to ally herself with a nasty racist got herself hurt? Why waste empathy on that? (Spencer, in a court filing, denies all her allegations .)
The new rule for empathy seems to be: reserve it, not for your ""enemies,"" but for the people you believe are hurt, or you have decided need it the most. Empathy, but just for your own team. And empathizing with the other team? That's practically a taboo.
And it turns out that this brand of selective empathy is a powerful force.
In the past 20 years, psychologists and neurologists have started to look at how empathy actually works, in our brains and our hearts, when we're not thinking about it. And one thing they've found is that ""one of the strongest triggers for human empathy is observing some kind of conflict between two other parties,"" says Fritz Breithaupt, a professor at Indiana University who studies empathy. ""Once they take the side, they're drawn into that perspective. And that can lead to very strong empathy and too strong polarization with something you only see this one side and not the other side any longer.""
A classic example is the Super Bowl, or any Auburn, Alabama game."

This story is based on an episode from Life Kit's guide, How To Buy A House . Check out these episodes: "" Mortgage Secrets That Will Save You Money "" and "" Should I Rent or Buy A House? "" Subscribe to listen later on Apple Podcasts , NPR One or your favorite podcast app.
The journey to buying a house can lead you down some perilous roads, past pushy real estate agents, self-interested bankers and not-so-meticulous home inspectors. We lay out a step-by-step approach to help you avoid those pitfalls, from what to look for in a house that will truly make you happy to assembling a team to help close the deal.
1. Find a good buyer's agent.
You can search for a house on your own through sites such as Zillow or Opendoor.com, but Ilyce Glink, author of 100 Questions Every First-Time Homebuyer Should Ask , doesn't recommend it. Real estate agents come in both buyer's and seller's versions: When you buy a home, a buyer's agent will represent your interests.
""They owe you a fiduciary duty, meaning that they have a responsibility to help you do things in the very best way that they can for your benefit,"" Glink says.
Be picky about the agent, Glink says, and make sure they're someone you are comfortable with and listens carefully to your needs.
""You really are interviewing for what I would call a short-term marriage,"" she says.
2. Make a list of what you need in a new home, and another of what you want.
Glink recommends that people buying as a couple each make their own list. When she and her husband were buying a house, she wanted a fireplace, while her husband wanted to be a half-hour or less from the train station.
And while a granite countertop and hardwood floor might thrill you for a time, what makes you happy over the long run might be different, says Elizabeth Dunn, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia who studies happiness and spending.
Dunn says those unchanging features fall victim to hedonic adaptation — our tendency to return to a set level of happiness once a novelty wears off. For lasting happiness, look for things that change — a view from a window or a backyard that varies with the seasons. Mortgage Secrets That Will Save You Money
Even more important for happiness is how we spend our time, Dunn says. A positive: space to hang out with family and friends. A huge negative: a long commute.
""If you want to be unhappy, you should arrange to have a really long commute to work every day,"" Dunn says. ""Going from having no commute to having a one-hour commute to work has an equivalent negative effect on happiness as becoming unemployed.""
3. Get preapproved for a mortgage before you start serious house-hunting.
Preapproval will help you understand how much house you can afford, and will also make sellers take you seriously.
It also means when you find a house you love, you can get the paperwork moving quickly. ""Preapproval means that you know that the lender is going to be there when you're ready to buy,"" Glink says.
4. Plan on a monthly mortgage payment that is no more than a third of your take-home pay — and don't just listen to what the bank says you can afford.
A lender often doesn't account for other demands on your budget, such as childcare, or the price of home maintenance and repairs, says Michelle Singletary, a personal finance author and columnist with The Washington Post . 6 Simple Rules For Saving Money
""If you buy a 100-year-old house, I promise you it's going to have 100-year-old problems, and those can be pretty expensive,"" Glink says. ""New houses aren't problem free either and so it's a good rule of thumb that you'll expect to spend between $5,000 and $8,000 a year taking care of your property.""
5. Make an offer for what the house is actually worth.
Your agent can help you decide what a house is worth, based on how long it's been on the market and how many people are looking at it, Glink says.
""You don't want to go in too low, because when you go in with a lowball bid, unless that house has been on the market for two years, they're going to laugh at you,"" she says. ""They're not even going to respond.""
6. Remember: There will always be another house.
Don't fall so hard for a house that you pay more than it's worth or that you can afford.
""It seems like there isn't another house because you've seen all the houses on the market,"" Glink says. ""But all you have to do is wait a week, two weeks, a month or so, and then a whole new crop of sellers are going to put their houses on the market.""
7. Get a good home inspection before you buy.
Your agent can give you a list of names that the real estate agency has already vetted, Glink says. She suggests you ask for references from recent clients and whether you can accompany the inspection to make sure no dark corners go unchecked.
Glink also suggests hiring a lawyer to look over your mortgage documents just in case something unexpected pops up as you close on the home.
""It's not inappropriate to spend $400 or $500 on the home inspector and $400 on your attorney,"" she says, ""because this is what goes into making a purchase feel like as safe and solid an investment in your future as you can."" Facebook "

A truth less universally acknowledged is that heroines may have flaws but they must always be kind. But the young adult romance If I'm Being Honest by Emily Wibberley and Austin Siegemund-Broka presents a heroine who is undeniably a Mean Girl. The novel is a contemporary version of Shakespeare's Taming of The Shrew , set in a wealthy Los Angeles high school — the twist is that our heroine, Cameron Bright, embarks on a scheme to tame herself.
Cameron is known for always honestly — or bluntly or cruelly — voicing her opinions. She's had a crush on her friend Andrew forever, and when their first hookup is interrupted by a weird girl named Paige, Cameron has some choice words that cool Andrew's interest in her.
So Cameron plans to win back Andrew's affections by making amends with everyone she's wronged, starting with Paige and her brother — who Cameron has nicknamed ""Barfy Brendan."" The list goes on. Cameron was not nice. In the process, she develops new friendships and goes deep on other complicated relationships in her life (her parents, especially). Her scheme works, but by the time Andrew asks her out, she's already genuinely fallen for Brendan. Cameron may be a mean girl, but she's also smart, self-aware and willing to do the hard work necessary to earn her happy ever after — and that makes her heroine material in my book.

On Tax Day: The IRS Is Short Of Money : NPR,www.npr.org,Scott Horsley,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713411490/on-tax-day-the-irs-is-short-of-money,"Enlarge this image The IRS budget has been cut sharply over the past decade, but President Trump has suggested spending an extra $362 million on tax enforcement next year. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images The IRS budget has been cut sharply over the past decade, but President Trump has suggested spending an extra $362 million on tax enforcement next year.
Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Here's a little encouragement for last-minute tax filers: Your chance of being audited by the IRS this year is as low as it has been in decades.
Years of budget cuts have hollowed out enforcement of the nation's tax laws. Now, even the Trump administration says those cuts may have gone too far.
Adjusted for inflation, IRS funding has been cut by about 25 percent since the beginning of the decade. And staffing for tax enforcement has fallen by nearly a third.
""Right now we have about the same number of auditors at the IRS that we had back in the 1950s when the economy was about one-seventh the size,"" said Chuck Marr, who studies tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
All Tech Considered A Real-Life Tax Scam: This Is What IRS Phone Fraud Sounds Like The IRS has always been something of a political punching bag. When Republicans took control of the House in 2010, they began pushing for deep cuts in the agency's budget.
""I know that when we were in the majority, that we took great pleasure in cutting the amount of money that was going to the IRS every year,"" Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, said last week.
The IRS made an easy target. The agency was the enforcer of the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans despise. There were charges that the IRS unfairly penalized conservative groups that tried to apply for tax-exempt status. And even in the best of times, people don't have warm and fuzzy feelings about the tax collector.
""There's always a concern among Americans that you have the jack-booted thugs coming into your business or office or home and auditing away,"" said Mark Mazur, who was assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy in the Obama administration.
Over time, both the criticism and the budget cuts have taken a toll.
Politics IRS Computer Glitch Caused By 'Master File' Issue Morale at the agency is down, experienced agents are heading for the exits, and less than 3 percent of the IRS workforce is under 30, said Tony Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents IRS workers.
""The IRS has essentially lost an entire generation of employees,"" he said. ""When you look at pay freezes, retirement cuts, government shutdowns, it makes it incredibly difficult to recruit and retain new talent.""
With the IRS cutting back sharply on tax enforcement, the federal government is leaving money it's owed by taxpayers on the table.
The number of individual audits fell 42 percent between 2010 and 2017, according to ProPublica . During that time, IRS scrutiny of taxpayers making more than $500,000 dropped more sharply than its audits of those making under $200,000.
""This clearly indicates a policy shift of some sort — cracking down on people who have little and going easier on people who are doing very, very well,"" Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., complained during a congressional hearing last week.
Now, after nearly a decade of cutting, the Trump administration is calling for a course correction. President Trump has suggested side-stepping budget caps to spend an extra $362 million on tax enforcement next year.
Business Shutdown Squeezes IRS Workers Just As The Tax-Filing Season Is About To Start The new IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig, argued that additional spending is necessary to reassure Americans that tax cheats stand a good chance of getting caught.
""Personally, I have both eyes focused on enforcement,"" he told lawmakers last week.
Rettig notes that the vast majority of Americans — 83 percent — already pay the taxes they owe voluntarily. But if a more visible cop on the beat could boost compliance by just 1 percentage point, that would mean an extra $30 billion a year in revenue for the government.
On the other hand, government revenues could take an equally big hit if the lack of enforcement triggers even a small drop in Americans' willingness to pay.
""Americans don't really want to feel like chumps,"" said Mazur, who now directs the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""They want to make sure like everybody is paying their fair share."""

Bangladesh Struggles To Cope With Pressures Of Hosting 1 Million Rohingya Refugees,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/710256666/bangladesh-struggles-to-cope-with-pressures-of-hosting-1-million-rohingya-refuge,"It's high tide in Cox's Bazar and there's a traffic jam right on the beach at Bangladesh's most prominent seaside resort. The lone road that leads south to the sprawling new camps sheltering hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees is closed for repairs. All the traffic has been diverted onto the gray sand beach, where people are taking selfies and strolling in the shallow surf.

All traffic heading south out of town was diverted on to the beach when the main road was closed for repairs.
Jason Beaubien/NPR Little green rickshaws jostle with passenger vans and pickup trucks to get over a sand dune and back onto the paved roadway to head in the direction of the camps. At high tide, some of the vehicles get stuck in the wet sand, blocking those behind them.
The sudden influx of 700,000 refugees in 2017 has had a huge negative impact on the local community, says Mohammad Abul Kalam, the head of Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission in Cox's Bazar.
World Rohingya Settle In For The Long Haul, Even As Bangladesh Wants Refugees To Go Home ""We're being outnumbered by the sheer number of the refugee population,"" he says.
Beyond this, ""The infrastructure has been under unbelievable pressure,"" Kalam says — not just from the refugees themselves, but also from the tremendous aid effort underway to keep so many people sheltered, fed and healthy.
Kalam is the Bangladesh government's top local official regarding the Rohingya. He says the area's roads and bridges are being beaten up by convoys of aid vehicles shuttling from Cox's Bazar to the camps.
""They were not meant for this much population,"" he says.
Kalam points out that Ukhiya, the administrative district that includes the camps, has a population of 230,000 people. ""Yet we now have more than 700,000 in the refugee population,"" he says. ""So the entire demographic balance has been reversed.""
Late in 2017, Rohingya fled from Myanmar into Bangladesh to escape attacks by soldiers and pro-government militias. The U.N. and human rights groups condemned the attacks as a campaign of ethnic cleansing and an organized effort to drive the Rohingya out of Myanmar.
Thousands of people were killed. The refugees who arrived in Bangladesh in 2017 joined other Rohingya who'd fled earlier waves of violence and pushed the total number of Rohingya refugees in the area up to nearly 1 million.
Kalam notes that the refugees' activities have been detrimental to the environment. They've cut down all of the forests surrounding the camps for firewood in what is a nature preserve. They've diverted streams as they've terraced hillsides to build new shelters.
Firewood is stacked for sale in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. Local residents complain that the Rohingya have cut down all the trees surrounding the camps and burned them in cooking fires. Jason Beaubien/NPR Jason Beaubien/NPR He claims they are driving up some food prices — while, at the same time, food aid diverted to local markets is driving down demand for Bangladesh-grown rice. And, he says, the refugees are pushing down wages by accepting jobs at lower pay than Bangladeshis are willing to accept. Aid convoys beat up the local roads and further congest what was already heavy traffic.
The refugees are not supposed to leave the camps. Nor are they allowed to work in Bangladesh. Kalam says they do both. He doesn't blame them.
""You cannot really stop people from being engaged in work of one kind or another,"" he says. ""It always happens.""
But he says the Rohingya are taking away jobs from Bangladeshis, particularly low-skilled jobs on farms and other manual labor.
The presence of nearly a million refugees is in this part of Bangladesh, he says, is unsustainable.
""It's very, very difficult for us,"" he says. ""We are already an overpopulated country with more than 160 million population in very limited space. It would be really very difficult for Bangladesh to allow them to integrate within our own society.""
Given the trauma that the Rohingya experienced in 2017, it appears unlikely that many will want to return to Myanmar anytime soon. Late last year, there was an effort to repatriate any Rohingya who wanted to go back. The Bangladeshi government offered free transportation and moving benefits. No one signed up.
So Bangladesh last year proposed another solution: move from the overcrowded camps outside Cox's Bazar to a camp with brand-new dormitories that can accommodate 100,000 refugees.

Gallo Images/Getty Images The only problem: It's on an island in the Bay of Bengal, more than 15 miles from the mainland.
The Bhasan Char island emerged 20 years ago, formed in the bay's shifting currents. It is uninhabited and was designated by the government as a forest reserve in 2013. Kamal says Bangladesh has spent $300 million building housing, concrete seawalls and cyclone shelters on the giant sandbar.
""Very good quality shelters and other infrastructure are put in place there, including long barriers meant to secure the inhabitants from any cyclonic hit from the Bay of Bengal,"" he says. ""The government is suspecting that the Rohingyas will have a better life there.""
But Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director for Human Rights Watch, says it's a terrible idea. She warns the island will serve more as a detention facility than upgraded refugee housing.
""The truth is these are people who are going to be locked on this island,"" she says. ""Because they're not really allowed to leave.""

Jason Beaubien/NPR Jason Beaubien/NPR Hamid Hassin, sitting in his shelter in the Balukali refugee camp, says he has no desire to move to a new island camp being built for the Rohingya refugees.
Jason Beaubien/NPR Most international aid groups have been skeptical of the plan to relocate refugees to Bhasan Char. Supplies, aid workers, even teachers would have to be ferried in by boat. The island is controlled by the Bangladesh navy and it's unclear if the Rohingya would have the same access to international aid that they currently do in the camps.
Kalam insists refugees won't be forced to move to the island and any relocations will be voluntary. The government had planned to start sending them to the island April 15, but now it's unclear when it may begin. The government may find few takers. There's little enthusiasm among refugees in the sprawling Balukali camp.
In his bamboo and tarp shelter, Hamid Hassin, 30, says he has no desire to move to the island. He doesn't want to be separated from other Rohingya in the camps and is worried the low-lying island could flood in a major storm.
""We fled Myanmar to save our lives,"" he says. ""I don't want to end up dying on that island."""

Their Coffee Is World-Renowned.

Now More Guatemalans Are Actually Drinking It Facebook October 10, 2017 12:10 PM ET Anna-Cat Brigida
A barista at El Injerto coffee shop in Guatemala City pours water into a chemex. Guatemala has long been known for its coffee, but a culture of artisanal coffee has only recently taken root here. Anna-Catherine Brigida hide caption toggle caption Anna-Catherine Brigida A barista at El Injerto coffee shop in Guatemala City pours water into a chemex. Guatemala has long been known for its coffee, but a culture of artisanal coffee has only recently taken root here. Anna-Catherine Brigida
The El Injerto coffee shop, with its silver stools, brick-and-chalkboard walls and The Weeknd's ""I Feel It Coming"" playing softly in the background, resembles many cafes in Brooklyn or Los Angeles. But it is in Guatemala City, where paying $5 for a cup of coffee has not always been so common.
Coffee has been one of Guatemala's most important export crops since at least the early 1800s. Only in the past few years have Guatemalans started to consume their own world-renowned product on a larger scale.
""The growth has been exponential in the last five to eight years,"" says Evelio Francisco Alvarado, general manager of Guatemala's National Coffee Association, known by its Spanish acronym, Anacafe . ""This growth has stemmed from the increase in coffee shops not only in the capital, but also in other parts of the country.""
Anacafe reports that 10 percent of the coffee produced in Guatemala now stays in the country. Just a decade ago, nearly 100 percent of Guatemalan coffee was exported to places such as the U.S., Europe and Japan.
The rise of independent coffee shops
That began to change in 2009, the same year thatthe Aguirre family opened El Injerto with a goal of allowing Guatemalans to enjoy their own nation's coffee. The family has owned a plantation of the same name since 1874, producing coffee in Huehuetenango, a province in the western highlands, more than 200 miles from the capital.
For more than a century, most of El Injerto's coffee left the country. Now, about 10 percent of the coffee produced on the plantation stays within the Central American nation, served at one of a handful of El Injerto coffee shops in the capital and surrounding area.
""Our idea is to continue leaving more coffee here in Guatemala, and export less,"" says Paulina Aguirre, manager of the El Injerto cafe. She works in the family business with her father, Arturo, and siblings Arturo Jr. and Maria Gabriela.
Most of this growing consumption happens at independent coffee shops that only buy from Guatemalan producers and use artisanal preparation methods. That includes Rojo Cerezo, one of the first independent coffee shops in Guatemala City's Cuatro Grados Norte neighborhood, which now has the highest concentration of coffee shops in the city.
Rogelio Dávila opened the coffee shop in 2013 to help spread coffee culture among his fellow Guatemalans. After working as a barista in other coffee chains, he was also looking for more freedom to select his own coffee from different regions of Guatemala and to experiment with new preparation methods. Plus, he wanted to create a more personal atmosphere where he could share what he had learned about coffee with his customers.

Anna-Catherine Brigida hide caption toggle caption Anna-Catherine Brigida A cappuccino at the family-owned El Injerto coffee shop, which was opened with a goal of allowing Guatemalans to enjoy their own nation's coffee. Anna-Catherine Brigida
""I've always liked the idea of coffee,"" says Dávila, who only serves coffee bought in his own country. ""I believe that the concept of coffee is not just trying a cup of coffee, but the whole atmosphere.""
As one of the first artisanal coffee shops in the area, Rojo Cerezo's approach to coffee wasn't immediately accepted. Some customers complained that the coffee took too long to prepare. That has shifted as the coffee shop has grown in popularity.
""Before, I was like any Guatemalan: misinformed,"" says 21-year-old Rony Hernandez, a frequent customer at Rojo Cerezo. ""You think that you know about coffee when you start to have a cappuccino, or when you know what an Americano is, but to really appreciate a good coffee, you need artisanal methods.""
'Third-wave' methods
Hernandez started coming to Rojo Cerezo about a year ago, and has been converted into a lover of so-called ""third-wave"" methods, which go beyond brewing in a coffee pot or using an espresso machine.
Instead, artisanal coffee is prepared using a wider variety of methods, some which have existed for years but have just recently become widespread. A barista pours water into a dripper, which is a funnel atop a flat base, or a chemex, an hourglass-shaped container with an open top for the filter. Also popular in third-wave preparation is the vacuum coffee method, which uses a siphon pot. Heat is placed beneath the lower, glass ball-shaped section of the pot. As it heats up, the water is pushed into the top cylindrical portion. The heat is then removed and brewed coffee falls back down into the ball.
""Now I prefer to appreciate the tones of the coffee, and the artisanal methods, and what they've taught me about how the process works, whether it's the weight of the coffee, the type of grain, where it comes from, the amount of water, the temperature — all of these processes and details,"" he says.
There are now more than a dozen independent coffee shops in the Cuatro Grados Norte neighborhood, but the trend reaches beyond the capital city. They are now popping up all over the country.
In December 2016, Pedro Martínez opened Café Sol in the colonial city of Antigua after working for five years as a barista in the Guatemalan coffee chain &Café. He became interested in the third wave of coffee, using YouTube and blogs to learn these methods.
He credits the increasing amount of information shared online with the country's coffee boom, because it has made ""coffee culture"" more accessible for people like him who want to learn, but don't know anyone who can teach them.
""When we were little, I remember there was always a jar of instant coffee in the house, and we never worried about whether it was good quality. We just liked it,"" he says.
That is no longer the case in Guatemala, where baristas and coffee-shop owners like Martínez are spreading their knowledge. Guatemalans have always been proud of their coffee, but now they are finally able to understand why.
""Coffee is very symbolic for the country and its culture,"" Martínez says. ""Guatemala has great coffee, so why don't we drink it ourselves?""

Dominic Valente for NPR Arivaca, Ariz., is a tiny village, population about 700, with an outsize problem.
It sits just 11 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and has become a magnet for self-styled militia groups from out of state that say they want to patrol the border and stop migrants. Their presence has strained a town that has long prided itself on its live-and-let-live, cooperative spirit.
When the women of Arivaca gather for Monday afternoon gentle yoga, there are certain topics they know to avoid.
Civility Wars In These Divided Times, Is Civility Under Siege? ""We just don't talk politics,"" says Sue Soucy, a staunch supporter of President Trump. Then she adds: ""Will I vote for Trump again? Absolutely!""
""And I would die before I would!"" chimes in Marjorie Leon, to gales of laughter.

Dominic Valente for NPR Jaffe first came to Arivaca in 1971, part of a group of hippies who set up tepees and established a community off the grid, riding horseback and hauling their own wood and water. That community-minded spirit persists, these women say, and the militias are not welcome.
""It's puzzling why they would be attracted to a place like this,"" says Dresang.
""The problem with the militias is you don't know who they are and you don't know what they want,"" says Kasulaitis, a local historian whose roots in Arivaca go way back. She grew up on ranchland that has been in her family since 1879. ""I put 'No Trespassing' signs on my fence, not because of the border crossers, but because of the militia. They're a worry to me.""

""It's made some of the locals more standoffish, a little more defensive,"" says Farrington.

I don't think traveling across the country with your little guns and your Rambo attitude, and going out and hunting human beings, is acceptable behavior. It's not.
Maggie Milinovitch, co-owner, La Gitana Cantina
Look for a sign of the tensions, and you'll find it on the front door of the one bar and restaurant in town, La Gitana Cantina. The owners have grown so fed up with the militias that they've posted a sign saying ""UNWANTED: Members of any vigilante border militia group, including, but not limited to AZ Border Recon. Do Not Enter our establishment.""
""We've had confrontations with them about bringing their guns in here, or harassing people that work here,"" says co-owner Maggie Milinovitch. ""And so, we just put the sign up. You cannot come in. It's the only way I have of putting my 2 cents in, saying that I don't think traveling across the country with your little guns and your Rambo attitude, and going out and hunting human beings, is acceptable behavior. It's not.""

Dominic Valente for NPR One of those not welcome at La Gitana is Tim Foley, the founder of a group called Arizona Border Recon .
Foley lives in Arivaca. He moved here two years ago. He is lean and sun-weathered, with piercing, pale blue eyes.
Foley prefers to call Arizona Border Recon an ""intelligence gathering company,"" rather than a militia. Either way, he organizes armed patrols to the borderlands.
""When we do ops,"" he says, ""I'll bring my guys in, because a lot of places Border Patrol won't go to. And we'll plug up that section of the border.""

As for how he's viewed in town, Foley shrugs. ""I've been called a racist. I've been called a Nazi, and everything else,"" he says. ""I just ignore 'em and let 'em flap their gums. I don't bother them and they don't bother me.""
""Well,"" he pauses. ""They do. But I've gotten accustomed to it.""

Tim Foley, Arizona Border Recon
Many in town worry that Foley's presence in Arivaca will draw more militias to town.
They remember all too well the brutal crime that happened here 10 years ago, when members of a militia group shot and killed a local man, Raul Flores, and his 9-year-old daughter, Brisenia, in a home invasion. Arivacans' worst fear is that something like that could happen again.
Along the border, support for Trump and the wall
The drive from Arivaca to the Mexico border is a slow, bumpy ride through rugged grassland and up mountains dotted with mesquite trees and saguaro cactus.
Ranchers Jim and Sue Chilton raise cattle on this land , part of the Coronado National Forest, right up to the Mexico border.

Dominic Valente for NPR The international boundary is marked by four strands of barbed wire, waist high, easy to crawl under or through.
The Chiltons say the Mexican cartels run drugs through this land constantly.
Standing by the wire fence, Jim Chilton says: ""I saw a group right over there, a year ago or more. Most of the people coming across our ranch drop their drugs, and they go back to Mexico for another return trip. They know the area. They know every trail.""
The Chiltons are gung-ho about President Trump, think the Border Patrol is ineffective, and really want to see a wall built here.

Dominic Valente for NPR These are contentious views in town. And civil discourse? That can seem elusive.
As Jim Chilton sees it, ""Civility is the ability to speak one's mind without being threatened or without having to worry about being politically correct.""
When I ask Sue Chilton if it still seems like Arivaca is a civil town, she says, emphatically, ""You keep going back to the word civil, and the answer is yes! It's entirely civil because we all know the situation. You just don't broach certain subjects with certain people.""
Subjects like immigration, or the militias.
As if on cue, as we're driving back from the border, we come upon a pickup truck carrying four guys in camo and shades.

Back in town, we meet Kristen Randall, who publishes the local monthly newspaper, Connection . It's an open forum, Randall says; the only rules for writers are that they have to identify themselves and maintain civility.
""Please,"" the paper's website says, ""no profanity, libel, name-calling or other bully[ing] behavior!""
Randall is among the Arivacans who are deeply troubled by the militias.

Randall has seen just how ugly it can get.
For several years now, she and others in Arivaca have been targeted by a local man who has harassed and threatened them with venomous letters, Facebook posts and emails. Mostly, he's incensed about immigration and what he calls ""liberal trash.""
It all started, Randall says, when the man submitted a letter for publication that violated the paper's rules of civility. She says his crusade of harassment began when she asked him to clean up the language.
Eventually, it got so bad that the targets of his abuse went to court and got restraining orders against him.

Skoll Awardees Predict How Their Projects Will Make The World A Better Place : Goats and Soda : NPR,www.npr.org,Marc Silver,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/15/712653034/no-fake-drugs-more-jobs-for-youth-end-child-sexual-abuse-online-a-vision-for-203,"Enlarge this image Trying to make the world a better place: (left to right) Skoll Award winners Gregory Rockson of mPharma, Nicola Galombik and Maryana Iskander of Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator, Nancy Lublin of Crisis Text Line, Bright Simons of mPedigree and Julie Cordua of Thorn.

Greg Smolonski/Skoll Welcome to 2030!
We asked some social entrepreneurs – people who've created projects to make the world a better place – to predict what they hope to accomplish in the not-too-distant future.
They are tackling a range of daunting issues: child sexual abuse on the internet, youth unemployment, mental health crises, counterfeit drugs, lack of access to medicine. Some of them have founded nonprofit groups, others are hoping to make a profit as they do good. To get up and running, they've relied on a mix of government money, donations, grants, fees from companies that buy in.
And this year they're each getting a $1.5 million investment in their work as the recipients of the Skoll Awards for Social Entrepreneurship , presented at the Skoll Foundation's World Forum this week in Oxford, England.
Here's a look at what they've accomplished so far – and what their hopes are for 2030 if they're able – as they say in both the charity and the business world – to scale up. (FYI, 2030 is the year the U.N. aims to meet its ""sustainable development goals."")
Youth Unemployment Will Come Way Down Young, out of school and unemployed.
That's a common situation in many countries, especially those with a bulging population of young people.
In South Africa, for example, every year 1.1 million young people graduate from high school or college – or else they just drop out.
But only 400,000 of them find a job. South African Nicola Galombik, who in her day job is director of a global investment group, wanted to found an organization that would do something about the other 700,000 – to help these kids stuck in ""a no man's land,"" as she puts it.
One problem, she says, is that potential employers can't easily judge an applicant's employability. A high school diploma doesn't attest to good English language skills, a strong work ethic, the ability to work well with colleagues and the public.
Goats and Soda Advice From 5 Women And A Guy Who Won $1.25 Million To Do Good The nonprofit group she started is called Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator . Harambee means ""we all pull together"" in Swahili. And she's pulled together a path for unemployed youth to burnish skills and land a job.
Harambee invites young people to sign up for assessment and training. Their only expense is about one rand – about 75 cents — for mobile phone charges. They complete assessments and take classes to get them ready for the workplace. They're eligible for apprenticeships. Their reliability is judged as well as their skills. Signing up for classes and not showing up, for example, is a red flag.
So in essence Harambee creates a talent pool for companies, focusing on such fields asthe service industry, retail, global business, digital firms and technical work.
The program appeals to youth. Harambee works with half a million young people in South Africa and also in Rwanda. And it appeals to employers, who have offered 100,000 jobs to candidates from the Harambee pool.
Prediction: By 2030 Galombik hopes that Harambee's efforts will grow, flipping the annual numbers in her country. She boldly predicts that of the 1.1 million youth leaving school each year, 700,000 will be able to enter the economy. If that happens, she says, ""we've tilted the seesaw"" in the right direction.
Feeling Lost? You Can Text For Mental Health Help When a person struggles with dark thoughts, mental health issues, abuse, one way to seek help is to call a helpline.
But many helplines have limited hours. In some countries there aren't any. And it can be hard to reach out for help by phone if you're in school or in an office setting. Or if you're a kid and parents are hovering nearby.
TED Radio Hour How Can Text Messaging Save Lives? But you can easily text for help at any time and in practically any place, says New Yorker Nancy Lublin. That's what motivated her to found Crisis Text Line , which trains volunteers to respond to text inquiries and gives them support from staff with degrees in relevant fields.
The group's data shows youth are big users: of the 100 million texts received in the first five and a half years, 75 percent are from people under age 25, and 13 percent of the texters are under age 13. Two-thirds of the texters say they're sharing something they've never told to anyone else before.
Prediction: By 2030, Lublin believes that text-for-help will be available in 50 countries. And there will be real-time global data drawn from these texts so it's possible to see if, say, a suicide by a famous individual or a gun incident has triggered mental health crises in certain parts of the world. Such data does not exist now, according to Lublin.
Even with this predicted progress, some things will never change. Lublin says that ""mom"" is one of the most popular terms in the texts and will no doubt continue to be – cited as a source of pain but also as a source of strength.
African Pharmacies Won't Run Out Of Pills — Or Charge High Prices You walk in a pharmacy to get some medication you need – say, for hypertension, for diabetes, for HIV, for malaria. They are all out. Or the pills are there but are prohibitively expensive.
That's a common problem in African pharmacies, says Gregory Rockson of Ghana. Africa has many mom-and-pop stores that can't order in big quantities as chain pharmacies do. That means they may have to pay higher prices and may not be able to keep a full supply of medications on hand.
Goats and Soda Hope Or Hype: The Revolution In Africa Will Be Wireless The solution Rockson came up with is a company called mPharma (the m stands for mobile). mPharma can negotiate for lower prices because they're buying in large quantities. By monitoring data from the pharmacies, he can figure out what kind of supplies they need to keep on hand to meet customer needs.
mPharma now works with over 200 pharmacies and 50 hospitals in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Prediction: By 2030 Rockson wants to see an Africa where companies like his private sector mPharma distribute drugs widely – and at a fair price — across the continent.
No Worries About Buying Fake Drugs, Seeds ... Or Motorcycle Parts Bright Simons of Ghana says his mother gave him the ""Christian name"" of Bright when he started religious school. It was a bright moment, a bright day, he says by way of explanation.
Now Simons is living up to his name with an idea that shines light on counterfeit products. His company, mPedigree, gives consumers confidence that medicines and seeds they buy are the genuine article and not poor quality knockoffs.
Fake pills and bad seeds are a serious problem in many parts of the world. Sometimes they're sold in fake packages that look like the real thing. People die from ingesting counterfeit medicines. Farmers see crops fail if they purchase poor quality seeds.
mPedigree has created software to try and solve the problem – from digital tools for governments to confirm authenticity to programs that let brands track their products as they go from the source to the customer, who can then use mPedigree apps or hotlines for verification.
These systems are now being used in 12 countries in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. The company also certifies a range of other products, from cosmetics to auto parts.
Prediction: Simons hopes to offer mPedigree's protections in many countries and for many products. As a side benefit, he says, consumers will develop trust in the marketplace – and technology as a tool to prevent fraud.
No More Child Sexual Violence In Online Images It is illegal in the United States and most countries to post online images and videos of child sexual abuse. Yet across the internet, these images still appear on sites that let users put up content. The National Center For Missing And Exploited Children has reviewed over 267 million such images and videos.
Some big players in the field – Facebook and Twitter, for example — take measures to find and remove this kind of illegal content. As for companies that don't — it's not necessarily that they are ""bad actors,"" says social justice advocate Julie Cordua of California. Rather, they are ""busy building their business"" and don't have the ability to monitor all their content.
Cordua is the CEO of Thorn , a group co-founded by actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher. Thorn has developed software to help social media companies find the user-generated images and take them down and has also created software to assist law enforcement agencies as they try to find the children in abuse materials. They may be missing or victims of trafficking.
In addition, Thorn uses online campaigns to target people who seek out abuse material and direct them to help. Cordua says the messages have ""directed more than 100,000 individuals to seek help via confidential counseling"" in the U.S.
Prediction: ""We will have eradicated the spread of child sexual abuse content online,"" says Cordua. ""It'd be a good world if that happens.""

"In Sudan, Activists Continue To Call For Civilian Government",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713460562/in-sudan-activists-continue-to-call-for-civilian-government,"In Sudan, Activists Continue To Call For Civilian Government In Sudan, Activists Continue To Call For Civilian Government Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition Halima Gikandi
Sudan is undergoing a period of political chaos after a military coup unseated the autocratic president, Omar al-Bashir. Protesters are demanding that civilians run the government.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
In Sudan, the ruling military council has said they are willing to negotiate with the opposition. But demonstrators in the capital of that country, Khartoum, continue to protest. As Halima Gikandi reports, they say their demands have not yet been met.
HALIMA GIKANDI, BYLINE: The air is filled with cautious hope and ironclad will. Activists say they will not leave the streets until their demands are met and change comes to Sudan.
(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Foreign language spoken).
GIKANDI: Thousands of people have been demonstrating outside the army headquarters in Khartoum for the past week, demanding that President Omar al-Bashir step down from office and that a civilian-led government take its place. On Thursday, their hopes were met when the military ousted the former president from office and formed a military transition council. But many activists say they're worried about the lack of transparency regarding how the military is interacting with al-Bashir's party, the NCP.
UNIDENTIFIED SPOKESPERSON: What is clear is that there has not really been a clean break from the previous regime. It is unlikely that they will launch a proper crackdown on previous leaders of the region.
GIKANDI: On Sunday, a spokesman for the military transition council said that they were willing to work with opposition groups to establish a civilian government. They gave them one week to suggest a new prime minister. But many activists say they are worried about the lack of transparency. Moni'm al-Sheikh (ph) is an exiled Sudanese activist living in Nairobi. He works with the Civic Forces Alliance, which is one of the opposition groups negotiating with the military council.
MONI'M AL-SHEIKH: There is no signal so far that the military council is handling the situation of the NCP and its leaders. There is no transparency about - the way about those who were arrested.
GIKANDI: For others, the negotiations are a step in the right direction and a sign that democracy could soon come to Sudan. Still, a call to continue protesting. Abubakar Muzammil (ph) is a 25-year-old civic engineer in Khartoum.
ABUBAKAR MUZAMMIL: People are afraid that if they lost the only card they have, which is the protest, well, they might be fooled or something.
GIKANDI: The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Norway have urged Sudan's military council to allow peaceful protests and to engage in dialogue with the opposition.

toggle caption Ross Anania/Getty Images Teen romance gone wrong can be dangerous for girls. Around 7 percent of teen homicides between 2003 and 2016 were committed by intimate partners, and girls were the victims in 90 percent of those deaths.
Ross Anania/Getty Images Domestic violence is common among adults, and women are most frequently the victims. In fact, nearly half of women killed by homicide in the United States are killed by their former or current intimate partners.
Now a new study finds that this kind of violence also poses a risk to the lives of adolescent girls.
The study found that of the more than 2,000 adolescents killed between 2003 and 2016, nearly 7 percent — 150 teens — were killed by their current or former intimate partners.
Ninety percent of the victims were female, and their average age was around 17 years old. In almost 80 percent of the cases, the perpetrator was 18 years or older.
The findings were published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.
""People think that intimate partner violence among adolescents is less serious than among adults,"" says study author Avanti Adhia , an epidemiologist at the University of Washington School Of Medicine . ""It's important to highlight that this can really lead to death. It's not something to brush off as 'This is just an argument between kids.' ""
If you need help Young people who are experiencing emotional abuse or fear they are facing danger can call the National Teen Dating Abuse helpline, 1-866-331-9474, or text LOVEIS to 22522 and be connected with a professional who can help. Teens can also chat with someone for help at loveisrespect.org.
The study might be the first to offer a national estimate for deaths of teenagers due to dating violence, says Anita Raj , who directs the Center for Gender Equity and Health at University of California San Diego and wasn't involved in the new study.
""I have never seen this kind of work with this very young [age] group,"" she says. ""I did not know it was an adolescent issue at this scale.""
The new study also offers details about the circumstances of the deaths.
Adhia and her colleagues looked at information from law enforcement, the medical examiner or the coroner's office records for each case. And they found that firearms, especially handguns, were the most common cause for injury, accounting for 61 percent of cases.
""When it comes to lethality, it was very much related to gun availability,"" says Deborah Capaldi , a developmental psychologist and senior scientist at Oregon Science Learning Center who has studied teen dating violence but wasn't involved in the new study. ""When they're in a situation where they're angry, mad, out of control, they're able to reach for a gun. That is more likely to end in the partner being killed.""
The new study also explored the precipitating events for these deaths. The most common reasons were the victim breaking up with the perpetrator or refusing to start a relationship with them. That accounted for 27 percent of cases. The perpetrator's jealousy was also included in this group.
Previous research shows that jealousy is a common issue in teen relationships, Capaldi says.
In one study, she and her colleagues brought in 17- to 18-year-olds to discuss relationship conflicts they were facing. The most frequent issue raised by the teens was jealousy of their partners, she says.
""This was equally by girls and boys,"" she says. ""The most dangerous situation is when you have a history of poor [emotional] control, hostility, and then they're placed in a high-risk situation, like becoming jealous.""
And breakups, she adds, are a particularly volatile and dangerous time in abusive relationships. ""We found breakups are for dangerous periods for more likelihood of injury,"" Capaldi says. ""When partners are together, although they might engage in intimate partner violence, they're not trying to do severe damage. When they're breaking up, they lash out, and they're trying to hurt the other person.""
About 25 percent of the cases were triggered by heated arguments between the victim and the perpetrator, making this the second most common precipitating event.
Reckless use of firearms also led to some deaths, whereas others happened because the victim was pregnant and the perpetrator did not want to have the baby or they feared arrest for statutory rape.
Dating violence is common
The results are ""shocking and frightening,"" but ""unfortunately, it's not surprising,"" says Megan Bair-Merritt , a pediatrician at Boston Medical Centre and Boston University School of Medicine, who wrote an accompanying editorial on the study.
Dating violence among adolescents is ""incredibly common,"" she says.
According to the National Survey on Teen Relationships and Intimate Violence, more than 60 percent of teens said they had experienced some kind of abuse — physical, sexual and/or emotional — by someone they were dating or previously were in a relationship with.
""We have to recognize how prevalent teen dating violence is,"" stresses Bair-Merritt. ""It can have incredibly substantial consequences on health and well-being, including mortality.""
Young survivors of intimate partner violence are at a higher risk of being in abusive relationships in the future, Raj says.
""This is how they're learning to form relationships,"" she says. ""There is the likelihood of this [kind of violence] occurring again.""
Prevention and help
The new findings raise two important questions about prevention and intervention, Bair-Merritt says.
""How do we talk to teens and children early on about dating violence?"" she says, and ""How do we set up good interventions?""
She says adults should speak openly to children about relationships even before they are dating. ""I think it's important to talk about what healthy relationships are,"" she says.
It's also important for kids to have many ""safe adults"" in their lives, adds Bair-Merritt. These are adults — parents, teachers, coaches, pastors, grandparents — who the teens feel comfortable with and trust, who they can reach out to during stressful experiences.
""For young kids ... safe relationships with adults buffer from stressors,"" she says. ""There's a physical stress buffer for adolescents in having those connections. The more [connections], the better.""
And pediatricians have a big role in preventing and intervening in teen dating violence, she writes in the editorial.
""The American Academy of Pediatrics says we should be talking to teens about relationships and supporting them,"" Bair-Merritt says. ""We have a fairly good reach. Most teens see their pediatrician at least once a year.""
And most children have known their pediatricians for years, so they are more likely to trust them for information about dating relationships, she says.
Health care professionals should be aware of signs that suggest their teen patients may be in abusive relationships, she writes in the editorial. Intimate partner violence has been shown to put teens at increased risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Pediatricians can look for signs of these mental health problems, social isolation and changes in their performance at school.
Limiting access to guns is also part of the solution, Capaldi says. Parents should speak to their kids about gun safety, she says, and ensure that any guns in their homes are kept in safe places. They should also ask their kids if the person they are dating owns or has access to a gun. ""Making sure guns are safely kept is a huge issue,"" she says.
Schools can also be a big part of the solution, Capaldi says.
School nurses and counselors can spot signs of dating abuse and help support the victims, she says. Schools that don't have the necessary resources to help should connect victims to community resources, like counseling centers or relevant nonprofit organizations.
""Schools and school nurses need to know resources in the area,"" she says.
There are several evidence-based programs that teach adolescents relationship skills and how to avoid intimate partner violence , Adhia notes. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a list of such programs.
And there are hotlines specifically for teens facing intimate partner violence, such as the National Teen Dating Abuse helpline, adds Bair-Merritt. Teenagers can call 1-866-331-9474 or text LOVEIS to 22522 and be connected with a professional trained to gauge whether they are in immediate danger, how scared they are feeling, whether they or their partner have access to firearms and to help individuals get out of unsafe situations. Teenagers can also chat with someone for help at loveisrespect.org ."

Buoyed by Thursday's ouster of longtime President Omar al-Bashir, Sudanese protesters faced off against troops during a sit-in outside military headquarters in Khartoum on Monday as they amplify their call for civilian-led rule.
Demonstrators say the Sudanese military attempted to take away the barriers surrounding protesters in the road, where thousands have gathered for days. Ayman, a protester who wants to use just his first name because he fears retribution, told NPR that the barriers' removal would have effectively dissolved the protest but the demonstrators managed to stop the troops.
The main protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association, issued an "" urgent appeal "" on Twitter, calling on additional protesters to step in and protect the area from the armed forces. Sudan's Military Says It Has Taken Control And Arrested President Omar Al-Bashir
Video from the scene shows a group of chanting and flag-waving demonstrators hustling toward the troops, some perched atop vehicles.
Media reports said the standoff ended peacefully with no bloodshed. But it underscored the tenuous nature of Sudan's transition as military leaders vie for power in the vacuum Bashir has left behind, and activists fear a continuation of the old regime passed along to loyalists.
""These people are really fearless,"" Ayman,a university lecturer who has been spending nights at the sit-in, told NPR. ""People come in knowing that they might die.""

The Sudan Doctors Committee, an affiliate of the umbrella SPA group, said Friday that more than a dozen people had been killed ""under the military council"" since the coup occurred just one day earlier.
The military council took control after Bashir's arrest and removal from office, announcing it would rule the country for two years before democratic elections take place; terms unacceptable to protesters and opposition leaders who are demanding a transitional civilian government assume power immediately.
""People are still keeping their eye on the prize of a full democratic transition to a civilian-led government, not a military-led government,"" Mayada Hassanain, an economist based in Khartoum who has taken part in months of protests, told NPR's Weekend Edition .
The military-led government has resembled a game of musical chairs. Gen. Awad Ibn Auf, who helped lead the coup, served as president for a single day before stepping down. He named Lt. Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan as the new leader. The head of the National Intelligence and Security Service was also reshuffled over the weekend.
The military council announced Sunday it would name a civilian prime minister and Cabinet, but has not yielded to demands to name a civilian president.
Analysts say Bashir, an autocrat who took over in 1989 in another coup, has left behind a deep state that may prove difficult to root out.
""What is clear is that there has not been a clear break from the old regime,"" Murithi Mutiga , deputy project director for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group told NPR's Halima Gikandi. ""And what we know is that what the military says and what the military does can be quite different.""
This latest round of protests initially ignited late last year in response to economic woes, before spreading and turning political , culminating in the military's removal of Bashir.
The lead-up to his ouster was not entirely smooth. The United Kingdom, Norway, the United States and Canada issued a joint statement in January calling for the immediate release of political activists, protesters and journalists detained without charge. And international human rights groups have raised the alarm about scores of people reportedly killed in the months before Bashir's ouster.
On Sunday, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum issued another joint statement expressing support for the protesters and appealing for peace. ""Sudan needs an orderly transition to civilian rule leading to elections in a reasonable time frame.""
But in separate statements, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates expressed support for the military council.
As for Bashir, he reportedly remains under house arrest. The 75-year-old is facing international charges for war crimes in connection with genocide committed in Darfur.

Activists say the protests will go on until their demands are met.
Hassanain told NPR the movement is largely youth-based with some protesters as young as 15, who, despite the risks, are eager to usher in a new era for Sudan.
""It's amazing to see all these people out on the streets literally putting themselves on the frontline of death to fight for their own futures and future generations."""

Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images A version of this story was first posted by member station WABE .
President Trump called former President Jimmy Carter for the first time this weekend.
Carter revealed that news during his regular Sunday school lesson at his home church, Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday morning.
Earlier this year, Carter sent Trump a letter with some advice about managing the U.S.-China relationship. Carter oversaw the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries 40 years ago.
On Saturday evening, Trump called Carter to talk about it. It was the first time they'd spoken, Carter said. He said Trump told him that he is particularly concerned about how China is ""getting ahead of us.""
Carter said he agreed with Trump on this issue.
""And do you know why?"" Carter said. ""I normalized diplomatic relations with China in 1979. Since 1979, do you know how many times China has been at war with anybody? None. And we have stayed at war,"" he said. (China and Vietnam actually fought a brief border war in early 1979, weeks after U.S. relations with China were normalized.)
Carter said the United States is ""the most warlike nation in the history of the world"" due to a desire to impose American values on other countries, and he suggested that China is investing its resources into projects such as high-speed railroads instead of defense spending.
""How many miles of high-speed railroad do we have in this country?""
Zero, the congregation answered.
""We have wasted, I think, $3 trillion,"" Carter said, referring to American military spending. ""China has not wasted a single penny on war, and that's why they're ahead of us. In almost every way.
""And I think the difference is if you take $3 trillion and put it in American infrastructure, you'd probably have $2 trillion left over. We'd have high-speed railroad. We'd have bridges that aren't collapsing. We'd have roads that are maintained properly. Our education system would be as good as that of, say, South Korea or Hong Kong.
""I wasn't comparing my country adversely to China,"" Carter qualified. ""I was just pointing that out because I happened to get a phone call last night.""
The former president said he understands that Trump is worried about China surpassing the U.S. as the world's top economic superpower.
""I don't really fear that time, but it bothers President Trump, and I don't know why. I'm not criticizing him — this morning,"" Carter said to laughs from the audience.
The White House confirmed the conversation in a statement released Monday.
""President Jimmy Carter wrote President Trump a beautiful letter about the current negotiations with China and on Saturday they had a very good telephone conversation about President Trump's stance on trade with China and numerous other topics,"" said the statement, which wasn't attributed to a spokesperson.
Much of Carter's Palm Sunday lesson was focused on peace and kindness and was given before an audience that was mostly composed of visitors, many of whom had lined up overnight for the service.
Last month, Carter became the nation's longest-living president."

Notre Dame Cathedral, one of the world's most famous churches, erupted in flames Monday in Paris, losing its spire but remaining otherwise largely intact after firefighters worked through the night to contain the fire.
The commander of the Paris firefighter brigade, Jean-Claude Gallet, said Monday night that the cathedral's main structure and two towers of the cathedral had been saved. Firefighters said they had contained the flames by early morning local time, and the fire was entirely out by midmorning, Gallet confirmed to NPR.

Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said authorities were trying to save priceless art and relics from the structure's interior, according to The Associated Press.
The Paris prosecutor's office says it has opened an investigation into the fire but that initial indications suggest it was started accidentally. The cathedral closed at 6:45 p.m. local time, and the fire broke out five or six minutes later, France 24 reported .

Michel Euler/AP The structure had been undergoing a $6.8 million renovation project , including work on its spire. Sixteen statues had been removed last week as part of the renovation and were therefore spared from the fire, the AP reports.
Promises of massive donations for the cathedral's reconstruction began to pour in within hours. Bernard Arnault, the billionaire chairman and CEO of the luxury goods group LVMH, pledged 200 million euros from his family and his company. Gucci head François-Henri Pinault, another billionaire, said he will donate 100 million euros.

In the U.S., the Basilica of the National Shrine announced it was accepting donations to help rebuild Notre Dame.
Located on the Île de la Cité in the middle of the Seine River, the soaring Gothic structure dates to the 13th century and was completed in the 15th century. The city said that it had closed all entrances to the isle.

It attracts 12 million visitors each year and is the most visited monument in France, ahead of the Eiffel Tower, according to the cathedral. Victor Hugo used its gargoyles and flying buttresses as the setting for his 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame .
Many observers wondered why airplanes were not dropping water on the inferno, as firefighters do to combat forest fires. But the cathedral's urban setting makes such a mission too dangerous: It would involve dropping perhaps 6 tons of water, an unsafe proposition in a densely populated city. The intervention could destroy the cathedral in the effort to save it.

The wooden roof was an ""accident waiting to happen,"" said Bruzelius.

On Thursday, Arizona lawmakers repealed a law that restricted how public school teachers could talk about LGBTQ relationships in health classes.
The Arizona law regulated HIV/AIDS instruction in public schools. Since 1991, it has banned teachers in those courses from promoting ""a homosexual life-style,"" portraying ""homosexuality as a positive alternative life-style"" or suggesting there are safe ways to have homosexual sex.
At least six other states have curriculum laws around LGBTQ issues, according to the advocacy group GLSEN . Like many of the laws that exist in other states, Arizona's was created in the throes of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
The repeal was the culmination of a lawsuit filed against Arizona education leaders in March , and years of advocacy from Democrats and LGBTQ advocacy groups.
""We're so excited and relieved and, I think, in a state of shock, to be honest,"" said Carol Brochin, a plaintiff in the lawsuit with her child, who lawsuit identifies as S.C.
""[S.C.] was so surprised and really taken aback and started crying, actually,"" Brochin said.
S.C., a Mexican-American seventh-grader, uses they/them pronouns and identifies as queer.
""They are the emotional center for their friends,"" Brochin said, adding that she thinks it's because of how much S.C. has been through.
The lawsuit described the bullying and offensive name-calling S.C. experienced in sixth grade while attending a Tucson Unified School District middle school. It said S.C. was ""repeatedly called a 'stupid gay kid' and 'faggot' by other students,"" and S.C. did not feel safe at school and ""frequently went to the school nurse's office because they were so upset from the harassment and bullying.""
The complaint argued that because S.C. would take courses that are subject to the curriculum law in high school, they ""will face further stigma and will be denied equal education opportunities because of the Law."" Loading...

It was unclear from the beginning who, if anyone, would defend the law. One of the lawsuit's listed defendants, Arizona Superintendent Kathy Hoffman, had already publicly supported the LGBTQ curriculum restrictions' repeal.
In a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday, the Arizona House and Senate voted on a repeal, and Gov. Doug Ducey signed it into law.
The amendment was brought by Republican Rep. T.J. Shope. Know An LGBTQ Student Itching To Study Abroad? Here Are Some Things To Think About
""I thought to myself this ... seems fairly antiquated. We should probably go ahead and see if we can't get out of this,"" Shope said after the vote. He added that repealing the law would save taxpayer money that would have gone to defending it against the lawsuit.
Democratic Sen. Martín Quezada had tried to repeal the law every year since 2016, but Republican lawmakers blocked his bill from advancing.
""I want us to all be honest with ourselves today about this bill,"" Quezada said in explaining his vote for the repeal. ""We would not be here today if it was not a forced issue.""
Several LGBTQ lawmakers explained how powerful it was to vote yes on the repeal.

As a testament to that, he even collaborated with Cage the Elephant earlier this year. But Beck, ever the disruptor of standards, took a pivot into left-field.

Worldwide journalism groups are demanding that the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega stop its attacks on journalists. Costa Rica wants an imprisoned TV journalist released too.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Journalism advocacy groups are calling for the Nicaraguan government to end its attacks on the media. The government of Costa Rica has now joined in. Nicaragua's strongman President Daniel Ortega has imprisoned a television journalist who has Costa Rican citizenship. Here's reporter Maria Martin.
MARIA MARTIN, BYLINE: In the last two weeks, the Ortega government has intensified its repression of civil society groups and media outlets in Nicaragua, raiding several media organizations, closing one and imprisoning journalists.
UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Yelling in Spanish).
MARTIN: This is the sound as dozens of heavily armed police brutally shove journalist Carlos Chamorro and his staff with nightsticks and plastic shields outside police headquarters in Managua. Chamorro, director of the digital outlet Confidencial and one of the most respected journalists in Central America, had come to place an official complaint after Confidencial's offices were raided and its equipment damaged in mid-December.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CARLOS CHAMORRO: (Speaking Spanish).
MARTIN: Chamorro continues to produce programs like this one examining the embattled state of Nicaragua's media. But according to reports, he does it practically in hiding. Other media outlets have fared worse. The director of the television station 100% Noticias - 100% News - Miguel Mora and its news director Lucia Pineda were kidnapped and taken into custody after the station's equipment was destroyed. They're now in the infamous El Chipote prison, charged with fomenting hate and terrorism, their special concern about journalist Pineda, who hasn't been allowed to see her family nor human rights representatives nor the Costa Rican consul.
Pineda holds dual Nicaraguan and Costa Rican citizenship. This weekend, Costa Rica's President Carlos Alvarado, himself a former journalist, stated that his neighboring country is most concerned about the ever increasing violations of human rights and press freedoms in Nicaragua.
Meanwhile, international press groups such as Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Inter American Press Association are calling for President Ortega to end the escalation of attacks against media he sees as critical of his government. Ortega and his supporters maintain they support freedom of expression in Nicaragua. For NPR News, I'm Maria Martin.

Blanka Callejas looks out over the production floor of her family's factory just outside the Nicaraguan town of Granada. Workers scrub down huge metal vats where they process fruit for the Callejas brand of jams and preserves, a staple in Nicaraguan homes for decades. She is worried about how she will pay her 50 employees.
These days, she says, jam has become a luxury.
Nicaragua has been in turmoil since last April, when President Daniel Ortega launched a brutal crackdown on opponents. At least 325 people have been killed, thousands injured and 550 arrested. In December, Ortega expelled international observers who were invited into the country to look into allegations of human rights abuses. The Organization of American States said at the time that the expulsion of its observers ""further places Nicaragua into the terrain of authoritarianism."" The economy, after years of growth, is now in recession .
That has left many Nicaraguans grappling with the difficult decision of whether to stay, or go.

Callejas says she's not giving up, despite her company's sales having plummeted 40 percent since the crisis began last April.
""I know what it's like to be in exile, to be alone,"" she says, remembering back in the 1970s, when as a teen, she had to flee to Costa Rica for a while. She had taken up arms against the Somoza dictatorship with the Sandinista rebels. President Ortega was a leader in that fight, but now many of his critics and old allies now say the leader is behaving like an authoritarian ruler himself .
This time around, Callejas says she won't leave her business or employees. Her son, however, did leave the country, fearing he was targeted by the authorities and their allies.
""They labeled him a terrorist, a vandal, a criminal, just like they have done to all protesters,"" she says. Nicaragua's New Anti-Terrorism Law Thwarts Protesters, Activists Say Aug. 29, 2018
The nationwide demonstrations broke out originally over pension cuts but then they widened into broad discontent with the regime. Ortega responded with increased repression of opponents: Hundreds were prosecuted under new anti-terrorism laws . Ortega also shuttered nine nongovernmental groups, including the country's leading human rights organization. The organization's head, Vilma Núñez, says she is determined to stay, too.
""I'm not running, I couldn't live with myself if I did, I'd feel terrible,"" she says at an outdoor café. Núñez picked this spot. She says her house is watched by police.
""When is this all going to end, I don't know, I may not see it ... I hope I get to,"" she says.
Núñez was jailed during the struggle to topple the Somoza dictatorship, and isn't afraid of a fight. But she says, at 80, she's too old to leave the country or her husband, who is also in his 80s.
Gioconda Belli, Nicaragua's prize-winning poet, says so many people are facing the agonizing decision of whether to stay and fight or flee.
""The ground beneath our feet has ceased to be stable ... when the earth shakes you don't know exactly where to stand,"" she says.
The United States has imposed sanctions on senior government officials, including Ortega's wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, but the Ortega administration doesn't appear to be budging. The president insists he will serve out his current, third term until 2021.
Ortega is one of Latin America's remaining allies with Venezuela's embattled President Nicolás Maduro, a relationship that has brought Nicaragua much scorn from the U.S. Last November, President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton included Nicaragua in a list of hemispheric enemies, along with Venezuela and Cuba, dubbing them the "" troika of tyranny .""
While many in Nicaragua are closely watching events in Venezuela, the two countries are not as economically intertwined as they once were. Nicaragua has moved to wean itself of Venezuelan oil and handouts in recent years.
But despite that diversification, Nicaragua's economy, one of the poorest in the hemisphere, might not hold up much longer, says Juan Sebastián Chamorro, the head of the Nicaraguan Foundation for Economic and Social Development, a think tank in Managua. He says unemployment is skyrocketing, tourism has tanked and nearly a third of cash deposits have left the country.
""There is no credit in the economy, the economic situation is going to worsen throughout 2019 so that is in itself going to create the incentive for a lot of people to leave the country,"" he says.
Police surround his office and routinely pull him over, he says. He works remotely and sleeps at different houses, but he is not leaving the country.
His cousin, however, prominent journalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro, has. Enlarge this image

""Going to exile has been a very painful and difficult decision,"" says Chamorro, the editor of a news and analysis website called Confidencial .
Adding to what has been a grueling calculus in his decision to leave is the fact that his mother, former President Violeta Chamorro, is gravely ill. Leading Journalist Flees Nicaragua, Citing 'Extreme Threats' From The Government
Ultimately he fled, and last month Chamorro announced he had moved his entire news operations to neighboring Costa Rica. Nicaraguan police raided his Managua offices last December and continue to occupy it. He had been warned his arrest was imminent.
""There's a moment in which you have to choose either you wait for them to detain you and fabricate criminal charges and take you to prison,"" he says. Or you have to preserve your freedom so you will be able to keep fighting, he adds.
As many as 66 Nicaraguan journalists have reportedly fled the country as the authorities carry out media raids and arrests.
Overall, tens of thousands of residents have sought refuge in Costa Rica since April. The United Nations says hundreds of Nicaraguans have also recently applied for asylum in Panama, Mexico and the United States.
There is a daily sign of the exodus outside the Costa Rican Embassy in Managua, where Nicaraguans form long lines for visas. Vendors selling them everything from photocopies to bus tickets fill the street.
One woman who recently obtained a visa, who is too afraid to give her name, says she is leaving for a short vacation. She could see the two police officers watching all activity outside the embassy. When asked if that was the real reason she needed a visa, she smiled nervously and kept nodding her head.
Another family of five, with their packed suitcases in hand, says the same.
They have just received their visas. They toss their bags into the trunk of a waiting taxi, pile in, and take off, straight for the border."

Before Dana Canedy got down to the business of announcing the winners of this year's Pulitzer Prizes, the administrator offered an unusual aside.
""I want to break with tradition and offer my sincere admiration for an entry that did not win, but that should give us all hope for the future of journalism in this great democracy,"" Canedy told the journalists assembled at Columbia University in New York City.
The entry was from the Eagle Eye , the student newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last year. There, in the aftermath of the violence, the student journalists had to grapple with their immense grief in crafting 17 obituaries for slain friends and coaches.
""These budding journalists remind us of the media's unwavering commitment to bearing witness even in the most wrenching of circumstances, in service to a nation whose very existence depends on a free and dedicated press,"" Canedy explained. ""There is hope in their example even as security threats to journalists are greater than ever and there is hope even if some wrongly degrade the media as the enemy of the very democracy it serves.""
The staff of the Eagle Eye didn't win a Pulitzer. But it did set the tone for the crop of Pulitzer Prize winners to come, many of whom faced down threats — both verbal and physical — in an increasingly fraught environment for the media in the U.S. and abroad.
(Want to see the full list of winners right away? Skip ahead by clicking here, or watch the full ceremony using the video embedded below.)
YouTube The South Florida Sun-Sentinel won the Pulitzer Prize for public service, the only prize out of the 21 official categories to include a gold medal with the usual purse of $15,000 in winnings. The 18-member Pulitzer Prize Board , which typically makes the final call on winners, applauded the paper ""for exposing failings by school and law enforcement officials before and after"" last year's shooting in Parkland.
Pulitzer judges also recognized the entire staff of Reuters, including journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who are serving multi-year prison sentences in Myanmar for their reporting on the country's brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims. Reuters split the international reporting prize with Maggie Michael, Maad al-Zikry and Nariman El-Mofty of the Associated Press, who ""exposed the tragic effects of the war in Yemen.""

— Reuters Top News (@Reuters) April 15, 2019 Canedy deviated from the usual plan in order to honor another newsroom: the journalists at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md., who saw five of their colleagues killed in a gunman's attack on their office last year. The paper earned a special citation for their ""courageous response"" to the horrific assault, and ""for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief.""
Along with the citation comes a $100,000 bequest, intended to ""further the newspaper's journalistic mission.""
The Two-Way See Last Year's Pulitzer Winners, Including Kendrick Lamar Not all of the afternoon's remarks centered on such violence, however. Journalists at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal won prizes for their work reporting on President Trump, and the staff of The Advocate in Baton Rouge, La., earned recognition for its ""damning portrayal of the state's discriminatory conviction system.""
For all the focus on journalism, about a third of the prizes doled out Monday went to scholars, artists and authors — including Richard Powers, whose novel The Overstory earned the prolific writer a Pulitzer to go along with the 2006 National Book Award already on his mantel.
The board added a second special citation, as well — this one posthumously awarded to Aretha Frankin ""for her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades.""
This year's winners beat out a vast field of entries, which often number more than 2,500 each year, according to prize administrators . It takes more than 100 judges to shave that snowdrift of submissions down to something manageable for the board, which typically then picks the final winners by majority vote.

Mortgage Secrets That Will Save You Money : NPR,www.npr.org,sports.yahoo.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711941375/mortgage-secrets-that-will-save-you-money,"Enlarge this image Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images It's hard to imagine a more boring (and dreaded) word than ""mortgage."" But if you know where to look, you might find a mortgage that will save you thousands of dollars a year or discover that you qualify for a loan when you didn't think you could — and that's exciting. You might even find free money to help with a down payment.
Here are a few ways to get started:
1. Don't just wander into your bank to get a mortgage. Shop around at all kinds of lenders — especially if you're a first-time homebuyer.
Deitra Douglas bought a home in Charlotte, N.C., last year — but only because of a loan program that most people don't even know exists. Though she had a good job, Douglas had been through a divorce and had run up credit card debt, hurting her credit score. Her bank told her she didn't qualify for a mortgage.
How To Buy A House How To Buy A House, In 7 Steps A friend told her about a nonprofit homeownership organization called the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America . Under NACA's mortgage program, Douglas took a homebuyer class, demonstrated over time that she was saving money and paid off $11,000 of credit card debt. That qualified her for a mortgage with a low down payment and no closing costs or fees.
NACA founder Bruce Marks calls the program character-based lending that looks at individual circumstances that people can control, like paying rent and bills on time. ""It's going back to the old way of doing lending,"" he says. ""She could afford the payment.""
Even if you aren't in the same situation as Douglas, shopping around beyond mainstream banks can find you a better deal.
2. Find out if you qualify for a grant to help with a down payment.
If you are a first-time homebuyer — or haven't owned a home for at least a few years — you might qualify for a government grant for what's called down payment assistance, which can mean borrowing less on your mortgage.
Marks says to check with your state's housing finance agency and ask about assistance programs.
How To Buy A House Rent Or Buy? 6 Ways To Consider​ The Pros And Cons ""There's a lot of grant money around for down payment and closing costs,"" Marks says. ""You can get up to $20,000 to $25,000 in Boston and up to $20,000 in California. They're doing $40,000, $50,000 and sometimes more.""
3. Get preapproved for a mortgage before you start shopping for a house.
Preapproval will tell you how much a lender is willing to lend you and forces real estate agents to take you seriously.
4. If you can afford it, get a 15-year mortgage. You will build wealth much more quickly than with a 30-year mortgage.

Check out the charts. After 10 years of paying for your house, you could have $121,000 worth of ownership built up — or you could have only $42,000, a huge difference.
A 15-year mortgage also means paying less in interest — $50,000 as opposed to $74,000 — over those 10 years. That means each dollar you pay on the 15-year mortgage is doing about three times more work for your wealth.
5. Remember that adjustable-rate loans are risky.
Payments on an adjustable-rate loan may start out small but will fluctuate with the market and could cost much more in the long run than a fixed-rate loan. Think of a fixed-rate loan as a reliable car that will get you where you're going. An adjustable is more like a used car — cheaper, but breakdowns will cost you more money and worry in the long run.
6. Shop around to see if you can avoid paying for private mortgage insurance, or PMI.
Mortgage insurance protects the bank in case the buyer can't pay the mortgage and the bank has to foreclose on the home, and it's often required for buyers who make less than a 20 percent down payment on their home. It can add hundreds to your monthly payments.
Get Out Of Debt Crush Debt Fast (While Staying Motivated) If a lender says it has to charge you PMI, you might be able to find a credit union or other lender that will offer the same loan but not charge the mortgage insurance. For example, NACA doesn't charge mortgage insurance. Marks also suggests something called wealth-builder loans, which have a 15- or 20-year term and don't charge insurance.
""The best mortgage that you've never heard of is the wealth-builder 15-year mortgage,"" Marks says. ""If you can afford the payments, you need to do that. Build equity really quickly.""
7. Don't let the dreaded HELOC monster — home equity line of credit — eat your home equity.
A HELOC is a second loan that uses your home as collateral, once you've built up equity in the house. Many people use HELOCs to finance home repairs or improvements. But too many people use them as piggy banks to pay off credit cards or buy a car, putting their home equity at risk."

Mark Rogers Photography As they have with so many other industries, apps are shaking up the weight loss business, including big-name companies like Nutrisystem and Weight Watchers. And it's basically because more consumers feel the way Jessica Holloway-Haytcher does.
A couple years ago, she tried diet shakes and supplements. She hated them. She also hired a former NFL player turned personal trainer — but his schedule never matched hers.
She spent $600 a month for programs that weren't sustainable. She says she couldn't keep up with the ""astronomical"" costs.
The Salt Resolved To Lose Weight? We Gave Food-Tracking Apps A Try Now Holloway-Haytcher uses an app called Noom. (Noom is an NPR sponsor.) She has shed over 30 pounds so far, by changing her habits. She now prepares healthy meals in the morning, so she's not ravenous at night; she focuses on conversation to slow her eating.
The app also helps her track meals, exercise and keep in touch with an online coach. It's always with her, and works with her busy schedule as the owner of a staffing firm in Kennewick, Wash. Sometimes, it even feels as though the app knows what she is thinking.
""It's kind of funny how I'll open the app one day, and it'll be exactly what I'm struggling with is what they're talking about,"" Holloway-Haytcher says. Like when she stopped losing weight, and got discouraged. ""They talked about how that can affect you and how to work through it and then how to work through the negative self-talk that you have,"" she says.
When it comes to weight loss, 80 percent of people try to do it on their own, says John LaRosa, president of Marketdata, which tracks the $4 billion commercial U.S. weight loss industry. (The overall market — including diet foods and soft drinks, health clubs, weight loss surgery and diet pharmaceuticals — totals about $72 billion .) He says apps like MyFitnessPal, Fitbit and Fooducate appeal to those consumers.
The Salt This Chef Lost 50 Pounds And Reversed Prediabetes With A Digital Program LaRosa says apps have a downside: Users often tire of them, just as they do gym memberships. But the apps are also cheaper than most commercial programs, and they appeal to the younger demographic that traditional chains have struggled to attract.
""The average age of a customer of Jenny Craig, or Nutrisystem or Weight Watchers is about 48, and it's probably going up,"" LaRosa says. ""It's going to be a shrinking market if they just cater to the baby boomers.""
That explains why Nutrisystem, which was acquired by Tivity Health last year, revamped its digital strategy. Tivity President Dawn Zier says that included advertising more on social media and redesigning its NuMi app.

""[They will say] 'I want the food when I want it; I want to talk to a counselor when I actually have an issue, which may be 10 o'clock on Saturday night.' ""
Weight Watchers also overhauled its brand last year, changing its name to WW.
""Three years ago, millennials told us that this was my grandmother's brand,"" says Debra Benovitz, a senior vice president for WW.
The 56-year-old company shifted gears. It still champions support groups at its retail locations, a concept that made it and Jenny Craig popular in the 1980s. Having physical stores is still WW's biggest difference from upstarts that are exclusively digital.

"Biographer Robert Caro On Fame, Power And 'Working' To Uncover The Truth",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713413916/biographer-robert-caro-on-fame-power-and-working-to-uncover-the-truth,"Biographer Robert Caro On Fame, Power And 'Working' To Uncover The Truth Biographer Robert Caro On Fame, Power And 'Working' To Uncover The Truth Embed Embed Independent Booksellers
Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Robert Caro has spent decades researching and chronicling the lives of notable men.
His biographies have focused on former President Lyndon B. Johnson ( The Path to Power ) and famed New York City planner Robert Moses ( The Power Broker ). Still, he says, ""I never had the slightest interest in writing a book just to tell the story of a great man.""
Instead, Caro is interested in power: ""I wanted to use [Johnson's and Moses'] lives to show how political power worked; that's what I was interested in.""
Caro points out that though Moses was never elected to anything, he's credited with developing many of New York City's highways, bridges and public housing units.
""He had more power than any mayor, more power than any governor, and more power than any mayor or governor combined,"" Caro says of Moses.
But uncovering the mechanisms of power can be difficult. Caro says his subjects sometimes didn't welcome his attention. Other times, he had to dig up long-buried facts or discern unseen motives during interviews. Caro writes about his process as a biographer in the new book, Working . Interview Highlights In 'Working,' Writer Robert Caro Explains His Process — And What Drives Him
On the difficulty of getting sources to talk on the record about Robert Moses
Over 40 years, numerous biographers, some of them quite famous, had tried to do, started to do a biography on him. And I suppose he told them the same thing he told me: I was told it by two public relations men who took me out to lunch and informed me across the table that he would never talk to me; his family and friends would never talk to me. And then they had a phrase — I forget the exact phrase — but the import was ""no one who ever wants a contract from state or city will ever talk to you.""
But I started interviewing anyway. So I drew a series of concentric circles on a piece of paper. In the center I put a dot. That was Robert Moses. The inner circle was his family and closest friends. The next circle was close friends but not quite as close. I figured he could keep those people in the first couple of circles from talking to me, but out in the outer circles are all the other people that he dealt with. He couldn't think of them all.
And I started interviewing them and I don't know that this is true, since it's complimentary to me, but his closest associate his chief subordinate a guy named Sid Shapiro, once said to me that [Moses] realized that someone was finally going to do a biography of him whether we wanted it or not. And after two years his daughter suddenly calls me out of nowhere. She calls him Poppa Bear, and she said, ""Poppa Bear will see you."" So I went to have my first interview with Robert Moses. Robert Caro talks about his Pulitzer Prize winning book ""The Power Broker: Robert Moses and th... Robert Caro talks about his Pulitzer Prize winning book ""The Power Broker: Robert Moses and th... Embed Embed < iframe src=""https://www.npr.org/player/embed/1109995/109995"" width=""100%"" height=""290"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" title=""NPR embedded audio player"">
On interviewing Moses and challenging him
There came a point in the seventh interview where ... a lot of the things that he was telling me did not comport with the facts as I was learning them from the papers of the governors and mayors that he remembered that he served with. As soon as I started asking him questions, I saw his eyes change, and shortly thereafter he said, ""Well, that's enough for today,"" and I never got to see him again. Every time after that that I called, the secretary said he was busy.
On how Moses bent people to his will
Moses, when someone opposed him, a public official, he put what he called his ""team of bloodhounds,"" that's his investigators, onto this person. If they found anything about the person that was derogatory, he basically would say, ""I'm going to leak it to the newspapers unless you go along."" So I was examining a very mysterious thing that happened in Moses' career. He wanted to run this road — the Cross Bronx Expressway — right across the heart of the Bronx, displacing thousands of people when there was an alternate route just two blocks away that displaced almost no one. And every elected official was against him.
But all of a sudden, the key official, a lawyer for the council to Mayor [Robert] Wagner changed his mind, and wrote a letter saying Moses' route was good. So when I was talking to Moses I said, ""What did you do to Henry Epstein?"" And he said something like, ""Oh we hit him with an ax."" I said, ""What do you mean?"" And he said in their investigation they had found that he had a girlfriend. He was a married man but he had a longtime girlfriend. He said, ""I said to Henry, you and this chum of yours. And Henry said, ""She's not my chum."" And Moses said, ""Oh yes, Henry, she's your chum all right."" So Moses said to me... ""So Henry wrote his letter.""
On how he got Lyndon Johnson's brother Sam to tell the truth about his brother's childhood In 'Passage,' Caro Mines LBJ's Changing Political Roles
I had been interviewing his brother Sam Houston Johnson and ... there was a lot of braggadocio and bravado and basically untruthfulness in his stories. I had gotten disgusted with interviewing him and I decided I'm not going to use anything he told me and I'm not going to spend any more time on this. So I'm working with other people.
Now, all of a sudden I hear he's had this terrible operation for cancer and he stopped drinking ... and I took him for a cup of coffee in the cafe there and the guy sitting next to me all of a sudden was a quiet, introspective guy. I decided to try to interview him again. By this time, I knew the key to Lyndon Johnson's youth was this childhood conflict with his father. So I thought of a way to make him remember more accurately what had happened.
I got the National Park Service to agree that I could take him in to the Johnson boyhood home after the tourists were gone. We went in and I sat him down at the dining room table ... I didn't sit at the table. I didn't want anything in his sight that wouldn't remind of his boyhood. So I sat behind him and I said, ""Repeat those dinner time conversations with your father.""
He started yelling back and forth. ""Lyndon, you're a failure! You'll always be a failure!"" ""Well, what are you dad? You're bus inspector. That's what you are."" And he was shouting back and forth. ... I said, ""Now Sam Houston, I want you to tell me again all those wonderful anecdotes, those wonderful stories that you and everyone else told about your brother for all these years, only just give me some more details."" ... And then he started without any other prompting to give a completely different picture of Lyndon Johnson's youth.
On why he writes his books longhand
It's because of something that was said to me at Princeton by a professor, a very courtly gentleman, Southern gentleman, who was my creative writing teacher. Every two weeks we'd hand in a short story. I was in his course for two years. For two years he gave me high marks, but I always did these short stories at the last minute. ... I would always start at the last minute and just type, because I could write very fast.
At our last session, he hands back my short story ... and he compliments me, and as I'm getting up to go he says, ""But you know, Mr. Caro, you will never achieve what you want to achieve unless you stop thinking with your fingers."" ...
Did you ever realize that someone is seeing right through you? I realized he had seen right through me all along. He knew that I wasn't putting any thought into these. I was just writing, because writing was so easy for me. So when I was a newspaper man, I was a really fast rewrite man. But when I quit to do a book, and I began to realize how complex the story of Robert Moses was; I said I must make myself think things all the way through, and the slowest way of committing your thoughts to paper is by writing in hand. So I write three or four or more — sometimes I write a lot of drafts in hand. Then I go to my typewriter and that's how I write.

Measles Cases Spike Driven By Outbreaks In N.Y And 4 Other Regions : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Michaeleen Doucleff,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/15/713508519/measles-outbreak-accelerates-health-officials-warn,"Enlarge this image A nurse prepares the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine at the Rockland County Health Department in Haverstraw, N.Y.

Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images A nurse prepares the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine at the Rockland County Health Department in Haverstraw, N.Y. Several measles outbreaks in New York state are contributing to this year's unusually high measles rates.
Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Measles is surging. Last week the U.S. recorded 90 cases, making this year's outbreak the second largest in more than two decades.
So far this year, the U.S. has confirmed 555 measles cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday. That's 50 percent higher than the total number recorded last year, even though we're only about a quarter of the way through 2019.
And the virus isn't slowing down.
""The number of cases is accelerating,"" says Dr. Amanda Cohn, a senior adviser for vaccines at the CDC. ""We are on track to have one of the highest numbers of cases of measles reported since we eliminated the disease in the year 2000.""
The majority of the cases are connected to outbreaks in New York, Cohn says.
""This is a very significant outbreak,"" she says. ""These cases were imported from other countries, but because of low vaccination coverage in these communities, measles is spreading widely throughout these communities.""

Last week, New York City declared a public health emergency in an ultra-Orthodox community in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. The city's Health Department is mandating that parents vaccinate their children, or they may face a $1,000 fine.
The CDC pointed to four other places with ongoing outbreaks in the U.S.: Clark County, Wash. ; Oakland County, Mich.; two counties in New Jersey ; and a handful of counties across California .
Health officials say there are two main reasons for the virus's surge: more international travel and lower vaccination rates.
Several countries around the world are currently experiencing massive measles outbreaks. Madagascar has recorded more than 100,000 cases since the fall, with more than 1,200 deaths. Ukraine has recorded about 37,000 cases this year. And the European Union is tallying about 1,000 cases a month.
Globally, the World Health Organization reports that measles cases in the first quarter of 2019 nearly quadrupled compared with what was reported at this time last year.
More American families are bringing measles home with them after traveling abroad, Cohn says. And once the disease lands stateside, it has a better chance of gaining a foothold because vaccination rates in some places have dropped below 93 to 95 percent, the threshold required to protect the entire community.
""When you make the decision not to vaccinate your child, please understand you're also making that decision for the people around your child,"" New York City's deputy mayor of health and human services, Herminia Palacio, told NPR on Wednesday .
Measles can be an extremely serious disease. About 25 percent of infected children are hospitalized. About 10 percent of children develop ear infections, which can cause permanent hearing damage. In about 1 in 1,000 cases, the infection becomes life-threatening. In these cases, the virus moves to the brain, causing encephalitis and convulsions. Children can be left deaf, blind or with intellectual disabilities — if they recover.
Before the development of the measles vaccine in the 1960s, the U.S. recorded nearly a half-million cases each year , the CDC says. About 48,000 kids were hospitalized and about 500 people died per year.
""We eliminated measles from this country in 2000, and ... I think we eliminated the memory of that virus,"" Dr. Paul Offit of Children's told NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday . ""People don't remember how sick it could make you."""

Group chemistry and deft composing make Harrell's new album a polished, inventive album that's worth checking out. Critic Kevin Whitehead says it's ""really, really good.""
DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. Jazz trumpet player Tom Harrell played with bandleader Horace Silver in the 1970s and started recording under his own name in the '80s. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead says ever since, Harrell has shown himself to be a thinking person's jazz soloist - thoughtful and introspective. Kevin says Harrell writes music to match and picks the right musicians as well.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""DUBLIN"")
KEVIN WHITEHEAD, BYLINE: ""Dublin"" by trumpet player Tom Harrell - for decades, he's been making first-rate records and acquiring high-profile admirers without quite becoming a household name. Harrell occupies his own corner of the jazz scene. He likes to record his own compositions and generally takes a thoughtful and even reserved approach. But he's a swinger, too, and his best pieces have compulsive drive. The highlight of his new quintet album, ""Infinity,"" is his tune ""Ground."" Its infectious, doubled-up shuffle beat sends the trumpeter to his happy place.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""GROUND"")
WHITEHEAD: A buoyant rhythm section always helps - in this case, Ben Street on bass, Johnathan Blake on drums and Charles Altura doing a little light overdubbing on guitars. Not having a piano opens up the texture. Leader Tom Harrell is partial to understatement in the great tradition of un-shouty jazz horn players. Any trumpeter using Harmon mute to get a plaintive sound will remind some listeners of Miles Davis. Tom Harrell is his own man, but he may make that connection himself. His solo on ""Hope"" recalls Miles' economy and dry wit.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""HOPE"")
WHITEHEAD: The trumpeter's partner in the front line is tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, a thinking horn player himself. There's good give and take between them when they solo back to back. These players are thoughtful, but that doesn't mean they can't turn up the heat, especially with that rhythm section pushing.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""CORONATION"")
WHITEHEAD: Tom Harrell has been crossing paths with and hiring most of these younger musicians for a decade. So even though this lineup and much of the music is newish, the performances have a lived-in feel. That comfort level among the players lets them be their best. Group chemistry and deft composing make ""Infinity"" one more polished, inventive, easy-on-the-ears Tom Harrell album to check out - jazz in the modern mainstream that's really, really good.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""THE ISLE"")
DAVIES: Kevin Whitehead writes for Point of Departure and The Audio Beat. He reviewed ""Infinity,"" the new CD by jazz trumpeter Tom Harrell.
On tomorrow's show - fear and hope about climate change. Bill McKibben, who first warned of climate change 30 years ago, says its effects are now upon us with heatwaves, fires, flooding, drought and, soon, millions of climate refugees. He also warns of the dangers of human genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. McKibben's new book is called ""Falter"" - hope you can join us.

Trump Administration Moves Forward With Proposal To Re-Define Waterway Protections,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616827/trump-administration-moves-forward-with-proposal-to-re-define-waterway-protectio,"Trump Administration Moves Forward With Proposal To Re-Define Waterway Protections Trump Administration Moves Forward With Proposal To Re-Define Waterway Protections Embed Embed
The Trump administration's revisions to the Waters of the U.S. rule will strip federal water protections from millions of miles of rivers. The impact will be even more pronounced in the arid Southwest.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
The Trump administration is moving forward with a proposal that would redefine which waterways in America get federal protection. Many industry groups felt that the previous definition was too broad. NPR's Nathan Rott went to New Mexico, a state that's bracing for significant change. He sent this report.
NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: For most of you river-goers out there, the Santa Fe...
(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)
ROTT: ...Would not be much to look at or play in. You'd be lucky if you could float a soda can down it. Though looking at its brush-tangled banks in downtown Santa Fe, it looks like a few people have tried. Its springtime runoff is more trickle than torrent. But to folks like Rachel Conn, this is impressive.
RACHEL CONN: This is, like, flow in New Mexico. This is - a lot of creatures depend on something like this.
ROTT: Conn is with Amigos Bravos, New Mexico-based conservation group that focuses on water issues.
CONN: Up to 94 percent of our waters are these smaller types of waters that flow only part of the year. But they all drain into our bigger systems. And it is from these bigger systems that close to 300,000 New Mexicans receive their drinking water.
ROTT: And it's these types of smaller rivers and streams that may soon lose federal protections. The Trump administration's new proposed definition of which waters should fall under the Clean Water Act does not include ephemeral or intermittent streams - waterways that only flow after precipitation like the Santa Fe, or, say, every other year, which isn't all that uncommon in the arid Southwest. That means industry or landowners looking to discharge wastewater into one of those or dam one of those streams would no longer need a federal permit to do so.
HELEN NEVILLE: So it's millions of miles of stream.
ROTT: Helen Neville is the senior scientist for the conservation and sportsmen's group Trout Unlimited, an organization that opposes the new rule. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that about 18 percent of streams nationwide and half of the country's wetlands would no longer be considered waters of the United States under the president's proposal. Trout Unlimited believes it's far more because ephemeral streams are so hard to map and so easily overlooked.
NEVILLE: You know, it's very similar to how you think about your capillaries feeding your blood vessels.
ROTT: Ephemeral streams may seem insignificant.
NEVILLE: But they're critically important for the health of those downstream waters just like your capillaries are critically important for the health of your blood system.
ROTT: And she says that's especially true in the southwest, where rains can be few and far between. Even the Rio Grande, New Mexico's biggest river, ran dry in parts last year. Chad Smith, CEO of the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, is less worried about the impact on the state's waterways and doesn't believe that it will lead to a surge in pollution from industries like his, something environmental groups have warned about.
CHAD SMITH: We want to make sure our waterways are clean. We want to make sure we protect our natural resources that we make a living off of.
ROTT: He says industry groups around the country are applauding the proposed change.
SMITH: It couldn't be more welcomed. I think what it does from a very high-level perspective is it provides some more clarity and certainty for farmers and ranchers across the landscape.
ROTT: Clarity and certainty are the reasons the Trump administration is giving, too. The EPA says they want to make it clear for landowners and developers whether federal laws apply to a project or not. Conflicting court decisions have made that muddy in the past. And it's likely that courts will get another say about this change. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Santa Fe, N.M. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Yahoo sports columnist Dan Wetzel about Tiger Woods' comeback as a person and player, following his fifth Masters win on Sunday.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Just two years ago around this time, Tiger Woods was ranked the 780th best golfer in the world a far cry from where he stood during the late 90s and mid 2000s when he was considered one of the best golfers of all time. After dealing with both personal and medical problems for years, it was uncertain whether Woods would ever get back to the top of the sport. Well, that all changed yesterday when Tiger Woods won the Masters Tournament, his first major championship since 2008.
And now President Trump has announced that he will be presenting Tiger Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, quote, because of his ""incredible success and comeback in sports - golf - and, more importantly, life.""
Here to help us wrap all of this up is Dan Wetzel of Yahoo Sports. Welcome.
DAN WETZEL: Thanks for having me on.
CHANG: So would you rate Tiger's win on Sunday as one of the biggest comebacks you have ever seen in all of sports?
WETZEL: Absolutely because this looked like a guy spiraling completely out of control in every aspect. He's turned his life around. He's not only succeeding on the golf course, he seemed to be extremely healthy in all ways and maintains a terrific relationship with his children. He always wanted to be a terrific father, and you saw that, too, on Sunday.
CHANG: Speaking of that, you wrote a really moving piece about how special yesterday's victory was, in part because of who was waiting for him at the very end. Can you take us back to that moment?
WETZEL: So when he first won in 1997 at the Masters at Augusta National, his father was waiting for him right off of the 18th green. And Tiger was 21 years old at that point. And it was really a culmination of a journey between a father and a son in shocking the world and becoming the youngest Masters champion of all time and the first African-American champion.
CHANG: Yeah.
WETZEL: It was a pioneering moment. Twenty-two years later, his father has passed away. But Tiger returns, wins even with more acclaim after all this tumult. And who's waiting in the exact same spot where his dad was but his old 10-year-old son Charlie, his daughter Sam, his mom and stuff like that. But it was really Charlie who ran into him. And in the exact same spot...
CHANG: Wow.
WETZEL: ...He's now bear-hugging his 10-year-old son where he once bear-hugged his father. And even Tiger is not the most sentimental. But I guess as you get older, you become that.
CHANG: (Laughter).
WETZEL: And his dad got them there by teaching him how to play golf, how to be competitive, how to kick down doors. Charlie and Samantha (ph), his kids, taught him how to keep trying because they - he said they have the infectious happiness of a child. In their own way, they helped him get there, too - just a really interesting situation, the Woods family.
CHANG: Yeah. I want to play you this clip from Brooks Koepka. He finished second after Tiger yesterday. Here's what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BROOKS KOEPKA: It's probably one of the coolest things to be a part of it. Even though I - you know, you finish second place. You know, you're a little bummed out. But it's - I wouldn't want it any other way. You want to go toe-to-toe with him. And I can leave saying I gave it my all. And he's a good, man.
CHANG: I mean, Koepka is a guy who grew up as a little kid watching Tiger dominate in those early years. Right?
WETZEL: Most of the guys Tiger Woods beat yesterday are playing golf because of Tiger Woods, they will tell you. They were 8 and 10 and 12 years old and said, I want to play like him and were drawn to that sport. Almost all the golfers who lost the tournament stuck around and waited when Tiger was going to win it. Usually, those guys are defeated, they're depressed, and they want to get out of there as fast as possible.
CHANG: (Laughter).
WETZEL: Guys that lost and others stayed, and they just wanted to be a part of it and see Tiger Woods win that. The amount of respect that says without saying a word is incredible. It's very, very rare.
CHANG: So when you were watching him play yesterday, did it feel like a different Tiger in the way he connected with people watching?
WETZEL: All weekend, he wore a smile - if nothing else - that you didn't always see when he was a little bit more intense and robotic and more of a fierce competitor early in his career. I think, over this, he's realized how many people really wanted him to succeed. Again, as we mentioned, he'd been in some dark places physically...
CHANG: Yeah.
WETZEL: ...And in his personal life. And then here's the support and everybody rooting him on. The crowd wanted him to win. He wanted to win. And it was like a journey he had to go with them together.
CHANG: Yahoo Sports writer Dan Wetzel, thanks so much for joining us today.

Could The Release Of The Mueller Report Change President Trump's Narrative?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616813/could-the-release-of-the-mueller-report-change-president-trumps-narrative,"NPR's Audie Cornish speaks with New Yorker staff writer Susan Glasser, about how President Trump has bounced back up in the polls since the release of the summary of the Mueller report.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
President Trump's take on all this - no collusion, no obstruction, complete and total exoneration. And we know all that because that's what the president tweeted shortly after Attorney General William Barr released his four-page summary of the Mueller report last month. So could the release of the report change the president's narrative, or how could it affect the political landscape in Washington? We're going to tackle some of these questions with Susan Glasser. She writes the Letter From Washington column for The New Yorker. Welcome to the studio.
SUSAN GLASSER: Thank you so much.
CORNISH: So as we just heard Carrie say, there is a lot of nuance that could be revealed in the report, right? For example, the reason why Robert Mueller decided not to charge the president with obstruction of justice because of - was it because of Justice Department policy or was it because he truly did not obstruct justice? But have perceptions been set already?
GLASSER: Well, that's right. There's obviously not a lot of nuance that can be conveyed in either a four-page letter or a 140-character tweet. And President Trump has been very clear in trying to establish a political narrative around what the attorney general has characterized as the findings in the report. So the question is, is there anything that's going to change, essentially, the political point of view surrounding this report that we're going to learn? Or, essentially, has the news cycle moved on?
Remember, President Trump has had such a consistent approval and disapproval rating. Basically, people's minds are made up about the president. And so I think, from the point of view of Washington and politics, one big question - is there anything in this report - any fact, any conclusion, any information - that offers the possibility of changing the minds of the very few people whose minds are still available to be changed about the president?
CORNISH: Right. I mean, did poll numbers tell us anything even when the summary first came out? We've had, you know, some time since then.
GLASSER: Well, that's right. I mean, look. Consistently, surveys have shown that people in both parties want the report released. It took a little bit of time, but you have seen Republicans migrating around to the narrative that the president has offered for them that, in fact, this report does offer exoneration and vindication. But interestingly, the president himself appears to be somewhat more nervous and concerned about what is actually in this report than he was initially.
Remember, there was this sort of jubilance. The president was in Florida at his golf club when the initial reports about the report came out. And he exclaimed with what clearly was a great relief that he was off scot-free. There was no collusion. Now he's back to criticizing - just this morning, again in a tweet - the Mueller team, who has written this report, as if they were partisan, angry Democrats. And you hear increasing calls on the Republican side that they should investigate the investigators.
CORNISH: Right. This is questions about whether or not the investigators surveilled the Trump campaign, whether they overstepped in doing so. In the time we have left, what does this mean for Democrats?
GLASSER: Well, there was already a very, very robust debate that's only likely to grow about 2020 and how best to confront and to run against Donald Trump. Is it about his character? Is it about his conduct while in office? Is it about questions that may be raised in the Mueller report and other investigations? Or should Democrats really pursue a conversation and offering the American people their substantive, policy-oriented agenda? And I think this will help to answer some of that debate a little bit, what we find out this week.
CORNISH: That's Susan Glasser, staff writer at The New Yorker. Thank you for speaking with us.
GLASSER: Thank you.

Justice Department To Release Redacted Version Of Mueller Report On Thursday,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616806/justice-department-to-release-redacted-version-of-mueller-report-on-thursday,"Justice Department To Release Redacted Version Of Mueller Report On Thursday Justice Department To Release Redacted Version Of Mueller Report On Thursday Embed Embed
The Justice Department says it will release a redacted version of the Mueller report on Thursday. The release should shed light on many open questions surrounding the special counsel's investigation.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
And now to Washington, where the long wait to see the Mueller report is nearly over here. The Justice Department says it will release the special counsel report about Russian election interference this Thursday, but it's still unclear how much of the document people will get to see. NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this story, and she joins us now. Hey, Carrie.
CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.
CHANG: So can you just take us back for a moment? What do we know about this report and what it will look like when it gets released?
JOHNSON: Remember that special counsel Robert Mueller delivered this report to Justice Department leaders on March 22 - quite a while ago.
CHANG: Right. Yeah.
JOHNSON: It's long. It's about 400 pages, and it's separated into sections that cover things like obstruction of justice and conspiracy, also known as collusion in this White House. The report covers the analysis as well as the conclusions the special counsel reached. Now, a lot of work went into this investigation - nearly two years, 500 search warrants, 2,800 subpoenas.
CHANG: Wow.
JOHNSON: But all people have seen is a four-page letter that the attorney general, Bill Barr, sent to Congress last month. Remember, in that letter, Barr says prosecutors did not have enough evidence to establish conspiracy charges against any Americans for conspiring with the Russian government. And Barr says he can determine that President Trump did not obstruct justice, so Trump won't face any criminal charges either.
CHANG: OK. But there's still a lot that we don't know. What are you personally going to be looking for when you get your hands on this report on Thursday?
JOHNSON: I'm curious about a lot of things. The first is the special counsel did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump should be charged with obstructing justice, but the special counsel also wrote he did not exonerate the president. Why not? Was that because the Justice Department guidance says a sitting president can't be charged with a crime while he's in office, or for some other reason?
Another thing I wonder about - what other evidence did investigators gather about obstruction? A lot was done in the open - the firing of former FBI Director Jim Comey, for instance. But what else did this team pry out of this White House?
And then on another front, conspiracy. Was the evidence just not strong enough on conspiracy because Trump campaign officials didn't know what they were doing? Were they being duped by the Russian government or Russian business leaders? Or are they more like what some former intelligence officers call useful idiots?
CHANG: Now, the attorney general told Congress last week that he would be redacting, or blacking out, parts of this report. That prompted a question from Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. Here's what he asked.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BRIAN SCHATZ: The basic question, I think, for the public is, are we going to get the gist of this, or is it going to be, you know, on January of 2015, and then you have to flip 15 pages to find the next text?
WILLIAM BARR: You will get more than the gist.
CHANG: OK, more than the gist, but how much more, Carrie? What do you think?
JOHNSON: What we know is the process has been happening in connection with members of the special counsel team as of last week. Barr told Congress he had not overruled that team on any redactions.
And we also know there are categories of material that are going to be hidden - things about ongoing investigations, since there are offshoots ongoing in D.C. and New York and Virginia that are still active. Classified material's not going to be in there. Grand jury material is unlikely to be in there. And also unlikely to be in there - sensitive information that could hurt the privacy of third parties who were not charged.
Now, the attorney general says that category will not apply to the president, but what about Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump or the son-in-law, Jared Kushner? We just don't know yet.
CHANG: So many questions still left to be answered. NPR justice correspondent, Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie.

Tragedy And Fire Strike Notre Dame Cathedral In Paris,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616795/tragedy-and-fire-strike-notre-dame-cathedral-in-paris,"NPR's Audie Cornish speaks with Time Magazine correspondent Vivienne Walt about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. She says this fire was a disaster waiting to happen due to lack of funds to protect it.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris went up in flames today. The spire of this historic building has collapsed. But a Paris fire official says the main structure of the cathedral has been saved and preserved. For now, though, firefighters are still on the scene. Vivienne Walt is a correspondent for Time magazine based in Paris, and she joins us now. Welcome.
VIVIENNE WALT: Thank you.
CHANG: So I understand you could see the fire from your balcony. What did it look like from where you were standing earlier today?
WALT: Well, I mean, you could certainly see smoke rising. And the air was pretty thick with smoke. You could smell it for several hours. It's abated a bit now. But I have to say, you know, this city has been through some pretty high drama in the last couple of years. And every time the sirens start screaming through the streets, there's a kind of tension that descends on the city. And, you know, people immediately start gathering and trying to see what's going on. So outside the cathedral you had hundreds and hundreds of people who have been out for hours now, singing, just standing there silently, just gathering. Notre Dame is a place of gathering.
CHANG: Yeah.
WALT: It's really - it's really unlike any other church in the city and, you know, very, very few in Europe. It's not simply a church. It's almost like stepping into a kind of medieval marketplace inside. It's enormous. It's - there's always a hurly burly. And there's always a - you know, numerous things going on in there.
CHANG: Well, now, we were seeing reports that officials are saying the fire might be connected to the renovation work going on in there. You've reported on the renovations for Time. What kind of shape was the cathedral in before this fire?
WALT: Well, you know, for years they have been saying that the church was in terrible shape. And in fact, church officials had taken me up onto the roof not that long ago, when I was reporting this for Time, to show me how pieces of the building were simply dropping off. They described the gargoyles, the medieval faces on the side of the church, as being like ice cream melting in the sun. They would simply, like, drop away. The church had no money to replace them or restore them. And so they were using, like, PVC pipes to just, you know, stick on the side of the walls where the gargoyles had been. And...
CHANG: Oh, my goodness, wow. I mean, Notre Dame is one of the most iconic symbols of Paris. Can you talk about the cultural significance of this cathedral for France?
WALT: Well, this is where it all began. This was the beginning point of Paris. Everything, all distances in the whole of France, in fact, are measured by the distance to Notre Dame Cathedral. It was the kind of ground zero, if you like, of the city and of this country. And it has remained - even though France is a strictly secular country now, it has remained a very, very symbolic heart of the country that I think will - this will really have quite a deep impact on people.
CHANG: Yeah. Vivienne Walt from Time magazine, thank you very much for joining us tonight.
WALT: You're welcome.

Woods now has 15 major wins, compared to 18 for Nicklaus. ""I felt for a long time that he was going to win again. ... He's got me shaking in my boots, guys,"" Nicklaus told the Golf Channel after Tiger's victory.

Tiger last won the Masters Tournament in 2005 – the longest period ever between wins in that tournament. Since then, he's gone through a high-profile sex scandal and major injuries.

""Luckily I had the procedure on my back, which gave me a chance at having a normal life. ... The body's not the same as it was a long time ago, but I still have good hands.""
According to Forbes , in 2009 he brought in $105 in endorsements and appearance fees, compared to $37 million in 2017. As Bloomberg noted , many top sponsors such as AT&T, Accenture, Gillette, Gatorade ended their relationships with him following the scandals. TaylorMade is a newer sponsor, as is golf ball manufacturer Bridgestone Golf and drink company Monster Energy.
But Nike, which has been a sponsor since 1996, has stuck by him. And that has turned out to be lucrative.
According to sponsorship analytics firm Apex Marketing Group, the brand exposure that Nike got from Woods during the final round of this tournament was worth more than $22.5 million. They calculated that branding on his bag from Monster Energy and on his golf balls from Bridgestone Golf was also worth more than $1 million total.
The amount of exposure that Woods produced for Nike in the final round is nearly double the $12 million that Apex estimates Nike gained last year from Masters winner Patrick Reed.
That's largely due to the intense focus the TV broadcast placed on Woods, said Apex president Eric Smallwood. ""Pretty much every hole, every time he hit the ball, they were showing him ... or the Nike logo,"" he told NPR.
Nike has drawn down its relationship with Woods over the years – now concentrating on his apparel rather than balls or clubs.
But Smallwood doesn't see the company ever dropping him. ""I think Nike will stick with him until he stops playing golf, in some capacity. I don't foresee that ever going away,"" he says.
From a branding perspective, he says, Woods' story has obvious appeal. ""This is coming back from not even playing and winning the Masters. It's got a lot of good story lines to it,"" he says, that brands would want to hold onto.

Across the country, spring has sprung. But for millions of fans, winter is finally here. And a television phenomenon is almost over.
Eight years, tens of Emmy Awards , many millions of fans: by the numbers, ""Game of Thrones"" is a a massive hit.
The last season will resolve the fight for the Iron Throne and take a beloved series of novels farther than even its author imagined.
Here's how Vulture described the show's symbolism and resonance:
Game of Thrones may be the last show we all watch together the way we used to, on such a tremendous scale. Even if you don't watch it, you may feel as if you do. So many key incidents on the series — including the Red Wedding, Cersei's walk of shame, and the death and resurrection of Jon Snow — seeped into the surrounding culture and became synonymous with ""shocking plot twist"" (or ""obligatory plot twist"") even for people who'd never seen a frame of it. It's a lavishly produced, massively popular piece of entertainment that generates awareness far out or proportion to its legal viewership (between 12 million and 16 million people watch a first-run episode, according to HBO), dominating online TV conversation during consecutive weeks when it airs new installments.
The most important words in that last sentence are ""consecutive weeks"" and ""installments."" From the heyday of Charles Dickens, whose piecemeal novels were so popular that superfans used to wait at the docks for shipments of periodicals containing the latest installments, serialized storytelling has always known how to hook people's imaginations with the bait of ""What will happen next?""
As the final season begins, we're wondering about the future of appointment television. Is there any other show out there that has the same broad appeal? What does it mean that millions of people are so attached to this story?
We answer your questions, hear from fans and take your predictions on how it all might end. Facebook"

Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, entered not guilty pleas Monday in federal court in Boston.
Both waived their right to appear in court for arraignment.
Federal prosecutors announced additional charges last week against Loughlin, Giannulli and 14 other wealthy parents. They face one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest-services mail and wire fraud, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Loughlin is best known for playing the role of Aunt Becky on Full House . Giannulli's Mossimo brand was a core clothing label at Target until 2017 . Lori Loughlin, 15 Others Indicted On New Charges In College Admissions Scandal
Giannulli and Loughlin are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes arranged by college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits for the crew team, despite neither of them being a rower.
According to the Justice Department's superseding indictment , Giannulli and Loughlin made payments in 2016 and 2017 to former USC Associate Athletic Director Donna Heinel and to Key Worldwide Foundation, which was operated by Singer.
The indictment paints a picture of how the Justice Department built its case:
""On or about November 29, 2018, Singer called Loughlin from Boston, Massachusetts. During the call, Singer said, in sum and substance, that [Key Worldwide Foundation] was being audited by the IRS, which was asking about the two payments of $200,000 by the Giannullis. Singer added: 'So I just want to make sure that you know that, one, that you're probably going to get a call and that I have not told them anything about the girls going through the side door, through crew, ever though they didn't do crew to get into USC. So I—that is—all I told them was that you guys made a donation to our foundation to help underserved kids.' Loughlin replied, 'Um-hmm.' "" Felicity Huffman And 12 Other Parents To Plead Guilty In College Cheating Scandal
The couple's older daughter, Olivia Jade Giannulli, is a beauty vlogger with nearly 2 million subscribers. Since her parents' arrest, she has lost deals with Sephora and TRESemmé.
Last week, other parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, announced that they would enter guilty pleas to a single charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest-services mail fraud. "

Twitter Enlarge this image Christina Chung for NPR Christina Chung for NPR Militia leader Ammon Bundy, famous for leading an armed standoff in Oregon, had a tender moment in November of last year. He recorded a Facebook post saying that perhaps President Trump's characterization of the migrant caravan on the U.S.-Mexico border was somewhat broad. Maybe they weren't all criminals, he said. ""What about those who have come here for reasons of need?""
Bundy did not say he was breaking with Trump. He just asked his followers to put themselves in the shoes of ""the fathers, the mothers, the children"" who came to escape violence. It was a call for a truce grounded in empathy, the kind you might hear in a war zone, say, or an Easter Sunday sermon. Still, it was met with a swift and rageful response from his followers, so overwhelming that within days, Bundy decided to quit Facebook.
Civility Wars Keeping It Civil: How To Talk Politics Without Letting Things Turn Ugly In an earlier era, Bundy's appeal might have resonated. But he failed to tune in to a critical shift in American culture — one that a handful of researchers have been tracking, with some alarm, for the past decade or so. Americans these days seem to be losing their appetite for empathy, especially the walk-a-mile-in-someone's-shoes Easter Sunday morning kind.
When I was growing up in the '70s, empathy was all the rage. The term was coined in 1908; then, social scientists and psychologists started more aggressively pushing the concept into the culture after World War II, basically out of fear. The idea was that we were all going to kill each other with nuclear weapons — or learn to see the world through each other's eyes. In my elementary school in the 1970s, which was not progressive or mushy in any way, we wrote letters to pretend Russian pen pals to teach us to open our hearts to our enemies.
Shots - Health News Does Empathy Have A Dark Side? And not just enemies. Civil rights activists had also picked up on the idea. Kenneth Clark, a social scientist and civil rights activist, half-jokingly proposed that people in power all be required to take an ""empathy pill"" so they could make better decisions. His hope was that people with power and privilege would one day inhabit the realities of people without power, not from the safe, noblesse oblige distance of pity, but from the inside. An evolved person was an empathetic person, choosing understanding over fear.
Then, more than a decade ago, a certain suspicion of empathy started to creep in, particularly among young people. One of the first people to notice was Sara Konrath, an associate professor and researcher at Indiana University. Since the late 1960s, researchers have surveyed young people on their levels of empathy, testing their agreement with statements such as: ""It's not really my problem if others are in trouble and need help"" or ""Before criticizing somebody I try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place.""
Konrath collected decades of studies and noticed a very obvious pattern. Starting around 2000, the line starts to slide. More students say it's not their problem to help people in trouble, not their job to see the world from someone else's perspective. By 2009, on all the standard measures, Konrath found, young people on average measure 40 percent less empathetic than my own generation — 40 percent!
It's strange to think of empathy – a natural human impulse — as fluctuating in this way, moving up and down like consumer confidence. But that's what happened. Young people just started questioning what my elementary school teachers had taught me.
Their feeling was: Why should they put themselves in the shoes of someone who was not them, much less someone they thought was harmful? In fact, cutting someone off from empathy was the positive value, a way to make a stand.
So, for example, when the wife of white nationalist Richard Spencer recently told BuzzFeed he had abused her, the question debated on the lefty Internet was: Why should we care that some woman who chose to ally herself with a nasty racist got herself hurt? Why waste empathy on that? (Spencer, in a court filing, denies all her allegations .)
The new rule for empathy seems to be: reserve it, not for your ""enemies,"" but for the people you believe are hurt, or you have decided need it the most. Empathy, but just for your own team. And empathizing with the other team? That's practically a taboo.
And it turns out that this brand of selective empathy is a powerful force.
In the past 20 years, psychologists and neurologists have started to look at how empathy actually works, in our brains and our hearts, when we're not thinking about it. And one thing they've found is that ""one of the strongest triggers for human empathy is observing some kind of conflict between two other parties,"" says Fritz Breithaupt, a professor at Indiana University who studies empathy. ""Once they take the side, they're drawn into that perspective. And that can lead to very strong empathy and too strong polarization with something you only see this one side and not the other side any longer.""
A classic example is the Super Bowl, or any Auburn, Alabama game.

Especially when you're younger, Dunn says, you may be happier having the flexibility to travel and teach English in Thailand and pursue other adventures like that, rather than spend money and time dealing with plumbing problems and leaky roofs. How To Buy A House, In 7 Steps
4. That flexibility comes with a cost: Rent will always go up.
Inflation alone pushes rents up over time — and if the neighborhood gets trendy, rents can go through the roof.
But if you own your home (and you have a fixed-rate mortgage), your monthly payment is a fixed cost. McCargo says that this offers peace of mind. And as inflation rises, living in your home gets effectively cheaper over time.
""Not to mention, every single month, you're paying something down every time you make that mortgage payment,"" says McCargo, thereby building your equity in your home and reducing your debt load.

Homeownership might have a lower price of entry than you think. A 20 percent down payment was once standard, but McCargo says the average today is 5 percent of the total. First-time buyers can find programs that offer mortgages with even lower down payments, and some cities offer grants to help with down payments to encourage people to invest in their communities. A good place to go to find out about such incentives is your state's housing finance agency.
6. Owning a home can give you a sense of security — and that can be priceless.

President Trump Is Not Backing Down From Controversial Proposal On Sanctuary Cities : NPR,www.npr.org,Mara Liasson,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616850/president-trump-is-not-backing-down-from-controversial-proposal-on-sanctuary-cit,"President Trump Is Not Backing Down From Controversial Proposal On Sanctuary Cities President Trump Is Not Backing Down From Controversial Proposal On Sanctuary Cities Embed Embed
President Trump is leaning into a controversial proposal to send immigrants in the country illegally to so-called sanctuary cities. What is the political calculus behind such a move?
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
President Trump is leaning in on an idea that was initially dismissed by experts in his own administration. That idea is to transfer migrants detained at the border to so-called sanctuary cities. These are cities where local law enforcement limits its cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The idea has outraged Democrats. They say the president wants to use migrants as political pawns.
NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now from the White House to talk about all of this. Hey, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.
CHANG: So what's the latest from the president on this idea? I take it he is not backing down.
LIASSON: He's not backing down. He tweeted about it again today. He said that migrants in the country who can no longer be legally detained will be, quote, ""given to sanctuary cities and states."" Although he said that would be subject to the Department of Homeland Security, so we don't know if it's something that is actually doable right away. We know that the White House and the Department of Homeland Security is looking into whether it can be done financially and legally. And already Democrats in Congress are pushing back against this, saying they haven't appropriated any money to do this.
CHANG: Can we just talk about the politics of all this? Why might this actually be a good political maneuver on Trump's part?
LIASSON: Well, that's debated even inside Republican circles. Trump initially said this was a way to punish Democrats, to kind of own the libs - to say, oh, well, you don't like us holding these asylum-seekers. We'll just send them your way.
CHANG: Right.
LIASSON: But practically speaking, he isn't really owning the libs if mayors in those sanctuary cities say they're happy to take migrants. And the migrants themselves would be thrilled to be bussed free of charge to San Francisco instead of kept in a very chilly detention center on the border. But politically, this is a way for him to show that he's taking action, acting unilaterally - that's the way he likes to act - sticking it to his opponents. So in that sense, his base is likely to be supportive of this move. On the other hand, people who find every single thing that Donald Trump does horrifying - they probably won't like it at all. So it's the same old polarization.
CHANG: Right. Now, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told NPR over the weekend that this idea actually is not about punishing Democrats. Instead, it's about giving them an olive branch - an olive branch for what?
LIASSON: Well, that was kind of discordant messaging because Hogan Gidley is suggesting this is an olive branch to maybe convince Democrats that they should negotiate with Donald Trump, where Trump is off saying it's a way to punish liberals.
But the administration has been pretty clear the things they want to do to deal with the recent surge of immigrants in the border. Most of those things need Congress' approval to solve the problem. They would like Congress to make it easier to hold families together in detention. They would like to change a law that deals with unaccompanied minors. And they want to close something that they call the credible fear loophole. The administration feels it's too easy for asylum-seekers to come to the border and say they have a credible fear of being killed if they stayed in their home countries. And the administration wants to change the criteria for when a credible fear claim should be believed.
CHANG: Well, given how many challenges there are at managing the problems at the border, is there a risk for Democrats if they don't engage with the White House now to try to address the situation down there?
LIASSON: Potentially yes. You know, if the issue is framed in terms of border security, I think that's an advantage for the administration. If the debate is all about putting children in cages, using immigrants as political pawns, building a wall that's very unpopular, then Donald Trump is on the defensive.
But I do think that if Democrats were to say what they'd want to do at the border, they would probably say we need more judges. We need more detention facilities. We need to streamline the process. We need to send more money to Central America, money that the president has now taken away, to Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala to try to mitigate the forces in those countries that are causing people to flee. So you can imagine two sides coming together in a negotiation in an alternative universe...
CHANG: (Laughter).
LIASSON: ...But not the political universe that we have right now.
CHANG: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara.

Officials In Condemn Trump's To Move Immigrant Detainees,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616857/officials-in-sanctuary-cities-condemn-trumps-proposal-to-move-immigrant-detainee,"The president says he is considering sending detained immigrants in the country illegally to sanctuary cities. San Francisco is among the cities that have passed sanctuary city ordinances.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Officials in sanctuary cities are largely condemning President Trump's proposal to move immigrant detainees from the border to those cities. There are almost 200 sanctuary municipalities, states and counties across the U.S. San Francisco is one of them. City leaders there say that although they would welcome migrants, they don't think transporting them to the city is the best option. Sonja Hutson from member station KQED reports.
SONJA HUTSON, BYLINE: San Francisco's had a sanctuary policy since 1989. It limits the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. San Francisco Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer says it's an ordinance the city is proud of.
SANDRA LEE FEWER: In San Francisco, we don't know who's documented and who isn't. Actually, we just live amongst each other, and we live peacefully.
HUTSON: While Fewer and other officials are denouncing the proposal, they're also saying they would welcome the migrants if it goes through.
FEWER: We will treat them as human beings. We respect them as people. And we want their families to have a livelihood here, too.
HUTSON: Critics of sanctuary policies say they endanger residents. They point to the fatal 2015 shooting of a woman in San Francisco by an undocumented immigrant. That instance garnered national attention as an example of violence enabled by sanctuary policies. The immigrant, however, was acquitted of murder and manslaughter.
But supporters of the policy, like San Francisco Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, say they keep the city safe and help improve the well-being of immigrants.
RAFAEL MANDELMAN: It's about immigrant communities being able to go to the police, be able to go to our public health resources. Our city will not be stronger if our immigrant communities feel that they can't go to the police or can't go see a doctor.
HUTSON: In addition to several major cities, including San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles, the entire state of California has a sanctuary policy. Kevin de Leon authored the sanctuary state law when he represented parts of Los Angeles in the state Senate. He says another concern is the cost of transporting these migrants.
KEVIN DE LEON: Wasting taxpayer dollars to put folks on a plane specifically to sanctuary cities is a non-starter.
HUTSON: San Francisco is more than 500 miles from the California-Mexico border. De Leon says the proposal has little to do with what's best for immigration and more to do with agitating President Trump's base in the run-up to the 2020 election.
DE LEON: It's clearly not done to benefit the immigrants themselves, but rather to do everything within his power to embarrass elected official leaders throughout the state who have defended immigrants.
HUTSON: This isn't the first time the Trump administration has singled out sanctuary cities. In 2017, it threatened to withhold law enforcement grants from nearly 30 jurisdictions. In the end, many courts determined the federal government could not withhold those grants.
But not everyone in California or San Francisco agrees with the elected leaders who put forth these policies. Harmeet Dhillon is the Republican National Committeewoman for California and a lawyer in San Francisco. She supports President Trump's proposal to move immigrants to sanctuary cities. And she says the Democratic response to that suggestion has been hypocritical.
HARMEET DHILLON: Talk about political ploys and political pawns. Democrats have been using illegal aliens as political pawns and selling points and talking points for their pandering to the Hispanic vote for decades.
HUTSON: And Dhillon says city officials shouldn't be welcoming large amounts of undocumented immigrants into places like San Francisco.
DHILLON: Actually, when you can't take care of the health and welfare needs and educational needs of your own citizens, then you are a bad leader trying to dilute those resources amongst people who have not necessarily paid their dues to be here in this country.
HUTSON: Dhillon says sanctuary cities should focus on helping current residents, including large homeless populations in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles. For NPR News, I'm Sonja Hutson in San Francisco.
