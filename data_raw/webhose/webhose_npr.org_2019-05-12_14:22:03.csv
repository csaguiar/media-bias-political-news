World's Largest Plane Takes Flight Over The Weekend,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387966/worlds-largest-plane-takes-flight-over-the-weekend,"Stratolaunch Systems successfully launched the first test flight of the Stratolaunch, a six-engine plane with a wingspan 385 feet wide — longer than a football field and any planes' wingspan.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So over the weekend, we saw a record-breaking launch that will hopefully change the way we send satellites into space.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The Stratolaunch took its first flight on Saturday. It is a six-engine plane with a wingspan of 385 feet. Three-hundred-eighty-five feet from one wing tip to the other, which makes it the world's largest plane if you measure it by wingspan. To put that in perspective, that is considerably wider than the length of a football field.
EVAN THOMAS: It was overall fantastic. I honestly could not have hoped for more on a first flight, especially of an airplane of this complexity.
INSKEEP: Evan Thomas is the pilot from Saturday's test flight in California's Mojave Desert - I guess we should say over the desert. He was speaking after the launch.
GREENE: Eventually, Stratolaunch hopes to use this oversized wingspan as a launching pad from 35,000 feet, at which point, the rockets carrying commercial satellites would take off into orbit. Now, while this weekend's test flight did not carry any rockets, it did carry a lot of weight for the company.
INSKEEP: The flight took place without Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft and Stratolaunch's founder. He died in October before getting the chance to witness this moment.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JEAN FLOYD: I'd never imagined the experience without Paul standing next to me. And even though he wasn't there today as the plane lifted gracefully from the runway, I did whisper a thank you to Paul for allowing me to be part of this remarkable achievement.
GREENE: That was Stratolaunch CEO Jean Floyd. The company says it wants to begin launching rockets from the Stratolaunch as early as next year.

Oil and gas companies will do seismic testing to see what's under the ocean floor, part of the Trump administration's push to expand drilling. Experts say that could harm some endangered animals.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The Trump administration wants to expand oil and gas drilling offshore. It's given a preliminary go-ahead for companies to carry out seismic testing to see what's down there. But what do those sound waves do to ocean life? Here's Craig LeMoult of member station WGBH.
CRAIG LEMOULT, BYLINE: Researcher Stormy Mayo searches the water from inside the cabin of a 44-foot boat. The radio crackles. And it gets a message from a spotter plane overhead.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We have about eight individual right whales, scattered about, going on long dives...
LEMOULT: Mayo's with the Center for Coastal Studies on the tip of Cape Cod. And much of his work focuses on the North Atlantic right whale.
STORMY MAYO: A population that numbers, probably, in the vicinity of 410 animals left. And the most troubling part of the story is that their numbers appear to be declining.
LEMOULT: As he talks, he keeps his eye on the water.
MAYO: There's something over there - way over there. See, yeah. There's a spout. Yeah.
LEMOULT: The boat heads in that direction. And then there it is. A right whale, about as big as the boat, floats to the surface and exhales.
(SOUNDBITE OF BLOWHOLE SPRAYING)
LEMOULT: Mayo says the greatest threats to right whales are ship strikes and entanglements in fishing lines. But he's increasingly worried about the oil and gas industry's desire to see what's under the Atlantic seafloor. In November, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reversed an Obama administration decision. It permitted five companies to use sound waves to explore for oil and gas between Delaware and Florida.
MAYO: Is seismic testing something that is likely safe? I don't think many of us believe that. We think seismic testing is damaging not just to whales but to much of the marine ecosystem.
LEMOULT: Chris Clark of Cornell University says seismic exploration is based on a very simple principle.
CHRIS CLARK: You make a very loud sound. And the sound energy travels through the water and enters the Earth's crust and then reflects off of things in the Earth's crust.
LEMOULT: That incredibly loud sound comes from an air cannon that goes off continually about every 10 seconds. Clark has recorded those blasts underwater.
(SOUNDBITE OF AIR CANNON FIRING)
LEMOULT: Clark worries seismic blasts could disrupt the basic activities of whales and a range of other marine life.
CLARK: Navigating, finding food, finding mates, detecting predators, maintaining social networks - all of this is done through sound, not through sight.
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALE VOCALIZING)
LEMOULT: Gail Adams of the International Association of Geophysical Contractors says seismic testing is used without negative impacts for research and in the development of offshore wind. And she says they make an effort to avoid whales.
GAIL ADAMS: We have people onboard the vessels that check for the presence of marine mammals and other marine species within a specified exclusion zone, that make sure that the area is free before we begin our operations. We have passive acoustic monitoring onboard that listens for the vocalization of marine mammals.
LEMOULT: And they consider migration patterns and breeding times. Scott Kraus, a right whale expert at the New England Aquarium, says that's not enough. He testified at a congressional hearing on the subject last month.
(SOUNDBITE OF CONGRESSIONAL HEARING)
SCOTT KRAUS: The mitigation strategies employed by - for all of these seismic activities are a little bit of a lipstick on a pig. That is to say they will prevent immediate mortality if a whale gets so close that it's going to get blown up.
LEMOULT: But he says they won't do anything to stop the disruption from the sound that can travel for hundreds of miles.
(SOUNDBITE OF AIR CANNON FIRING)
LEMOULT: Coalition of environmental groups and attorneys general from nine states have filed suit to stop seismic testing. So it may ultimately be up to the courts to determine what the ocean sounds like. For NPR News, I'm Craig LeMoult. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Politics In The News: Sanctuary Cities,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713387952/politics-in-the-news-sanctuary-cities,"Heard on Morning Edition
David Greene talks to Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at National Review , about the president doubling down on his comment that he has the legal right to send undocumented migrants to sanctuary cities.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
President Trump's plan to drop detained immigrants off in so-called sanctuary cities appears on again, at least rhetorically speaking. Sanctuary cities now refer to jurisdictions that don't fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The Washington Post first reported on this idea. And critics saw it as a form of political retribution from the president.
The White House initially dismissed this as, quote, ""just a suggestion that was floated and rejected"" - rejected, it appears, by lawyers and officials within the administration. But then on Friday, the president tweeted that, quote, ""We are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities."" And now the White House appears to be doubling down. Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley spoke yesterday to NPR's Michel Martin.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
HOGAN GIDLEY: It's not political retribution. If anything, you should consider it - on the Democrat side - to be an olive branch.
GREENE: Conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg is here with us. He's senior editor with National Review. You often hear him on our program. Jonah, thanks for coming in.
JONAH GOLDBERG: Always great to be here.
GREENE: A political olive branch. What exactly is the White House argument here?
GOLDBERG: Well, the White House's argument is that somehow - that since Democrats won't make changes to the existing immigration laws, which I think the Republicans have - or the White House has a good reason to complain about some of that. We do have real problems - that this is somehow a way to deal with the crisis at the border in a way that is sort of asking Democrats to put up or shut up, since they're in favor of sanctuary cities and the rest. I want to be very clear. I think this may be one of the single most asinine moments in...
(LAUGHTER)
GOLDBERG: Modern American politics.
GREENE: That's saying a lot.
GOLDBERG: Yeah. I mean, well, you say in the beginning that this is - at least, it's rhetorically back on the table. Rhetorically gives it a very flowery, high-minded, almost Platonic status. This is the triumph of trolling in lieu of public policy, where the president assumes that the entire country agrees with his characterization of the refugees at the border as a bunch of predatory, dangerous criminals that are just massing on the border to invade the country.
GREENE: And polls do not show that most of the country believes that.
GOLDBERG: Right. And moreover, there's no data that suggests that that's what these people really are, right? And so then he says - the assumption is, OK, well, we're just going to give the Democrats what they want, and we're going to unleash these barbarians in their midst. First of all, if your concern is attracting more refugees, announcing that when you get to the border, you're going to get a free bus ticket to the very places these people are trying to get to will only heighten this. And even when you hear the president's defenders - some of them are close friends of mine - on TV, they always say, well, I don't think this is actually going to happen, but this is a brilliant sort of about-face or a brilliant reply to Democratic rhetoric.
GREENE: But what is the point if it's not going to happen? Like, what are we all talking about if even people who support this are saying, this is not going to happen?
GOLDBERG: I think it's fodder for Twitter. It's fodder for cable news talk shows. It's fodder for Trump to sort of get the headlines he likes from friendly outlets. But it is insane on almost every level to take it seriously. And it sort of puts the lie to this stuff about how we're supposed to take the president's rhetoric seriously but not literally - or whatever that, you know, famous phrase was. This is just simply an example of the president wanting a fun talking point that would actually lead to him betraying his central campaign promise, which was to halt the flow of immigrants into this country. He would be the greatest net importer of immigrants into this country if he followed through on this. And let's be clear. The places that these people at the border want to go are precisely the places he's threatening to send them for free.
GREENE: Or joining their family. They want to come into...
GOLDBERG: Sure.
GREENE: ...The country. So this would, in some ways - either they would go to cities that they might want to go to. Or they would only spend a few days in a sanctuary city. And I mean, it just makes - can I just step - I mean, just listening to you, it makes me wonder, should we even be talking about this this morning? Like, what is - is this news? How do Republicans in Congress, how do journalists deal with a president who, you know, in an - there's an immigration - substantively, these parties have not come to a comprehensive solution in years. So can the president just say what he wants to fill the vacuum?
GOLDBERG: Well, yeah. There is a very serious crisis. And there are serious people in the White House, in the Republican Party who want to deal with it. There are serious people in the Democratic Party who want to deal with it. But the leaderships are not going to figure - are not doing anything to do it.
On Friday, when the Washington Post story came out, everyone sort of tamped this down and said, this isn't a real story, as you suggested. But when the president reverses that and announces, no, no, no, this is very serious and we're taking it seriously, I don't see how the press has any choice but to talk about it and to take it somewhat seriously 'cause it's the president of the United States saying it.
GREENE: Could that work for the president, heading to 2020?
GOLDBERG: Yes, absolutely. Just as a talking point thing, we are living in this sort of Kabuki theater, you know, shadow puppet theater, where it's just the images on the wall that seem to matter more than any actual substantive policies. And whoever wins the battle for better talking points wins. So maybe it certainly could work because that seems to be the world that we're living in now.
GREENE: Jonah Goldberg is senior editor at National Review. Jonah, thanks for coming in, as always.
GOLDBERG: Great to be here. Thank you. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Winter is here. At least on HBO's Game of Thrones , which premiered its final season Sunday night. It was packed with uncomfortable reunions — unleashing massive implications for the story to come.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Winter is here - at least on HBO's ""Game Of Thrones.""
(SOUNDBITE OF ""'GAME OF THRONES' MAIN TITLE THEME"")
GREENE: The hit series aired the first of its six remaining episodes last night. And as NPR TV critic Eric Deggans reports, the highly anticipated season premiere was packed with uncomfortable reunions with massive implications for the story to come. And just a spoiler alert, this review is going to discuss many revelations from yesterday's episode.
ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: ""Game Of Thrones"" producers rewarded fans Sunday by reuniting characters they've waited many seasons to see together again in a story that mimicked the show's very first episode in lots of telling ways. In one scene, when Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister approaches his ex-wife, Sophie Turner's Sansa Stark, we saw two characters meet who hadn't been together since the show's fourth season in 2014.
Back then, Sansa was a naive, young girl, and Tyrion was trying to raise her spirits. Now, long after she ran away from him, Sansa feels wiser, sharper and smarter than both Tyrion and his sister/enemy Cersei, who's promised to send troops to aid them in a coming war.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""GAME OF THRONES"")
SOPHIE TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) Apologies for leaving like that.
PETER DINKLAGE: (As Tyrion Lannister) Yes. It was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.
TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) We both survived.
DIINKLAGE: (As Tyrion Lannister) Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do, but I promise you'll be safe.
TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) Cersei told you her army was coming north. You believed her.
DIINKLAGE: (As Tyrion Lannister) I believe she wants to survive.
TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
DEGGANS: I'm thinking she doesn't believe that anymore. The first half of Sunday's episode is filled with well-crafted, uneasy moments like this. Characters split apart in the show's early seasons come together again in scenes filled with tension and emotion. Their relationships have changed because the characters have changed, tempered by time and often by tragedy.
Newer fans convinced to check out the show by all the pre-finale hype might feel a little lost. It's tough to see characters having an emotional moment but not know entirely why it's happening. But for those who know ""Game Of Thrones'"" sprawling story, these were excellent moments conveyed with a minimum of dialogue and maximum of acting.
The other big story here is the romance between the show's hero, Jon Snow, and the Queen of the Dragons, Daenerys Targaryen. When Jon brings Daenerys to his northern stronghold of Winterfell with her army and two dragons to help fight a zombie army, his sister Sansa has one question that Daenerys answers pretty quickly.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""GAME OF THRONES"")
TURNER: (As Sansa Stark) May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? What do dragons eat, anyway?
EMILIA CLARKE: (As Daenerys Targaryen) Whatever they want.
DEGGANS: The show's producers can be sneaky. In an episode that does a lot of table-setting, positioning characters and plots that will pay off later, we see Jon and Daenerys riding dragons together, falling in love. They seem the perfect power couple for this medieval fantasy world, with Daenerys poised to become queen of the realm with Jon's help. But there are hints that the Queen of the Dragons may be a little too ruthless a leader.
Then John's closest friend Samwell drops news that viewers learned last season. Jon's actually the son of Daenerys' older brother, giving him a stronger claim to the Iron Throne that she has spent the entire series chasing.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""GAME OF THRONES"")
JOHN BRADLEY: (As Samwell Tarly) You're the true king - Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.
KIT HARINGTON: (As Jon Snow) Daenerys is our queen.
BRADLEY: (As Samwell Tarly) She shouldn't be.
HARINGTON: (As Jon Snow) That's treason.
BRADLEY: (As Samwell Tarly) It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
DEGGANS: Lovers may become rivals. Siblings have become enemies. And a gigantic zombie army is marching south to kill everyone. Seems as if this final ""Game Of Thrones"" is off to an exciting and well-crafted start. I'm Eric Deggans.

Severe weather moves across the southern U.S. A possible tornado touched down in Troy, Ala., but officials there believe the state's experience with past storms may have helped to keep citizens safe.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
A line of storms, including tornadoes, ripped across the south from Texas to the mid-Atlantic in the last few days. At least eight people died, among them two children in Texas. None of those killed were in Troy, Ala., where officials believe that experience with past storms may have kept citizens safe. Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott reports.
KYLE GASSIOTT, BYLINE: Byron Straughn is a firm believer in weather radios. The 45-year-old says that's what kept him safe on Sunday morning when a possible tornado blew through his mobile home park in Troy.
BYRON STRAUGHN: I advise everyone to please purchase a weather radio and please get with someone that's knowledgeable and help you program it. And it will save you. Trust me.
GASSIOTT: Straughn's wife programmed his radio, and so he was in a shelter when the storm came through. It picked up one neighbor's single-wide home and dropped it on the roof of the home next door, where one of the occupants was sleeping. The cooking range from the first trailer ended up in the bedroom of the second trailer.
STRAUGHN: Trailer that's on top - the stove was sitting in his room when he woke up.
GASSIOTT: Mark Rose is a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Birmingham. He says the National Weather Service partners with companies that make weather radios to educate people on their use. He also says that phone alerts, as well as Facebook and Twitter, have been helping build awareness ahead of storms.
MARK ROSE: The social media aspect of it has really helped us get people's attention that these stronger systems are expected, you know, within the next several days.
GASSIOTT: And Rose's colleagues used Facebook to send a special message to churches before the Palm Sunday weekend telling them to designate someone to watch for severe weather that could happen when everyone is in church.
ROSE: Any kind of large building that may have a - you know, a fairly high roof, like a gymnasium in a school or a sanctuary in church, those types of facilities we advise people not to be in.
GASSIOTT: Jason Reeves is Troy's mayor. He credits what everyone has learned from the tornadoes that killed 23 people in Lee County, Ala., last month, with keeping his constituents safe.
JASON REEVES: Maybe some of our people actually paid more attention than they would have. You know, it's just so terrible when a tragedy of that magnitude has to remind us.
GASSIOTT: Reeves says he hopes his citizens never get complacent when storms don't kill or seriously injure anyone because the next time, Troy may not be so lucky. For NPR News, I'm Kyle Gassiott in Troy, Ala.

Trump said, referring to immigrants from Latin America to the U.S., ""We can't take you. Our country is full."" David Greene asks David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution, how true that is.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
President Trump has kept the issue of immigration front and center recently. He's shaken up leadership at the Department of Homeland Security. He's promoting an idea that his administration's own lawyers and officials found troubling - the idea to drop detained immigrants in so-called sanctuary cities. And earlier this month at a Border Patrol facility in California, he offered this argument.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Whether it's asylum, whether it's anything you want - it's illegal immigration - can't take you anymore. We can't take you. Our country is full. Our area's full. The sector is full - can't take you anymore. I'm sorry - can't happen, so turn around.
GREENE: The U.S. is full, his argument is. Well, let's talk about that statement with someone who thinks and writes about economics in our country. It's David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center and a contributor to the Wall Street Journal. David, welcome back.
DAVID WESSEL: Good morning.
GREENE: What do you make of the statement that the United States is full?
WESSEL: Well, it's hard to know what the president means. It sounds more of an emotional appeal to people who feel the other. But taking it at face value, physically, are we full? Well, plenty of other countries are more densely populated than the U.S. And, in fact, there are nine U.S. states that lost population last year, including a couple of big ones - New York and Illinois. If you look at it economically, well, at the worst of the recession, there were six unemployed people for every job opening. Today there are more job openings than there are unemployed people. And the Federal Reserve tells us that there are what they call notable worker shortages in IT, manufacturing, trucking, restaurants and constructions.
But I think immigration isn't really about today. It's about the future. And given the aging of our society and the decline in the number of kids that each woman has in her lifetime, projections are that the native-born population of the U.S. won't grow at all after 2030. The only way the population will be growing is through immigration.
GREENE: And what are the implications of whether or not population grows or not when it comes to our economy?
WESSEL: Well, the way to think about this is really looking at the demography of the U.S. We are an aging society. By 2035, the demographers tell us there'll be more people over age 65 than children under 18. That's never before happened in the country's history. We're going to need workers, and we're going to need them not only to staff our businesses but to pay taxes to support those elderly and to take care of them.
So basically if we can't grow our own, we're going to have to import people. I mean, look at the Social Security system. The actuaries at Social Security tell us that the more immigrants we have - working-age immigrants, that is - the more payroll taxes going into the system, and the longer we'll be able to sustain the Social Security system without raising taxes on other people.
GREENE: So this narrative that immigrants take away American jobs, I mean, it sounds like that's an answer that is different than some people assume.
WESSEL: Well, look, if we didn't have immigrants, would more Americans have jobs? And I think the really honest answer to that is maybe. If employers find it hard to hire, maybe they'll raise wages, and maybe that'll draw some people off the sidelines of the economy. I mean, even though there are a lot more people working these days, still, among people between 25 and 54 - that's what economists call prime-age working people - nearly 1 in 5 is not working or looking for work today.
But it's also true that we know that there's some jobs - picking fruits and vegetables in California, caregiving for the elderly, nannies. There are folks - there are jobs here that seem to be much more attractive to immigrants, and they're staffing them. And of course, a large - a disproportionately large number of our entrepreneurs and scientists and technicians are people who came to this country from somewhere else. So it's kind of hard to say, but it's not an easy answer.
GREENE: David, can I just ask you about another statement we heard from the president more recently? I mean, he made the statement about, you know, quote, ""our country is full."" But as you think through the economic implications of the issue of immigration and what the president has said and his policies, he's talking about the country being full, but at the same time, moving detained migrants into sanctuary cities, these places that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. How do you even think about that idea from an economic perspective?
WESSEL: Look, it's hard to know whether the president is serious about that. I mean - really? - we're going to tell a bunch of people who want to come to the United States that the government is going to move them to San Francisco, or New York, or Chicago, or Seattle, or Boston or New Orleans, which are all sanctuary cities?
GREENE: Right.
WESSEL: If it actually happened, it would obviously be expensive. Someone would have to pay to - facilities to house them. And it's true that although working-age immigrants can add to our workforce, kids are expensive until they grow up. So it would be expensive if it's a serious proposal, but I'm not really convinced it is.
GREENE: David Wessel of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center. David, thanks as always.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Megan Stack, a former foreign correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, gave up a life of covering war and natural disasters when she had her first child in Beijing.
She quickly hired a nanny and soon realized how dependent she was on this woman — something she writes about in her book Women's Work: A Reckoning with Work and Home .
Stack spoke with NPR about the book — and the difficult decision to write about her own family.
""I would not have done it if I could have found another way to tell the story,"" she said. ""I had been through so many just sort of shocking experiences. ... I knew that I could never get that from someone else's house because you can never get that level of access and that kind of intimacy.""
In the interview, Stack reflects on hiring women to work in her home, coming to terms with the fact that they were leaving their own children to watch hers, and the role of men in domestic life.
On hiring someone to help with her first child in China
I think I sort of went into these relationships of hiring women to help me watch the kids — to help us, I should say, because I also have a husband ... who's part of this equation. ... But, realistically, I say myself because his job was travel-intensive. And when I remember that, especially that first year, he was often gone and he was working and he was just sort of coming and going. And I was very much in the house. And so I had this feeling that I had hired this woman who was coming to help me. You know that is, that is not a good way to think of it because it is part of the problem. ...
People kept saying to me ""You're so lucky that you're having your baby in China because help is affordable here."" I heard that phrase over and over again and it just had kind of gotten into my mind that this is the natural way that I'll be able to work on my book — and I'll have the baby and there'll be somebody coming. And Tom [my husband] will be at his job and I'll be home, you know, writing and not worrying about chores and it will be great. ...What it was actually going to feel like in reality and all of the things that would come along with that decision — I didn't anticipate them. I had never really thought about it. It was just not on my radar.
On considering domestic help to be family
I have consciously tried to avoid thinking of these women in those terms because I actually think there are a lot of problems attached to that framing. I feel competent with that now because now I've read people's doctoral theses where they did all this field work — and the sort of realities of domestic labor and how these jobs are carried out. The problem is, so now I'm conscious that when you say somebody is your family member, a lot of familiarity goes along with that — and a lot of labor protections tend to kind of go out the window.
Because you sort of say, well, she's here and you know we love her and she loves us and she loves the kids. She doesn't mind working the extra day off. She doesn't mind coming in even though maybe her family has something else to do — and you sort of impose. I think it often starts from a very good place and an honest place — and I understand that place because I have definitely felt that I loved the women who worked in my house, like I literally loved them. ... But the problem is when you put that on somebody who is actually your employee and who doesn't have the same power in the relationship, you are taking away more of their power, I think.
On the difference between how she and her husband viewed their first domestic hire
So [my husband is] trying to work all the time and [this combined with everything else] is a lot of pressure. I think when he was in that mode he was seeing [our first nanny], the woman who was working in our home, in a very transactional way. It was sort of like she's here so that you can get your work done. I can get my work done and everything has to function smoothly and to the extent that she can do that, that's great. And if she can't then, you know, maybe we should just replace her.
Whereas, I was in the house with this woman and I was very, very — I became very close to her and I felt very dependent upon her and she, in many ways, got tangled up. I write about this in the book. She was very involved in kind of my own sort of postpartum period and the sort of sense of, you know, how I could function as a mother. And the truth is, there was a time when she worked for me and I had the baby that I thought ""I'm only a good mother because [my nanny] is here."" And I really thought ""[when] she's gone, this is all going to fall apart.""
So I had this great love and gratitude. ... That sort of first year after my first child was born was very difficult for me and I really associated her with being able to function — and, sort of, emotional health. And she was tremendously helpful to me in many ways, so I saw her as much more: You know, she's not just a cog that is put into the machine and then if she's not working out, we'll just get another cog. I thought ""she is personally very crucial."" So we did have a divide. ...
Years went by, we both evolved in our thinking. We talked about these things a lot in our marriage — this was something that was an ongoing conversation. And I think that by the time ... the second woman in the book worked for us, I feel like we were sort of reversed where, I think, I became more transactional with her in a way. And Tom, my husband, was much more ... he had really this huge soft spot for her and was much more defensive of her. And, so, I think we went through different things at different times with different personalities — and just where we were in our own understanding of what we were doing.
On being so reliant on care-taking help — and fearing losing it
I think, for one thing, it was kind of the particularity of being in China and being so far from my family and, you know, I did have this feeling that I was sort of on my own and that maybe my husband would just get on a plane that week and not be around. So ... I was quite dependent on this woman who I trusted with my baby and it wasn't easy for me especially coming out of all the years of journalism and sort of studying all the horrible things. ... I had the feeling [that] I trust her and I don't know who else I would ever trust — because now I've sort of established in my mind that this woman is loving and wonderful with my son, but I can't just get someone else. So that was one thing. ...
And I was so desperate for work time which, in retrospect, seems a little crazy to me. But it felt very real at the time, the sense that I had to really fight every day to get these sort of hours of work time out of each day. And if I lost them, that felt like a real loss to me. It felt like I'm losing ground. I'm losing something not only the time and the progress in the manuscript but something existential — like I'm losing my place in the world. I'm losing my foothold on the work that will take me back out of this house. And that I'm just going to be in this house now as a mom — and I was really freaked out about all those issues.
On realization that the woman caring for her child was a mother, too, and had left her child to be a nanny
At first, I was just oblivious because I was so overwhelmed by my own state. Then I began to internalize it. I have memories of being shown photographs of her daughter. And the more I was understanding my reality as a mother ... I'm looking at other mothers, including [my nanny] , and thinking ""How are you handling this?"" Like how it would make me crazy if I had to leave my kid when he was a year and a half and go work in someone else's house.
So I think it was a slow process of first not really being aware of it, then becoming more aware of it and not wanting to think about it because it felt so dangerous to my status quo. ...
On discussing men's place in the conversation of domestic duties
I'm asking with this book where the men are in this conversation ... the question of child care and the household and the maintenance of the household. ... Tied to this is also the care of elderly people or the sick. Why all of those issues are just still very much kind of shoved onto the women — and we're sort of left to resolve them among ourselves. I think if there's no answer from men or from society at large, then we're just going to continue to kind of pass this work among ourselves as best we can.
It's always a woman ... it's something that the men are not really getting involved with and yet, and yet there is somehow this social expectation or maybe it's even a social pretension that women are going to be able to participate fully in the labor force at the same rate as men. And that's obviously, it's flawed. It's not going to work. We are going to continue to be hampered and held back by the things that we have to do in our houses until we manage to sort of involve men. And I think that is a huge challenge that we are facing — and I am not sure how we go forward into it. But I'm hoping to at least hear more conversation about it."
"For Anxious Kids, Parents May Need To Learn To Let Them Face Their Fears : Shots - Health News",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/15/711213752/for-kids-with-anxiety-parents-learn-to-let-them-face-their-fears,"Enlarge this image Joseph Calise, 9, plays on his iPad in his bedroom. Joseph used to get anxious whenever he was alone, even when taking a shower or at bedtime, so his parents, Jessica and Chris Calise, learned new parenting skills from the Yale Child Study Center. Christopher Capozziello for NPR Christopher Capozziello for NPR Joseph Calise, 9, plays on his iPad in his bedroom. Joseph used to get anxious whenever he was alone, even when taking a shower or at bedtime, so his parents, Jessica and Chris Calise, learned new parenting skills from the Yale Child Study Center.
Christopher Capozziello for NPR The first time Jessica Calise can remember her 9-year-old son Joseph's anxiety spiking was about a year ago, when he had to perform at a school concert. He said his stomach hurt and he might throw up. ""We spent the whole performance in the bathroom,"" she recalls.
After that, Joseph struggled whenever he had to do something alone, like showering or sleeping in his bedroom. He would beg his parents to sit outside the bathroom door or let him sleep in their bed. ""It's heartbreaking to see your child so upset and feel like he's going to throw up because he's nervous about something that, in my mind, is no big deal,"" Jessica says.
Jessica decided to enroll in an experimental program, one that was very different from other therapy for childhood anxiety that she knew about. It wasn't Joseph who would be seeing a therapist every week — it would be her.
The program was part of a Yale University study that treated children's anxiety by teaching their parents new ways of responding to it.
""The parent's own responses are a core and integral part of childhood anxiety,"" says Eli Lebowitz , a psychologist at the Yale School of Medicine who developed the training.
For instance, when Joseph would get scared about sleeping alone, Jessica and her husband, Chris Calise, did what he asked and comforted him. ""In my mind, I was doing the right thing,"" she says. ""I would say, 'I'm right outside the door' or 'Come sleep in my bed.' I'd do whatever I could to make him feel not anxious or worried.""
But this comforting — something psychologists call accommodation — can actually be counterproductive for children with anxiety disorders, Lebowitz says.
Shots - Health News For Children With Severe Anxiety, Drugs Plus Therapy Help Best NPR Ed Empowering Kids In An Anxious World ""These accommodations lead to worse anxiety in their child, rather than less anxiety,"" he says. That's because the child is always relying on the parents, he explains, so kids never learn to deal with stressful situations on their own and never learn they have the ability to cope with these moments.
""When you provide a lot of accommodation, the unspoken message is, 'You can't do this, so I'm going to help you,' "" he says.
Lebowitz wondered if it would help to train parents to change that message and to encourage their children to face anxieties rather than flee from them.
Currently the established treatment for childhood anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy delivered directly to the child.
When researchers have tried to involve parents in their child's therapy in the past, the outcomes from studies suggested that training parents in cognitive behavioral therapy didn't make much of a difference for the child's recovery. Lebowitz says that this might be because cognitive behavioral therapy asks the child to change their behavior. ""When you ask the parents to change their child's behavior, you are setting them up for a very difficult interaction,"" he says.
Instead, Lebowitz's research explores whether training only the parents without including direct child therapy can help. He is running experiments to compare cognitive behavioral therapy for the child with parent-only training. A study of the approach appeared in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry last month.
Jessica Calise received 12 weeks of Lebowitz's parent training as part of a follow-up study, the results of which are not yet published.
Enlarge this image Jessica and Chris Calise sit in their living room with their son, Joseph Calise. Christopher Capozziello for NPR Christopher Capozziello for NPR Jessica and Chris Calise sit in their living room with their son, Joseph Calise.
Christopher Capozziello for NPR Once a week, she drove from Norwalk, Conn., to Yale University for an hourlong session with a therapist. Like all the parents who went through Lebowitz's training program, Jessica began forming a plan with the therapist on how she and her husband would stop swooping in when Joseph became anxious.
The key to doing that, Lebowitz says, is to make children feel heard and loved, while using supportive statements to build their confidence. Parents need to ""show their child that they understand how terrible it is to feel anxious,"" he says. They need to accept that their child is ""genuinely anxious and not just being attention seeking,"" he adds.
The next step is to tell children that ""they can tolerate that anxiety and they don't need to be rescued from it."" This helps give them the strength to face their fears, Lebowitz says.
This approach was hard at first, says Joseph's father, Chris Calise. He's a construction equipment operator, roughly 6 feet tall, with a frame as solid as brick. ""The hardest hump for me was the way I was brought up,"" he says, rapping his fingers against the kitchen table. ""I always thought the way you do things [is to say], 'Get over it. You're fine. Suck it up.' But it was obvious what we were doing wasn't working.""
So, the parents committed themselves to a plan to get Joseph to feel comfortable sleeping and showering alone.
""It was baby steps first. I'd say, 'I'm not going to stay [outside the bathroom], but I'll come back and check on you in five minutes,' "" Jessica says. ""Then I would say, 'I know it's scary for you, but I know that you can do it. You're going to do great.' Just acknowledging the anxiety and providing the reinforcing statement.""
It was slow at first, Jessica says. But each time, as she'd been trained, Jessica would praise Joseph when he managed to pass the time on his own. ""[We'd] say like, 'Wow, you're a rock star! You were nervous and scared, but you did it, and you can do it,' "" she says.
And, slowly, Joseph started to spend longer amounts of time by himself, eventually sleeping on his own all night. ""It was about halfway through when you really started noticing big differences,"" Chris recalls. ""He was becoming more confident. He just did things on his own without us having to ask or tell him.""
Many parents in Lebowitz's recently published study had a similar experience. Nearly 70 percent of the 64 children who were assigned to the parent-training arm of the experiment had no anxiety by the end of the study.
""It is amazing. It is really exciting. These children had never met a therapist and were as likely to be cured of their anxiety disorder as the children who had 12 sessions of the best therapy available,"" Lebowitz says of the results of his recently published study.
The parent training seems to work because it lets children confront their anxieties while parents provide love and support from afar, says Anne Marie Albano , a psychologist at Columbia University who did not work on the study.
""You coach the child a bit but don't take over. It's helping the child stumble into their own way of coping and ride whatever wave of anxiety they're having,"" she says. ""That ultimately builds their confidence.""
Enlarge this image Joseph brushes his teeth before bedtime. Christopher Capozziello for NPR Christopher Capozziello for NPR Joseph brushes his teeth before bedtime.
Christopher Capozziello for NPR That suggests this parent training has a lot of potential to advance childhood anxiety treatment, Albano says. ""It is preliminary, but this paper is very exciting to me as someone who worked for 30 years in this field,"" she says. ""This treatment brings in the parents, finally, and focuses on the ways parents need [to stop] taking over, to break the cycle of anxiety in kids.""
Lebowitz's parent training is theoretically similar to traditional therapy, says Muniya Khanna , a psychologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and director of the OCD & Anxiety Institute in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the work. ""But, this gets at it from a different angle,"" she says. ""It targets lifestyle change and says, yes, if you change lifestyle and family life, it can have almost the same effect as changing the child's theoretical understanding about [anxiety].""
Khanna thinks that combining this parent program with traditional therapy might yield even better results, particularly for children who haven't responded to behavioral therapy alone. ""It's encouraging for families where kids may not be developmentally or emotionally ready to take on cognitive behavioral therapy,"" she says.
The study leaves many unanswered questions, Albano adds. ""This is only a short-term outcome. We need to follow up [with] the kids at six months, 12 months, even several years,"" she says. Not only does it remain to be seen if the benefits from the parent training persist as the child gets older, but more research will also need to be done to see if the same techniques will continue to work as children age into teenagers.

Joseph used to be afraid to sleep alone, but he has learned to be OK with it since his mother learned new parenting approaches.
Christopher Capozziello for NPR Jessica and Chris Calise say that they even use the techniques they learned through the parent-training program with Joseph's twin sister and older brother, Isabella and Nicholas. ""It's important to validate your kids' feelings and show them that we care,"" Jessica says. ""I think this taught us to communicate better. I think it made us better parents, quite honestly.""
Joseph says he no longer feels anxiety about being alone. He doesn't enjoy it, ""but I'm OK with it,"" he says. He has learned to banish the frightening thoughts that would come when he was by himself and that kept him up at night. ""If I get a nightmare, I just change the subject to something happy,"" he says. ""Then I'm fine.""
New fears come up from time to time — like a recently discovered fear of heights. But with his parents' support, Joseph says, he's learning to face these too. ""I think I'll be OK,"" he says. ""I'll just try to do it.""

Kaitlin Scott/Courtesy Spotify and Apple playlists
There's a prevailing image of The Tallest Man of Earth — Swedish folk singer Kristian Matsson's musical moniker — of a wayward, sometimes homesick vagabond in the constant pursuit of adventure. Maybe it's the abstractions of nature that he's swooned about for so long, or the landscapes-as-album-art that sets his music in the passing daydreams of Americana nostalgia. He pines for the wild hunt, for the thrill of the trail — even in the midst of personal crisis, as was the case with 2015's lonesome Dark Bird Is Home.
So when I Love You. It's A Fever Dream. begins with a mundane drive to a hotel bar, it's a little unnerving. ""The end of night, I hum along / The driver's turning up the dancey song,"" he sings, the click of footsteps establishing the song's mise-en-scene . ""How many heartaches in this car, I wonder?"" It's still a Tallest Man On Earth song. Mattson plays a spindly guitar twirl, as a single horn encroaches over his window-gazing thoughts. The story's just a bit different now.
No longer is he a poet of travelogues and histories, spinning yarns that blur the line between the vastness of imagination and lived experience. With I Love You. It's A Fever Dream ., his first new album in four years, The Tallest Man On Earth tells the vast stories that comprise his inner self.
That doesn't mean he's closed off his sense of wonder, or that he's composing navel-gazing solitary dirges. Matsson seems to have figured out that the crests and valleys of our interiorities are just as beguiling as the vast expanses around us. He's touched upon this at times, in the most gutting moments in Dark Bird is Home , or in ""The Dreamer,"" the first plugged-in cut Mattson ever made and a fan favorite.
But here, as in ""The Dreamer,"" subtle poetics and extended metaphors are punctuated by lines of total clarity. ""I see stars in the sky / And I wish they'd return to be in me now,"" he sighs in ""The Running Styles Of New York,"" a cutting line that tethers the feeling of inadequacy to the judgmentless, boundless beyond. ""Make up for what I lack somehow / When it's all been too much.""
He returns to a similar motif on ""I'll Be A Sky."" ""I travel the fever road, I travel the clouds of my mistakes and sure I can drift away, but I'll just be around the corner of your love,"" he sighs on ""I'll Be A Sky,"" There's an evolution taking place, both lyrically and musically.
Matsson's always been something of an independent musician, but I Love You is his first as a wholly autonomous artist — singing, producing and recording the whole affair in his home. When he embarks on tour this year, he's bringing himself, a piano and a guitar. It feels like a personal challenge set upon himself, both to re-discover the sound that painted him as the preeminent Swedish one-man folkie reviving the genre and to update that sound over a decade after his initial breakthrough.
Where at times the newfound toolkit of Dark Bird is Home threatened to overshadow the singular beauty of Mattson and his guitar, the additions here never feel excessive or overly ornate. There's a lot of familiar terrain here. ""My Dear"" resembles a smoothed-up version of a scuffed-up demo, Matsson's picking as stunning as ever. It's bolstered by a faint screech of a violin. Twinkling bleeps abound on ""What I've Been Kicking Around,"" an otherwise unplugged affair that hearkens back to the heartstring-tug arrangements he mastered so early in his career.
Once we've reached the end, the title track lays bare Matsson's conclusion in the wake of a devastating divorce and death: ""But I keep the hope I carry, little things so I can love wherever I go now,"" he sings emphatically, drawing out the now over a solitary horn. All this is to say: Now that he's weathered the worst within himself, he's ready to venture forward once more."

Rep. Omar says she's seen a spike in death threats since Trump tweeted a video of her. HBO begins Game of Thrones final season.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The history of a White House proposal for migrants suggests just how serious it is or is not.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
News reports last week revealed a Trump administration proposal that was made and rejected. Lawyers turned aside the plan to drop detained asylum seekers in so-called sanctuary cities. Now, White House officials said this was no longer an idea under consideration. But as soon as it was generating conversation, President Trump extended the news coverage for days by claiming that he's really considering this. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley spoke with NPR's Michel Martin yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
HOGAN GIDLEY: It's not political retribution. If anything, you should consider it - on the Democrat side - to be an olive branch.
INSKEEP: NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration and joins us now. Joel, good morning.
JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.
INSKEEP: Are there any details of this presidential proposal beyond his tweets?
ROSE: Not much. I mean, the president is talking about taking detained migrants who were apprehended at the southern border and transporting them to so-called sanctuary cities, which loosely are defined as jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities.
And as you say, the White House has sent spokespeople - I mean, spokespeople have been out over the weekend talking up this idea, arguing that there are huge numbers of migrants arriving at the border, which is true. We had more than 100,000 last month alone, which is the biggest monthly total in a decade. And the White House argues that communities along the border shouldn't be forced to bear the brunt of that, as they put it.
Democrats, meanwhile, are howling with outrage. The reaction of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf pretty much sums up her party's response. Here's Schaaf speaking to NPR's Weekend Edition.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LIBBY SCHAAF: This is about an outrageous abuse of power. The idea that you could use human beings, families, as instruments of political payback to exact retribution on your political enemies, this is not America.
INSKEEP: And we should be clear. The White House says this is an olive branch. The way that this has been framed on social media over the last few days by the president's supporters is this is a way to get back at Democrats. Setting aside the motivations, though, would it be legal to do this?
ROSE: The president argues that it would be. But it's been reported that lawyers inside the Department of Homeland Security had concerns about this proposal, and that's one of the reasons why it hasn't happened. Clearly, the president's critics and opponents would challenge this move in court if he actually does move forward with this proposal.
INSKEEP: Well, let's say it was found to be legal. Is it in any way practical to take a bunch of migrants on the border and just start dropping them off in San Francisco or whatever city has policies the White House doesn't like?
ROSE: The fact is that it would be an enormous logistical challenge, right? I mean, the Border Patrol and other immigration authorities have been saying loudly for months now that they are overwhelmed by these huge numbers of migrants, largely Central Americans who are fleeing from violence and poverty.
You know, if authorities are barely managing to get these people to cities on the border right now as it is, never mind transporting them, you know, hundreds or even thousands of additional miles - so it would be costly for sure. That's one of the reasons immigration authorities reportedly pushed back on this idea when it was floated initially. And also, from an operational perspective, it's not really clear how much this proposal would achieve.
INSKEEP: I'm sorry - what do you mean, an operational perspective?
ROSE: So there's the reality at the border that this proposal seems to overlook, which is that most of these migrants spend very little time in the cities where they're released by immigration authorities - maybe 48 hours, something like that. The vast majority of these migrants have a connection in the U.S. already, like a friend or a relative in some part of the country who can wire them the money for a bus ticket. And then they move on to Iowa or New York or LA or Virginia.
And certainly, this - the migrants are putting a strain on the nonprofit organizations that shelter and work with them near the border. But the idea that they remain there in these - or would stay in these sanctuary cities, that's just not how we're seeing it work right now on the ground.
INSKEEP: So we have a proposal here that would be emotionally satisfying for people who resent sanctuary cities, but would have no other practical effect. That's what you're reporting here, Joel.
ROSE: I - it's hard to see what it would accomplish. Yes.
INSKEEP: OK. NPR's Joel Rose, thanks so much.
ROSE: You're welcome.

INSKEEP: Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is saying she faces more death threats.
GREENE: Yeah. Her comments come after the president shared a video on his Twitter feed on Friday. This video included recent comments Omar made during a speech on civil liberties edited with graphic footage of the World Trade Center towers burning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked for a review of security measures intended to protect the Congresswoman, her family and her staff.
INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis, who's following this, is in our studios. Good morning.
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: More death threats, meaning she was already receiving death threats?
DAVIS: She has. You know, Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, she is the - one of the two first Muslim women serving in Congress. She is someone that has become rather familiar to a lot of people as a freshman lawmaker because she has already been the point of earlier controversies over comments she has made. And in the course of her short tenure in Congress, she has drawn a lot of attention and, yes, a lot of threats.
INSKEEP: Some of the comments were about Israel, about Jews, about power of American Jews in the United States and so forth. Now she made these comments about the aftermath of 9/11 and pressures that Muslims felt. And at one point, there was a phrase in there - some people did something - which was taken as her description of 9/11. How strong has the response been to that reference?
DAVIS: Well, it's interesting on the Democratic side because in this instance, I think you see so many more of her colleagues in her party coming to her defense - that the president, in using these words and juxtaposing her image against the 9/11 attacks, has, in their words, attempted to incite violence against her and that her comments, in the broader context of what she was saying, was talking about overall Muslim bigotry in the country following 9/11 and that she sees herself as an activist against those forms of bigotry.
INSKEEP: You said that Democrats are publicly - are vociferously defending her, in this case.
DAVIS: They have been more quick to defend her here, although it's interesting to see the debate inside the party over - they have been angry about who has been fastest to defend her and how quickly and how enthusiastically. And I think you've seen - Rashida Tlaib, who's a Democrat from Michigan, is the other Muslim woman in Congress. And she had a really interesting response in which she called out Democratic leaders for not doing enough and suggesting that they were tokenizing women of color in the caucus, where they're happy to use their images to promote diversity but not defend them.
And so the speaker, when she was asked about it, initially kind of deferred and said she wasn't ready to comment. Although, over the weekend, she obviously did call for the security review and call - excuse me - call on the president to take down the video, which he has not as of now.
INSKEEP: You've also got tape here from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another freshman member of Congress.
DAVIS: Well, Democrats see this as part of a more broader political strategy. And here's what she said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: We are getting to a level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color.
DAVIS: An incitement of violence. And her point was that the Republican Party uses images of people like her, like Ilhan Omar, like Rashida Tlaib and are trying to paint a picture of a party that is extreme or holds political views that is not in line with the country.
INSKEEP: Well, let's make that clear. The president, by highlighting Ilhan Omar, makes that the subject. This is about deciding what we're going to talk about, and the president determines that. Democrats - are they embracing Ilhan Omar as the face of their party, given some of her past controversial comments about Israel and so forth? Do they want her to be the face of their party?
DAVIS: I don't think they see her as the face of the party. But I certainly think that they see an attempt by the president and the Republican Party to make her that. And that is where you're going to see this debate going forward.
INSKEEP: Susan, thanks so much.
DAVIS: You're welcome.

INSKEEP: Winter has been coming for the characters on ""Game Of Thrones"" ever since the first season aired in 2011.
GREENE: Yeah. Last night, the most expensive, most watched, most accoladed scripted drama series in HBO history came one step closer to its end. The show aired the final episode of its eighth and final season.
INSKEEP: NPR TV critic Eric Deggans has been up all night reflecting on what was. Hey there, Eric.
ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi.
INSKEEP: OK, lot of hype going into last night. You were watching, I assume.
DEGGANS: I was watching, and I was enjoying it. I should first - we should first deliver a spoiler alert because I'm going to talk a little bit about what happened on Sunday's episode. But I thought it was one of those really good table-setting episodes where they kind of put characters and plot in place that you know are going to happen later. Fans of the show know that ""Game Of Thrones"" tends to do that with its first episode of the season.
And we saw a lot of characters come together that hadn't seen each other in a while. So there was a lot of emotional kind of reunions and a lot of history playing out and characters that were one way when they met each other early in the season, and they were - they had a very different dynamic later in the season. And of course, the hero, Jon Snow, found out that he's actually related to the woman that he's in love with, and he may have a really strong claim to the Iron Throne that rules the Seven Kingdoms. So, you know, there's that.
INSKEEP: OK, you got that. So we're talking to two different strands of people here, Eric, automatically - people who are watching ""Game Of Thrones"" and people who have been told this is so complicated that if you haven't started yet, don't even bother starting because it's just too much for you possibly to understand. But help those who are in that latter category. Why is this show so important, if you haven't been watching it?
DEGGANS: Well, I would say it's the most popular high-quality show on television. So it takes the production values of a major motion picture, like ""Lord Of The Rings,"" you know, sword-and-sorcery epic with lots of special effects, and it brings it to television. And you know, it also proved that a show with a really complex storyline, a show that has a lot of characters with names that sound the same and this very convoluted sort of history of characters bouncing off each other, that it could become really popular.
And a lot of shows that are this complex, when they get to their sixth or seventh season, they get so complex that even fans can't follow them anymore. But ""Game Of Thrones"" has managed to keep people engaged, keep everything interesting and exciting, even after all the similar names and even after taking off almost two years between the seventh season and this eighth season.
INSKEEP: Eric, I just want to note, we have houseguests, and they're ""Game Of Thrones"" people. And so we had to set up everything so they could watch right at 9 o'clock. And that was - I realized, wow, like, right at its...
DEGGANS: Yeah. Never happens.
INSKEEP: ...Actual, old-time appointment viewing...
DEGGANS: (Laughter).
INSKEEP: ...Like, of a sort that people kind of don't have to do anymore. This show is different.
DEGGANS: Well, in a way, it's different. I mean, there are several other shows that are like that. You know, there are several - excuse me, I'm sorry.
INSKEEP: That's all right.
DEGGANS: There are several other shows like that, shows that have - that air on HBO, on Showtime, on AMC. They also drop once a week. But this is a unique show. We will not see its like again. And people should enjoy it while they can because we've only got five more episodes to go.
INSKEEP: OK. Eric, thanks so much.
DEGGANS: Thank you.
INSKEEP: NPR's Eric Deggans.

The End Of Empathy,www.npr.org,Hanna Rosin,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712249664/the-end-of-empathy,"Christina Chung for NPR Christina Chung for NPR
Militia leader Ammon Bundy, famous for leading an armed standoff in Oregon, had a tender moment in November of last year. He recorded a Facebook post saying that perhaps President Trump's characterization of the migrant caravan on the U.S.-Mexico border was somewhat broad. Maybe they weren't all criminals, he said. ""What about those who have come here for reasons of need?""
Bundy did not say he was breaking with Trump. He just asked his followers to put themselves in the shoes of ""the fathers, the mothers, the children"" who came to escape violence. It was a call for a truce grounded in empathy, the kind you might hear in a war zone, say, or an Easter Sunday sermon. Still, it was met with a swift and rageful response from his followers, so overwhelming that within days, Bundy decided to quit Facebook. Keeping It Civil: How To Talk Politics Without Letting Things Turn Ugly
In an earlier era, Bundy's appeal might have resonated. But he failed to tune in to a critical shift in American culture — one that a handful of researchers have been tracking, with some alarm, for the past decade or so. Americans these days seem to be losing their appetite for empathy, especially the walk-a-mile-in-someone's-shoes Easter Sunday morning kind.
When I was growing up in the '70s, empathy was all the rage. The term was coined in 1908; then, social scientists and psychologists started more aggressively pushing the concept into the culture after World War II, basically out of fear. The idea was that we were all going to kill each other with nuclear weapons — or learn to see the world through each other's eyes. In my elementary school in the 1970s, which was not progressive or mushy in any way, we wrote letters to pretend Russian pen pals to teach us to open our hearts to our enemies. Does Empathy Have A Dark Side?
And not just enemies. Civil rights activists had also picked up on the idea. Kenneth Clark, a social scientist and civil rights activist, half-jokingly proposed that people in power all be required to take an ""empathy pill"" so they could make better decisions. His hope was that people with power and privilege would one day inhabit the realities of people without power, not from the safe, noblesse oblige distance of pity, but from the inside. An evolved person was an empathetic person, choosing understanding over fear.
Then, more than a decade ago, a certain suspicion of empathy started to creep in, particularly among young people. One of the first people to notice was Sara Konrath, an associate professor and researcher at Indiana University. Since the late 1960s, researchers have surveyed young people on their levels of empathy, testing their agreement with statements such as: ""It's not really my problem if others are in trouble and need help"" or ""Before criticizing somebody I try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place.""
Konrath collected decades of studies and noticed a very obvious pattern. Starting around 2000, the line starts to slide. More students say it's not their problem to help people in trouble, not their job to see the world from someone else's perspective. By 2009, on all the standard measures, Konrath found, young people on average measure 40 percent less empathetic than my own generation — 40 percent!
It's strange to think of empathy – a natural human impulse — as fluctuating in this way, moving up and down like consumer confidence. But that's what happened. Young people just started questioning what my elementary school teachers had taught me.
Their feeling was: Why should they put themselves in the shoes of someone who was not them, much less someone they thought was harmful? In fact, cutting someone off from empathy was the positive value, a way to make a stand.
So, for example, when the wife of white nationalist Richard Spencer recently told BuzzFeed he had abused her, the question debated on the lefty Internet was: Why should we care that some woman who chose to ally herself with a nasty racist got herself hurt? Why waste empathy on that? (Spencer, in a court filing, denies all her allegations .)
The new rule for empathy seems to be: reserve it, not for your ""enemies,"" but for the people you believe are hurt, or you have decided need it the most. Empathy, but just for your own team. And empathizing with the other team? That's practically a taboo.
And it turns out that this brand of selective empathy is a powerful force.
In the past 20 years, psychologists and neurologists have started to look at how empathy actually works, in our brains and our hearts, when we're not thinking about it. And one thing they've found is that ""one of the strongest triggers for human empathy is observing some kind of conflict between two other parties,"" says Fritz Breithaupt, a professor at Indiana University who studies empathy. ""Once they take the side, they're drawn into that perspective. And that can lead to very strong empathy and too strong polarization with something you only see this one side and not the other side any longer.""
A classic example is the Super Bowl, or any Auburn, Alabama game."

This story is based on an episode from Life Kit's guide, How To Buy A House . Check out these episodes: "" Mortgage Secrets That Will Save You Money "" and "" Should I Rent or Buy A House? "" Subscribe to listen later on Apple Podcasts , NPR One or your favorite podcast app.
The journey to buying a house can lead you down some perilous roads, past pushy real estate agents, self-interested bankers and not-so-meticulous home inspectors. We lay out a step-by-step approach to help you avoid those pitfalls, from what to look for in a house that will truly make you happy to assembling a team to help close the deal.
1. Find a good buyer's agent.
You can search for a house on your own through sites such as Zillow or Opendoor.com, but Ilyce Glink, author of 100 Questions Every First-Time Homebuyer Should Ask , doesn't recommend it. Real estate agents come in both buyer's and seller's versions: When you buy a home, a buyer's agent will represent your interests.
""They owe you a fiduciary duty, meaning that they have a responsibility to help you do things in the very best way that they can for your benefit,"" Glink says.
Be picky about the agent, Glink says, and make sure they're someone you are comfortable with and listens carefully to your needs.
""You really are interviewing for what I would call a short-term marriage,"" she says.
2. Make a list of what you need in a new home, and another of what you want.
Glink recommends that people buying as a couple each make their own list. When she and her husband were buying a house, she wanted a fireplace, while her husband wanted to be a half-hour or less from the train station.
And while a granite countertop and hardwood floor might thrill you for a time, what makes you happy over the long run might be different, says Elizabeth Dunn, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia who studies happiness and spending.
Dunn says those unchanging features fall victim to hedonic adaptation — our tendency to return to a set level of happiness once a novelty wears off. For lasting happiness, look for things that change — a view from a window or a backyard that varies with the seasons. Mortgage Secrets That Will Save You Money
Even more important for happiness is how we spend our time, Dunn says. A positive: space to hang out with family and friends. A huge negative: a long commute.
""If you want to be unhappy, you should arrange to have a really long commute to work every day,"" Dunn says. ""Going from having no commute to having a one-hour commute to work has an equivalent negative effect on happiness as becoming unemployed.""
3. Get preapproved for a mortgage before you start serious house-hunting.
Preapproval will help you understand how much house you can afford, and will also make sellers take you seriously.
It also means when you find a house you love, you can get the paperwork moving quickly. ""Preapproval means that you know that the lender is going to be there when you're ready to buy,"" Glink says.
4. Plan on a monthly mortgage payment that is no more than a third of your take-home pay — and don't just listen to what the bank says you can afford.
A lender often doesn't account for other demands on your budget, such as childcare, or the price of home maintenance and repairs, says Michelle Singletary, a personal finance author and columnist with The Washington Post . 6 Simple Rules For Saving Money
""If you buy a 100-year-old house, I promise you it's going to have 100-year-old problems, and those can be pretty expensive,"" Glink says. ""New houses aren't problem free either and so it's a good rule of thumb that you'll expect to spend between $5,000 and $8,000 a year taking care of your property.""
5. Make an offer for what the house is actually worth.
Your agent can help you decide what a house is worth, based on how long it's been on the market and how many people are looking at it, Glink says.
""You don't want to go in too low, because when you go in with a lowball bid, unless that house has been on the market for two years, they're going to laugh at you,"" she says. ""They're not even going to respond.""
6. Remember: There will always be another house.
Don't fall so hard for a house that you pay more than it's worth or that you can afford.
""It seems like there isn't another house because you've seen all the houses on the market,"" Glink says. ""But all you have to do is wait a week, two weeks, a month or so, and then a whole new crop of sellers are going to put their houses on the market.""
7. Get a good home inspection before you buy.
Your agent can give you a list of names that the real estate agency has already vetted, Glink says. She suggests you ask for references from recent clients and whether you can accompany the inspection to make sure no dark corners go unchecked.
Glink also suggests hiring a lawyer to look over your mortgage documents just in case something unexpected pops up as you close on the home.
""It's not inappropriate to spend $400 or $500 on the home inspector and $400 on your attorney,"" she says, ""because this is what goes into making a purchase feel like as safe and solid an investment in your future as you can."" Facebook "

A truth less universally acknowledged is that heroines may have flaws but they must always be kind. But the young adult romance If I'm Being Honest by Emily Wibberley and Austin Siegemund-Broka presents a heroine who is undeniably a Mean Girl. The novel is a contemporary version of Shakespeare's Taming of The Shrew , set in a wealthy Los Angeles high school — the twist is that our heroine, Cameron Bright, embarks on a scheme to tame herself.
Cameron is known for always honestly — or bluntly or cruelly — voicing her opinions. She's had a crush on her friend Andrew forever, and when their first hookup is interrupted by a weird girl named Paige, Cameron has some choice words that cool Andrew's interest in her.
So Cameron plans to win back Andrew's affections by making amends with everyone she's wronged, starting with Paige and her brother — who Cameron has nicknamed ""Barfy Brendan."" The list goes on. Cameron was not nice. In the process, she develops new friendships and goes deep on other complicated relationships in her life (her parents, especially). Her scheme works, but by the time Andrew asks her out, she's already genuinely fallen for Brendan. Cameron may be a mean girl, but she's also smart, self-aware and willing to do the hard work necessary to earn her happy ever after — and that makes her heroine material in my book.

On Tax Day: The IRS Is Short Of Money : NPR,www.npr.org,Scott Horsley,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713411490/on-tax-day-the-irs-is-short-of-money,"Enlarge this image The IRS budget has been cut sharply over the past decade, but President Trump has suggested spending an extra $362 million on tax enforcement next year. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images The IRS budget has been cut sharply over the past decade, but President Trump has suggested spending an extra $362 million on tax enforcement next year.
Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Here's a little encouragement for last-minute tax filers: Your chance of being audited by the IRS this year is as low as it has been in decades.
Years of budget cuts have hollowed out enforcement of the nation's tax laws. Now, even the Trump administration says those cuts may have gone too far.
Adjusted for inflation, IRS funding has been cut by about 25 percent since the beginning of the decade. And staffing for tax enforcement has fallen by nearly a third.
""Right now we have about the same number of auditors at the IRS that we had back in the 1950s when the economy was about one-seventh the size,"" said Chuck Marr, who studies tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
All Tech Considered A Real-Life Tax Scam: This Is What IRS Phone Fraud Sounds Like The IRS has always been something of a political punching bag. When Republicans took control of the House in 2010, they began pushing for deep cuts in the agency's budget.
""I know that when we were in the majority, that we took great pleasure in cutting the amount of money that was going to the IRS every year,"" Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, said last week.
The IRS made an easy target. The agency was the enforcer of the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans despise. There were charges that the IRS unfairly penalized conservative groups that tried to apply for tax-exempt status. And even in the best of times, people don't have warm and fuzzy feelings about the tax collector.
""There's always a concern among Americans that you have the jack-booted thugs coming into your business or office or home and auditing away,"" said Mark Mazur, who was assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy in the Obama administration.
Over time, both the criticism and the budget cuts have taken a toll.
Politics IRS Computer Glitch Caused By 'Master File' Issue Morale at the agency is down, experienced agents are heading for the exits, and less than 3 percent of the IRS workforce is under 30, said Tony Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents IRS workers.
""The IRS has essentially lost an entire generation of employees,"" he said. ""When you look at pay freezes, retirement cuts, government shutdowns, it makes it incredibly difficult to recruit and retain new talent.""
With the IRS cutting back sharply on tax enforcement, the federal government is leaving money it's owed by taxpayers on the table.
The number of individual audits fell 42 percent between 2010 and 2017, according to ProPublica . During that time, IRS scrutiny of taxpayers making more than $500,000 dropped more sharply than its audits of those making under $200,000.
""This clearly indicates a policy shift of some sort — cracking down on people who have little and going easier on people who are doing very, very well,"" Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., complained during a congressional hearing last week.
Now, after nearly a decade of cutting, the Trump administration is calling for a course correction. President Trump has suggested side-stepping budget caps to spend an extra $362 million on tax enforcement next year.
Business Shutdown Squeezes IRS Workers Just As The Tax-Filing Season Is About To Start The new IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig, argued that additional spending is necessary to reassure Americans that tax cheats stand a good chance of getting caught.
""Personally, I have both eyes focused on enforcement,"" he told lawmakers last week.
Rettig notes that the vast majority of Americans — 83 percent — already pay the taxes they owe voluntarily. But if a more visible cop on the beat could boost compliance by just 1 percentage point, that would mean an extra $30 billion a year in revenue for the government.
On the other hand, government revenues could take an equally big hit if the lack of enforcement triggers even a small drop in Americans' willingness to pay.
""Americans don't really want to feel like chumps,"" said Mazur, who now directs the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""They want to make sure like everybody is paying their fair share."""

Bangladesh Struggles To Cope With Pressures Of Hosting 1 Million Rohingya Refugees,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/710256666/bangladesh-struggles-to-cope-with-pressures-of-hosting-1-million-rohingya-refuge,"It's high tide in Cox's Bazar and there's a traffic jam right on the beach at Bangladesh's most prominent seaside resort. The lone road that leads south to the sprawling new camps sheltering hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees is closed for repairs. All the traffic has been diverted onto the gray sand beach, where people are taking selfies and strolling in the shallow surf.

All traffic heading south out of town was diverted on to the beach when the main road was closed for repairs.
Jason Beaubien/NPR Little green rickshaws jostle with passenger vans and pickup trucks to get over a sand dune and back onto the paved roadway to head in the direction of the camps. At high tide, some of the vehicles get stuck in the wet sand, blocking those behind them.
The sudden influx of 700,000 refugees in 2017 has had a huge negative impact on the local community, says Mohammad Abul Kalam, the head of Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission in Cox's Bazar.
World Rohingya Settle In For The Long Haul, Even As Bangladesh Wants Refugees To Go Home ""We're being outnumbered by the sheer number of the refugee population,"" he says.
Beyond this, ""The infrastructure has been under unbelievable pressure,"" Kalam says — not just from the refugees themselves, but also from the tremendous aid effort underway to keep so many people sheltered, fed and healthy.
Kalam is the Bangladesh government's top local official regarding the Rohingya. He says the area's roads and bridges are being beaten up by convoys of aid vehicles shuttling from Cox's Bazar to the camps.
""They were not meant for this much population,"" he says.
Kalam points out that Ukhiya, the administrative district that includes the camps, has a population of 230,000 people. ""Yet we now have more than 700,000 in the refugee population,"" he says. ""So the entire demographic balance has been reversed.""
Late in 2017, Rohingya fled from Myanmar into Bangladesh to escape attacks by soldiers and pro-government militias. The U.N. and human rights groups condemned the attacks as a campaign of ethnic cleansing and an organized effort to drive the Rohingya out of Myanmar.
Thousands of people were killed. The refugees who arrived in Bangladesh in 2017 joined other Rohingya who'd fled earlier waves of violence and pushed the total number of Rohingya refugees in the area up to nearly 1 million.
Kalam notes that the refugees' activities have been detrimental to the environment. They've cut down all of the forests surrounding the camps for firewood in what is a nature preserve. They've diverted streams as they've terraced hillsides to build new shelters.
Firewood is stacked for sale in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. Local residents complain that the Rohingya have cut down all the trees surrounding the camps and burned them in cooking fires. Jason Beaubien/NPR Jason Beaubien/NPR He claims they are driving up some food prices — while, at the same time, food aid diverted to local markets is driving down demand for Bangladesh-grown rice. And, he says, the refugees are pushing down wages by accepting jobs at lower pay than Bangladeshis are willing to accept. Aid convoys beat up the local roads and further congest what was already heavy traffic.
The refugees are not supposed to leave the camps. Nor are they allowed to work in Bangladesh. Kalam says they do both. He doesn't blame them.
""You cannot really stop people from being engaged in work of one kind or another,"" he says. ""It always happens.""
But he says the Rohingya are taking away jobs from Bangladeshis, particularly low-skilled jobs on farms and other manual labor.
The presence of nearly a million refugees is in this part of Bangladesh, he says, is unsustainable.
""It's very, very difficult for us,"" he says. ""We are already an overpopulated country with more than 160 million population in very limited space. It would be really very difficult for Bangladesh to allow them to integrate within our own society.""
Given the trauma that the Rohingya experienced in 2017, it appears unlikely that many will want to return to Myanmar anytime soon. Late last year, there was an effort to repatriate any Rohingya who wanted to go back. The Bangladeshi government offered free transportation and moving benefits. No one signed up.
So Bangladesh last year proposed another solution: move from the overcrowded camps outside Cox's Bazar to a camp with brand-new dormitories that can accommodate 100,000 refugees.

Gallo Images/Getty Images The only problem: It's on an island in the Bay of Bengal, more than 15 miles from the mainland.
The Bhasan Char island emerged 20 years ago, formed in the bay's shifting currents. It is uninhabited and was designated by the government as a forest reserve in 2013. Kamal says Bangladesh has spent $300 million building housing, concrete seawalls and cyclone shelters on the giant sandbar.
""Very good quality shelters and other infrastructure are put in place there, including long barriers meant to secure the inhabitants from any cyclonic hit from the Bay of Bengal,"" he says. ""The government is suspecting that the Rohingyas will have a better life there.""
But Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director for Human Rights Watch, says it's a terrible idea. She warns the island will serve more as a detention facility than upgraded refugee housing.
""The truth is these are people who are going to be locked on this island,"" she says. ""Because they're not really allowed to leave.""

Jason Beaubien/NPR Most international aid groups have been skeptical of the plan to relocate refugees to Bhasan Char. Supplies, aid workers, even teachers would have to be ferried in by boat. The island is controlled by the Bangladesh navy and it's unclear if the Rohingya would have the same access to international aid that they currently do in the camps.
Kalam insists refugees won't be forced to move to the island and any relocations will be voluntary. The government had planned to start sending them to the island April 15, but now it's unclear when it may begin. The government may find few takers. There's little enthusiasm among refugees in the sprawling Balukali camp.
In his bamboo and tarp shelter, Hamid Hassin, 30, says he has no desire to move to the island. He doesn't want to be separated from other Rohingya in the camps and is worried the low-lying island could flood in a major storm.
""We fled Myanmar to save our lives,"" he says. ""I don't want to end up dying on that island."""

Their Coffee Is World-Renowned.

Now More Guatemalans Are Actually Drinking It Facebook October 10, 2017 12:10 PM ET Anna-Cat Brigida
A barista at El Injerto coffee shop in Guatemala City pours water into a chemex. Guatemala has long been known for its coffee, but a culture of artisanal coffee has only recently taken root here. Anna-Catherine Brigida hide caption toggle caption Anna-Catherine Brigida A barista at El Injerto coffee shop in Guatemala City pours water into a chemex.

The El Injerto coffee shop, with its silver stools, brick-and-chalkboard walls and The Weeknd's ""I Feel It Coming"" playing softly in the background, resembles many cafes in Brooklyn or Los Angeles. But it is in Guatemala City, where paying $5 for a cup of coffee has not always been so common.
Coffee has been one of Guatemala's most important export crops since at least the early 1800s. Only in the past few years have Guatemalans started to consume their own world-renowned product on a larger scale.
""The growth has been exponential in the last five to eight years,"" says Evelio Francisco Alvarado, general manager of Guatemala's National Coffee Association, known by its Spanish acronym, Anacafe . ""This growth has stemmed from the increase in coffee shops not only in the capital, but also in other parts of the country.""
Anacafe reports that 10 percent of the coffee produced in Guatemala now stays in the country. Just a decade ago, nearly 100 percent of Guatemalan coffee was exported to places such as the U.S., Europe and Japan.
The rise of independent coffee shops
That began to change in 2009, the same year thatthe Aguirre family opened El Injerto with a goal of allowing Guatemalans to enjoy their own nation's coffee. The family has owned a plantation of the same name since 1874, producing coffee in Huehuetenango, a province in the western highlands, more than 200 miles from the capital.
For more than a century, most of El Injerto's coffee left the country. Now, about 10 percent of the coffee produced on the plantation stays within the Central American nation, served at one of a handful of El Injerto coffee shops in the capital and surrounding area.
""Our idea is to continue leaving more coffee here in Guatemala, and export less,"" says Paulina Aguirre, manager of the El Injerto cafe. She works in the family business with her father, Arturo, and siblings Arturo Jr. and Maria Gabriela.
Most of this growing consumption happens at independent coffee shops that only buy from Guatemalan producers and use artisanal preparation methods. That includes Rojo Cerezo, one of the first independent coffee shops in Guatemala City's Cuatro Grados Norte neighborhood, which now has the highest concentration of coffee shops in the city.
Rogelio Dávila opened the coffee shop in 2013 to help spread coffee culture among his fellow Guatemalans. After working as a barista in other coffee chains, he was also looking for more freedom to select his own coffee from different regions of Guatemala and to experiment with new preparation methods. Plus, he wanted to create a more personal atmosphere where he could share what he had learned about coffee with his customers.

Anna-Catherine Brigida hide caption toggle caption Anna-Catherine Brigida A cappuccino at the family-owned El Injerto coffee shop, which was opened with a goal of allowing Guatemalans to enjoy their own nation's coffee. Anna-Catherine Brigida
""I've always liked the idea of coffee,"" says Dávila, who only serves coffee bought in his own country. ""I believe that the concept of coffee is not just trying a cup of coffee, but the whole atmosphere.""
As one of the first artisanal coffee shops in the area, Rojo Cerezo's approach to coffee wasn't immediately accepted. Some customers complained that the coffee took too long to prepare. That has shifted as the coffee shop has grown in popularity.
""Before, I was like any Guatemalan: misinformed,"" says 21-year-old Rony Hernandez, a frequent customer at Rojo Cerezo. ""You think that you know about coffee when you start to have a cappuccino, or when you know what an Americano is, but to really appreciate a good coffee, you need artisanal methods.""
'Third-wave' methods
Hernandez started coming to Rojo Cerezo about a year ago, and has been converted into a lover of so-called ""third-wave"" methods, which go beyond brewing in a coffee pot or using an espresso machine.
Instead, artisanal coffee is prepared using a wider variety of methods, some which have existed for years but have just recently become widespread. A barista pours water into a dripper, which is a funnel atop a flat base, or a chemex, an hourglass-shaped container with an open top for the filter. Also popular in third-wave preparation is the vacuum coffee method, which uses a siphon pot. Heat is placed beneath the lower, glass ball-shaped section of the pot. As it heats up, the water is pushed into the top cylindrical portion. The heat is then removed and brewed coffee falls back down into the ball.
""Now I prefer to appreciate the tones of the coffee, and the artisanal methods, and what they've taught me about how the process works, whether it's the weight of the coffee, the type of grain, where it comes from, the amount of water, the temperature — all of these processes and details,"" he says.
There are now more than a dozen independent coffee shops in the Cuatro Grados Norte neighborhood, but the trend reaches beyond the capital city. They are now popping up all over the country.
In December 2016, Pedro Martínez opened Café Sol in the colonial city of Antigua after working for five years as a barista in the Guatemalan coffee chain &Café. He became interested in the third wave of coffee, using YouTube and blogs to learn these methods.
He credits the increasing amount of information shared online with the country's coffee boom, because it has made ""coffee culture"" more accessible for people like him who want to learn, but don't know anyone who can teach them.
""When we were little, I remember there was always a jar of instant coffee in the house, and we never worried about whether it was good quality. We just liked it,"" he says.
That is no longer the case in Guatemala, where baristas and coffee-shop owners like Martínez are spreading their knowledge. Guatemalans have always been proud of their coffee, but now they are finally able to understand why.
""Coffee is very symbolic for the country and its culture,"" Martínez says. ""Guatemala has great coffee, so why don't we drink it ourselves?""

Dominic Valente for NPR Arivaca, Ariz., is a tiny village, population about 700, with an outsize problem.
It sits just 11 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and has become a magnet for self-styled militia groups from out of state that say they want to patrol the border and stop migrants. Their presence has strained a town that has long prided itself on its live-and-let-live, cooperative spirit.
When the women of Arivaca gather for Monday afternoon gentle yoga, there are certain topics they know to avoid.
Civility Wars In These Divided Times, Is Civility Under Siege? ""We just don't talk politics,"" says Sue Soucy, a staunch supporter of President Trump. Then she adds: ""Will I vote for Trump again? Absolutely!""
""And I would die before I would!"" chimes in Marjorie Leon, to gales of laughter.
Avoiding politics helps keep the peace, says Mary Kasulaitis: ""You have to choose not to rile up people.""

Dominic Valente for NPR ""Or, you just look for the commonalities: How are we more alike than different?"" adds Wendy Dresang, a retired elementary school teacher who raised her three children in Arivaca. ""When I think of why I'm so proud to be an Arivacan,"" she says, ""it's because of that community of people caring about each other, helping each other. ... People want to be for things, rather than against things.""
Eileen Jaffe agrees. ""Because of the strong divisiveness that exists right now, it would be very easy to start arguing and getting upset,"" she says. ""We choose not to do that. We choose to be friends no matter what.""

Dominic Valente for NPR Jaffe first came to Arivaca in 1971, part of a group of hippies who set up tepees and established a community off the grid, riding horseback and hauling their own wood and water. That community-minded spirit persists, these women say, and the militias are not welcome.
""It's puzzling why they would be attracted to a place like this,"" says Dresang.
""The problem with the militias is you don't know who they are and you don't know what they want,"" says Kasulaitis, a local historian whose roots in Arivaca go way back. She grew up on ranchland that has been in her family since 1879. ""I put 'No Trespassing' signs on my fence, not because of the border crossers, but because of the militia. They're a worry to me.""
Poker night
Tuesday night in Arivaca means it's poker night at Joe Farrington's double-wide. Some of the men gathered around the table have been playing poker together for nearly 40 years.

Dominic Valente for NPR Farrington, a lifelong Arivacan, describes the town as ""a nice oasis for people that don't like conventional life.""
""A total eclectic village, is what I'd call it,"" says his poker buddy Brad Knaub, who runs the local coffee roaster, Gadsden Coffee Co. ""So many different types of people that somehow manage to get along. Cowboys, hippies, miners ... No matter what, or where you come from, if you're in need and need some help, people will step [up] to help you.""

Dominic Valente for NPR Now, the militia groups' presence is putting that harmonious spirit to the test.
""It's made some of the locals more standoffish, a little more defensive,"" says Farrington. ""Everybody used to be pretty open out here, but now you gotta kinda wonder, if you meet a stranger, is he just a nice hunter? Or is he some crazed guy that thinks everybody that lives in town is a criminal?""
He's referring to what happened last year, when militia groups came and spread wild conspiracy theories that the townspeople were in cahoots with Mexican drug cartels and sex traffickers.

Arivaca is a one-street, blink-and-you-miss-it town, set among the rolling hills of the Sonoran desert, 60 miles south of Tucson.

Look for a sign of the tensions, and you'll find it on the front door of the one bar and restaurant in town, La Gitana Cantina.

Foley lives in Arivaca. He moved here two years ago. He is lean and sun-weathered, with piercing, pale blue eyes.
Foley prefers to call Arizona Border Recon an ""intelligence gathering company,"" rather than a militia. Either way, he organizes armed patrols to the borderlands.

As for how he's viewed in town, Foley shrugs. ""I've been called a racist. I've been called a Nazi, and everything else,"" he says. ""I just ignore 'em and let 'em flap their gums. I don't bother them and they don't bother me.""

Many in town worry that Foley's presence in Arivaca will draw more militias to town.
They remember all too well the brutal crime that happened here 10 years ago, when members of a militia group shot and killed a local man, Raul Flores, and his 9-year-old daughter, Brisenia, in a home invasion. Arivacans' worst fear is that something like that could happen again.
Along the border, support for Trump and the wall
The drive from Arivaca to the Mexico border is a slow, bumpy ride through rugged grassland and up mountains dotted with mesquite trees and saguaro cactus.

Dominic Valente for NPR These are contentious views in town. And civil discourse? That can seem elusive.
As Jim Chilton sees it, ""Civility is the ability to speak one's mind without being threatened or without having to worry about being politically correct.""
When I ask Sue Chilton if it still seems like Arivaca is a civil town, she says, emphatically, ""You keep going back to the word civil, and the answer is yes! It's entirely civil because we all know the situation. You just don't broach certain subjects with certain people.""
Subjects like immigration, or the militias.

Randall has seen just how ugly it can get.
For several years now, she and others in Arivaca have been targeted by a local man who has harassed and threatened them with venomous letters, Facebook posts and emails. Mostly, he's incensed about immigration and what he calls ""liberal trash.""
It all started, Randall says, when the man submitted a letter for publication that violated the paper's rules of civility. She says his crusade of harassment began when she asked him to clean up the language.
Eventually, it got so bad that the targets of his abuse went to court and got restraining orders against him.

Skoll Awardees Predict How Their Projects Will Make The World A Better Place : Goats and Soda : NPR,www.npr.org,Marc Silver,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/15/712653034/no-fake-drugs-more-jobs-for-youth-end-child-sexual-abuse-online-a-vision-for-203,"Enlarge this image Trying to make the world a better place: (left to right) Skoll Award winners Gregory Rockson of mPharma, Nicola Galombik and Maryana Iskander of Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator, Nancy Lublin of Crisis Text Line, Bright Simons of mPedigree and Julie Cordua of Thorn.

Greg Smolonski/Skoll Welcome to 2030!
We asked some social entrepreneurs – people who've created projects to make the world a better place – to predict what they hope to accomplish in the not-too-distant future.
They are tackling a range of daunting issues: child sexual abuse on the internet, youth unemployment, mental health crises, counterfeit drugs, lack of access to medicine. Some of them have founded nonprofit groups, others are hoping to make a profit as they do good. To get up and running, they've relied on a mix of government money, donations, grants, fees from companies that buy in.
And this year they're each getting a $1.5 million investment in their work as the recipients of the Skoll Awards for Social Entrepreneurship , presented at the Skoll Foundation's World Forum this week in Oxford, England.
Here's a look at what they've accomplished so far – and what their hopes are for 2030 if they're able – as they say in both the charity and the business world – to scale up. (FYI, 2030 is the year the U.N. aims to meet its ""sustainable development goals."")
Youth Unemployment Will Come Way Down Young, out of school and unemployed.
That's a common situation in many countries, especially those with a bulging population of young people.
In South Africa, for example, every year 1.1 million young people graduate from high school or college – or else they just drop out.
But only 400,000 of them find a job. South African Nicola Galombik, who in her day job is director of a global investment group, wanted to found an organization that would do something about the other 700,000 – to help these kids stuck in ""a no man's land,"" as she puts it.
One problem, she says, is that potential employers can't easily judge an applicant's employability. A high school diploma doesn't attest to good English language skills, a strong work ethic, the ability to work well with colleagues and the public.
Goats and Soda Advice From 5 Women And A Guy Who Won $1.25 Million To Do Good The nonprofit group she started is called Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator . Harambee means ""we all pull together"" in Swahili. And she's pulled together a path for unemployed youth to burnish skills and land a job.
Harambee invites young people to sign up for assessment and training. Their only expense is about one rand – about 75 cents — for mobile phone charges. They complete assessments and take classes to get them ready for the workplace. They're eligible for apprenticeships. Their reliability is judged as well as their skills. Signing up for classes and not showing up, for example, is a red flag.
So in essence Harambee creates a talent pool for companies, focusing on such fields asthe service industry, retail, global business, digital firms and technical work.
The program appeals to youth. Harambee works with half a million young people in South Africa and also in Rwanda. And it appeals to employers, who have offered 100,000 jobs to candidates from the Harambee pool.
Prediction: By 2030 Galombik hopes that Harambee's efforts will grow, flipping the annual numbers in her country. She boldly predicts that of the 1.1 million youth leaving school each year, 700,000 will be able to enter the economy. If that happens, she says, ""we've tilted the seesaw"" in the right direction.
Feeling Lost? You Can Text For Mental Health Help When a person struggles with dark thoughts, mental health issues, abuse, one way to seek help is to call a helpline.
But many helplines have limited hours. In some countries there aren't any. And it can be hard to reach out for help by phone if you're in school or in an office setting. Or if you're a kid and parents are hovering nearby.
TED Radio Hour How Can Text Messaging Save Lives? But you can easily text for help at any time and in practically any place, says New Yorker Nancy Lublin. That's what motivated her to found Crisis Text Line , which trains volunteers to respond to text inquiries and gives them support from staff with degrees in relevant fields.
The group's data shows youth are big users: of the 100 million texts received in the first five and a half years, 75 percent are from people under age 25, and 13 percent of the texters are under age 13. Two-thirds of the texters say they're sharing something they've never told to anyone else before.
Prediction: By 2030, Lublin believes that text-for-help will be available in 50 countries. And there will be real-time global data drawn from these texts so it's possible to see if, say, a suicide by a famous individual or a gun incident has triggered mental health crises in certain parts of the world. Such data does not exist now, according to Lublin.
Even with this predicted progress, some things will never change. Lublin says that ""mom"" is one of the most popular terms in the texts and will no doubt continue to be – cited as a source of pain but also as a source of strength.
African Pharmacies Won't Run Out Of Pills — Or Charge High Prices You walk in a pharmacy to get some medication you need – say, for hypertension, for diabetes, for HIV, for malaria. They are all out. Or the pills are there but are prohibitively expensive.
That's a common problem in African pharmacies, says Gregory Rockson of Ghana. Africa has many mom-and-pop stores that can't order in big quantities as chain pharmacies do. That means they may have to pay higher prices and may not be able to keep a full supply of medications on hand.
Goats and Soda Hope Or Hype: The Revolution In Africa Will Be Wireless The solution Rockson came up with is a company called mPharma (the m stands for mobile). mPharma can negotiate for lower prices because they're buying in large quantities. By monitoring data from the pharmacies, he can figure out what kind of supplies they need to keep on hand to meet customer needs.
mPharma now works with over 200 pharmacies and 50 hospitals in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Prediction: By 2030 Rockson wants to see an Africa where companies like his private sector mPharma distribute drugs widely – and at a fair price — across the continent.
No Worries About Buying Fake Drugs, Seeds ... Or Motorcycle Parts Bright Simons of Ghana says his mother gave him the ""Christian name"" of Bright when he started religious school. It was a bright moment, a bright day, he says by way of explanation.
Now Simons is living up to his name with an idea that shines light on counterfeit products. His company, mPedigree, gives consumers confidence that medicines and seeds they buy are the genuine article and not poor quality knockoffs.
Fake pills and bad seeds are a serious problem in many parts of the world. Sometimes they're sold in fake packages that look like the real thing. People die from ingesting counterfeit medicines. Farmers see crops fail if they purchase poor quality seeds.
mPedigree has created software to try and solve the problem – from digital tools for governments to confirm authenticity to programs that let brands track their products as they go from the source to the customer, who can then use mPedigree apps or hotlines for verification.
These systems are now being used in 12 countries in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. The company also certifies a range of other products, from cosmetics to auto parts.
Prediction: Simons hopes to offer mPedigree's protections in many countries and for many products. As a side benefit, he says, consumers will develop trust in the marketplace – and technology as a tool to prevent fraud.
No More Child Sexual Violence In Online Images It is illegal in the United States and most countries to post online images and videos of child sexual abuse. Yet across the internet, these images still appear on sites that let users put up content. The National Center For Missing And Exploited Children has reviewed over 267 million such images and videos.
Some big players in the field – Facebook and Twitter, for example — take measures to find and remove this kind of illegal content. As for companies that don't — it's not necessarily that they are ""bad actors,"" says social justice advocate Julie Cordua of California. Rather, they are ""busy building their business"" and don't have the ability to monitor all their content.
Cordua is the CEO of Thorn , a group co-founded by actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher. Thorn has developed software to help social media companies find the user-generated images and take them down and has also created software to assist law enforcement agencies as they try to find the children in abuse materials. They may be missing or victims of trafficking.
In addition, Thorn uses online campaigns to target people who seek out abuse material and direct them to help. Cordua says the messages have ""directed more than 100,000 individuals to seek help via confidential counseling"" in the U.S.
Prediction: ""We will have eradicated the spread of child sexual abuse content online,"" says Cordua. ""It'd be a good world if that happens.""

"In Sudan, Activists Continue To Call For Civilian Government",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713460562/in-sudan-activists-continue-to-call-for-civilian-government,"In Sudan, Activists Continue To Call For Civilian Government In Sudan, Activists Continue To Call For Civilian Government Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition Halima Gikandi
Sudan is undergoing a period of political chaos after a military coup unseated the autocratic president, Omar al-Bashir. Protesters are demanding that civilians run the government.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
In Sudan, the ruling military council has said they are willing to negotiate with the opposition. But demonstrators in the capital of that country, Khartoum, continue to protest. As Halima Gikandi reports, they say their demands have not yet been met.
HALIMA GIKANDI, BYLINE: The air is filled with cautious hope and ironclad will. Activists say they will not leave the streets until their demands are met and change comes to Sudan.
(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Foreign language spoken).
GIKANDI: Thousands of people have been demonstrating outside the army headquarters in Khartoum for the past week, demanding that President Omar al-Bashir step down from office and that a civilian-led government take its place. On Thursday, their hopes were met when the military ousted the former president from office and formed a military transition council. But many activists say they're worried about the lack of transparency regarding how the military is interacting with al-Bashir's party, the NCP.
UNIDENTIFIED SPOKESPERSON: What is clear is that there has not really been a clean break from the previous regime. It is unlikely that they will launch a proper crackdown on previous leaders of the region.
GIKANDI: On Sunday, a spokesman for the military transition council said that they were willing to work with opposition groups to establish a civilian government. They gave them one week to suggest a new prime minister. But many activists say they are worried about the lack of transparency. Moni'm al-Sheikh (ph) is an exiled Sudanese activist living in Nairobi. He works with the Civic Forces Alliance, which is one of the opposition groups negotiating with the military council.
MONI'M AL-SHEIKH: There is no signal so far that the military council is handling the situation of the NCP and its leaders. There is no transparency about - the way about those who were arrested.
GIKANDI: For others, the negotiations are a step in the right direction and a sign that democracy could soon come to Sudan. Still, a call to continue protesting. Abubakar Muzammil (ph) is a 25-year-old civic engineer in Khartoum.
ABUBAKAR MUZAMMIL: People are afraid that if they lost the only card they have, which is the protest, well, they might be fooled or something.
GIKANDI: The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Norway have urged Sudan's military council to allow peaceful protests and to engage in dialogue with the opposition.

"When Teen Dating Leads To Homicide, Girls Are Most Likely Victims : Shots - Health News : NPR",www.npr.org,Rhitu Chatterjee,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/15/713469721/teen-dating-violence-can-lead-to-homicide-girls-are-the-most-common-victims,"Enlarge this image Teen romance gone wrong can be dangerous for girls.

toggle caption Ross Anania/Getty Images Teen romance gone wrong can be dangerous for girls. Around 7 percent of teen homicides between 2003 and 2016 were committed by intimate partners, and girls were the victims in 90 percent of those deaths.
Ross Anania/Getty Images Domestic violence is common among adults, and women are most frequently the victims. In fact, nearly half of women killed by homicide in the United States are killed by their former or current intimate partners.
Now a new study finds that this kind of violence also poses a risk to the lives of adolescent girls.
The study found that of the more than 2,000 adolescents killed between 2003 and 2016, nearly 7 percent — 150 teens — were killed by their current or former intimate partners.
Ninety percent of the victims were female, and their average age was around 17 years old. In almost 80 percent of the cases, the perpetrator was 18 years or older.
The findings were published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.
""People think that intimate partner violence among adolescents is less serious than among adults,"" says study author Avanti Adhia , an epidemiologist at the University of Washington School Of Medicine . ""It's important to highlight that this can really lead to death. It's not something to brush off as 'This is just an argument between kids.' ""
If you need help Young people who are experiencing emotional abuse or fear they are facing danger can call the National Teen Dating Abuse helpline, 1-866-331-9474, or text LOVEIS to 22522 and be connected with a professional who can help. Teens can also chat with someone for help at loveisrespect.org.
The study might be the first to offer a national estimate for deaths of teenagers due to dating violence, says Anita Raj , who directs the Center for Gender Equity and Health at University of California San Diego and wasn't involved in the new study.
""I have never seen this kind of work with this very young [age] group,"" she says. ""I did not know it was an adolescent issue at this scale.""
The new study also offers details about the circumstances of the deaths.
Adhia and her colleagues looked at information from law enforcement, the medical examiner or the coroner's office records for each case. And they found that firearms, especially handguns, were the most common cause for injury, accounting for 61 percent of cases.
""When it comes to lethality, it was very much related to gun availability,"" says Deborah Capaldi , a developmental psychologist and senior scientist at Oregon Science Learning Center who has studied teen dating violence but wasn't involved in the new study. ""When they're in a situation where they're angry, mad, out of control, they're able to reach for a gun. That is more likely to end in the partner being killed.""
The new study also explored the precipitating events for these deaths. The most common reasons were the victim breaking up with the perpetrator or refusing to start a relationship with them. That accounted for 27 percent of cases. The perpetrator's jealousy was also included in this group.
Previous research shows that jealousy is a common issue in teen relationships, Capaldi says.
In one study, she and her colleagues brought in 17- to 18-year-olds to discuss relationship conflicts they were facing. The most frequent issue raised by the teens was jealousy of their partners, she says.
""This was equally by girls and boys,"" she says. ""The most dangerous situation is when you have a history of poor [emotional] control, hostility, and then they're placed in a high-risk situation, like becoming jealous.""
And breakups, she adds, are a particularly volatile and dangerous time in abusive relationships. ""We found breakups are for dangerous periods for more likelihood of injury,"" Capaldi says. ""When partners are together, although they might engage in intimate partner violence, they're not trying to do severe damage. When they're breaking up, they lash out, and they're trying to hurt the other person.""
About 25 percent of the cases were triggered by heated arguments between the victim and the perpetrator, making this the second most common precipitating event.
Reckless use of firearms also led to some deaths, whereas others happened because the victim was pregnant and the perpetrator did not want to have the baby or they feared arrest for statutory rape.
Dating violence is common
The results are ""shocking and frightening,"" but ""unfortunately, it's not surprising,"" says Megan Bair-Merritt , a pediatrician at Boston Medical Centre and Boston University School of Medicine, who wrote an accompanying editorial on the study.
Dating violence among adolescents is ""incredibly common,"" she says.
According to the National Survey on Teen Relationships and Intimate Violence, more than 60 percent of teens said they had experienced some kind of abuse — physical, sexual and/or emotional — by someone they were dating or previously were in a relationship with.
""We have to recognize how prevalent teen dating violence is,"" stresses Bair-Merritt. ""It can have incredibly substantial consequences on health and well-being, including mortality.""
Young survivors of intimate partner violence are at a higher risk of being in abusive relationships in the future, Raj says.
""This is how they're learning to form relationships,"" she says. ""There is the likelihood of this [kind of violence] occurring again.""
Prevention and help
The new findings raise two important questions about prevention and intervention, Bair-Merritt says.
""How do we talk to teens and children early on about dating violence?"" she says, and ""How do we set up good interventions?""
She says adults should speak openly to children about relationships even before they are dating. ""I think it's important to talk about what healthy relationships are,"" she says.
It's also important for kids to have many ""safe adults"" in their lives, adds Bair-Merritt. These are adults — parents, teachers, coaches, pastors, grandparents — who the teens feel comfortable with and trust, who they can reach out to during stressful experiences.
""For young kids ... safe relationships with adults buffer from stressors,"" she says. ""There's a physical stress buffer for adolescents in having those connections. The more [connections], the better.""
And pediatricians have a big role in preventing and intervening in teen dating violence, she writes in the editorial.
""The American Academy of Pediatrics says we should be talking to teens about relationships and supporting them,"" Bair-Merritt says. ""We have a fairly good reach. Most teens see their pediatrician at least once a year.""
And most children have known their pediatricians for years, so they are more likely to trust them for information about dating relationships, she says.
Health care professionals should be aware of signs that suggest their teen patients may be in abusive relationships, she writes in the editorial. Intimate partner violence has been shown to put teens at increased risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Pediatricians can look for signs of these mental health problems, social isolation and changes in their performance at school.
Limiting access to guns is also part of the solution, Capaldi says. Parents should speak to their kids about gun safety, she says, and ensure that any guns in their homes are kept in safe places. They should also ask their kids if the person they are dating owns or has access to a gun. ""Making sure guns are safely kept is a huge issue,"" she says.
Schools can also be a big part of the solution, Capaldi says.
School nurses and counselors can spot signs of dating abuse and help support the victims, she says. Schools that don't have the necessary resources to help should connect victims to community resources, like counseling centers or relevant nonprofit organizations.
""Schools and school nurses need to know resources in the area,"" she says.
There are several evidence-based programs that teach adolescents relationship skills and how to avoid intimate partner violence , Adhia notes. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a list of such programs.
And there are hotlines specifically for teens facing intimate partner violence, such as the National Teen Dating Abuse helpline, adds Bair-Merritt. Teenagers can call 1-866-331-9474 or text LOVEIS to 22522 and be connected with a professional trained to gauge whether they are in immediate danger, how scared they are feeling, whether they or their partner have access to firearms and to help individuals get out of unsafe situations. Teenagers can also chat with someone for help at loveisrespect.org ."

Ahmed Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images Ahmed Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images Sudanese demonstrators gather near military headquarters in the capital Khartoum on Monday. Organizers said they were resisting an attempt to disperse the sit-in where thousands of people have camped out for days.
Ahmed Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images Buoyed by Thursday's ouster of longtime President Omar al-Bashir, Sudanese protesters faced off against troops during a sit-in outside military headquarters in Khartoum on Monday as they amplify their call for civilian-led rule.
Demonstrators say the Sudanese military attempted to take away the barriers surrounding protesters in the road, where thousands have gathered for days. Ayman, a protester who wants to use just his first name because he fears retribution, told NPR that the barriers' removal would have effectively dissolved the protest but the demonstrators managed to stop the troops.
The main protest group, the Sudanese Professionals Association, issued an "" urgent appeal "" on Twitter, calling on additional protesters to step in and protect the area from the armed forces.
Africa Sudan's Military Says It Has Taken Control And Arrested President Omar Al-Bashir Video from the scene shows a group of chanting and flag-waving demonstrators hustling toward the troops, some perched atop vehicles.
Media reports said the standoff ended peacefully with no bloodshed. But it underscored the tenuous nature of Sudan's transition as military leaders vie for power in the vacuum Bashir has left behind, and activists fear a continuation of the old regime passed along to loyalists.
""These people are really fearless,"" Ayman, a university lecturer who has been spending nights at the sit-in, told NPR. ""People come in knowing that they might die.""

Ahmed Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images Ahmed Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images Sudanese armed forces gather near the site of a demonstration close to the military headquarters in Khartoum on Monday.
Ahmed Mustafa/AFP/Getty Images The Sudan Doctors Committee, an affiliate of the umbrella SPA group, said Friday that more than a dozen people had been killed ""under the military council"" since the coup occurred just one day earlier.
The military council took control after Bashir's arrest and removal from office, announcing it would rule the country for two years before democratic elections take place; terms unacceptable to protesters and opposition leaders who are demanding a transitional civilian government assume power immediately.
""People are still keeping their eye on the prize of a full democratic transition to a civilian-led government, not a military-led government,"" Mayada Hassanain, an economist based in Khartoum who has taken part in months of protests, told NPR's Weekend Edition .
The military-led government has resembled a game of musical chairs. Gen. Awad Ibn Auf, who helped lead the coup, served as president for a single day before stepping down. He named Lt. Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan as the new leader. The head of the National Intelligence and Security Service was also reshuffled over the weekend.
The military council announced Sunday it would name a civilian prime minister and Cabinet, but has not yielded to demands to name a civilian president.
Analysts say Bashir, an autocrat who took over in 1989 in another coup, has left behind a deep state that may prove difficult to root out.
""What is clear is that there has not been a clear break from the old regime,"" Murithi Mutiga , deputy project director for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group told NPR's Halima Gikandi. ""And what we know is that what the military says and what the military does can be quite different.""
This latest round of protests initially ignited late last year in response to economic woes, before spreading and turning political , culminating in the military's removal of Bashir.
The lead-up to his ouster was not entirely smooth. The United Kingdom, Norway, the United States and Canada issued a joint statement in January calling for the immediate release of political activists, protesters and journalists detained without charge. And international human rights groups have raised the alarm about scores of people reportedly killed in the months before Bashir's ouster.
On Sunday, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum issued another joint statement expressing support for the protesters and appealing for peace. ""Sudan needs an orderly transition to civilian rule leading to elections in a reasonable time frame.""
But in separate statements, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates expressed support for the military council.
As for Bashir, he reportedly remains under house arrest. The 75-year-old is facing international charges for war crimes in connection with genocide committed in Darfur.

Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images A version of this story was first posted by member station WABE .
President Trump called former President Jimmy Carter for the first time this weekend.
Carter revealed that news during his regular Sunday school lesson at his home church, Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday morning.
Earlier this year, Carter sent Trump a letter with some advice about managing the U.S.-China relationship. Carter oversaw the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries 40 years ago.
On Saturday evening, Trump called Carter to talk about it. It was the first time they'd spoken, Carter said. He said Trump told him that he is particularly concerned about how China is ""getting ahead of us.""
Carter said he agreed with Trump on this issue.
""And do you know why?"" Carter said. ""I normalized diplomatic relations with China in 1979. Since 1979, do you know how many times China has been at war with anybody? None. And we have stayed at war,"" he said. (China and Vietnam actually fought a brief border war in early 1979, weeks after U.S. relations with China were normalized.)
Carter said the United States is ""the most warlike nation in the history of the world"" due to a desire to impose American values on other countries, and he suggested that China is investing its resources into projects such as high-speed railroads instead of defense spending.
""How many miles of high-speed railroad do we have in this country?""
Zero, the congregation answered.
""We have wasted, I think, $3 trillion,"" Carter said, referring to American military spending. ""China has not wasted a single penny on war, and that's why they're ahead of us. In almost every way.
""And I think the difference is if you take $3 trillion and put it in American infrastructure, you'd probably have $2 trillion left over. We'd have high-speed railroad. We'd have bridges that aren't collapsing. We'd have roads that are maintained properly. Our education system would be as good as that of, say, South Korea or Hong Kong.
""I wasn't comparing my country adversely to China,"" Carter qualified. ""I was just pointing that out because I happened to get a phone call last night.""
The former president said he understands that Trump is worried about China surpassing the U.S. as the world's top economic superpower.
""I don't really fear that time, but it bothers President Trump, and I don't know why. I'm not criticizing him — this morning,"" Carter said to laughs from the audience.
The White House confirmed the conversation in a statement released Monday.
""President Jimmy Carter wrote President Trump a beautiful letter about the current negotiations with China and on Saturday they had a very good telephone conversation about President Trump's stance on trade with China and numerous other topics,"" said the statement, which wasn't attributed to a spokesperson.
Much of Carter's Palm Sunday lesson was focused on peace and kindness and was given before an audience that was mostly composed of visitors, many of whom had lined up overnight for the service.
Last month, Carter became the nation's longest-living president."

Notre Dame Cathedral, one of the world's most famous churches, erupted in flames Monday in Paris, losing its spire but remaining otherwise largely intact after firefighters worked through the night to contain the fire.
The commander of the Paris firefighter brigade, Jean-Claude Gallet, said Monday night that the cathedral's main structure and two towers of the cathedral had been saved. Firefighters said they had contained the flames by early morning local time, and the fire was entirely out by midmorning, Gallet confirmed to NPR.

Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said authorities were trying to save priceless art and relics from the structure's interior, according to The Associated Press.
The Paris prosecutor's office says it has opened an investigation into the fire but that initial indications suggest it was started accidentally. The cathedral closed at 6:45 p.m. local time, and the fire broke out five or six minutes later, France 24 reported .
Police in Paris asked people to avoid the area so emergency vehicles could pass. The area was evacuated and a shelter was set up for residents who live near the cathedral.

Michel Euler/AP The structure had been undergoing a $6.8 million renovation project , including work on its spire. Sixteen statues had been removed last week as part of the renovation and were therefore spared from the fire, the AP reports.
Promises of massive donations for the cathedral's reconstruction began to pour in within hours. Bernard Arnault, the billionaire chairman and CEO of the luxury goods group LVMH, pledged 200 million euros from his family and his company. Gucci head François-Henri Pinault, another billionaire, said he will donate 100 million euros.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has also pledged 50 million euros from the city and announced a conference to bring together international donors.
In the U.S., the Basilica of the National Shrine announced it was accepting donations to help rebuild Notre Dame.
Located on the Île de la Cité in the middle of the Seine River, the soaring Gothic structure dates to the 13th century and was completed in the 15th century. The city said that it had closed all entrances to the isle.

Philippe Wojazer/Reuters Notre Dame celebrated its 850th birthday in 2013. It attracts 12 million visitors each year and is the most visited monument in France, ahead of the Eiffel Tower, according to the cathedral. Victor Hugo used its gargoyles and flying buttresses as the setting for his 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame .
Many observers wondered why airplanes were not dropping water on the inferno, as firefighters do to combat forest fires. But the cathedral's urban setting makes such a mission too dangerous: It would involve dropping perhaps 6 tons of water, an unsafe proposition in a densely populated city. The intervention could destroy the cathedral in the effort to save it.

The wooden roof was an ""accident waiting to happen,"" said Bruzelius.

Arizona Teachers Can Now Discuss LGBTQ Issues Without Worrying About The Law,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712842522/arizona-teachers-can-now-discuss-lgbtq-issues-without-worrying-about-the-law,"Arizona Teachers Can Now Discuss LGBTQ Issues Without Worrying About The Law Facebook April 15, 2019 2:30 PM ET Mariana Dale
Before the repeal, Arizona was one of at least seven states with curriculum laws around LGBTQ issues.

Zelda Gardner/Getty Images
On Thursday, Arizona lawmakers repealed a law that restricted how public school teachers could talk about LGBTQ relationships in health classes.
The Arizona law regulated HIV/AIDS instruction in public schools. Since 1991, it has banned teachers in those courses from promoting ""a homosexual life-style,"" portraying ""homosexuality as a positive alternative life-style"" or suggesting there are safe ways to have homosexual sex.
At least six other states have curriculum laws around LGBTQ issues, according to the advocacy group GLSEN . Like many of the laws that exist in other states, Arizona's was created in the throes of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
The repeal was the culmination of a lawsuit filed against Arizona education leaders in March , and years of advocacy from Democrats and LGBTQ advocacy groups.
""We're so excited and relieved and, I think, in a state of shock, to be honest,"" said Carol Brochin, a plaintiff in the lawsuit with her child, who lawsuit identifies as S.C.
""[S.C.] was so surprised and really taken aback and started crying, actually,"" Brochin said.
S.C., a Mexican-American seventh-grader, uses they/them pronouns and identifies as queer.
""They are the emotional center for their friends,"" Brochin said, adding that she thinks it's because of how much S.C. has been through.
The lawsuit described the bullying and offensive name-calling S.C. experienced in sixth grade while attending a Tucson Unified School District middle school. It said S.C. was ""repeatedly called a 'stupid gay kid' and 'faggot' by other students,"" and S.C. did not feel safe at school and ""frequently went to the school nurse's office because they were so upset from the harassment and bullying.""
The complaint argued that because S.C. would take courses that are subject to the curriculum law in high school, they ""will face further stigma and will be denied equal education opportunities because of the Law."" Loading...

It was unclear from the beginning who, if anyone, would defend the law. One of the lawsuit's listed defendants, Arizona Superintendent Kathy Hoffman, had already publicly supported the LGBTQ curriculum restrictions' repeal.
In a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday, the Arizona House and Senate voted on a repeal, and Gov. Doug Ducey signed it into law.
The amendment was brought by Republican Rep. T.J. Shope. Know An LGBTQ Student Itching To Study Abroad? Here Are Some Things To Think About
""I thought to myself this ... seems fairly antiquated. We should probably go ahead and see if we can't get out of this,"" Shope said after the vote. He added that repealing the law would save taxpayer money that would have gone to defending it against the lawsuit.
Democratic Sen. Martín Quezada had tried to repeal the law every year since 2016, but Republican lawmakers blocked his bill from advancing.
""I want us to all be honest with ourselves today about this bill,"" Quezada said in explaining his vote for the repeal. ""We would not be here today if it was not a forced issue.""
Several LGBTQ lawmakers explained how powerful it was to vote yes on the repeal.

""Today's vote is long overdue,"" said Democratic Rep. Andrés Cano, who is gay. ""Our schools should be safe; they should be inclusive; they should be free from harassment, bullying and stigmatization.""
Both Republicans and Democrats supported the repeal, with 74 lawmakers voting in favor. The 15 no votes all came from GOP legislators. Facebook"

It sort of stood to reason that after winning multiple Grammys this decade — including one for Album of the Year — Beck would retire to the cushy corners of modern alt-rock. As a testament to that, he even collaborated with Cage the Elephant earlier this year. But Beck, ever the disruptor of standards, took a pivot into left-field.

Journalists Demand Nicaragua Stop Attacking Reporters,www.npr.org,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2018/12/31/681143329/journalists-demand-nicaragua-stop-attacking-reporters,"Journalists Demand Nicaragua Stop Attacking Reporters Journalists Demand Nicaragua Stop Attacking Reporters Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition Maria Martin
Worldwide journalism groups are demanding that the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega stop its attacks on journalists. Costa Rica wants an imprisoned TV journalist released too.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Journalism advocacy groups are calling for the Nicaraguan government to end its attacks on the media. The government of Costa Rica has now joined in. Nicaragua's strongman President Daniel Ortega has imprisoned a television journalist who has Costa Rican citizenship. Here's reporter Maria Martin.
MARIA MARTIN, BYLINE: In the last two weeks, the Ortega government has intensified its repression of civil society groups and media outlets in Nicaragua, raiding several media organizations, closing one and imprisoning journalists.
UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Yelling in Spanish).
MARTIN: This is the sound as dozens of heavily armed police brutally shove journalist Carlos Chamorro and his staff with nightsticks and plastic shields outside police headquarters in Managua. Chamorro, director of the digital outlet Confidencial and one of the most respected journalists in Central America, had come to place an official complaint after Confidencial's offices were raided and its equipment damaged in mid-December.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CARLOS CHAMORRO: (Speaking Spanish).
MARTIN: Chamorro continues to produce programs like this one examining the embattled state of Nicaragua's media. But according to reports, he does it practically in hiding. Other media outlets have fared worse. The director of the television station 100% Noticias - 100% News - Miguel Mora and its news director Lucia Pineda were kidnapped and taken into custody after the station's equipment was destroyed. They're now in the infamous El Chipote prison, charged with fomenting hate and terrorism, their special concern about journalist Pineda, who hasn't been allowed to see her family nor human rights representatives nor the Costa Rican consul.
Pineda holds dual Nicaraguan and Costa Rican citizenship. This weekend, Costa Rica's President Carlos Alvarado, himself a former journalist, stated that his neighboring country is most concerned about the ever increasing violations of human rights and press freedoms in Nicaragua.
Meanwhile, international press groups such as Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Inter American Press Association are calling for President Ortega to end the escalation of attacks against media he sees as critical of his government. Ortega and his supporters maintain they support freedom of expression in Nicaragua. For NPR News, I'm Maria Martin.

Blanka Callejas looks out over the production floor of her family's factory just outside the Nicaraguan town of Granada. Workers scrub down huge metal vats where they process fruit for the Callejas brand of jams and preserves, a staple in Nicaraguan homes for decades. She is worried about how she will pay her 50 employees.
These days, she says, jam has become a luxury.
Nicaragua has been in turmoil since last April, when President Daniel Ortega launched a brutal crackdown on opponents. At least 325 people have been killed, thousands injured and 550 arrested. In December, Ortega expelled international observers who were invited into the country to look into allegations of human rights abuses. The Organization of American States said at the time that the expulsion of its observers ""further places Nicaragua into the terrain of authoritarianism."" The economy, after years of growth, is now in recession .
That has left many Nicaraguans grappling with the difficult decision of whether to stay, or go.

Callejas says she's not giving up, despite her company's sales having plummeted 40 percent since the crisis began last April.
""I know what it's like to be in exile, to be alone,"" she says, remembering back in the 1970s, when as a teen, she had to flee to Costa Rica for a while. She had taken up arms against the Somoza dictatorship with the Sandinista rebels. President Ortega was a leader in that fight, but now many of his critics and old allies now say the leader is behaving like an authoritarian ruler himself .
This time around, Callejas says she won't leave her business or employees. Her son, however, did leave the country, fearing he was targeted by the authorities and their allies.
""They labeled him a terrorist, a vandal, a criminal, just like they have done to all protesters,"" she says. Nicaragua's New Anti-Terrorism Law Thwarts Protesters, Activists Say Aug. 29, 2018
The nationwide demonstrations broke out originally over pension cuts but then they widened into broad discontent with the regime. Ortega responded with increased repression of opponents: Hundreds were prosecuted under new anti-terrorism laws . Ortega also shuttered nine nongovernmental groups, including the country's leading human rights organization. The organization's head, Vilma Núñez, says she is determined to stay, too.
""I'm not running, I couldn't live with myself if I did, I'd feel terrible,"" she says at an outdoor café. Núñez picked this spot. She says her house is watched by police.
""When is this all going to end, I don't know, I may not see it ... I hope I get to,"" she says.
Núñez was jailed during the struggle to topple the Somoza dictatorship, and isn't afraid of a fight. But she says, at 80, she's too old to leave the country or her husband, who is also in his 80s.
Gioconda Belli, Nicaragua's prize-winning poet, says so many people are facing the agonizing decision of whether to stay and fight or flee.
""The ground beneath our feet has ceased to be stable ... when the earth shakes you don't know exactly where to stand,"" she says.
The United States has imposed sanctions on senior government officials, including Ortega's wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, but the Ortega administration doesn't appear to be budging. The president insists he will serve out his current, third term until 2021.
Ortega is one of Latin America's remaining allies with Venezuela's embattled President Nicolás Maduro, a relationship that has brought Nicaragua much scorn from the U.S. Last November, President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton included Nicaragua in a list of hemispheric enemies, along with Venezuela and Cuba, dubbing them the "" troika of tyranny .""
While many in Nicaragua are closely watching events in Venezuela, the two countries are not as economically intertwined as they once were. Nicaragua has moved to wean itself of Venezuelan oil and handouts in recent years.
But despite that diversification, Nicaragua's economy, one of the poorest in the hemisphere, might not hold up much longer, says Juan Sebastián Chamorro, the head of the Nicaraguan Foundation for Economic and Social Development, a think tank in Managua. He says unemployment is skyrocketing, tourism has tanked and nearly a third of cash deposits have left the country.
""There is no credit in the economy, the economic situation is going to worsen throughout 2019 so that is in itself going to create the incentive for a lot of people to leave the country,"" he says.
Police surround his office and routinely pull him over, he says. He works remotely and sleeps at different houses, but he is not leaving the country.
His cousin, however, prominent journalist Carlos Fernando Chamorro, has. Enlarge this image

""Going to exile has been a very painful and difficult decision,"" says Chamorro, the editor of a news and analysis website called Confidencial .
Adding to what has been a grueling calculus in his decision to leave is the fact that his mother, former President Violeta Chamorro, is gravely ill. Leading Journalist Flees Nicaragua, Citing 'Extreme Threats' From The Government
Ultimately he fled, and last month Chamorro announced he had moved his entire news operations to neighboring Costa Rica. Nicaraguan police raided his Managua offices last December and continue to occupy it. He had been warned his arrest was imminent.
""There's a moment in which you have to choose either you wait for them to detain you and fabricate criminal charges and take you to prison,"" he says. Or you have to preserve your freedom so you will be able to keep fighting, he adds.
As many as 66 Nicaraguan journalists have reportedly fled the country as the authorities carry out media raids and arrests.
Overall, tens of thousands of residents have sought refuge in Costa Rica since April. The United Nations says hundreds of Nicaraguans have also recently applied for asylum in Panama, Mexico and the United States.
There is a daily sign of the exodus outside the Costa Rican Embassy in Managua, where Nicaraguans form long lines for visas. Vendors selling them everything from photocopies to bus tickets fill the street.
One woman who recently obtained a visa, who is too afraid to give her name, says she is leaving for a short vacation. She could see the two police officers watching all activity outside the embassy. When asked if that was the real reason she needed a visa, she smiled nervously and kept nodding her head.
Another family of five, with their packed suitcases in hand, says the same.
They have just received their visas. They toss their bags into the trunk of a waiting taxi, pile in, and take off, straight for the border."

Before Dana Canedy got down to the business of announcing the winners of this year's Pulitzer Prizes, the administrator offered an unusual aside.
""I want to break with tradition and offer my sincere admiration for an entry that did not win, but that should give us all hope for the future of journalism in this great democracy,"" Canedy told the journalists assembled at Columbia University in New York City.
The entry was from the Eagle Eye , the student newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last year. There, in the aftermath of the violence, the student journalists had to grapple with their immense grief in crafting 17 obituaries for slain friends and coaches.
""These budding journalists remind us of the media's unwavering commitment to bearing witness even in the most wrenching of circumstances, in service to a nation whose very existence depends on a free and dedicated press,"" Canedy explained. ""There is hope in their example even as security threats to journalists are greater than ever and there is hope even if some wrongly degrade the media as the enemy of the very democracy it serves.""
The staff of the Eagle Eye didn't win a Pulitzer. But it did set the tone for the crop of Pulitzer Prize winners to come, many of whom faced down threats — both verbal and physical — in an increasingly fraught environment for the media in the U.S. and abroad.
(Want to see the full list of winners right away? Skip ahead by clicking here, or watch the full ceremony using the video embedded below.)
YouTube The South Florida Sun-Sentinel won the Pulitzer Prize for public service, the only prize out of the 21 official categories to include a gold medal with the usual purse of $15,000 in winnings. The 18-member Pulitzer Prize Board , which typically makes the final call on winners, applauded the paper ""for exposing failings by school and law enforcement officials before and after"" last year's shooting in Parkland.
Pulitzer judges also recognized the entire staff of Reuters, including journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who are serving multi-year prison sentences in Myanmar for their reporting on the country's brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims. Reuters split the international reporting prize with Maggie Michael, Maad al-Zikry and Nariman El-Mofty of the Associated Press, who ""exposed the tragic effects of the war in Yemen.""

— Reuters Top News (@Reuters) April 15, 2019 Canedy deviated from the usual plan in order to honor another newsroom: the journalists at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md., who saw five of their colleagues killed in a gunman's attack on their office last year. The paper earned a special citation for their ""courageous response"" to the horrific assault, and ""for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief.""
Along with the citation comes a $100,000 bequest, intended to ""further the newspaper's journalistic mission.""
The Two-Way See Last Year's Pulitzer Winners, Including Kendrick Lamar Not all of the afternoon's remarks centered on such violence, however. Journalists at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal won prizes for their work reporting on President Trump, and the staff of The Advocate in Baton Rouge, La., earned recognition for its ""damning portrayal of the state's discriminatory conviction system.""
For all the focus on journalism, about a third of the prizes doled out Monday went to scholars, artists and authors — including Richard Powers, whose novel The Overstory earned the prolific writer a Pulitzer to go along with the 2006 National Book Award already on his mantel.
The board added a second special citation, as well — this one posthumously awarded to Aretha Frankin ""for her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades.""
This year's winners beat out a vast field of entries, which often number more than 2,500 each year, according to prize administrators . It takes more than 100 judges to shave that snowdrift of submissions down to something manageable for the board, which typically then picks the final winners by majority vote.

Mortgage Secrets That Will Save You Money : NPR,www.npr.org,sports.yahoo.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711941375/mortgage-secrets-that-will-save-you-money,"Enlarge this image Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images It's hard to imagine a more boring (and dreaded) word than ""mortgage."" But if you know where to look, you might find a mortgage that will save you thousands of dollars a year or discover that you qualify for a loan when you didn't think you could — and that's exciting. You might even find free money to help with a down payment.
Here are a few ways to get started:
1. Don't just wander into your bank to get a mortgage. Shop around at all kinds of lenders — especially if you're a first-time homebuyer.
Deitra Douglas bought a home in Charlotte, N.C., last year — but only because of a loan program that most people don't even know exists. Though she had a good job, Douglas had been through a divorce and had run up credit card debt, hurting her credit score. Her bank told her she didn't qualify for a mortgage.
How To Buy A House How To Buy A House, In 7 Steps A friend told her about a nonprofit homeownership organization called the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America . Under NACA's mortgage program, Douglas took a homebuyer class, demonstrated over time that she was saving money and paid off $11,000 of credit card debt. That qualified her for a mortgage with a low down payment and no closing costs or fees.
NACA founder Bruce Marks calls the program character-based lending that looks at individual circumstances that people can control, like paying rent and bills on time. ""It's going back to the old way of doing lending,"" he says. ""She could afford the payment.""
Even if you aren't in the same situation as Douglas, shopping around beyond mainstream banks can find you a better deal.
2. Find out if you qualify for a grant to help with a down payment.
If you are a first-time homebuyer — or haven't owned a home for at least a few years — you might qualify for a government grant for what's called down payment assistance, which can mean borrowing less on your mortgage.
Marks says to check with your state's housing finance agency and ask about assistance programs.
How To Buy A House Rent Or Buy? 6 Ways To Consider​ The Pros And Cons ""There's a lot of grant money around for down payment and closing costs,"" Marks says. ""You can get up to $20,000 to $25,000 in Boston and up to $20,000 in California. They're doing $40,000, $50,000 and sometimes more.""
3. Get preapproved for a mortgage before you start shopping for a house.
Preapproval will tell you how much a lender is willing to lend you and forces real estate agents to take you seriously.
4. If you can afford it, get a 15-year mortgage. You will build wealth much more quickly than with a 30-year mortgage.

Check out the charts. After 10 years of paying for your house, you could have $121,000 worth of ownership built up — or you could have only $42,000, a huge difference.
A 15-year mortgage also means paying less in interest — $50,000 as opposed to $74,000 — over those 10 years. That means each dollar you pay on the 15-year mortgage is doing about three times more work for your wealth.
5. Remember that adjustable-rate loans are risky.
Payments on an adjustable-rate loan may start out small but will fluctuate with the market and could cost much more in the long run than a fixed-rate loan. Think of a fixed-rate loan as a reliable car that will get you where you're going. An adjustable is more like a used car — cheaper, but breakdowns will cost you more money and worry in the long run.
6. Shop around to see if you can avoid paying for private mortgage insurance, or PMI.
Mortgage insurance protects the bank in case the buyer can't pay the mortgage and the bank has to foreclose on the home, and it's often required for buyers who make less than a 20 percent down payment on their home. It can add hundreds to your monthly payments.
Get Out Of Debt Crush Debt Fast (While Staying Motivated) If a lender says it has to charge you PMI, you might be able to find a credit union or other lender that will offer the same loan but not charge the mortgage insurance. For example, NACA doesn't charge mortgage insurance. Marks also suggests something called wealth-builder loans, which have a 15- or 20-year term and don't charge insurance.
""The best mortgage that you've never heard of is the wealth-builder 15-year mortgage,"" Marks says. ""If you can afford the payments, you need to do that. Build equity really quickly.""
7. Don't let the dreaded HELOC monster — home equity line of credit — eat your home equity.
A HELOC is a second loan that uses your home as collateral, once you've built up equity in the house. Many people use HELOCs to finance home repairs or improvements. But too many people use them as piggy banks to pay off credit cards or buy a car, putting their home equity at risk."

Mark Rogers Photography As they have with so many other industries, apps are shaking up the weight loss business, including big-name companies like Nutrisystem and Weight Watchers. And it's basically because more consumers feel the way Jessica Holloway-Haytcher does.
A couple years ago, she tried diet shakes and supplements. She hated them. She also hired a former NFL player turned personal trainer — but his schedule never matched hers.
She spent $600 a month for programs that weren't sustainable. She says she couldn't keep up with the ""astronomical"" costs.
The Salt Resolved To Lose Weight? We Gave Food-Tracking Apps A Try Now Holloway-Haytcher uses an app called Noom. (Noom is an NPR sponsor.) She has shed over 30 pounds so far, by changing her habits. She now prepares healthy meals in the morning, so she's not ravenous at night; she focuses on conversation to slow her eating.
The app also helps her track meals, exercise and keep in touch with an online coach. It's always with her, and works with her busy schedule as the owner of a staffing firm in Kennewick, Wash. Sometimes, it even feels as though the app knows what she is thinking.
""It's kind of funny how I'll open the app one day, and it'll be exactly what I'm struggling with is what they're talking about,"" Holloway-Haytcher says. Like when she stopped losing weight, and got discouraged. ""They talked about how that can affect you and how to work through it and then how to work through the negative self-talk that you have,"" she says.
When it comes to weight loss, 80 percent of people try to do it on their own, says John LaRosa, president of Marketdata, which tracks the $4 billion commercial U.S. weight loss industry. (The overall market — including diet foods and soft drinks, health clubs, weight loss surgery and diet pharmaceuticals — totals about $72 billion .) He says apps like MyFitnessPal, Fitbit and Fooducate appeal to those consumers.
The Salt This Chef Lost 50 Pounds And Reversed Prediabetes With A Digital Program LaRosa says apps have a downside: Users often tire of them, just as they do gym memberships. But the apps are also cheaper than most commercial programs, and they appeal to the younger demographic that traditional chains have struggled to attract.
""The average age of a customer of Jenny Craig, or Nutrisystem or Weight Watchers is about 48, and it's probably going up,"" LaRosa says. ""It's going to be a shrinking market if they just cater to the baby boomers.""
That explains why Nutrisystem, which was acquired by Tivity Health last year, revamped its digital strategy. Tivity President Dawn Zier says that included advertising more on social media and redesigning its NuMi app.

Weight Watchers also overhauled its brand last year, changing its name to WW.
""Three years ago, millennials told us that this was my grandmother's brand,"" says Debra Benovitz, a senior vice president for WW.
The 56-year-old company shifted gears. It still champions support groups at its retail locations, a concept that made it and Jenny Craig popular in the 1980s. Having physical stores is still WW's biggest difference from upstarts that are exclusively digital.

"Biographer Robert Caro On Fame, Power And 'Working' To Uncover The Truth",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713413916/biographer-robert-caro-on-fame-power-and-working-to-uncover-the-truth,"Biographer Robert Caro On Fame, Power And 'Working' To Uncover The Truth Biographer Robert Caro On Fame, Power And 'Working' To Uncover The Truth Embed Embed Independent Booksellers
Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Robert Caro has spent decades researching and chronicling the lives of notable men.
His biographies have focused on former President Lyndon B. Johnson ( The Path to Power ) and famed New York City planner Robert Moses ( The Power Broker ). Still, he says, ""I never had the slightest interest in writing a book just to tell the story of a great man.""
Instead, Caro is interested in power: ""I wanted to use [Johnson's and Moses'] lives to show how political power worked; that's what I was interested in.""
Caro points out that though Moses was never elected to anything, he's credited with developing many of New York City's highways, bridges and public housing units.
""He had more power than any mayor, more power than any governor, and more power than any mayor or governor combined,"" Caro says of Moses.
But uncovering the mechanisms of power can be difficult. Caro says his subjects sometimes didn't welcome his attention. Other times, he had to dig up long-buried facts or discern unseen motives during interviews. Caro writes about his process as a biographer in the new book, Working . Interview Highlights In 'Working,' Writer Robert Caro Explains His Process — And What Drives Him
On the difficulty of getting sources to talk on the record about Robert Moses
Over 40 years, numerous biographers, some of them quite famous, had tried to do, started to do a biography on him. And I suppose he told them the same thing he told me: I was told it by two public relations men who took me out to lunch and informed me across the table that he would never talk to me; his family and friends would never talk to me. And then they had a phrase — I forget the exact phrase — but the import was ""no one who ever wants a contract from state or city will ever talk to you.""
But I started interviewing anyway. So I drew a series of concentric circles on a piece of paper. In the center I put a dot. That was Robert Moses. The inner circle was his family and closest friends. The next circle was close friends but not quite as close. I figured he could keep those people in the first couple of circles from talking to me, but out in the outer circles are all the other people that he dealt with. He couldn't think of them all.
And I started interviewing them and I don't know that this is true, since it's complimentary to me, but his closest associate his chief subordinate a guy named Sid Shapiro, once said to me that [Moses] realized that someone was finally going to do a biography of him whether we wanted it or not. And after two years his daughter suddenly calls me out of nowhere. She calls him Poppa Bear, and she said, ""Poppa Bear will see you."" So I went to have my first interview with Robert Moses. Robert Caro talks about his Pulitzer Prize winning book ""The Power Broker: Robert Moses and th... Robert Caro talks about his Pulitzer Prize winning book ""The Power Broker: Robert Moses and th... Embed Embed < iframe src=""https://www.npr.org/player/embed/1109995/109995"" width=""100%"" height=""290"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" title=""NPR embedded audio player"">
On interviewing Moses and challenging him
There came a point in the seventh interview where ... a lot of the things that he was telling me did not comport with the facts as I was learning them from the papers of the governors and mayors that he remembered that he served with. As soon as I started asking him questions, I saw his eyes change, and shortly thereafter he said, ""Well, that's enough for today,"" and I never got to see him again. Every time after that that I called, the secretary said he was busy.
On how Moses bent people to his will
Moses, when someone opposed him, a public official, he put what he called his ""team of bloodhounds,"" that's his investigators, onto this person. If they found anything about the person that was derogatory, he basically would say, ""I'm going to leak it to the newspapers unless you go along."" So I was examining a very mysterious thing that happened in Moses' career. He wanted to run this road — the Cross Bronx Expressway — right across the heart of the Bronx, displacing thousands of people when there was an alternate route just two blocks away that displaced almost no one. And every elected official was against him.
But all of a sudden, the key official, a lawyer for the council to Mayor [Robert] Wagner changed his mind, and wrote a letter saying Moses' route was good. So when I was talking to Moses I said, ""What did you do to Henry Epstein?"" And he said something like, ""Oh we hit him with an ax."" I said, ""What do you mean?"" And he said in their investigation they had found that he had a girlfriend. He was a married man but he had a longtime girlfriend. He said, ""I said to Henry, you and this chum of yours. And Henry said, ""She's not my chum."" And Moses said, ""Oh yes, Henry, she's your chum all right."" So Moses said to me... ""So Henry wrote his letter.""
On how he got Lyndon Johnson's brother Sam to tell the truth about his brother's childhood In 'Passage,' Caro Mines LBJ's Changing Political Roles
I had been interviewing his brother Sam Houston Johnson and ... there was a lot of braggadocio and bravado and basically untruthfulness in his stories. I had gotten disgusted with interviewing him and I decided I'm not going to use anything he told me and I'm not going to spend any more time on this. So I'm working with other people.
Now, all of a sudden I hear he's had this terrible operation for cancer and he stopped drinking ... and I took him for a cup of coffee in the cafe there and the guy sitting next to me all of a sudden was a quiet, introspective guy. I decided to try to interview him again. By this time, I knew the key to Lyndon Johnson's youth was this childhood conflict with his father. So I thought of a way to make him remember more accurately what had happened.
I got the National Park Service to agree that I could take him in to the Johnson boyhood home after the tourists were gone. We went in and I sat him down at the dining room table ... I didn't sit at the table. I didn't want anything in his sight that wouldn't remind of his boyhood. So I sat behind him and I said, ""Repeat those dinner time conversations with your father.""
He started yelling back and forth. ""Lyndon, you're a failure! You'll always be a failure!"" ""Well, what are you dad? You're bus inspector. That's what you are."" And he was shouting back and forth. ... I said, ""Now Sam Houston, I want you to tell me again all those wonderful anecdotes, those wonderful stories that you and everyone else told about your brother for all these years, only just give me some more details."" ... And then he started without any other prompting to give a completely different picture of Lyndon Johnson's youth.
On why he writes his books longhand
It's because of something that was said to me at Princeton by a professor, a very courtly gentleman, Southern gentleman, who was my creative writing teacher. Every two weeks we'd hand in a short story. I was in his course for two years. For two years he gave me high marks, but I always did these short stories at the last minute. ... I would always start at the last minute and just type, because I could write very fast.
At our last session, he hands back my short story ... and he compliments me, and as I'm getting up to go he says, ""But you know, Mr. Caro, you will never achieve what you want to achieve unless you stop thinking with your fingers."" ...
Did you ever realize that someone is seeing right through you? I realized he had seen right through me all along. He knew that I wasn't putting any thought into these. I was just writing, because writing was so easy for me. So when I was a newspaper man, I was a really fast rewrite man. But when I quit to do a book, and I began to realize how complex the story of Robert Moses was; I said I must make myself think things all the way through, and the slowest way of committing your thoughts to paper is by writing in hand. So I write three or four or more — sometimes I write a lot of drafts in hand. Then I go to my typewriter and that's how I write.

Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images A nurse prepares the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine at the Rockland County Health Department in Haverstraw, N.Y. Several measles outbreaks in New York state are contributing to this year's unusually high measles rates.
Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Measles is surging. Last week the U.S. recorded 90 cases, making this year's outbreak the second largest in more than two decades.
So far this year, the U.S. has confirmed 555 measles cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday. That's 50 percent higher than the total number recorded last year, even though we're only about a quarter of the way through 2019.
And the virus isn't slowing down.
""The number of cases is accelerating,"" says Dr. Amanda Cohn, a senior adviser for vaccines at the CDC. ""We are on track to have one of the highest numbers of cases of measles reported since we eliminated the disease in the year 2000.""
The majority of the cases are connected to outbreaks in New York, Cohn says.
""This is a very significant outbreak,"" she says. ""These cases were imported from other countries, but because of low vaccination coverage in these communities, measles is spreading widely throughout these communities.""

Last week, New York City declared a public health emergency in an ultra-Orthodox community in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. The city's Health Department is mandating that parents vaccinate their children, or they may face a $1,000 fine.
The CDC pointed to four other places with ongoing outbreaks in the U.S.: Clark County, Wash. ; Oakland County, Mich.; two counties in New Jersey ; and a handful of counties across California .
Health officials say there are two main reasons for the virus's surge: more international travel and lower vaccination rates.
Several countries around the world are currently experiencing massive measles outbreaks. Madagascar has recorded more than 100,000 cases since the fall, with more than 1,200 deaths. Ukraine has recorded about 37,000 cases this year. And the European Union is tallying about 1,000 cases a month.
Globally, the World Health Organization reports that measles cases in the first quarter of 2019 nearly quadrupled compared with what was reported at this time last year.
More American families are bringing measles home with them after traveling abroad, Cohn says. And once the disease lands stateside, it has a better chance of gaining a foothold because vaccination rates in some places have dropped below 93 to 95 percent, the threshold required to protect the entire community.
""When you make the decision not to vaccinate your child, please understand you're also making that decision for the people around your child,"" New York City's deputy mayor of health and human services, Herminia Palacio, told NPR on Wednesday .
Measles can be an extremely serious disease. About 25 percent of infected children are hospitalized. About 10 percent of children develop ear infections, which can cause permanent hearing damage. In about 1 in 1,000 cases, the infection becomes life-threatening. In these cases, the virus moves to the brain, causing encephalitis and convulsions. Children can be left deaf, blind or with intellectual disabilities — if they recover.
Before the development of the measles vaccine in the 1960s, the U.S. recorded nearly a half-million cases each year , the CDC says. About 48,000 kids were hospitalized and about 500 people died per year.
""We eliminated measles from this country in 2000, and ... I think we eliminated the memory of that virus,"" Dr. Paul Offit of Children's told NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday . ""People don't remember how sick it could make you."""

Group chemistry and deft composing make Harrell's new album a polished, inventive album that's worth checking out. Critic Kevin Whitehead says it's ""really, really good.""
DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. Jazz trumpet player Tom Harrell played with bandleader Horace Silver in the 1970s and started recording under his own name in the '80s. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead says ever since, Harrell has shown himself to be a thinking person's jazz soloist - thoughtful and introspective. Kevin says Harrell writes music to match and picks the right musicians as well.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""DUBLIN"")
KEVIN WHITEHEAD, BYLINE: ""Dublin"" by trumpet player Tom Harrell - for decades, he's been making first-rate records and acquiring high-profile admirers without quite becoming a household name. Harrell occupies his own corner of the jazz scene. He likes to record his own compositions and generally takes a thoughtful and even reserved approach. But he's a swinger, too, and his best pieces have compulsive drive. The highlight of his new quintet album, ""Infinity,"" is his tune ""Ground."" Its infectious, doubled-up shuffle beat sends the trumpeter to his happy place.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""GROUND"")
WHITEHEAD: A buoyant rhythm section always helps - in this case, Ben Street on bass, Johnathan Blake on drums and Charles Altura doing a little light overdubbing on guitars. Not having a piano opens up the texture. Leader Tom Harrell is partial to understatement in the great tradition of un-shouty jazz horn players. Any trumpeter using Harmon mute to get a plaintive sound will remind some listeners of Miles Davis. Tom Harrell is his own man, but he may make that connection himself. His solo on ""Hope"" recalls Miles' economy and dry wit.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""HOPE"")
WHITEHEAD: The trumpeter's partner in the front line is tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, a thinking horn player himself. There's good give and take between them when they solo back to back. These players are thoughtful, but that doesn't mean they can't turn up the heat, especially with that rhythm section pushing.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""CORONATION"")
WHITEHEAD: Tom Harrell has been crossing paths with and hiring most of these younger musicians for a decade. So even though this lineup and much of the music is newish, the performances have a lived-in feel. That comfort level among the players lets them be their best. Group chemistry and deft composing make ""Infinity"" one more polished, inventive, easy-on-the-ears Tom Harrell album to check out - jazz in the modern mainstream that's really, really good.
(SOUNDBITE OF TOM HARRELL'S ""THE ISLE"")
DAVIES: Kevin Whitehead writes for Point of Departure and The Audio Beat. He reviewed ""Infinity,"" the new CD by jazz trumpeter Tom Harrell.
On tomorrow's show - fear and hope about climate change. Bill McKibben, who first warned of climate change 30 years ago, says its effects are now upon us with heatwaves, fires, flooding, drought and, soon, millions of climate refugees. He also warns of the dangers of human genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. McKibben's new book is called ""Falter"" - hope you can join us.

The Trump administration's revisions to the Waters of the U.S. rule will strip federal water protections from millions of miles of rivers. The impact will be even more pronounced in the arid Southwest.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
The Trump administration is moving forward with a proposal that would redefine which waterways in America get federal protection. Many industry groups felt that the previous definition was too broad. NPR's Nathan Rott went to New Mexico, a state that's bracing for significant change. He sent this report.
NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: For most of you river-goers out there, the Santa Fe...
(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)
ROTT: ...Would not be much to look at or play in. You'd be lucky if you could float a soda can down it. Though looking at its brush-tangled banks in downtown Santa Fe, it looks like a few people have tried. Its springtime runoff is more trickle than torrent. But to folks like Rachel Conn, this is impressive.
RACHEL CONN: This is, like, flow in New Mexico. This is - a lot of creatures depend on something like this.
ROTT: Conn is with Amigos Bravos, New Mexico-based conservation group that focuses on water issues.
CONN: Up to 94 percent of our waters are these smaller types of waters that flow only part of the year. But they all drain into our bigger systems. And it is from these bigger systems that close to 300,000 New Mexicans receive their drinking water.
ROTT: And it's these types of smaller rivers and streams that may soon lose federal protections. The Trump administration's new proposed definition of which waters should fall under the Clean Water Act does not include ephemeral or intermittent streams - waterways that only flow after precipitation like the Santa Fe, or, say, every other year, which isn't all that uncommon in the arid Southwest. That means industry or landowners looking to discharge wastewater into one of those or dam one of those streams would no longer need a federal permit to do so.
HELEN NEVILLE: So it's millions of miles of stream.
ROTT: Helen Neville is the senior scientist for the conservation and sportsmen's group Trout Unlimited, an organization that opposes the new rule. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that about 18 percent of streams nationwide and half of the country's wetlands would no longer be considered waters of the United States under the president's proposal. Trout Unlimited believes it's far more because ephemeral streams are so hard to map and so easily overlooked.
NEVILLE: You know, it's very similar to how you think about your capillaries feeding your blood vessels.
ROTT: Ephemeral streams may seem insignificant.
NEVILLE: But they're critically important for the health of those downstream waters just like your capillaries are critically important for the health of your blood system.
ROTT: And she says that's especially true in the southwest, where rains can be few and far between. Even the Rio Grande, New Mexico's biggest river, ran dry in parts last year. Chad Smith, CEO of the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, is less worried about the impact on the state's waterways and doesn't believe that it will lead to a surge in pollution from industries like his, something environmental groups have warned about.
CHAD SMITH: We want to make sure our waterways are clean. We want to make sure we protect our natural resources that we make a living off of.
ROTT: He says industry groups around the country are applauding the proposed change.
SMITH: It couldn't be more welcomed. I think what it does from a very high-level perspective is it provides some more clarity and certainty for farmers and ranchers across the landscape.
ROTT: Clarity and certainty are the reasons the Trump administration is giving, too. The EPA says they want to make it clear for landowners and developers whether federal laws apply to a project or not. Conflicting court decisions have made that muddy in the past. And it's likely that courts will get another say about this change. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Santa Fe, N.M. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Yahoo sports columnist Dan Wetzel about Tiger Woods' comeback as a person and player, following his fifth Masters win on Sunday.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Just two years ago around this time, Tiger Woods was ranked the 780th best golfer in the world a far cry from where he stood during the late 90s and mid 2000s when he was considered one of the best golfers of all time. After dealing with both personal and medical problems for years, it was uncertain whether Woods would ever get back to the top of the sport. Well, that all changed yesterday when Tiger Woods won the Masters Tournament, his first major championship since 2008.
And now President Trump has announced that he will be presenting Tiger Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, quote, because of his ""incredible success and comeback in sports - golf - and, more importantly, life.""
Here to help us wrap all of this up is Dan Wetzel of Yahoo Sports. Welcome.
DAN WETZEL: Thanks for having me on.
CHANG: So would you rate Tiger's win on Sunday as one of the biggest comebacks you have ever seen in all of sports?
WETZEL: Absolutely because this looked like a guy spiraling completely out of control in every aspect. He's turned his life around. He's not only succeeding on the golf course, he seemed to be extremely healthy in all ways and maintains a terrific relationship with his children. He always wanted to be a terrific father, and you saw that, too, on Sunday.
CHANG: Speaking of that, you wrote a really moving piece about how special yesterday's victory was, in part because of who was waiting for him at the very end. Can you take us back to that moment?
WETZEL: So when he first won in 1997 at the Masters at Augusta National, his father was waiting for him right off of the 18th green. And Tiger was 21 years old at that point. And it was really a culmination of a journey between a father and a son in shocking the world and becoming the youngest Masters champion of all time and the first African-American champion.
CHANG: Yeah.
WETZEL: It was a pioneering moment. Twenty-two years later, his father has passed away. But Tiger returns, wins even with more acclaim after all this tumult. And who's waiting in the exact same spot where his dad was but his old 10-year-old son Charlie, his daughter Sam, his mom and stuff like that. But it was really Charlie who ran into him. And in the exact same spot...
CHANG: Wow.
WETZEL: ...He's now bear-hugging his 10-year-old son where he once bear-hugged his father. And even Tiger is not the most sentimental. But I guess as you get older, you become that.
CHANG: (Laughter).
WETZEL: And his dad got them there by teaching him how to play golf, how to be competitive, how to kick down doors. Charlie and Samantha (ph), his kids, taught him how to keep trying because they - he said they have the infectious happiness of a child. In their own way, they helped him get there, too - just a really interesting situation, the Woods family.
CHANG: Yeah. I want to play you this clip from Brooks Koepka. He finished second after Tiger yesterday. Here's what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BROOKS KOEPKA: It's probably one of the coolest things to be a part of it. Even though I - you know, you finish second place. You know, you're a little bummed out. But it's - I wouldn't want it any other way. You want to go toe-to-toe with him. And I can leave saying I gave it my all. And he's a good, man.
CHANG: I mean, Koepka is a guy who grew up as a little kid watching Tiger dominate in those early years. Right?
WETZEL: Most of the guys Tiger Woods beat yesterday are playing golf because of Tiger Woods, they will tell you. They were 8 and 10 and 12 years old and said, I want to play like him and were drawn to that sport. Almost all the golfers who lost the tournament stuck around and waited when Tiger was going to win it. Usually, those guys are defeated, they're depressed, and they want to get out of there as fast as possible.
CHANG: (Laughter).
WETZEL: Guys that lost and others stayed, and they just wanted to be a part of it and see Tiger Woods win that. The amount of respect that says without saying a word is incredible. It's very, very rare.
CHANG: So when you were watching him play yesterday, did it feel like a different Tiger in the way he connected with people watching?
WETZEL: All weekend, he wore a smile - if nothing else - that you didn't always see when he was a little bit more intense and robotic and more of a fierce competitor early in his career. I think, over this, he's realized how many people really wanted him to succeed. Again, as we mentioned, he'd been in some dark places physically...
CHANG: Yeah.
WETZEL: ...And in his personal life. And then here's the support and everybody rooting him on. The crowd wanted him to win. He wanted to win. And it was like a journey he had to go with them together.
CHANG: Yahoo Sports writer Dan Wetzel, thanks so much for joining us today.

Could The Release Of The Mueller Report Change President Trump's Narrative?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616813/could-the-release-of-the-mueller-report-change-president-trumps-narrative,"NPR's Audie Cornish speaks with New Yorker staff writer Susan Glasser, about how President Trump has bounced back up in the polls since the release of the summary of the Mueller report.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
President Trump's take on all this - no collusion, no obstruction, complete and total exoneration. And we know all that because that's what the president tweeted shortly after Attorney General William Barr released his four-page summary of the Mueller report last month. So could the release of the report change the president's narrative, or how could it affect the political landscape in Washington? We're going to tackle some of these questions with Susan Glasser. She writes the Letter From Washington column for The New Yorker. Welcome to the studio.
SUSAN GLASSER: Thank you so much.
CORNISH: So as we just heard Carrie say, there is a lot of nuance that could be revealed in the report, right? For example, the reason why Robert Mueller decided not to charge the president with obstruction of justice because of - was it because of Justice Department policy or was it because he truly did not obstruct justice? But have perceptions been set already?
GLASSER: Well, that's right. There's obviously not a lot of nuance that can be conveyed in either a four-page letter or a 140-character tweet. And President Trump has been very clear in trying to establish a political narrative around what the attorney general has characterized as the findings in the report. So the question is, is there anything that's going to change, essentially, the political point of view surrounding this report that we're going to learn? Or, essentially, has the news cycle moved on?
Remember, President Trump has had such a consistent approval and disapproval rating. Basically, people's minds are made up about the president. And so I think, from the point of view of Washington and politics, one big question - is there anything in this report - any fact, any conclusion, any information - that offers the possibility of changing the minds of the very few people whose minds are still available to be changed about the president?
CORNISH: Right. I mean, did poll numbers tell us anything even when the summary first came out? We've had, you know, some time since then.
GLASSER: Well, that's right. I mean, look. Consistently, surveys have shown that people in both parties want the report released. It took a little bit of time, but you have seen Republicans migrating around to the narrative that the president has offered for them that, in fact, this report does offer exoneration and vindication. But interestingly, the president himself appears to be somewhat more nervous and concerned about what is actually in this report than he was initially.
Remember, there was this sort of jubilance. The president was in Florida at his golf club when the initial reports about the report came out. And he exclaimed with what clearly was a great relief that he was off scot-free. There was no collusion. Now he's back to criticizing - just this morning, again in a tweet - the Mueller team, who has written this report, as if they were partisan, angry Democrats. And you hear increasing calls on the Republican side that they should investigate the investigators.
CORNISH: Right. This is questions about whether or not the investigators surveilled the Trump campaign, whether they overstepped in doing so. In the time we have left, what does this mean for Democrats?
GLASSER: Well, there was already a very, very robust debate that's only likely to grow about 2020 and how best to confront and to run against Donald Trump. Is it about his character? Is it about his conduct while in office? Is it about questions that may be raised in the Mueller report and other investigations? Or should Democrats really pursue a conversation and offering the American people their substantive, policy-oriented agenda? And I think this will help to answer some of that debate a little bit, what we find out this week.
CORNISH: That's Susan Glasser, staff writer at The New Yorker. Thank you for speaking with us.
GLASSER: Thank you.

Justice Department To Release Redacted Version Of Mueller Report On Thursday,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616806/justice-department-to-release-redacted-version-of-mueller-report-on-thursday,"Justice Department To Release Redacted Version Of Mueller Report On Thursday Justice Department To Release Redacted Version Of Mueller Report On Thursday Embed Embed
The Justice Department says it will release a redacted version of the Mueller report on Thursday. The release should shed light on many open questions surrounding the special counsel's investigation.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
And now to Washington, where the long wait to see the Mueller report is nearly over here. The Justice Department says it will release the special counsel report about Russian election interference this Thursday, but it's still unclear how much of the document people will get to see. NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this story, and she joins us now. Hey, Carrie.
CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.
CHANG: So can you just take us back for a moment? What do we know about this report and what it will look like when it gets released?
JOHNSON: Remember that special counsel Robert Mueller delivered this report to Justice Department leaders on March 22 - quite a while ago.
CHANG: Right. Yeah.
JOHNSON: It's long. It's about 400 pages, and it's separated into sections that cover things like obstruction of justice and conspiracy, also known as collusion in this White House. The report covers the analysis as well as the conclusions the special counsel reached. Now, a lot of work went into this investigation - nearly two years, 500 search warrants, 2,800 subpoenas.
CHANG: Wow.
JOHNSON: But all people have seen is a four-page letter that the attorney general, Bill Barr, sent to Congress last month. Remember, in that letter, Barr says prosecutors did not have enough evidence to establish conspiracy charges against any Americans for conspiring with the Russian government. And Barr says he can determine that President Trump did not obstruct justice, so Trump won't face any criminal charges either.
CHANG: OK. But there's still a lot that we don't know. What are you personally going to be looking for when you get your hands on this report on Thursday?
JOHNSON: I'm curious about a lot of things. The first is the special counsel did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump should be charged with obstructing justice, but the special counsel also wrote he did not exonerate the president. Why not? Was that because the Justice Department guidance says a sitting president can't be charged with a crime while he's in office, or for some other reason?
Another thing I wonder about - what other evidence did investigators gather about obstruction? A lot was done in the open - the firing of former FBI Director Jim Comey, for instance. But what else did this team pry out of this White House?
And then on another front, conspiracy. Was the evidence just not strong enough on conspiracy because Trump campaign officials didn't know what they were doing? Were they being duped by the Russian government or Russian business leaders? Or are they more like what some former intelligence officers call useful idiots?
CHANG: Now, the attorney general told Congress last week that he would be redacting, or blacking out, parts of this report. That prompted a question from Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. Here's what he asked.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BRIAN SCHATZ: The basic question, I think, for the public is, are we going to get the gist of this, or is it going to be, you know, on January of 2015, and then you have to flip 15 pages to find the next text?
WILLIAM BARR: You will get more than the gist.
CHANG: OK, more than the gist, but how much more, Carrie? What do you think?
JOHNSON: What we know is the process has been happening in connection with members of the special counsel team as of last week. Barr told Congress he had not overruled that team on any redactions.
And we also know there are categories of material that are going to be hidden - things about ongoing investigations, since there are offshoots ongoing in D.C. and New York and Virginia that are still active. Classified material's not going to be in there. Grand jury material is unlikely to be in there. And also unlikely to be in there - sensitive information that could hurt the privacy of third parties who were not charged.
Now, the attorney general says that category will not apply to the president, but what about Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump or the son-in-law, Jared Kushner? We just don't know yet.
CHANG: So many questions still left to be answered. NPR justice correspondent, Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie.

Tragedy And Fire Strike Notre Dame Cathedral In Paris,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616795/tragedy-and-fire-strike-notre-dame-cathedral-in-paris,"NPR's Audie Cornish speaks with Time Magazine correspondent Vivienne Walt about the Notre Dame Cathedral fire. She says this fire was a disaster waiting to happen due to lack of funds to protect it.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris went up in flames today. The spire of this historic building has collapsed. But a Paris fire official says the main structure of the cathedral has been saved and preserved. For now, though, firefighters are still on the scene. Vivienne Walt is a correspondent for Time magazine based in Paris, and she joins us now. Welcome.
VIVIENNE WALT: Thank you.
CHANG: So I understand you could see the fire from your balcony. What did it look like from where you were standing earlier today?
WALT: Well, I mean, you could certainly see smoke rising. And the air was pretty thick with smoke. You could smell it for several hours. It's abated a bit now. But I have to say, you know, this city has been through some pretty high drama in the last couple of years. And every time the sirens start screaming through the streets, there's a kind of tension that descends on the city. And, you know, people immediately start gathering and trying to see what's going on. So outside the cathedral you had hundreds and hundreds of people who have been out for hours now, singing, just standing there silently, just gathering. Notre Dame is a place of gathering.
CHANG: Yeah.
WALT: It's really - it's really unlike any other church in the city and, you know, very, very few in Europe. It's not simply a church. It's almost like stepping into a kind of medieval marketplace inside. It's enormous. It's - there's always a hurly burly. And there's always a - you know, numerous things going on in there.
CHANG: Well, now, we were seeing reports that officials are saying the fire might be connected to the renovation work going on in there. You've reported on the renovations for Time. What kind of shape was the cathedral in before this fire?
WALT: Well, you know, for years they have been saying that the church was in terrible shape. And in fact, church officials had taken me up onto the roof not that long ago, when I was reporting this for Time, to show me how pieces of the building were simply dropping off. They described the gargoyles, the medieval faces on the side of the church, as being like ice cream melting in the sun. They would simply, like, drop away. The church had no money to replace them or restore them. And so they were using, like, PVC pipes to just, you know, stick on the side of the walls where the gargoyles had been. And...
CHANG: Oh, my goodness, wow. I mean, Notre Dame is one of the most iconic symbols of Paris. Can you talk about the cultural significance of this cathedral for France?
WALT: Well, this is where it all began. This was the beginning point of Paris. Everything, all distances in the whole of France, in fact, are measured by the distance to Notre Dame Cathedral. It was the kind of ground zero, if you like, of the city and of this country. And it has remained - even though France is a strictly secular country now, it has remained a very, very symbolic heart of the country that I think will - this will really have quite a deep impact on people.
CHANG: Yeah. Vivienne Walt from Time magazine, thank you very much for joining us tonight.
WALT: You're welcome.

toggle caption Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Tiger Woods celebrates after making his putt on the 18th green to win the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club on Sunday in Augusta, Georgia.
Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Tiger Woods' historic comeback victory Sunday at the The Masters Tournament shows the enduring star — and earning — power of a player once dropped by many sponsors because of his problems on and off the golf course.
""It's crazy to think a 43-year-old who has experienced every high and every low and has just won his 15 th major .... is chasing the same dream as a 3-year-old,"" a new Nike ad says .
President Trump announced Monday that he will award Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, ""because of his incredible Success & Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more importantly, LIFE.""
At 43, Woods is the second-oldest winner of the Masters. In 1986 Jack Nicklaus won The Masters for a sixth time when he was 46.
And after Woods' momentous victory Sunday, multiple sponsors are celebrating his resilience. At the end of the Nike ad, a very young Woods is seen on camera saying: ""I'm going to beat Jack Nicklaus.""
Woods now has 15 major wins, compared to 18 for Nicklaus. ""I felt for a long time that he was going to win again. ... He's got me shaking in my boots, guys,"" Nicklaus told the Golf Channel after Tiger's victory.
TaylorMade, a golf club manufacturer and another sponsor of Woods, is promoting the hashtag ""#NeverDone"" – a reference to the player's longevity.
Tiger last won the Masters Tournament in 2005 – the longest period ever between wins in that tournament. Since then, he's gone through a high-profile sex scandal and major injuries.
Roaring back. #themasters pic.twitter.com/nlTwxWJW8X
— Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 14, 2019 ""I had serious doubts after what transpired a few years ago. I couldn't walk, I couldn't sit, I couldn't lay down, I really couldn't do much of anything,"" he told reporters. ""Luckily I had the procedure on my back, which gave me a chance at having a normal life. ... The body's not the same as it was a long time ago, but I still have good hands.""
According to Forbes , in 2009 he brought in $105 in endorsements and appearance fees, compared to $37 million in 2017. As Bloomberg noted , many top sponsors such as AT&T, Accenture, Gillette, Gatorade ended their relationships with him following the scandals. TaylorMade is a newer sponsor, as is golf ball manufacturer Bridgestone Golf and drink company Monster Energy.
But Nike, which has been a sponsor since 1996, has stuck by him. And that has turned out to be lucrative.
According to sponsorship analytics firm Apex Marketing Group, the brand exposure that Nike got from Woods during the final round of this tournament was worth more than $22.5 million. They calculated that branding on his bag from Monster Energy and on his golf balls from Bridgestone Golf was also worth more than $1 million total.
The amount of exposure that Woods produced for Nike in the final round is nearly double the $12 million that Apex estimates Nike gained last year from Masters winner Patrick Reed.
That's largely due to the intense focus the TV broadcast placed on Woods, said Apex president Eric Smallwood. ""Pretty much every hole, every time he hit the ball, they were showing him ... or the Nike logo,"" he told NPR.
Nike has drawn down its relationship with Woods over the years – now concentrating on his apparel rather than balls or clubs.
But Smallwood doesn't see the company ever dropping him. ""I think Nike will stick with him until he stops playing golf, in some capacity. I don't foresee that ever going away,"" he says.
From a branding perspective, he says, Woods' story has obvious appeal. ""This is coming back from not even playing and winning the Masters. It's got a lot of good story lines to it,"" he says, that brands would want to hold onto.

Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Tiger Woods' historic comeback victory Sunday at the The Masters Tournament shows the enduring star — and earning — power of a player once dropped by many sponsors because of his problems on and off the golf course.
""It's crazy to think a 43-year-old who has experienced every high and every low and has just won his 15 th major .... is chasing the same dream as a 3-year-old,"" a new Nike ad says .
President Trump announced Monday that he will award Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, ""because of his incredible Success & Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more importantly, LIFE.""
At 43, Woods is the second-oldest winner of the Masters. In 1986 Jack Nicklaus won The Masters for a sixth time when he was 46.
And after Woods' momentous victory Sunday, multiple sponsors are celebrating his resilience. At the end of the Nike ad, a very young Woods is seen on camera saying: ""I'm going to beat Jack Nicklaus.""
Woods now has 15 major wins, compared to 18 for Nicklaus. ""I felt for a long time that he was going to win again. ... He's got me shaking in my boots, guys,"" Nicklaus told the Golf Channel after Tiger's victory.
TaylorMade, a golf club manufacturer and another sponsor of Woods, is promoting the hashtag ""#NeverDone"" – a reference to the player's longevity.
Tiger last won the Masters Tournament in 2005 – the longest period ever between wins in that tournament. Since then, he's gone through a high-profile sex scandal and major injuries.

— Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 14, 2019 ""I had serious doubts after what transpired a few years ago. I couldn't walk, I couldn't sit, I couldn't lay down, I really couldn't do much of anything,"" he told reporters. ""Luckily I had the procedure on my back, which gave me a chance at having a normal life. ... The body's not the same as it was a long time ago, but I still have good hands.""
According to Forbes , in 2009 he brought in $105 in endorsements and appearance fees, compared to $37 million in 2017. As Bloomberg noted , many top sponsors such as AT&T, Accenture, Gillette, Gatorade ended their relationships with him following the scandals. TaylorMade is a newer sponsor, as is golf ball manufacturer Bridgestone Golf and drink company Monster Energy.
But Nike, which has been a sponsor since 1996, has stuck by him. And that has turned out to be lucrative.
According to sponsorship analytics firm Apex Marketing Group, the brand exposure that Nike got from Woods during the final round of this tournament was worth more than $22.5 million. They calculated that branding on his bag from Monster Energy and on his golf balls from Bridgestone Golf was also worth more than $1 million total.
The amount of exposure that Woods produced for Nike in the final round is nearly double the $12 million that Apex estimates Nike gained last year from Masters winner Patrick Reed.
That's largely due to the intense focus the TV broadcast placed on Woods, said Apex president Eric Smallwood. ""Pretty much every hole, every time he hit the ball, they were showing him ... or the Nike logo,"" he told NPR.
Nike has drawn down its relationship with Woods over the years – now concentrating on his apparel rather than balls or clubs.
But Smallwood doesn't see the company ever dropping him. ""I think Nike will stick with him until he stops playing golf, in some capacity. I don't foresee that ever going away,"" he says.

Across the country, spring has sprung. But for millions of fans, winter is finally here. And a television phenomenon is almost over.
Eight years, tens of Emmy Awards , many millions of fans: by the numbers, ""Game of Thrones"" is a a massive hit.
The last season will resolve the fight for the Iron Throne and take a beloved series of novels farther than even its author imagined.
Here's how Vulture described the show's symbolism and resonance:
Game of Thrones may be the last show we all watch together the way we used to, on such a tremendous scale. Even if you don't watch it, you may feel as if you do. So many key incidents on the series — including the Red Wedding, Cersei's walk of shame, and the death and resurrection of Jon Snow — seeped into the surrounding culture and became synonymous with ""shocking plot twist"" (or ""obligatory plot twist"") even for people who'd never seen a frame of it. It's a lavishly produced, massively popular piece of entertainment that generates awareness far out or proportion to its legal viewership (between 12 million and 16 million people watch a first-run episode, according to HBO), dominating online TV conversation during consecutive weeks when it airs new installments.
The most important words in that last sentence are ""consecutive weeks"" and ""installments."" From the heyday of Charles Dickens, whose piecemeal novels were so popular that superfans used to wait at the docks for shipments of periodicals containing the latest installments, serialized storytelling has always known how to hook people's imaginations with the bait of ""What will happen next?""
As the final season begins, we're wondering about the future of appointment television. Is there any other show out there that has the same broad appeal? What does it mean that millions of people are so attached to this story?

Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, entered not guilty pleas Monday in federal court in Boston.
Both waived their right to appear in court for arraignment.
Federal prosecutors announced additional charges last week against Loughlin, Giannulli and 14 other wealthy parents. They face one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest-services mail and wire fraud, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Loughlin is best known for playing the role of Aunt Becky on Full House . Giannulli's Mossimo brand was a core clothing label at Target until 2017 . Lori Loughlin, 15 Others Indicted On New Charges In College Admissions Scandal
Giannulli and Loughlin are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes arranged by college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits for the crew team, despite neither of them being a rower.
According to the Justice Department's superseding indictment , Giannulli and Loughlin made payments in 2016 and 2017 to former USC Associate Athletic Director Donna Heinel and to Key Worldwide Foundation, which was operated by Singer.
The indictment paints a picture of how the Justice Department built its case:
""On or about November 29, 2018, Singer called Loughlin from Boston, Massachusetts. During the call, Singer said, in sum and substance, that [Key Worldwide Foundation] was being audited by the IRS, which was asking about the two payments of $200,000 by the Giannullis. Singer added: 'So I just want to make sure that you know that, one, that you're probably going to get a call and that I have not told them anything about the girls going through the side door, through crew, ever though they didn't do crew to get into USC. So I—that is—all I told them was that you guys made a donation to our foundation to help underserved kids.' Loughlin replied, 'Um-hmm.' "" Felicity Huffman And 12 Other Parents To Plead Guilty In College Cheating Scandal
The couple's older daughter, Olivia Jade Giannulli, is a beauty vlogger with nearly 2 million subscribers. Since her parents' arrest, she has lost deals with Sephora and TRESemmé.
Last week, other parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, announced that they would enter guilty pleas to a single charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest-services mail fraud. "
Empathy Might Not Be the Antidote To Poisonous Political Polarization : NPR,www.npr.org,sports.yahoo.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712249664/the-end-of-empathy?utm_source=webuproar,"The End Of Empathy Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email April 15, 2019 5:00 AM ET Hanna Rosin
Twitter Enlarge this image Christina Chung for NPR Christina Chung for NPR Militia leader Ammon Bundy, famous for leading an armed standoff in Oregon, had a tender moment in November of last year. He recorded a Facebook post saying that perhaps President Trump's characterization of the migrant caravan on the U.S.-Mexico border was somewhat broad. Maybe they weren't all criminals, he said. ""What about those who have come here for reasons of need?""
Bundy did not say he was breaking with Trump. He just asked his followers to put themselves in the shoes of ""the fathers, the mothers, the children"" who came to escape violence. It was a call for a truce grounded in empathy, the kind you might hear in a war zone, say, or an Easter Sunday sermon. Still, it was met with a swift and rageful response from his followers, so overwhelming that within days, Bundy decided to quit Facebook.
Civility Wars Keeping It Civil: How To Talk Politics Without Letting Things Turn Ugly In an earlier era, Bundy's appeal might have resonated. But he failed to tune in to a critical shift in American culture — one that a handful of researchers have been tracking, with some alarm, for the past decade or so. Americans these days seem to be losing their appetite for empathy, especially the walk-a-mile-in-someone's-shoes Easter Sunday morning kind.
When I was growing up in the '70s, empathy was all the rage. The term was coined in 1908; then, social scientists and psychologists started more aggressively pushing the concept into the culture after World War II, basically out of fear. The idea was that we were all going to kill each other with nuclear weapons — or learn to see the world through each other's eyes. In my elementary school in the 1970s, which was not progressive or mushy in any way, we wrote letters to pretend Russian pen pals to teach us to open our hearts to our enemies.
Shots - Health News Does Empathy Have A Dark Side? And not just enemies. Civil rights activists had also picked up on the idea. Kenneth Clark, a social scientist and civil rights activist, half-jokingly proposed that people in power all be required to take an ""empathy pill"" so they could make better decisions. His hope was that people with power and privilege would one day inhabit the realities of people without power, not from the safe, noblesse oblige distance of pity, but from the inside. An evolved person was an empathetic person, choosing understanding over fear.
Then, more than a decade ago, a certain suspicion of empathy started to creep in, particularly among young people. One of the first people to notice was Sara Konrath, an associate professor and researcher at Indiana University. Since the late 1960s, researchers have surveyed young people on their levels of empathy, testing their agreement with statements such as: ""It's not really my problem if others are in trouble and need help"" or ""Before criticizing somebody I try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place.""
Konrath collected decades of studies and noticed a very obvious pattern. Starting around 2000, the line starts to slide. More students say it's not their problem to help people in trouble, not their job to see the world from someone else's perspective. By 2009, on all the standard measures, Konrath found, young people on average measure 40 percent less empathetic than my own generation — 40 percent!
It's strange to think of empathy – a natural human impulse — as fluctuating in this way, moving up and down like consumer confidence. But that's what happened. Young people just started questioning what my elementary school teachers had taught me.
Their feeling was: Why should they put themselves in the shoes of someone who was not them, much less someone they thought was harmful? In fact, cutting someone off from empathy was the positive value, a way to make a stand.
So, for example, when the wife of white nationalist Richard Spencer recently told BuzzFeed he had abused her, the question debated on the lefty Internet was: Why should we care that some woman who chose to ally herself with a nasty racist got herself hurt? Why waste empathy on that? (Spencer, in a court filing, denies all her allegations .)
The new rule for empathy seems to be: reserve it, not for your ""enemies,"" but for the people you believe are hurt, or you have decided need it the most. Empathy, but just for your own team. And empathizing with the other team? That's practically a taboo.
And it turns out that this brand of selective empathy is a powerful force.
In the past 20 years, psychologists and neurologists have started to look at how empathy actually works, in our brains and our hearts, when we're not thinking about it. And one thing they've found is that ""one of the strongest triggers for human empathy is observing some kind of conflict between two other parties,"" says Fritz Breithaupt, a professor at Indiana University who studies empathy. ""Once they take the side, they're drawn into that perspective. And that can lead to very strong empathy and too strong polarization with something you only see this one side and not the other side any longer.""
A classic example is the Super Bowl, or any Auburn, Alabama game.

Rent Or Buy? 6 Ways To Look At A Big Decision,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711929383/rent-or-buy-6-ways-to-consider-the-pros-and-cons,"
""I'm still a big believer in homeownership — obviously, I've been a homeowner since my second year out of college,"" Singletary says. ""I just believe that you need to take it slow, understand what it means.""
3. Renting gives you flexibility.
Renters have one definite benefit over owners: It's a lot easier to pick up and move, whether to escape noisy neighbors or follow a job offer across the country.
Especially when you're younger, Dunn says, you may be happier having the flexibility to travel and teach English in Thailand and pursue other adventures like that, rather than spend money and time dealing with plumbing problems and leaky roofs. How To Buy A House, In 7 Steps
4. That flexibility comes with a cost: Rent will always go up.
Inflation alone pushes rents up over time — and if the neighborhood gets trendy, rents can go through the roof.
But if you own your home (and you have a fixed-rate mortgage), your monthly payment is a fixed cost. McCargo says that this offers peace of mind. And as inflation rises, living in your home gets effectively cheaper over time.
""Not to mention, every single month, you're paying something down every time you make that mortgage payment,"" says McCargo, thereby building your equity in your home and reducing your debt load.
5. You don't need a big down payment to own a home. New Homebuyers Face A Friendlier Housing Market, Thanks To Cooldown
Homeownership might have a lower price of entry than you think. A 20 percent down payment was once standard, but McCargo says the average today is 5 percent of the total. First-time buyers can find programs that offer mortgages with even lower down payments, and some cities offer grants to help with down payments to encourage people to invest in their communities. A good place to go to find out about such incentives is your state's housing finance agency.
6. Owning a home can give you a sense of security — and that can be priceless.
Singletary was surprised by the profound sense of both security and accomplishment she felt from buying her own place.
""I had been raised by my grandmother, and the circumstances in which I came to live with her were not great,"" she says. ""I was thinking, 'Wow, this is supercool — that this kid who was thrown away and almost ended up in foster care, here she is, at 22. I own my own home.' It was a great deal of satisfaction and pride that I had done this, against all odds."" Facebook "
President Trump Is Not Backing Down From Controversial Proposal On Sanctuary Cities : NPR,www.npr.org,Mara Liasson,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616850/president-trump-is-not-backing-down-from-controversial-proposal-on-sanctuary-cit,"President Trump Is Not Backing Down From Controversial Proposal On Sanctuary Cities President Trump Is Not Backing Down From Controversial Proposal On Sanctuary Cities Embed Embed
President Trump is leaning into a controversial proposal to send immigrants in the country illegally to so-called sanctuary cities. What is the political calculus behind such a move?
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
President Trump is leaning in on an idea that was initially dismissed by experts in his own administration. That idea is to transfer migrants detained at the border to so-called sanctuary cities. These are cities where local law enforcement limits its cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The idea has outraged Democrats. They say the president wants to use migrants as political pawns.
NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now from the White House to talk about all of this. Hey, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.
CHANG: So what's the latest from the president on this idea? I take it he is not backing down.
LIASSON: He's not backing down. He tweeted about it again today. He said that migrants in the country who can no longer be legally detained will be, quote, ""given to sanctuary cities and states."" Although he said that would be subject to the Department of Homeland Security, so we don't know if it's something that is actually doable right away. We know that the White House and the Department of Homeland Security is looking into whether it can be done financially and legally. And already Democrats in Congress are pushing back against this, saying they haven't appropriated any money to do this.
CHANG: Can we just talk about the politics of all this? Why might this actually be a good political maneuver on Trump's part?
LIASSON: Well, that's debated even inside Republican circles. Trump initially said this was a way to punish Democrats, to kind of own the libs - to say, oh, well, you don't like us holding these asylum-seekers. We'll just send them your way.
CHANG: Right.
LIASSON: But practically speaking, he isn't really owning the libs if mayors in those sanctuary cities say they're happy to take migrants. And the migrants themselves would be thrilled to be bussed free of charge to San Francisco instead of kept in a very chilly detention center on the border. But politically, this is a way for him to show that he's taking action, acting unilaterally - that's the way he likes to act - sticking it to his opponents. So in that sense, his base is likely to be supportive of this move. On the other hand, people who find every single thing that Donald Trump does horrifying - they probably won't like it at all. So it's the same old polarization.
CHANG: Right. Now, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told NPR over the weekend that this idea actually is not about punishing Democrats. Instead, it's about giving them an olive branch - an olive branch for what?
LIASSON: Well, that was kind of discordant messaging because Hogan Gidley is suggesting this is an olive branch to maybe convince Democrats that they should negotiate with Donald Trump, where Trump is off saying it's a way to punish liberals.
But the administration has been pretty clear the things they want to do to deal with the recent surge of immigrants in the border. Most of those things need Congress' approval to solve the problem. They would like Congress to make it easier to hold families together in detention. They would like to change a law that deals with unaccompanied minors. And they want to close something that they call the credible fear loophole. The administration feels it's too easy for asylum-seekers to come to the border and say they have a credible fear of being killed if they stayed in their home countries. And the administration wants to change the criteria for when a credible fear claim should be believed.
CHANG: Well, given how many challenges there are at managing the problems at the border, is there a risk for Democrats if they don't engage with the White House now to try to address the situation down there?
LIASSON: Potentially yes. You know, if the issue is framed in terms of border security, I think that's an advantage for the administration. If the debate is all about putting children in cages, using immigrants as political pawns, building a wall that's very unpopular, then Donald Trump is on the defensive.
But I do think that if Democrats were to say what they'd want to do at the border, they would probably say we need more judges. We need more detention facilities. We need to streamline the process. We need to send more money to Central America, money that the president has now taken away, to Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala to try to mitigate the forces in those countries that are causing people to flee. So you can imagine two sides coming together in a negotiation in an alternative universe...
CHANG: (Laughter).
LIASSON: ...But not the political universe that we have right now.
CHANG: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara.

Officials In Condemn Trump's To Move Immigrant Detainees,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616857/officials-in-sanctuary-cities-condemn-trumps-proposal-to-move-immigrant-detainee,"The president says he is considering sending detained immigrants in the country illegally to sanctuary cities. San Francisco is among the cities that have passed sanctuary city ordinances.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Officials in sanctuary cities are largely condemning President Trump's proposal to move immigrant detainees from the border to those cities. There are almost 200 sanctuary municipalities, states and counties across the U.S. San Francisco is one of them. City leaders there say that although they would welcome migrants, they don't think transporting them to the city is the best option. Sonja Hutson from member station KQED reports.
SONJA HUTSON, BYLINE: San Francisco's had a sanctuary policy since 1989. It limits the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. San Francisco Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer says it's an ordinance the city is proud of.
SANDRA LEE FEWER: In San Francisco, we don't know who's documented and who isn't. Actually, we just live amongst each other, and we live peacefully.
HUTSON: While Fewer and other officials are denouncing the proposal, they're also saying they would welcome the migrants if it goes through.
FEWER: We will treat them as human beings. We respect them as people. And we want their families to have a livelihood here, too.
HUTSON: Critics of sanctuary policies say they endanger residents. They point to the fatal 2015 shooting of a woman in San Francisco by an undocumented immigrant. That instance garnered national attention as an example of violence enabled by sanctuary policies. The immigrant, however, was acquitted of murder and manslaughter.
But supporters of the policy, like San Francisco Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, say they keep the city safe and help improve the well-being of immigrants.
RAFAEL MANDELMAN: It's about immigrant communities being able to go to the police, be able to go to our public health resources. Our city will not be stronger if our immigrant communities feel that they can't go to the police or can't go see a doctor.
HUTSON: In addition to several major cities, including San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles, the entire state of California has a sanctuary policy. Kevin de Leon authored the sanctuary state law when he represented parts of Los Angeles in the state Senate. He says another concern is the cost of transporting these migrants.
KEVIN DE LEON: Wasting taxpayer dollars to put folks on a plane specifically to sanctuary cities is a non-starter.
HUTSON: San Francisco is more than 500 miles from the California-Mexico border. De Leon says the proposal has little to do with what's best for immigration and more to do with agitating President Trump's base in the run-up to the 2020 election.
DE LEON: It's clearly not done to benefit the immigrants themselves, but rather to do everything within his power to embarrass elected official leaders throughout the state who have defended immigrants.
HUTSON: This isn't the first time the Trump administration has singled out sanctuary cities. In 2017, it threatened to withhold law enforcement grants from nearly 30 jurisdictions. In the end, many courts determined the federal government could not withhold those grants.
But not everyone in California or San Francisco agrees with the elected leaders who put forth these policies. Harmeet Dhillon is the Republican National Committeewoman for California and a lawyer in San Francisco. She supports President Trump's proposal to move immigrants to sanctuary cities. And she says the Democratic response to that suggestion has been hypocritical.
HARMEET DHILLON: Talk about political ploys and political pawns. Democrats have been using illegal aliens as political pawns and selling points and talking points for their pandering to the Hispanic vote for decades.
HUTSON: And Dhillon says city officials shouldn't be welcoming large amounts of undocumented immigrants into places like San Francisco.
DHILLON: Actually, when you can't take care of the health and welfare needs and educational needs of your own citizens, then you are a bad leader trying to dilute those resources amongst people who have not necessarily paid their dues to be here in this country.
HUTSON: Dhillon says sanctuary cities should focus on helping current residents, including large homeless populations in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles. For NPR News, I'm Sonja Hutson in San Francisco.

Sophie Lanfear/Silverback/Netflix Our Planet is the kind of nature show where every image could be a screen saver: sweeping, dramatic landscapes are full of colorful animals.
But among the high-definition scenes of lions on the hunt, there are some images you don't often see in these kinds of shows. Tropical reefs bleach into white bone-scapes; glaciers crumble into Arctic seas. In one particularly noteworthy sequence, confused walruses plummet off a cliff to their deaths — a phenomenon that the show links to climate change and the decline of the walrus' preferred habitat of sea ice.
Animals Following The Lives Of Chimpanzees On Screen, With Alastair Fothergill Series producer Alastair Fothergill was responsible for some of the most high-profile nature documentaries of the last decade: Planet Earth , Blue Planet , Frozen Planet . In an interview, he says that it has previously been difficult to include environmental messaging in prime-time, mass-audience programming — and even so, that Our Planet is careful to show where earth is still very healthy, or has bounced back.
But while other nature programs might make passing reference to the impact of humans, that narrative is at the center of Our Planet .
""We decided way back, actually in 2012, that the time had come to try and do a series which would be as entertaining and as accessible as series like Planet Earth — but for the first time deal in depth with the challenges that our planet faces,"" Fothergill says. ""There's no doubt that it is seriously under threat. And we felt that it was a story that urgently needed telling now.""
The eight-part series, narrated by David Attenborough , is now streaming on Netflix.
Interview Highlights On planning a project of this scale and rarity

Silverback/Netflix We spent a whole year planning: talking to scientists, talking to conservationists, deciding on our stories. And then we filmed over three years, and we spend a record 3,500 days in the field. To give you an idea, that means every final minute of the show you watch, we spent 10 days in the field. ...
But we were very specific. Although the animals don't read the script, we have a very, very organized and planned script and we knew exactly the narrative that we wanted to tell. ... What is very important to us is that each individual episode tell a bigger story about each individual habitat. Because what's very interesting is the challenges to the habitats, the threats to the habitats and the solutions to those habitats differ, depending on whether it's the open ocean, the tropical forest or the coniferous forest.
On capturing the Siberian tiger in the wild
I think the Siberian tiger is a wonderful achievement. It's the first intimate images of these amazing cats in the wild. And to give you a sense of how difficult it was, over two winters, three cameramen were literally locked away inside wooden hides. They didn't come out for six weeks. Everything you need to do to survive, they did inside the small box. And they worked for two winters. They got one single shot of a wild Siberian tiger. At the same time, we had in about 40 motion-control cameras — remote cameras that are set off by the moving animal. And again, the first winter we got nothing really. We got lynx going past, other animals of the forest. But over that period we began to see the movements of the tigers, how they were moving in that area. And the second season we got 36 precious, precious images. For me, it's a wonderfully emblematic sequence of a wonderfully rare, wild, iconic species of the boreal forest.

Kieran O'Donovan/Netflix On the images the show missed
You know, failure is my job, and we failed a lot. Often to get the sequence, we'd go one season — as I described the Siberian tiger — back and back and back. And yes, there are things that we still have to do and still have to film — which is great, because I've still got the life in me.
On the forest sequence in Madagascar
The patch of forest where we were filming was destroyed by the end of our filming period, yes. It was desperately, desperately sad. I mean, you know, Madagascar is a poor country. There's a lot of pressure; people need land. But the traditional forest — there's only 3 percent left. It's got so many precious, precious animals there. We really need to help those people to preserve the lemurs and all the wonderful forests that they live in.
On the forest sequence in Chernobyl
Thirty-three years ago, of course, famously the [nuclear] reactor at Chernobyl exploded. It was probably the greatest environmental disaster in living memory. And 30 years later, we ... go back and amazingly, the forest, the resilient forest, has overtaken Chernobyl. It's a green oasis now. And because people can't go there for very long because of the radiation — it's dangerous for us to stay there for a long period — it's been left alone.
And we found that an enormous variety of animals had returned, including the wolf. The wolf is an apex predator. The wolves are only there if beneath it, there's a very, very healthy community. And we now know that there are seven times more wolves in the Chernobyl exclusion zone than anywhere else in Eastern Europe. And the key point — and it's very important in our series to remind people — [is] that nature is resilient. And if we give it space, if we work together to preserve it, it can bounce back. And Chernobyl is a wonderful example of that.

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with art historian Caroline Bruzelius about the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, which caught on fire Monday.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
We're going to turn now to someone who knows Notre Dame Cathedral inside and out. Art historian Caroline Bruzelius has spent years studying its Gothic architecture. Welcome.
CAROLINE BRUZELIUS: Hello.
CHANG: Now, I understand you actually spent years inside the cathedral. Can you tell us; what is it made of? Are you surprised that it caught on fire like this?
BRUZELIUS: Well, there are several things to talk about there. My work was on the cathedral while they were cleaning the interior. And I was taking advantage of that to go up a scaffolding up the height of the vaults, which are 108 feet above the ground, to try to study how the building is put together - to measure the stones, to record the moldings, to think about process of building what I call a mega-building. The cathedral was...
CHANG: Yeah.
BRUZELIUS: ...The biggest building of its time in Paris especially but in that whole region.
CHANG: And can you tell us what kind of stone it's made out of?
BRUZELIUS: So it's made out of Parisian limestone, which is quarried right there under and around the city. It's a beautiful quality of stone. But when it's exposed to fire, stone is damaged. It doesn't actually burn, but it loses its surface. It becomes friable. It chips, and it's no longer structurally sound.
CHANG: Yeah.
BRUZELIUS: But the fire, however, seems to have started in the roof. And what most people don't understand when they visit a cathedral is that above the vaults, there may be 50 to 60 or even more feet of timber that support the enormous roof above the cathedral vaults. So between the vaults and the roof, there is a forest of timber.
CHANG: Wow.
BRUZELIUS: I wish I could show you a photograph. This timber is old. It's very dry and porous.
CHANG: Very flammable.
BRUZELIUS: Very flammable.
CHANG: Now, a firefighter the scene said earlier that they're directing their efforts towards saving the artwork at the very back of the cathedral. Can you describe for us what kind of artwork is there?
BRUZELIUS: Well, a lot of that artwork was put in in the 18th century - great altar pieces, beautiful sculpture, pews - as part of an 18th century renovation of the cathedral. But there also are many, many works of art that date to the Middle Ages, not the least of which of course is some of the remaining stained glass and sculpture, all of which - because it was Notre Dame in Paris - was of the highest possible quality.
CHANG: Yeah. Now, Notre Dame is more than 850 years old. Has it ever suffered drastic damage on this level before?
BRUZELIUS: Nothing perhaps on this level.
CHANG: Yeah.
BRUZELIUS: Seeing that fire was heart-chilling, and it extended the entire length of the roof structure. The cathedral has been changed and damaged many, many times, especially after the French Revolution, which, as you know, was as much against the church as it was against the state. And a sculpture was torn off the facade. Many portals were damaged, and the stained glass windows had already partially been changed in the 18th century. So yeah, a lot of change has happened at this building, but this is a kind of cataclysmic change way beyond anything we've ever seen.
CHANG: Now, I understand you have dedicated many years to this cathedral. May I ask; what is it like personally for you to watch it burn like this?
BRUZELIUS: I would say heartrending. You know, we tend to take buildings for granted. People like myself who work on them and metaphorically crawl up and down the walls know, however, that even monumental architecture is very vulnerable and that maintenance and restoration is critical. Here, I don't really know what kind of anti-fire provisions they had up above the vaults, but clearly, as I said, this was - in some ways, that kind of wooden roof is an accident waiting to happen.
CHANG: Yeah. That's Caroline Bruzelius. She's a professor emeritus of art history at Duke University. Thank you very much for joining us.
BRUZELIUS: Thank you. Bye-bye. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

A fire has broken out in the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. Flames and smoke were seen billowing high above the cathedral's roof on Monday as the spire collapsed.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The Spire of Notre Dame Cathedral has been part of the Parisian skyline for centuries. Today it fell while engulfed in flames. The world stopped to watch the images.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: At this point, the damage is catastrophic. There is yellow smoke...
UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: Know that much of a wooden interior of this 12th century landmark is burning and also likely to be...
UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #3: We're hearing people - Parisians, but also tourists - getting off buses, just standing, staring and crying and weeping and looking at - it went up like a torch.
CHANG: Within sight of the cathedral, people gathered to sing and pray.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing in French).
CHANG: We begin our coverage this hour with NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, who's in Paris. Hey, Eleanor.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.
CHANG: So what does the Notre Dame look like right now?
BEARDSLEY: Well, it looks like the fire is out. There's still water shooting up onto the dark church. Now it's nighttime here. And it - the good news is the structure has been saved, the two towers and the facade, says the fire chief. The fire burned for about five hours, and it's still cooling. He says that they're going to be working all night still trying to get artworks out in the smoke and in the falling pieces.
CHANG: Now, this is a cathedral that has been through so much over the centuries. It withstood the French Revolution, two world wars. What are people in Paris saying now as they're taking in what happened today?
BEARDSLEY: Well, it was a surreal scene out there. Thousands of people were on the banks of the Seine River right across from Notre Dame, and that's where I was. People were singing, some were praying, some were kneeling. But everyone was just watching it burn with a stricken look on their face. It was sort of as people were sad and panicked as the flames just would not go out and sometimes appeared to get even bigger. A lot of Parisians were too shaken up to talk to me, but I did speak to 22-year-old Eleanor Mark (ph), and here's what she says.
ELEANOR MARK: (Speaking French).
BEARDSLEY: She says, you know, she's sad. And she says it's a thousand years of history going up in a few hours. She's an architecture student. And she says they studied that cathedral. She knew it very intimately. And she said, it's just terrible to see it go in front of our eyes like this.
CHANG: Now that the fire is under control, what are officials there saying about the scope of the damage and the path forward on how to fix it?
BEARDSLEY: Yeah, exactly. Well, the scope of the damage is massive. The roof is said to be just completely gone. An investigation has been opened by the Paris prosecutor. And, you know, President Macron, he came out to that - to the cathedral tonight. He was supposed to give an important political speech on television. He canceled that. And here he is speaking out in front of Notre Dame.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French).
BEARDSLEY: So he says, you know, Notre Dame is our history, our literature. It's the place where we've lived all of our big moments - our wars, our epidemics, our liberation. He says, it's the epicenter of our life, and together, we're going to rebuild it. He says, that's France's destiny now - to work on Notre Dame together, to come together and rebuild it, and to call on the most talented people to do so.
CHANG: Now, have authorities shared any details so far about how they think this happened, what caused this? Are they investigating? I'm assuming they are.
BEARDSLEY: Yeah. There's an investigation being opened. And I haven't heard officially, but the French media is saying that there is, you know, there was renovation going on near the roof by the ceiling. There was a lot of scaffolding there. And they say that's where the fire broke out. And there was so much, you know, wood and timber in there hundreds of years old. And they say it was, you know, dried and cured and waxed. And it may have been that wood along the ceiling where the fire started. But we'll find out, Ailsa.
CHANG: That's NPR's Eleanor Beardsley. Thank you very much, Eleanor.

‘Razorblades and feathers in my throat’: A fire at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh made a major polluter even worse,stateimpact.npr.org,Reid Frazier,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2019/04/15/razorblades-and-feathers-in-my-throat-a-fire-at-a-u-s-steel-plant-near-pittsburgh-made-a-major-polluter-even-worse/,"A reporting project of NPR member stations
U.S. Steel's Clairton Plant, the largest coke works in North America, in Clairton, Pa. Reid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania April 15, 2019 | 07:00 AM ‘Razorblades and feathers in my throat’: A fire at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh made a major polluter even worse The country's largest coke plant was without pollution controls for over three months Reid Frazier Recent Stories Reid R. Frazier is an energy reporter for The Allegheny Front, a Pittsburgh-based public media outlet covering the environment in Pennsylvania. His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace.
The complaint came in on an answering service for the Allegheny County Health Department’s air quality hotline on Dec. 26 at 8:17 p.m.: “SMELL IS VERY BAD CANNOT EVEN LET DOGS OUT”
Another came in later that night, from Squirrel Hill: NEIGHBORHOOD SMELLS OF ROTTEN EGGS
Two days later, a phone call from McKeesport: SMOKE IS FILLING WHOLE VALLEY CLEAR DOWN TO KENNYWOOD. HEAVY AND THICK, SMELLS HORRIBLE.
They kept coming. Over three months, thousands poured in to the health department, by telephone, online, or through a smart phone app.
Complaints obtained from the health department reveal descriptions of an industrial stench wafting over the old milltowns of the Monongahela River valley — “A STRONG ODOR OF SULFUR” or “STRONG BURNING SMELL” — and resulting health effects: “It’s causing coughing for my husband and I,” said one person from Dravosburg on Jan. 3.
The cause was U.S. Steel’s Clairton Plant.
On Christmas Eve , a fire at the plant crippled its air pollution controls. For three months, the Pittsburgh area was blanketed with releases of sulfur dioxide much higher than usual.
For two weeks, the public was largely unaware of the releases. On Jan. 9, after six spikes of pollution above federal air quality standards, the county issued an air alert for the area. Residents criticized the county for the lack of information before the warning.
The county ultimately issued an April 15 deadline to the company to fix its pollution equipment. On April 5, 10 days ahead of schedule, the steelmaker finished its repairs.
But worries about air pollution, and its health impacts, remain.
The Clairton plant is the largest coke works in North America. To make coke, a key component of steelmaking, it bakes coal at high temperatures. The process creates sulfur-rich coke oven gas. The plant normally removes much of that sulfur from its waste stream, but the fire put a temporary halt to that.
To dispose of the gas, before the pollution controls were fixed, the plant flared it at several locations throughout the Mon Valley.
As a result, U.S. Steel emitted more than 70,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide (SO2) a day — five times the amount it’s permitted for, said Jim Kelly, deputy director of environmental health at the Allegheny County Health Department.
“ That’s a lot of pollution. It’s a lot of coke oven gas and so this a large opportunity for excess SO2,” Kelly said. Reid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania Doreen Luff, of Jefferson Hills, Pa., with her daughter Katie, 9, and son Jimmy, 6, in their back yard overlooking US Steel’s Clairton Coke Works.
“It’s a pretty acrid smell. The problem with sulfur dioxide is, in the air, in the presence of water, it forms sulfuric acid. So you can just imagine what that does when you breathe it into your lungs.”
What it does is burn the nose and throat , obstruct airway passages, and make it hard to breathe.
From her back yard on top of a hill, Doreen Luff can see the Clairton Plant — and smell it.
“When the wind blows, it blows the sulfur up here pretty good,” she says.
Since moving to her house in the community of Jefferson Hills 12 years ago, Luff could always smell the plant, some days worse than others. But after the fire, things got worse. On warm days, she keeps her windows closed.
Her kids’ schools stopped outdoor recess on bad air days. And in January, her 9-year-old daughter Katie got asthma. Luff blames the plant.
“She’s never been sick like that before, but now she has asthma. She has to use an inhaler,” Luff said. “I get nauseous, I have headaches, constant dizziness.”
She’s not alone. Her neighbor, Reita Derrick, says the air has made her cough: “It feels like I have at the same time razorblades and feathers in my throat.”
Another neighbor, Christa Gaugler, said her kids complained of sore throats and burning eyes. Gaugler said after the fire she experienced a “thickness” in the back of her throat, “a nasty taste that will not go away.”
Jacob Fleming, of Glassport, said he started wheezing after riding his bike. “I’ve never had any issues breathing. I feel like I have asthma now,” he said. Reid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania Inside Doreen Luff’s house in Jefferson Hills, Pa.
Environmental groups and angry residents criticized the health department for not doing enough to protect air quality after the fire. But Kelly says the agency did what it could, within the bounds of the law.
Kelly said the department couldn’t just order the plant to close down while it fixed those controls because he didn’t think a judge would allow it. That’s because coke ovens need to stay hot, or else they break down.
“To replace a coke oven is about $500 million,” Kelly said. “That’s something a judge will take into consideration if we order them to cease operation.”
In February, the county tried to order U.S. Steel to put the plant on a hot idle — where the plant stays hot, but produces no coke. The agency backed down when it learned that U.S. Steel said it would have taken longer to put the plant on idle than to just repair its pollution controls. Reid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania A flare at US Steel’s Irvin Works overlooks the town of Glassport, Pa.
One of U.S. Steel’s flares overlooks the nearby town of Glassport. Outside the Dollar Tree there where she works, Jennifer Magura said the air was so bad she got bronchitis this winter.
“I have a rescue inhaler and I’ve been using it, like, nonstop,” she said. “I mean, I already emptied two in the last two weeks and it’s just hard to breathe.”
Magura is a smoker, but says the kinds of breathing problems she’s had this winter are different.
“ I’ve smoked all my life, so I know what that’s like and I know when things are worse than usual, because when I go to downtown Pittsburgh I’m not struggling as much to breathe. And that’s like in the same day.”
But some aren’t so bothered by the plant’s air pollution, as long as it is providing jobs. Hilda Lueckert of Clairton said she couldn’t really smell anything different in the air. She’s lived in Clairton all her life, and her son works at the plant.
“Well, everything needs to be cleaned up. They do have to follow (environmental) guidelines. But as long as there’s smoke comin’ out of there, I know the men are going to have their jobs. So…I don’t have any complaints about it.”
The Clairton plant employs 1,200, and supports another 1,800 jobs at two other U.S. Steel mills nearby.
Lueckert remembers the days when the air was so bad in Clairton you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. The plant is much cleaner than in those days, she said. U.S. Steel said it’s already spent $37 million in pollution controls since 2016, and is spending $65 million more to improve those controls. The company reported profits of $1.15 billion in 2018.

“Give them a chance to work on it,” she said. “Instead of shutting everything down, and having all these men out of a job. Give them a chance to improve it.”
Back at her home in Jefferson Hills, Doreen Luff says she’s thought about moving, but she doesn’t think her family can afford to right now. Her husband Bryan works for Verizon and she’s a stay-at-home mom.
“ I talked about moving, but I think we’re financially unable to,” she said. “So we’re kind of stuck here like a lot of people are.”
Her 9 year old daughter, Katie, said on some days, she has tried to hold her breath when she goes outside to wait for the bus.
“And I’m not really good at holding my breath,” she said. “It kind of smells like sulfur. I don’t, I don’t like that…I don’t like it at all.”
Luff is glad the mill has put the pollution controls back on, but she says some days the air is still unbearable. She hopes her headaches go away, and that her daughter’s breathing gets better, eventually."
The Losers And Winners Of The Trump Administration's Big Tax Cut : NPR,www.npr.org,Jim Zarroli,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616898/the-losers-and-winners-of-the-trump-administrations-big-tax-cut,"It's tax day and many Americans are finding out whether last year's big tax overhaul really did cut their taxes. Most did, but some people saw their tax bill go up considerably.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
For most Americans, this is the day when federal income taxes are due. 2018 was the first year in which the Trump administration's big tax cut took effect. The bill lowered taxes for most people, but not for everyone. NPR's Jim Zarroli looks at who the winners and losers are.
JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The 2017 tax cut was President Trump's biggest legislative accomplishment to date. It sharply lowered the corporate tax rate and allowed businesses to bring home the money they made overseas tax-free. But it also cut taxes on people. Here was Trump in his 2018 State of the Union address.
(SOUNDBITE OF 2018 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month - a lot more.
ZARROLI: And that was true. Mark Mazur of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center says people at every part of the income spectrum benefited at least a little from Trump's tax cut.
MARK MAZUR: Low-income families with children might see a tax cut of $50 or $100 a year. In the middle-income categories, the tax cuts would be several hundred dollars.
ZARROLI: And he says high-end taxpayers may have saved thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars. Though Trump initially promised that rich people would be hurt by his tax bill, they weren't, says former Obama administration official David Kamin.
DAVID KAMIN: Those at the top are not paying, on average, more because of this bill. Quite the opposite - they're getting a disproportionate amount of this tax cut.
ZARROLI: Still, most people - some two-thirds of American taxpayers - got a tax cut, says Mark Mazur. But Mazur says there's a problem for Republicans.
MAZUR: I think a lot of Americans don't really seem to feel that tax cut.
ZARROLI: In surveys done over the past year, most Americans say they don't think they benefited from the cut, even when they did. David Kamin says the tax cut kind of got lost.
KAMIN: For middle- to low-income Americans, the tax cut was not all that large. It was then spread out over time as, you know, they would just get a somewhat bigger paycheck immediately.
ZARROLI: As a result, a lot of people didn't even realize they got a tax cut. The bill also created some geographic winners and losers. It sharply cut the amount of money people could deduct for state and local taxes, which hurt millions of people in high-tax states, such as New Jersey and California.
KAMIN: That's not the vast majority of Americans, but there are a relatively small number who do immediately face a tax increase under the bill.
ZARROLI: And it barred taxpayers from deducting business expenses, such as computer software or magazine subscriptions. The Tax Policy Center says about 6 percent of Americans saw their taxes rise as a result of the bill. And Kamin says the bill will have another harmful effect.
KAMIN: When you begin to think through what this tax bill means over the long term, it becomes clear this is likely to leave most Americans worse off.
ZARROLI: He says the tax cut has meant less revenue coming into the government. The federal debt is growing. That will have to be paid eventually, either through higher taxes or cuts in government services. And there's one more unpleasant fact. Under the tax bill, the cuts for individuals are set to expire after 2025. So unless Congress decides to extend them, people will end up paying more once again.

Microplastic Found Even In The Air In France's Pyrenees Mountains : NPR,www.npr.org,Christopher Joyce,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713561484/microplastic-found-even-in-the-air-in-frances-pyrenees-mountains,"Microplastic Found Even In The Air In France's Pyrenees Mountains Microplastic Found Even In The Air In France's Pyrenees Mountains Embed Embed

Surprisingly high amounts of microplastic are raining down on a remote and seemingly pristine part of France's Pyrenees mountains, according to scientists who say such particles could potentially be floating everywhere.
Microplastic — fragments smaller than a fifth of an inch that have broken down from larger pieces of plastic — has been found in rivers, lakes, the oceans and in agricultural soil. But very few studies of wind-borne microplastic have ever been done. This one found that the air over these mountains has about as much floating plastic pollution as the air over Paris or Dongguan, a large industrial city in China.
Steve Allen, a researcher at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, was part of the team that dreamed up the Pyrenees experiment.
""I don't know if you've ever seen a plastic bag on a fence flapping away until it disappears,"" he says. ""Well, we thought that maybe it just doesn't disappear, so we started looking for it a bit higher up.""
Higher up meaning 4,500 feet up a mountain. Allen's team set up collectors there for five months to trap plastic particles as they fell to Earth. ""We expected to find some,"" Allen says. ""We didn't expect to find quite as much as we did.""
In fact, they found 365 plastic particles on average every day on a square meter collector. ""We'd kind of expected it in a city getting blown around,"" he says, ""but way up there? The number is astounding.""
Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience , the researchers found several types of microplastic floating on the wind in the Pyrenees: fibers from clothing, and bits from plastic bags, plastic film and packaging material.

And apparently, it isn't local. Only a few small villages lie within 60 miles of the study site.
Scientists know how dust gets blown — say, from the Sahara across the Atlantic – but they ""know basically nothing about how [microplastics] move,"" says Deonie Allen of the French institution EcoLab, who worked with Steve Allen on the research and is married to him.
""We don't have this sort of material in nature,"" Deonie Allen says, noting that microplastics come in different shapes and are of different densities, which might affect how long they remain wind-borne. The researchers suspect that rain or snow carries some particles down to the ground, but they don't need precipitation to fall to earth.
Allen says that if this much microplastic manages to get halfway up the Pyrenees mountains, it could theoretically be everywhere, floating hundreds of miles from its original source.
And some microplastics probably can be inhaled. ""We ...don't know what they do to humans,"" Allen says. ""They're a brand new [type of] pollution, but there's so much of it and it's increasing so fast that it's something we really need to start learning about.""
Chelsea Rochman , a plastics researcher at the University of Toronto, has found microplastic as far away from civilization as the Arctic. She says this new study shows that ""our use of plastic materials and the way we dispose of them has led to global contamination of more than just populated areas.""
In fact, she says, ""plastic pollution may be the marker of our time."" "
Writer Elaina Plott Looks 'Inside Ivanka Trump's Dreamworld' For 'The Atlantic',www.npr.org,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616952/writer-elaina-plott-looks-inside-ivanka-trump-s-dreamworld-for-the-atlantic,"NPR's Audie Cornish talks with Elaina Plott of The Atlantic, about Ivanka Trump and how her image and personal brand have come under deep scrutiny during her father's presidency.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
First daughter and senior adviser to the president Ivanka Trump is in Africa today, pushing her message of women's empowerment. Before she left, Trump reminded people to take advantage of an expanded child tax credit, another Trump administration policy she has supported.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
IVANKA TRUMP: Through tax reform, we fought hard for the American working family. In 2019, as you fill out your taxes and you check the box for the child tax credit, you will have a doubled child tax credit. And...
CHANG: Empowering women and helping working families are a big part of the personal brand Ivanka Trump built for herself before her father entered politics. That personal brand gave rise to what Atlantic writer Elaina Plott describes as the founding myth of Ivanka Trump.
ELAINA PLOTT: I consider the founding myth to be this notion that not only Ivanka Trump but also her husband, Jared Kushner, would come into the White House and be moderating influences of sorts. Throughout the campaign, we saw Trump advocating for things such as a border wall, other controversial immigration policies. And there was always this sense that he would never actually follow through on those things because somebody like Ivanka would ensure that he never did.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
The president did act on those campaign promises, including pulling out of the Paris climate accord, something his daughter lobbied against. That move put to rest the idea that his daughter and her husband would be a moderating influence. And it made it harder for his daughter to find her footing in his administration. Elaina Plott has written about all that in her new piece, ""Inside Ivanka's Dreamworld"" (ph). She and I spoke about this earlier today.
When I think about ""SNL"" making fun of her with their skit - I think it was a perfume company called Complicit...
PLOTT: Yeah.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As narrator) A scent made just for her. Because she's beautiful. She's powerful. She's Complicit.
CORNISH: But I also think of the fact that, like, my mom sent me a copy of her book, you know, a few years back. Can you talk about the shift in public perception of her more broadly and how she's reacted to that?
PLOTT: Definitely. Back before her father announced that he was running for president, she was somebody who was really well liked by a lot of women across America. I note in the piece that I was one of them. I followed her on Instagram, like many of my girlfriends. We saw her as somebody who was empowering women, who kind of had it all, as it were. She was a mother. She ran this multi-million-dollar company. Because of that, I think that is where the founding myth of a moderating force took place - because a lot of people were so kind of taken aback by Trump's presidency and what it could mean for this country, that because that favorable impression of Ivanka lingered, people were willing to project onto her what maybe they wanted her father to do.
And that's why I think something like the ""SNL"" ad, you know, came to light. It's not necessarily that Ivanka is complicit. It's that that fact was surprising to people, that she might not, in fact, disagree with her father. So I remember in that ""SNL"" skit, at one point - it's Scarlett Johansson - and she said, for the woman who could stop all of this, but won't.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As narrator) Complicit, the fragrance for the woman who could stop all of this, but won't.
PLOTT: And I think that Americans have to take a critical look at themselves and ask, why did I think she ever would stop it?
CORNISH: Although, your article seems to have the thesis that she can't.
PLOTT: I think that's right. I think that her father treasures her opinion very much. But he's also somebody who is really infatuated with his own opinion on issues. And even though I do think that he takes his daughter's thoughts into consideration in a way that he wouldn't any other senior adviser, ultimately he's going to do precisely what he wants to do.
CORNISH: So now she is here in Washington, working in the White House. And she has not been able to separate her brand, so to speak, from his. Here she is responding to questions about sexual assault allegations against her father. It's in an interview with Peter Alexander. It was on NBC. This was back in February of 2018.
(SOUNDBITE OF NBC BROADCAST)
PETER ALEXANDER: Do you believe your father's accusers?
TRUMP: I think it's a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter if she believes the accusers of her father when he's affirmatively stated that there's no truth to it. I don't think that's a question you would ask many other daughters. I believe my father. I know my father. So I - I think I have that right, as a daughter, to believe my father.
CORNISH: Can you talk about how this reflects the difficulty maybe she's had as she's been confronted with questions about her father's either behavior or policy?
PLOTT: I'm so glad you played that clip because, you know, one of the reasons that in the past people were willing to ascribe Ivanka the benefit of the doubt is she was not - she was not working for her father, necessarily. She was in The Trump Organization. But she was most known for her lifestyle brand. But when she started to become a senior adviser to her father in the White House, she was no longer just a daughter. She was somebody who implicitly, by virtue of her employment status, endorsed what was going on in this White House and would necessarily have to confront questions that a senior adviser has to expect to be asked about.
CORNISH: There is a perception of what does this woman do all day - right? - from the general public. Is that something you heard from people in the White House as well? What's the response?
PLOTT: Their impression is that she kind of shows up some days just to be seen. At the same time, I do think that a lot of those perceptions are unfair. Whatever you think about what Ivanka does or doesn't believe, she - she does work during the day. She shows up at senior staff meetings at 7 to 8 a.m. and is usually there throughout the day. She travels often to meet with workers as part of her workforce development initiative. But again, she's not somebody like her husband, even, who, when there is kind of a momentous debate taking place, she is not putting herself in the room and asserting herself anymore.
CORNISH: She is not asserting herself anymore. What do you think has changed? When did that shift happen?
PLOTT: The Paris climate accord - I cannot emphasize enough how pivotal that was for Ivanka Trump in terms of realizing the limits of her influence in these key policy debates. You know, she lobbied so ardently for the United States to stay in that accord.
CORNISH: Directly to the president.
PLOTT: Exactly, and personally encouraged people like Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, to call her father and urge him to stay in because that, to her, was so emblematic of what her crowd back in New York wanted. And when it failed, her response was to kind of look out for No. 1, retreat and say, what are things that I feel I could actually get my hands around and be judged by in a more favorable light.
CORNISH: In the end, why does it matter? Why do you think that this particular figure - there have been lots of White House children, so to speak, right? And they've been kind of off-limits, in a way. What's significant about her and her role?
PLOTT: What I think is significant about Ivanka Trump is that I see her as somebody who will want to be part of the national political conversation well after this White House is over. I see her as somebody who would have her eye on something like the World Bank or the United Nations. She is seen as somebody who doesn't necessarily view her father's presidency as a one-off but could maybe see her father as the catalyst for a Trump political dynasty. And so if she wants that to happen, it's incumbent, I think, on the public to understand as much as we can about who she is and what she stands for.
CORNISH: Elaina Plott, she covers the White House for The Atlantic. Thank you for sharing your reporting with us.
PLOTT: Thank you, Audie.

From big papers to small, famous authors to unknowns, the Pulitzer Prizes cover the map of American writing and music.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The 2019 Pulitzer Prizes were announced in New York today. They award achievements in journalism and in the Arts and Letters. As NPR's Andrew Limbong reports this year's awards turn the spotlight on some of the dangers journalists around the world faced.
ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: Dana Canedy, the administrator of the prizes, broke with tradition this year by opening the awards with a special recognition for the Eagle Eye. That's the school newspaper for Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which submitted the obituaries for 17 people who were killed during the shooting at the school.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DANA CANEDY: These budding journalists remind us of the media's unwavering commitment to bearing witness, even in the most wrenching of circumstances, in service to a nation whose very existence depends on a free and dedicated press.
LIMBONG: The most wrenching of circumstances affected many of the newsrooms named, including the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, which won a public service award for its coverage of the Parkland shooting. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won for its breaking news coverage of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in that city. And a special citation was given to the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CANEDY: For their courageous response to the largest killing of journalists in U.S. history in their newsroom on June 28, 2018, and for demonstrating unflagging commitment to covering the news and serving their community at a time of unspeakable grief.
LIMBONG: The New York Times was given an award for explanatory reporting for its work digging into the finances of President Donald Trump and his father, Fred. Here's Times writer David Barstow.
DAVID BARSTOW: Central to Donald Trump's narrative is that I am a self-made billionaire. And I know people have been skeptical about that for a long time. But what we were able to do with this body of work was we were able to document nearly 300 specific revenue streams that Fred Trump created specifically for the benefit of Donald Trump over his lifetime. Our story, in effect, rewrites the financial biography of our 45th president.
LIMBONG: As far as local reporting goes, The Advocate out of Baton Rouge, La., was awarded a Pulitzer for tracing a law back to 1890s during Jim Crow that allows non-unanimous juries to convict, including life sentences.
GORDON RUSSELL: And the idea seems to be that if one or two black people managed to get on a jury, they could still be ignored.
LIMBONG: Gordon Russell is the managing editor for investigations at The Advocate. He says that the law has serious implications for today.
RUSSELL: We found that 40 percent of the verdicts that ended in conviction were non-unanimous.
LIMBONG: Some of the winners in Arts and Letters also spoke to serious subjects. Richard Powers won the Fiction Prize for his novel, ""The Overstory,"" which is about a group of people trying to save trees on the verge of destruction. He told NPR last year that he was looking to foster a reverence for the environment.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
RICHARD POWERS: What a tree can do to transform the atmosphere to transform the soil is absolutely part of the story of humans trying to give to these huge, ancient, incredibly diverse and incredibly supple creatures the same kind of sanctity that we reserve exclusively for ourselves.
LIMBONG: Forrest Gander was awarded the Poetry Prize for ""Be With,"" a collection grappling with loss and grief. Playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury won the Drama Prize for her play, ""Fairview,"" which on its face is about a black family planning a birthday party, but as she told the Berkeley Repertory Theatre last year, is, in practice, about surveillance.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JACKIE SIBBLIES DRURY: Thinking about why surveillance feels more dangerous to people of color because of, like, the implicit bias around the people that are actually doing the surveilling.
LIMBONG: But the prizes this year were not just about the tragedies and hardships of the world around us, but giving due to the people who faced them and created joy, as noted by another special citation being given to the late Aretha Franklin. Andrew Limbong, NPR News.

"Without Using Profanity, Supreme Court Justices Discuss Case Centered On Bad Language",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616864/without-using-profanity-supreme-court-justices-discuss-case-centered-on-bad-lang,"Without Using Profanity, Supreme Court Justices Discuss Case Centered On Bad Language Without Using Profanity, Supreme Court Justices Discuss Case Centered On Bad Language Embed Embed
The Supreme Court heard arguments on a case examining whether the clothing brand F-U-C-T is profane or could be trademarked.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
At the Supreme Court today, the issue was bad language. Specifically, can the government refuse to grant trademark protection for brand names that include profanity? The immediate problem for the court was how to discuss the issue without using the actual words - how to discuss the F-word, for instance, without actually saying the F-word, which is a challenge that NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg faces in this report.
NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: At the center of the case is a casual clothing line marketed under the name F-U-C-T. You can pronounce it yourself. The line, designed by Erik Brunetti, is mainly hoodies, loose pants, shorts and T-shirts all with those letters prominently displayed. Brunetti opened his line in 1990 aimed at 20-somethings. He's been trying since then to get his brand, FUCT, trademarked so that he can go after copycats.
ERIK BRUNETTI: Go to eBay, and you'll see lots of counterfeits. Or go to Amazon. You'll see a lot - lots of counterfeits.
TOTENBERG: In short, he says, the knockoffs are costing him money.
BRUNETTI: If I win, I will pursue the counterfeiters to stop them from making my product.
TOTENBERG: The U.S. government Patent and Trademark Office, however, has consistently turned him down, contending that those letters violate the federal statute that bars trademark protection for immoral, shocking, offensive and scandalous words. Brunetti's case got a boost two years ago when the Supreme Court ruled that an Asian-American band calling itself The Slants could not be denied trademark protection because it used a disparaging term.
Dealing with the brand name FUCT proved a bit more daunting in the Supreme Court chamber today. Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart referred to it as, quote, ""a profane past-participle form of a well-known word of profanity and perhaps the paradigmatic word of profanity in our language."" The government, he maintained, can deny trademark protection for that word. The justices pointed to a chart showing which terms had been granted trademarks by the government and which had not. Most are not suitable for a general audience. Suffice to say that while FUCT did not win trademark approval, FCUK did, and so did the well-known brand FUBAR. The word crap was registered in a trademark name 70 times, but the S-word was consistently denied.
So, Justice Ginsburg asked, how does the Trademark Office define what is scandalous, shocking or offensive? Do 20-year-olds generally find FUCT to be shocking or scandalous? Probably not, conceded the government's Stewart. But he said the term would still be shocking or offensive to a substantial segment of the population. Justice Gorsuch pointed to the chart, declaring that it was hard to see why certain trademarks with dirty words were approved and others were denied.
Justice Alito asked what would happen when really dirty words were at issue. And how about racial slurs, asked Justice Breyer. Those are more like swear words. They're insults that sting and are remembered by those who were targeted. Stewart replied that because of the court's decision in The Slants' case, most racial slurs are now approved. But as for the most offensive slur, the N-word, for now, it's still out.
Representing FUCT designer Brunetti, lawyer John Sommer didn't have an easy time either. Justice Breyer - why doesn't the government have the right to say you can use this language in your brand name, but the government doesn't want to be associated with it by granting trademark protection? What I'm worried about, he said, is that if a racial slur is trademarked, it will appear as a product name on every bus where it's advertised. It'll be on newsstands where children and others will see it. That's not the audience Mr. Brunetti is appealing to, replied lawyer Sommer. Chief Justice Roberts - but that may not be the only audience he reaches.
Lawyer Sommer returned to the language of the statute, arguing that if offensiveness is the standard for turning down a trademark, Steak 'n Shake can't be registered either because, quote, ""a substantial portion of Americans believe that eating beef is immoral."" A decision in the case is expected by summer.

Bernie Sanders Releases A Decade Of Tax Returns,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/712739155/bernie-sanders-releases-a-decade-of-tax-returns,"Enlarge this image Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Scott Olson/Getty Images Updated at 7:26 p.m. ET
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders released 10 years' worth of tax returns Monday. The documents underscore how much money the populist presidential candidate has earned in recent years, as his public profile has risen.
In an interview with the New York Times before the returns were made public, Sanders dismissed the idea that his newfound wealth undercut his billionaire-bashing message.
""I wrote a bestselling book,"" he told the paper . ""If you write a bestselling book, you can be a millionaire, too.""
The tax returns show that Sanders earned more than $1 million recently, making $1,131,925 in 2017 between himself and his wife, Jane, and paying a total of $343,882 in taxes at a 30 percent tax rate. Most of the money came in connection with the book Sanders wrote after his 2016 bid, Where We Go From Here . That year, their adjusted gross income was $1,062,626, and they paid a total of $372,368 in taxes at a 35 percent tax rate.
But the royalties from that book have slowed, and in 2018 Sanders and his wife made $561,293. The two paid $145,840 in taxes, or a 26 percent tax rate, and also gave 3.4 percent of their income to charity, donating $18,950.
Politics Democratic Candidates Are Releasing Tax Returns, Answering Big Questions For Voters During the 2016 presidential primary, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pressured Sanders to release his tax returns. He eventually made his 2014 return public: The document showed he and Jane earned about $206,000 that year, including Social Security benefits.
It's been standard for major-party nominees to release their tax returns, but in 2016, Trump became the first general-election candidate in more than four decades to keep his private. Trump has continued to ignore calls to release them, and House Democrats are now trying to use their majority power to obtain the documents from the Internal Revenue Service.
Politics Treasury Department Misses House Committee Deadline To Turn Over Trump Tax Returns As Democrats continue to hammer Trump on the issue, several presidential candidates have made a point of releasing their own financial information earlier than presidential hopefuls have in past campaigns.
After Sanders put out the past decade of his taxes, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke did the same on Monday evening, though without his 2018 return — which he hadn't filed yet but said he would make public as soon as he did. In 2017, he and wife Amy's adjusted gross income was $366,455, and they paid a total of $81,019 in taxes for a 22 percent tax rate. They gave $1,166 to charity, meaning they had a 0.3 percent giving rate — the lowest by far of any 2020 hopeful.
Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kamala Harris of California, as well as Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, have all already made their 2018 tax returns public.
So far, those have shown that Harris and her husband made the most money, paid the most in taxes and were taxed at the highest rate.
Warren was the most generous.

Trump Administration Moves Forward With Proposal To Re-Define Waterway Protections,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/15/713616827/trump-administration-moves-forward-with-proposal-to-re-define-waterway-protectio?station=KXJZ_FM,"The Trump administration's revisions to the Waters of the U.S. rule will strip federal water protections from millions of miles of rivers. The impact will be even more pronounced in the arid Southwest.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
The Trump administration is moving forward with a proposal that would redefine which waterways in America get federal protection. Many industry groups felt that the previous definition was too broad. NPR's Nathan Rott went to New Mexico, a state that's bracing for significant change. He sent this report.
NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: For most of you river-goers out there, the Santa Fe...
(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)
ROTT: ...Would not be much to look at or play in. You'd be lucky if you could float a soda can down it. Though looking at its brush-tangled banks in downtown Santa Fe, it looks like a few people have tried. Its springtime runoff is more trickle than torrent. But to folks like Rachel Conn, this is impressive.
RACHEL CONN: This is, like, flow in New Mexico. This is - a lot of creatures depend on something like this.
ROTT: Conn is with Amigos Bravos, New Mexico-based conservation group that focuses on water issues.
CONN: Up to 94 percent of our waters are these smaller types of waters that flow only part of the year. But they all drain into our bigger systems. And it is from these bigger systems that close to 300,000 New Mexicans receive their drinking water.
ROTT: And it's these types of smaller rivers and streams that may soon lose federal protections. The Trump administration's new proposed definition of which waters should fall under the Clean Water Act does not include ephemeral or intermittent streams - waterways that only flow after precipitation like the Santa Fe, or, say, every other year, which isn't all that uncommon in the arid Southwest. That means industry or landowners looking to discharge wastewater into one of those or dam one of those streams would no longer need a federal permit to do so.
HELEN NEVILLE: So it's millions of miles of stream.
ROTT: Helen Neville is the senior scientist for the conservation and sportsmen's group Trout Unlimited, an organization that opposes the new rule. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that about 18 percent of streams nationwide and half of the country's wetlands would no longer be considered waters of the United States under the president's proposal. Trout Unlimited believes it's far more because ephemeral streams are so hard to map and so easily overlooked.
NEVILLE: You know, it's very similar to how you think about your capillaries feeding your blood vessels.
ROTT: Ephemeral streams may seem insignificant.
NEVILLE: But they're critically important for the health of those downstream waters just like your capillaries are critically important for the health of your blood system.
ROTT: And she says that's especially true in the southwest, where rains can be few and far between. Even the Rio Grande, New Mexico's biggest river, ran dry in parts last year. Chad Smith, CEO of the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, is less worried about the impact on the state's waterways and doesn't believe that it will lead to a surge in pollution from industries like his, something environmental groups have warned about.
CHAD SMITH: We want to make sure our waterways are clean. We want to make sure we protect our natural resources that we make a living off of.
ROTT: He says industry groups around the country are applauding the proposed change.
SMITH: It couldn't be more welcomed. I think what it does from a very high-level perspective is it provides some more clarity and certainty for farmers and ranchers across the landscape.
ROTT: Clarity and certainty are the reasons the Trump administration is giving, too. The EPA says they want to make it clear for landowners and developers whether federal laws apply to a project or not. Conflicting court decisions have made that muddy in the past. And it's likely that courts will get another say about this change. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Santa Fe, N.M.

toggle caption Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images A nurse prepares the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine at the Rockland County Health Department in Haverstraw, N.Y. Several measles outbreaks in New York state are contributing to this year's unusually high measles rates.
Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Measles is surging. Last week the U.S. recorded 90 cases, making this year's outbreak the second largest in more than two decades.
So far this year, the U.S. has confirmed 555 measles cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday. That's 50 percent higher than the total number recorded last year, even though we're only about a quarter of the way through 2019.
And the virus isn't slowing down.
""The number of cases is accelerating,"" says Dr. Amanda Cohn, a senior adviser for vaccines at the CDC. ""We are on track to have one of the highest numbers of cases of measles reported since we eliminated the disease in the year 2000.""
The majority of the cases are connected to outbreaks in New York, Cohn says.
""This is a very significant outbreak,"" she says. ""These cases were imported from other countries, but because of low vaccination coverage in these communities, measles is spreading widely throughout these communities.""

Last week, New York City declared a public health emergency in an ultra-Orthodox community in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. The city's Health Department is mandating that parents vaccinate their children, or they may face a $1,000 fine.
The CDC pointed to four other places with ongoing outbreaks in the U.S.: Clark County, Wash. ; Oakland County, Mich.; two counties in New Jersey ; and a handful of counties across California .
Health officials say there are two main reasons for the virus's surge: more international travel and lower vaccination rates.
Several countries around the world are currently experiencing massive measles outbreaks. Madagascar has recorded more than 100,000 cases since the fall, with more than 1,200 deaths. Ukraine has recorded about 37,000 cases this year. And the European Union is tallying about 1,000 cases a month.
Globally, the World Health Organization reports that measles cases in the first quarter of 2019 nearly quadrupled compared with what was reported at this time last year.
More American families are bringing measles home with them after traveling abroad, Cohn says. And once the disease lands stateside, it has a better chance of gaining a foothold because vaccination rates in some places have dropped below 93 to 95 percent, the threshold required to protect the entire community.
""When you make the decision not to vaccinate your child, please understand you're also making that decision for the people around your child,"" New York City's deputy mayor of health and human services, Herminia Palacio, told NPR on Wednesday .
Measles can be an extremely serious disease. About 25 percent of infected children are hospitalized. About 10 percent of children develop ear infections, which can cause permanent hearing damage. In about 1 in 1,000 cases, the infection becomes life-threatening. In these cases, the virus moves to the brain, causing encephalitis and convulsions. Children can be left deaf, blind or with intellectual disabilities — if they recover.
Before the development of the measles vaccine in the 1960s, the U.S. recorded nearly a half-million cases each year , the CDC says. About 48,000 kids were hospitalized and about 500 people died per year.
""We eliminated measles from this country in 2000, and ... I think we eliminated the memory of that virus,"" Dr. Paul Offit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia told NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday . ""People don't remember how sick it could make you."""

Oli Scarff/Getty Images
Alan Rusbridger knows a thing or two about high-stakes journalism.
During his 20-year tenure running the British newspaper The Guardian , he collaborated with NSA contractor Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on blockbuster stories drawn from secret government documents. Though Rusbridger left The Guardian in 2015, he remembers the stress vividly.
""We were publishing every minute of the day around the world,"" he says. ""It's a matter of deadlines and never enough information and people trying to sue you and generally harass you."" Full Cache Of Unredacted WikiLeaks Diplomatic Cables Is Now Online
And just as The Guardian was covering these massive stories, Rusbridger was also dealing with serious challenges to the journalism industry itself. While many newspapers at the time were establishing paywalls, under Rusbridger's watch, The Guardian created an economic model in which online users were asked — but not required — to pay for the newspaper's content. It's a model that seems to be working.
""Last week, my successor's editor announced they now had a million readers who are now contributing to The Guardian in order to keep it open to everybody,"" Rusbridger says. ""I think that's rather miraculous. It's called philanthropy, and that people want to be philanthropic about news is amazingly encouraging.""
Rusbridger now serves as chair of the steering committee at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. His new book is Breaking News: The Remaking of Journalism and Why it Matters Now. The Remaking of Journalism and Why It Matters Now Author Interview Highlights
On the decision to publish classified information provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden
We have the Pentagon Papers case of 1971 to thank for the fact that it established a ruling at the Supreme Court that said that the government can't walk into a newsroom and injunct them and prevent them from publishing. You can certainly hold an editor responsible in retrospect, but you can't stop them from publishing, unless you can show overwhelming cause. Now, in Britain we don't have that, and I always suspected with the Snowden story that there might come a point where the government would walk into the Guardian offices and prevent us from publishing — and that's exactly what they did.
In fact, they demanded that we smashed all the computers on which we were storing this material. But I also knew that, again, [with] a partnership with The New York Times, that the First Amendment and the effect of the Pentagon Papers ruling meant that the American government could never do that, and it was a much more permissive environment to publish out of New York than out of London, sadly.
On the U.K. government's destruction of Guardian computers because of the Snowden story Pentagon Papers Leaker Daniel Ellsberg Praises Snowden, Manning
It turns out that it's remarkably difficult todamage a computer so that it's of no use to anybody else. It involved a very elaborate, dusty, noisy morning in the basement of the Guardia n with drills and angled drivers and ... all kinds of weird equipment destroying specific chips and bits of the keyboard, bits of the hard drive, and bits of the memory board under the watchful eye of GCHQ [the Government Communications Headquarters]. That's the equivalent of the NSA technicians.
It seemed to me a piece of theater, because I had told them that we had a copy in New York with The New York Times and with Pro Publica . And so this was not going to stop our reporting, but it seemed like a piece of theater to be able to say to somebody, ""Look, we've smashed up The Guardian 's computers,"" and somebody would feel better. ...
In the modern world, it is very difficult to prevent good information (and sadly, bad information) ... from being published, because it's like water, and you can't you can't control it in the way that you could even 50 years ago.
On what it was like working with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange WikiLeaks' Assange Arrested In London
Assange and Snowden are often bracketed together as though they're the same; in fact, they're almost opposite. If you think what Edward Snowden did was to hand over his material to journalists, three or four journalists including The Washington Post, and said ""You choose,"" and once he handed it over he played no part in any of the editorial decisions.
Assange is, I think of as an information anarchist. He doesn't really like journalism or journalists, and he doesn't believe in the idea of gatekeepers, of people who are the arbiters on society's behalf, of what they read or not. So his instinct was just to dump all the information out there and people could read it and make their minds up.
They're obviously very different approaches and he was a difficult man to work with for that reason, because we thought we should be redacting and reading for libel and for potential damage, and for many dangers on our horizons. So in the end, I did think we were the only people in the world who have fallen out with Julian Assange, but it became an impossible relationship.
On crowdsourcing criticism
We had a wonderful theater critic called Michael Billington, who had been on the staff since 1972, and we always wanted Michael to be in the stalls on the first night of a big production. But would anybody think that out of 900 people in the audience he was the only person with an interesting opinion? No. Nobody would argue that today. And would it be interesting to hear from some of those 900? Well, of course ... 30 people might want to do that, but you would then have 30 different views. What would happen if Michael then had a dialogue with those 30 people? They could see things that he didn't, and vice-versa.
It is that idea of involving different voices in the act of criticism — is [that] a terrible idea? Is that a good idea? If we don't do it, someone else will. Then you get back into the ethos of the four billion people talking to each other, which has to be a powerful idea. Otherwise, all these people wouldn't be doing it. These were our attempts to fumble towards an idea of what we call ""open journalism.""
On how social media can influence journalism for the better
Journalism has to remake itself if it is to be the answer to the world of information chaos that we're in danger of living in. Alan Rusbridger There's much that is wrong with journalism, and journalism in many ways hasn't come to terms with a new age of the democratizing of news. ... Journalism has to remake itself if it is to be the answer to the world of information chaos that we're in danger of living in. ... You might think that at this time, of all times, people will turn to journalists. ... Whereas in fact, all the polls on trust show that journalists are not generally trusted. So I think you have to say how would we regain trust? And I think it's not enough just to say, ""We're journalists, trust us."" I think social media has some answers.
If you look at the best of social media you have some very good, intelligent, funny, expert people who are talking to each other and listening to each other and responding to each other. They don't say, ""Trust me,"" they say, ""Here's my evidence. Here's my link. Here's my screengrab. This is how I know, but if I'm wrong, tell me."" And it's a different kind of information sharing and a different kind of dialogue from the printing press model, which is, ""Here is the paper and we essentially are not very interested in hearing from you.""

Steven Senne/AP Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, entered not guilty pleas Monday in federal court in Boston.
Both waived their right to appear in court for arraignment.
Federal prosecutors announced additional charges last week against Loughlin, Giannulli and 14 other wealthy parents. They face one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest-services mail and wire fraud, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Loughlin is best known for playing the role of Aunt Becky on Full House . Giannulli's Mossimo brand was a core clothing label at Target until 2017 .
Law Lori Loughlin, 15 Others Indicted On New Charges In College Admissions Scandal Giannulli and Loughlin are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes arranged by college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits for the crew team, despite neither of them being a rower.
According to the Justice Department's superseding indictment , Giannulli and Loughlin made payments in 2016 and 2017 to former USC Associate Athletic Director Donna Heinel and to Key Worldwide Foundation, which was operated by Singer.
The indictment paints a picture of how the Justice Department built its case:
""On or about November 29, 2018, Singer called Loughlin from Boston, Massachusetts. During the call, Singer said, in sum and substance, that [Key Worldwide Foundation] was being audited by the IRS, which was asking about the two payments of $200,000 by the Giannullis. Singer added: 'So I just want to make sure that you know that, one, that you're probably going to get a call and that I have not told them anything about the girls going through the side door, through crew, ever though they didn't do crew to get into USC. So I—that is—all I told them was that you guys made a donation to our foundation to help underserved kids.' Loughlin replied, 'Um-hmm.' ""

Zelda Gardner/Getty Images Zelda Gardner/Getty Images Before the repeal, Arizona was one of at least seven states with curriculum laws around LGBTQ issues.
Zelda Gardner/Getty Images On Thursday, Arizona lawmakers repealed a law that restricted how public school teachers could talk about LGBTQ relationships in health classes.
The Arizona law regulated HIV/AIDS instruction in public schools. Since 1991, it has banned teachers in those courses from promoting ""a homosexual life-style,"" portraying ""homosexuality as a positive alternative life-style"" or suggesting there are safe ways to have homosexual sex.
At least six other states have curriculum laws around LGBTQ issues, according to the advocacy group GLSEN . Like many of the laws that exist in other states, Arizona's was created in the throes of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
The repeal was the culmination of a lawsuit filed against Arizona education leaders in March , and years of advocacy from Democrats and LGBTQ advocacy groups.
Education Arizona Law Leaves Schools Struggling To Navigate LGBTQ Issues Education 5 Ways To Make Classrooms More Inclusive ""We're so excited and relieved and, I think, in a state of shock, to be honest,"" said Carol Brochin, a plaintiff in the lawsuit with her child, who lawsuit identifies as S.C.
""[S.C.] was so surprised and really taken aback and started crying, actually,"" Brochin said.
S.C., a Mexican-American seventh-grader, uses they/them pronouns and identifies as queer.
""They are the emotional center for their friends,"" Brochin said, adding that she thinks it's because of how much S.C. has been through.
The lawsuit described the bullying and offensive name-calling S.C. experienced in sixth grade while attending a Tucson Unified School District middle school. It said S.C. was ""repeatedly called a 'stupid gay kid' and 'faggot' by other students,"" and S.C. did not feel safe at school and ""frequently went to the school nurse's office because they were so upset from the harassment and bullying.""
The complaint argued that because S.C. would take courses that are subject to the curriculum law in high school, they ""will face further stigma and will be denied equal education opportunities because of the Law.""

It was unclear from the beginning who, if anyone, would defend the law. One of the lawsuit's listed defendants, Arizona Superintendent Kathy Hoffman, had already publicly supported the LGBTQ curriculum restrictions' repeal.
In a 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday, the Arizona House and Senate voted on a repeal, and Gov. Doug Ducey signed it into law.
The amendment was brought by Republican Rep. T.J. Shope.

We should probably go ahead and see if we can't get out of this,"" Shope said after the vote. He added that repealing the law would save taxpayer money that would have gone to defending it against the lawsuit.
Democratic Sen. Martín Quezada had tried to repeal the law every year since 2016, but Republican lawmakers blocked his bill from advancing.
""I want us to all be honest with ourselves today about this bill,"" Quezada said in explaining his vote for the repeal. ""We would not be here today if it was not a forced issue.""
Several LGBTQ lawmakers explained how powerful it was to vote yes on the repeal.

It has become a magnet for self-styled militia groups from out of state that say they want to patrol the border and stop migrants.
Dominic Valente for NPR Arivaca, Ariz., is a tiny village, population about 700, with an outsize problem.
It sits just 11 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border and has become a magnet for self-styled militia groups from out of state that say they want to patrol the border and stop migrants. Their presence has strained a town that has long prided itself on its live-and-let-live, cooperative spirit.
When the women of Arivaca gather for Monday afternoon gentle yoga, there are certain topics they know to avoid.
Civility Wars In These Divided Times, Is Civility Under Siege? ""We just don't talk politics,"" says Sue Soucy, a staunch supporter of President Trump. Then she adds: ""Will I vote for Trump again? Absolutely!""
""And I would die before I would!"" chimes in Marjorie Leon, to gales of laughter.
Avoiding politics helps keep the peace, says Mary Kasulaitis: ""You have to choose not to rile up people.""

Dominic Valente for NPR Jaffe first came to Arivaca in 1971, part of a group of hippies who set up tepees and established a community off the grid, riding horseback and hauling their own wood and water. That community-minded spirit persists, these women say, and the militias are not welcome.
""It's puzzling why they would be attracted to a place like this,"" says Dresang.
""The problem with the militias is you don't know who they are and you don't know what they want,"" says Kasulaitis, a local historian whose roots in Arivaca go way back. She grew up on ranchland that has been in her family since 1879. ""I put 'No Trespassing' signs on my fence, not because of the border crossers, but because of the militia. They're a worry to me.""
Poker night
Tuesday night in Arivaca means it's poker night at Joe Farrington's double-wide. Some of the men gathered around the table have been playing poker together for nearly 40 years.

""A total eclectic village, is what I'd call it,"" says his poker buddy Brad Knaub, who runs the local coffee roaster, Gadsden Coffee Co. ""So many different types of people that somehow manage to get along. Cowboys, hippies, miners ... No matter what, or where you come from, if you're in need and need some help, people will step [up] to help you.""

Dominic Valente for NPR Now, the militia groups' presence is putting that harmonious spirit to the test.
""It's made some of the locals more standoffish, a little more defensive,"" says Farrington. ""Everybody used to be pretty open out here, but now you gotta kinda wonder, if you meet a stranger, is he just a nice hunter? Or is he some crazed guy that thinks everybody that lives in town is a criminal?""
He's referring to what happened last year, when militia groups came and spread wild conspiracy theories that the townspeople were in cahoots with Mexican drug cartels and sex traffickers.

Many in town worry that Foley's presence in Arivaca will draw more militias to town.
They remember all too well the brutal crime that happened here 10 years ago, when members of a militia group shot and killed a local man, Raul Flores, and his 9-year-old daughter, Brisenia, in a home invasion. Arivacans' worst fear is that something like that could happen again.
Along the border, support for Trump and the wall
The drive from Arivaca to the Mexico border is a slow, bumpy ride through rugged grassland and up mountains dotted with mesquite trees and saguaro cactus.
Ranchers Jim and Sue Chilton raise cattle on this land , part of the Coronado National Forest, right up to the Mexico border.

His ranchland extends 5 miles along the border, which is marked by a waist-high fence of four strands of barbed wire.
Dominic Valente for NPR The international boundary is marked by four strands of barbed wire, waist high, easy to crawl under or through.
The Chiltons say the Mexican cartels run drugs through this land constantly.
Standing by the wire fence, Jim Chilton says: ""I saw a group right over there, a year ago or more. Most of the people coming across our ranch drop their drugs, and they go back to Mexico for another return trip. They know the area. They know every trail.""
The Chiltons are gung-ho about President Trump, think the Border Patrol is ineffective, and really want to see a wall built here.

Dominic Valente for NPR These are contentious views in town. And civil discourse? That can seem elusive.
As Jim Chilton sees it, ""Civility is the ability to speak one's mind without being threatened or without having to worry about being politically correct.""
When I ask Sue Chilton if it still seems like Arivaca is a civil town, she says, emphatically, ""You keep going back to the word civil, and the answer is yes! It's entirely civil because we all know the situation. You just don't broach certain subjects with certain people.""
Subjects like immigration, or the militias.

Randall has seen just how ugly it can get.
For several years now, she and others in Arivaca have been targeted by a local man who has harassed and threatened them with venomous letters, Facebook posts and emails. Mostly, he's incensed about immigration and what he calls ""liberal trash.""
It all started, Randall says, when the man submitted a letter for publication that violated the paper's rules of civility. She says his crusade of harassment began when she asked him to clean up the language.
Eventually, it got so bad that the targets of his abuse went to court and got restraining orders against him.

Evan Vucci/AP hide caption toggle caption President Donald Trump walks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June. Evan Vucci/AP
In the crush of urgent news, some astounding events can almost slip past.
At a rally in West Virginia last Saturday, President Trump told the crowd about feelings he has developed for Kim Jong Un. Remember when the president mocked North Korea's supreme leader as ""Little Rocket Man,"" and Kim ridiculed Trump as a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard""?
Something else was going on.
Trump said , ""I was really being tough. And so was he. And we'd go back and forth. And then we fell in love. OK? No, really. He wrote me beautiful letters. And they're great letters. We fell in love. But you know what? Now, they'll say 'Donald Trump said they fell in love, how horrible. How horrible is that? So un-presidential.' ""
At least unprecedented.
Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt were uncommonly close leaders during the darkest hours of the Second World War. FDR once cabled Churchill , ""It is fun to be in the same decade with you.""
But Kim Jong Un, the leader for whom Donald Trump has declared his devotion, presides over a cruel kingdom of repression , torture , starvation , assassinations , abduction , forced abortion , public executions and slave labor . It isn't fun to even be in the same hemisphere with Kim Jong Un.
It wouldn't be surprising for any president to toss an occasional bouquet toward Kim, if it encourages him to abandon nuclear weapons. When Hitler's Germany invaded the U.S.S.R. in 1941, Winston Churchill, who had long denounced Stalin, welcomed him into alliance, and explained, ""If Hitler invaded hell I would make at least a favorable reference to the devil in the House of Commons.""
But Senator Lindsey Graham, who has recently supported the administration, said this week , ""I'm telling President Trump: Enough with 'I love you.' ... There's nothing to love about Kim Jong Un.""
The letters between President Trump and Kim Jong Un haven't been made public. But don't you wonder what charm and blandishments have made President Trump so besotted with a man who had his own half-brother poisoned, and his uncle executed? Maybe there's just something about a despot in a high-buttoned pinstripe suit."

Noel King talks to Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading the Tree of Life Synagogue community in prayer when a gunman opened fire, killing 11 people. He says hate will not close his synagogue.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
For the Tree of Life congregation in Pittsburgh, 2019 is going to be a year of rebuilding. In late October, members of that synagogue gathered for Shabbat service. Their prayers were interrupted by gunfire.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Good morning. We're coming on the air right now with breaking news for those...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
MARTIN: Eleven Jewish worshippers have been killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. A man has been charged with hate crimes and could face the death penalty.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh has again revealed the ugly anti-Semitism that still exists in the United States.
MARTIN: In the aftermath, the synagogue's rabbi, Jeffrey Myers, vowed that hate would not close his building's doors. It's now been two months since that tragedy. In a conversation with our co-host Noel King, Rabbi Myers explained what has kept him hopeful.
JEFFREY MYERS: Such a outpouring of love and support from not just around the immediate community or even the United States, but from around the world. I'll give one example. There was a young boy who had his bar mitzvah also on October 27 in another synagogue. And upon his reflection of the horrific events of that day, he felt he needed to do something.
So he took some money that was gifted to him for his bar mitzvah and sent a donation to our synagogue as his way of connecting with us and sharing in his sorrow and at hoping for a brighter future. And I thought, wow. That just took my breath away. And to me, that's so uplifting.
NOEL KING, BYLINE: I wonder, though, over the past couple of months whether or not your perspective has changed at all on anti-Semitism in this country.
MYERS: I don't think my perspective has changed at all. Many felt that this sort of horrific massacre was inevitable at some point in the history of the Jewish community in the United States. It was going to happen. Many were surprised that it didn't happen, I guess, historically sooner than it did, but that it was going to happen at some point.
KING: You know, people will hear you say that there was a sense of inevitability, and they'll say, you know, no one should have to live like that. This is the United States of America. What do you say to people who don't understand what it's like to be in the United States and to know that anti-Semitism does exist?
MYERS: This one has probably the longest-running form of bigotry in existence in humanity because it's been around literally almost as long as the Jewish people have been around. I'd like to think in some, you know, rosy sort of view of the United States that our country was founded because people were escaping bigotry and prejudice in Europe and came to a new place to build a new life. And yet there's some disappointment there in that the hopes that people could escape those forms of bigotry didn't materialize. It still exists. Americans still preach words that wound and hurt fellow citizens.
KING: Rabbi, you've been advocating for political leaders and for people of all parties and all faiths to eliminate the word hate from their vocabulary. Why?
MYERS: When we use words of hate, to use that word only once, we're creating a more dangerous world because those words lead to actions such as the massacre that occurred in Tree of Life on October 27. So if one could just be careful and think about what they say and how they use their words, people may come to realize, wow, my words really have an impact. I can be really more careful about those choices.
KING: Having had time to reflect, I wonder do you have a message for the man who committed these murders?
MYERS: I think that's the first time I've been asked that question. To me, it's such an unconscionable act that it defies answers. I don't think that anything I could ask, I would find a suitable answer that would soothe my soul, ease my pain or burden. So I don't have anything that I would ask at this time. I don't know if I ever would.
KING: Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, thank you so much for being with us.

"Get Paid To Stay In Bed, For Space Science",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195716/get-paid-to-stay-in-bed-for-space-science?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with Jennifer Ngo-Anh of the European Space Agency about their planned study during which subjects will stay in bed for two months.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
What if sleeping on the job wasn't a firing offense but was actually your job? NASA and the European Space Agency want to pay you almost $20,000 to do just that in Cologne, Germany. You'd be helping them study how the body adapts to weightlessness - catch is you have to stay in bed 24/7 for two months straight. That means no getting up for bathroom breaks, bathing or meals. If you're still interested, you may want to talk to Jennifer Ngo-Anh. She's team leader in human and robotic exploration at the European Space Agency. And she joins us on the line from near Amsterdam.
Jennifer, welcome to the program.
JENNIFER NGO-ANH: What a nice introduction (laughter).
PFEIFFER: (Laughter) So as I understand it, people would eat, they would drink, they would exercise, even use the bathroom lying in bed, much of that time with their head tilted down six degrees. Is that what this looks like for two months?
NGO-ANH: That is correct. When volunteers lie in bed with their heads tilted roughly six degrees below the horizontal, then a lot of the effects of - that spaceflight has on the human body can be simulated or being reproduced. It is not to annoy volunteers, but it is actually to test countermeasures.
PFEIFFER: So basically, lying in bed for a long time kind of mimics weightlessness?
NGO-ANH: Yes. It's a - it's an excellent model for us to study how the human body reacts to being exposed to weightlessness.
PFEIFFER: And what's the goal of the study? What do you hope to learn and then apply?
NGO-ANH: We're testing artificial gravity as a countermeasure. So volunteers will be exposed to artificial gravity a couple of minutes or half an hour in total per day. If this bedrest study shows that - or confirms this, then we may recommend artificial gravity as a potential countermeasure for future spaceflight missions. And they can then look into how to actually implement that onboard a space station be it via a short arm human centrifuge within the spacecraft or be it by designing a spacecraft that rotates.
PFEIFFER: You mentioned a centrifuge. I understand that part of this study involves the study subjects being spun around in a centrifuge. Why does that have to happen?
NGO-ANH: So when the volunteers are spun in the centrifuge, the fluids within the human body are propelled towards the head. And that counteracts some of the effects that we see when astronauts are in weightlessness.
PFEIFFER: So after being up in space for so long, the fluids get distributed incorrectly. Is that what happens?
NGO-ANH: Correct.
PFEIFFER: How do you get exercise while you're bed-bound? And is it even possible to get any cardio activity?
NGO-ANH: It is possible for volunteers to conduct exercise. We have tested everything from jumping in bed to cycling in bed. And that is through the use of - yeah - clever exercise devices that can be mounted onto the beds.
PFEIFFER: You know, the idea of getting paid to rest sounds great at first. But then as you start to learn the details and realize how confined you are, it starts to sound a lot less appealing. So who would want to do this?
NGO-ANH: A lot of people are intrigued about the idea of contributing to advance knowledge that helps us to really have humans live and work in space for extended periods of time.
PFEIFFER: Jennifer Ngo-Anh is with the European Space Agency.
Jennifer, thanks for talking with us.
NGO-ANH: Sure. You're very welcome.

Sunday Politics: Mueller Report Expectations,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/14/713195695/sunday-politics-mueller-report-expectations?station=KXJZ_FM,"This week, Congress and the public await the expected release of the Mueller report — or at least what Attorney General William Barr is willing to let them see.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
This week, Congress and the public await the expected release of the Mueller report - or at least what Attorney General William Barr is willing to let them see. What will it say? How much will it be redacted? What will the president tweet about it? Joining me now to discuss this and other political news of the day is national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
Good morning, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Sacha.
PFEIFFER: Mara, when the Mueller report comes out, what are the key elements Congress will be looking for?
LIASSON: Well, Congress has asked for the report and all the underlying investigative materials. It's - I doubt they'll get everything that they want, so there's going to be a big fight about getting as much material as they're calling for. What we're watching for is what in the report explains why Bob Mueller decided not to make a conclusion about obstruction of justice. We'll be looking and Congress will be looking for what he says about Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. He didn't think any of them rose to the legal crime of conspiracy.
But, you know, Congress is very suspicious of Attorney General William Barr's redactions because last week he repeated the unfounded claim of the president that somehow the Justice Department had spied on Trump and his campaign. It was court-approved surveillance, surveillance approved by a judge. But suspicions are now running high. And the president has tweeted - why should the Democrats in Congress have a right to examine the report? - which is a very basic, simple question with a simple answer. Article 1 says that Congress is a separate and equal branch of government and they have a right to oversee the Justice Department.
So he has been now, again, calling the report treasonous and saying that it should not be released after previously he said he was fine with it coming out.
PFEIFFER: Right. And what do you make of that? So why the criticism of it while sort of simultaneously claiming that it largely clears him?
LIASSON: Well, I think originally, he really wanted to establish a narrative based on Barr's summary of the Mueller report - that it completely exonerated him. Then there were a whole bunch of reports that the summary did not accurately reflect what was in the report and the suggestion that there were a lot of negative things in that report about the president. So he went back to attacking the Mueller report - trying to undermine its credibility - so that when it does come out, he can dismiss it as a partisan witch hunt.
PFEIFFER: And is that undermining campaign viewed as working?
LIASSON: Actually not. And what's so interesting about public opinion since Barr's summary was released is that it hasn't really moved at all. Big chunks of the public still believe the president has not been exonerated despite the fact that he's been repeating that he's been totally and completely exonerated. And that's because so much of the American public is so locked in. Seventy percent of Americans are - either strongly disapprove of Donald Trump or strongly approve of him. It's about, you know, 40 who strongly disapprove, about 29 who strongly approve. It shows you that even though he can dominate the media narrative, he can't always win the argument.
PFEIFFER: Different issue, which is WikiLeaks, which was in the news this week - last week, Trump said, I know nothing about WikiLeaks. That's quite different from when he said, I love WikiLeaks, during the 2016 campaign.
LIASSON: He actually said that about 141 times, either on tape - on video - or in tweets. And what that shows you is that - how confident he is that he can sit in the Oval Office and say, I don't know anything about WikiLeaks, knowing that every TV station in the world is going to start playing all the tape of him saying how much he loved WikiLeaks during the campaign. It shows you how confident he is that the norms and rules about how presidents should be accurate and truthful do not apply to him.
PFEIFFER: And presumably, he'll think the same in terms of issues he's expected to run on, like immigration.
LIASSON: Well, immigration is the No. 1 issue the president ran on in 2016. He's going to run on it again in 2020. And of course, he's been very, very frustrated because more and more families are coming to the border to apply for asylum. And he has offered a bunch of different proposals - closing the border, shutting down the asylum system - and nothing seems to be working. The latest thing that he is proposing is to take these asylum-seekers and send them to sanctuary cities, cities that have decided to limit their cooperation with immigration authorities. Here's what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they want more people in their sanctuary cities. Well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply. And let's see if they're so happy.
LIASSON: Yeah. So you can see here, on the one hand, this is a bit of a self-own because immigrants would love to be sent to San Francisco and cities that are welcoming to them. The mayors of those cities have already said, fine, we'll take it. So in his effort to own the libs (ph), he has used policy and families as pawns to punish his political opponents. And that certainly breaks another norm.
PFEIFFER: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
Thanks, Mara.
LIASSON: Thank you.

Sarah Walor/Courtesy of the artist In 1986, Bruce Hornsby became famous for his single ""The Way It Is."" But since then, he has embraced the constant evolution of his musical style throughout his career, experimenting with jazz, classical and even country. Never the same kind of musician, Hornsby has jammed on the accordion with the Grateful Dead and composed movie soundtracks for Spike Lee . His latest album, Absolute Zero , out now, is an embodiment of this constant motion, spiraling into whatever creative vision Hornsby has next.
First Listen 'Absolute Zero' Proves That Bruce Hornsby Is Still Up For Adventure Throughout his ambitious exploration of genre and sound, Hornsby says he always follows his own instinct. ""I'm just interested in my older age and trying to make a sound that I haven't quite heard before,"" Hornsby says. ""This record shows different ways that I'm trying to do that.""
The album features skitter-y piano, doleful strings, bubbling percussion, and inspiration drawn from other fields Hornsby admires like science and literature fiction. One track, ""White Noise"" is specifically based on his favorite work by David Foster Wallace , The Pale King . ""It's kind of a book about boredom. It's a book about IRS regional examination centers and the workers there,"" Hornsby explains. ""So this song is about tax return examiners and CPAs is as American heroes.""
Hornsby's latest exploration, Absolute Zero, is out now via Zappo Productions. Hornsby joined NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer to talk about searching for inspiration in unlikely places and how Absolute Zero came together. Hear their conversation in the audio link."
Trio Of Bald Eagles In Illinois Is Caring For Three Eaglets : NPR,www.npr.org,Francesca Paris,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/713767032/an-unusual-family-of-bald-eagles-adds-three-eaglets,"Enlarge this image Starr, a female bald eagle, looks over her eaglets in a nest along the Mississippi River in April.

Stewards of Upper Mississippi River Refuge via AP You can tell Tolstoy that not every happy family is alike after all.
Along the Mississippi River in Illinois lives an unusual family of six bald eagles. Two males and one female are caring for three eaglets — with the world watching on a livestream .
The two males, Valor I and Valor II, and the female, Starr, have been together since 2017, in the backwaters of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge.
Earlier that year the males' first partner, Hope, disappeared after a violent attack by other eagles. But the males stayed together and courted Starr, which experts say is a remarkable twist to an already unusual situation — bald eagle trios have been documented before, but rarely, according to the Audubon Society .
The birds saw three eggs hatch this year at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Stewards of the Upper Mississippi River Refuge via YouTube The unnamed eaglets, once tiny bundles covered in soft, gray down with wobbly legs and partially closed eyes, are now getting old enough to hold their heads up for feeding. They are just weeks away from being able to walk and tear up their own food — and eventually fly on their own.
And their parents are always keeping the pantry full, according to the Stewards of the Upper Mississippi River Refuge . On the menu are fish, fowl and the occasional muskrat and turtle.
It's an all-hands-on-deck co-parenting situation, with all three taking a role in maintaining the nest, incubating the eggs and raising the young, according to the stewards.
As the Audubon Society writes, ""Refuge biologists don't know for sure whether Valor I and Valor II have both fathered eaglets in this case, but based on the mating they've observed, the odds are good.""
And the trio is expected to stay together, say the stewards, as eagles mate for life.
Meanwhile in southwest Florida, two longtime bald eagle residents have recovered from nest devastation to hatch two eaglets of their own.
The pine tree that housed "" Vic and Nic "" toppled during Hurricane Irma in 2017, according to Eagle Country , which operates the livestream of their nest. The couple rebuilt in an adjacent tree, but their nest was blown out of the tree late last year. They hustled to rebuild and laid their first eggs just over a month later.
A few months out, eaglets Dandy and Spur appear to be healthy, with voracious appetites and their long, black juvenile feathers growing in.
There's been no such luck for the star eagles of Washington, D.C.
The National Arboretum's popular couple , Mr. President and the First Lady, haven't laid any eggs. Neither have Liberty and Justice , a pair living on the grounds of the D.C. Police Academy. Experts predict no eaglets for the two couples this year, as the brief window for breeding comes to a close, The Washington Post reports .
Mr. President and the First Lady's Twitter page acknowledged the empty nest. ""Who was the wise guy who said 'If you build it, they will come?' "" the account tweeted .
Okay Honey, now I’m starting to get impatient! #americaneaglefoundation #naeaglecam #mrpresident #firstlady #fona #usna #baldeagles #DC pic.twitter.com/lq07KNEiff
— Mr. P & First Lady (@naeaglecam) April 13, 2019 The couple lost one of their eaglets last year. The eaglet, Valor, was born in the spring and grew into a sleek, young bird, under the watchful eye of his parents and the many eyes of online eagle-watchers. But in midsummer he fell from the nesting tree. When he was taken to a bird rescue and research facility, he was found to be severely underweight and tested positive for West Nile Virus. Researchers said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that he would recover, and they euthanized him in August.
Valor I, Valor II and Starr have also known their share of loss. When the trio of bald eagles hatched their first eaglets together last year, one died of unknown causes before it could take its first flight.
While eaglet deaths are a blow to observers, they're a relatively common phenomenon. According to the stewards , as many as 70 to 80 percent of bald eagles in the wild die before they reach adulthood at five years of age.
But fans are undeterred by that fragility. Just like the beloved eagles of Washington, D.C., the Illinois trio has drawn a group of dedicated fans.
""Beautiful family,"" one woman wrote on Facebook . ""I watch every day.""
On another night, when storms blew through northern Illinois, another commenter wrote in with relief that the family had emerged unscathed.
""I was sending out prayers for them last night, when these storms were going through,"" she wrote. ""How scary for them! God Bless them."""
