First known as ""Decoration Day,"" it began three years after the end of the Civil War, when a former Union general called for a way to remember fallen service members. For decades, Americans marked the holiday on May 30. In 1971, the federal government officially designated the last Monday in May as Memorial Day. Here are ways you can honor those who have given their lives for this country. Read More Take action: According to the Memorial Day Foundation, there are specific customs for paying respect to fallen service members on Memorial Day: Flying the US flag at half-staff until noon Observing a moment of silence at 3 p.m. local time Placing flags or flowers on veterans' graves How to help: Here are some charities aiding families of service members who died serving their country: The Comfort Crew for Military Kids: Provides resources to help military kids and their families connect and build resiliency. Tragedy Assistance Program: Offers a variety of programs to those grieving the death of a loved one serving in our Armed Forces.

A man fulfills his quest to visit all 419 US national parks in a single journey,www.cnn.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/mikah-meyer-national-park-road-trip-trnd/index.html,"Search Menu A man fulfills his quest to visit all 419 US national parks in a single journey LaRell Reynolds, CNN • Updated 29th May 2019 Facebook Twitter Email After 1,095 days and more than 75,000 miles on the road, Mikah Meyer is home, having fulfilled his dream of visiting all 419 US national parks in a single, grueling journey. Meyer, 33, set out three years ago on an ambitious road trip in honor of his late father, leaving behind his life in Washington, D.C., and taking up residence in a cargo van. ""Life is too short to delay your dreams,"" Meyer says. It's a mantra he repeated to himself as he ventured solo across the United States . He claims to be the only person to have traveled to every US national park in a single journey. Meyer was only 19 when his father, a Lutheran pastor, died of cancer. Days after the funeral, Meyer says he went on his first independent road trip as a way to grieve. He and his father had bonded over their many road trips together, Meyer says.

Even after saving up for the trip in his 20s, he still didn't have enough cash by the time he was ready to begin. To stretch his limited funds, he slept in his van, which he outfitted with a bed and solar-powered fridge. Van life was ""not nearly as glamorous as what you see on social media,"" he said. Much of his time was spent on logistics, and he relied on wifi from public libraries and fast food restaurants. Not least among the hardships he faced on the road: loneliness. It's been ""very difficult on the psyche"" to be away from family and friends for three years. Honoring his father During his trip, Meyer listened to stories about his father from his dad's friends and colleagues. Some even reached out to Meyer to sing at their churches when he visited. It was thanks to congregants in those churches who donated funds that Meyer could afford to continue. ""This trip has been a ministry in many ways,"" Meyer says. Meyer says he felt his father's spirit especially during a visit to the Dinosaur National Monument at the Utah-Colorado border. In the park, Meyer encountered a wild Canadian goose that followed him around all day. ""George the Goose"" refused to leave Meyer's side, even braving rapid rivers to stay close to him. (Geese hold symbolic significance in Lutheranism, Meyer says.) l"
Inside the prestigious NYPD team with one focus: hate crimes - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/hate-crimes-nypd-pride-progress/index.html,"(CNN) When a subway ride in Queens last November became the setting of an anti-gay attack, New York Police turned to a team set up for just such an incident: the Hate Crime Task Force.
Just two weeks later, a 54-year-old man was arrested in the case. And that swift resolution, detective Ashley Breton told CNN, was one of the most memorable cases he's solved since he decided to join the prestigious task force two years ago. ""I would say that it's a very important unit to have because at any time, any incident could cause community unrest, which is something that no one wants to deal with -- (as) a member of the community or (as) a member of the New York City police department,"" he said. CNN recently spoke to Breton and other members of the Hate Crime Task Force as New York City is set to host WorldPride , an international celebration of the LGBTQ movement in June. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, the series of riots in Greenwich Village that is considered a turning point for the modern gay rights movement. Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, the commanding officer of the Hate Crime Task Force, said he has not seen a hate crime incident at a Pride event in New York City. And his team is working with the FBI and the Department of Justice to keep it that way. Read More ""As far back as I've looked up, I've never seen an incident related to Pride Week,"" Molinari said. ""But as a response unit to an event, we have to be ready to respond."" Mark Molinari leads the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force as it investigates crimes of bias in New York City. But their absence at Pride does not mean hate crimes aren't an issue in a city as diverse as New York. There were a total of 353 hate crime complaints in 2018, according to data from the NYPD. The number of anti-LGBT hate crime complaints declined slightly from 2017 to 2018, falling from 59 to 51 complaints, according to NYPD stats . Of the 51 anti-LGBT hate crime complaints last year, 35 were anti-gay, 5 were anti-lesbian and 11 were anti-transgender, the data shows. For Molinari and the Hate Crime Task Force, each one is important, no matter its severity. ""Criminal mischief, swastikas, property damage are no different to us than robberies and assaults. They're all victimizing an entire community -- sometimes a world-wide community -- so not being able to get closure for that community is difficult for all of us here,"" Molinari said. ""Our cases don't just victimize the victim. They victimize a group,"" he added. How the task force works The Hate Crime Task Force was launched under Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2000 as part of an initiative to enhance hate crime investigations and prosecutions. ""Every hate crime is a crime against our city, since it strikes at the diversity upon which New York thrives,"" Giuliani said at the time. It's now made up of 17 detectives and is called into action when investigators believe that a crime has some elements of bias. At that point, a task force detective will go and interview the victim, inspect the scene and conduct other investigative work. Finding their authentic selves: Transgender and over 50 Many of the task force's members have diverse backgrounds or language skills that come in handy when speaking with victims and their communities. Detective Breton, for example, speaks French, and his partner Salah Ali speaks Arabic. Ali said he joined the task force specifically because he thought his background as a Muslim of Arab descent would be of value to the team. ""A place like this there's definitely a lot of great feelings when you do find the perpetrators, and you give the victims justice and be able to give them peace of mind,"" Ali said. ""Because once they are victimized in this type of cases it's hard. It's not your typical assault. There's a lot of trauma that goes into it because of the way they are being targeted because of their race, religion, gender,"" he said. Molinari said some detectives average two to three cases a month. And that low case load means they get to work their cases hard, he said. However, Molinari said they have seen spikes in hate crimes during the last few election seasons. ""Looking back over (a) 25-year history, any world events that go on usually causes a little bit of a spike,"" he said. The names of victims of bias crimes are displayed on ribbons at a church on Christopher Street in New York City on May 22, 2013. But overall, he said not all LGBTQ hate crimes are reported to police because of the victim's fears. ""I've read reports on that victims are afraid of being outed if their family, their friends, their employer don't know their sexual orientation or gender they identify as,"" he explained. ""They don't want to report to the police because then they're going to be outed that they were attacked for their gender (identity) or sexual orientation. So that is a stumbling block for us."" Hate crimes in New York The majority of hate crimes in New York City are anti-Jewish, and they are primarily instances of property damage, such as swastika graffiti or broken property, Molinari said. Anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, on the other hand, tend to be physical confrontations, Molinari said. Pride beyond parades: How the LGBTQ celebration is enjoyed around the US ""When you're getting into LGBTQ (hate crimes), a lot of them are more personal interaction,"" he said. ""There's aggravated harassments, which (are) just basically a threat or a push with some slurs thrown in, or because their identities are related, or assaults coupled with derogatory language."" For example, in March 2017, a man stabbed two people and threatened another outside a gay night club in Brooklyn in what police said was an anti-gay attack. The Hate Crime Task Force investigated, and a 34-year-old local rapper turned himself into police after surveillance video of the incident was released. The man was found guilty earlier this year and sentenced to 21 years in prison, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said . Focusing on the victims While the Hate Crime Task Force focuses on finding the perpetrator of a hate crime, a related group focuses on the victims. Kathryn Clark-Hilliard is the manager of the Crime Victims Assistance Program, which works in partnership with the NYPD to put victim advocates in every police precinct in all five boroughs of New York. Their job is to work with crime victims who may be fearful or traumatized and provide them with support and resources. ""It can be very traumatizing after (an attack), and to be able to have an advocate that's able to talk with them in the precinct and link them to services that they may not even know about can be really supportive,"" Clark-Hilliard said. Clark-Hilliard said that work can mean setting victims up with community-based organizations, counseling or walking them through the police process ahead of them. ""For someone that has experienced a hate crime, that is really an attack on their identity,"" she said. ""It affects their personhood because, essentially, they feel that something that's true to themselves has been really attacked, and that can leave them feeling quite vulnerable."""
What it's like to be transgender in the military as new recruits are banned - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/politics/transgender-military-ban-jordan-lively-profile/index.html,"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) Jordan Lively, a specialist in the US Army, hated using the women's facilities at basic training and wearing the cinched top of a woman's uniform.
His wife, Malaina Lively, hated lying to friends and family about his gender before he came out to them as a transgender man. She hated the toll the secret took on their relationship. But as soon as Jordan spoke his truth to a therapist, he faced another decision: Would he come out to his command and start transitioning under the Trump administration's policy limiting transgender people from serving? The new policy , which took effect on April 12, prevents transgender people from joining the military as new recruits unless they are willing to serve in the sex they were assigned at birth, in what's widely regarded as a de facto ban. Read More Yet those who began -- or had since finished -- transitioning under the military's short-lived open service policy could continue serving openly under certain conditions. Now, many wonder how long the stalemate between the administration and active transgender troops will last -- and what could come next. The updated policy affected an estimated 14,700 transgender troops , most of whom faced a difficult choice in the weeks before the effective date arrived: whether to out themselves prematurely, remain closeted, or face being discharged. The Department of Defense says the policy aims to ensure a military force that is ""worldwide deployable and combat effective."" It is not a ban, a spokesperson said in an email to CNN, but ""a policy on gender dysphoria ,"" a condition in which a person's gender does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. The updated policy excludes prospective recruits who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria from serving, even though no evidence suggests that gender dysphoria impairs readiness. And the policy nevertheless allows active transgender troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria before April 12 to serve openly. Or so it seems, for the time being. The badges and rank for Jordan Lively, a specialist in the US Army, are seen on his uniform. With the April 12 ""deadline"" looming, Jordan said he obtained a diagnosis of gender dysphoria to avoid having to choose between a job he loved and being himself. As long as he had the diagnosis, he could choose if and when to come out to his command and start transitioning. ""I wanted that choice to be mine, regardless of the ban,"" he said. It turned out to be a positive step forward for him, but the policy has left others in limbo while shutting out prospective troops at a time when recruitment goals are not being met. Meanwhile, Jordan's wife worries that President Trump might still do something to interrupt her husband's service -- or his transition. ""I feel like he wants an army of people just like him and I fear that he's going to do something incredibly insane to get what he wants,"" Malaina said. Jordan echoes her concern, albeit in less strident tones. He's still serving, after all, and the President is his commander in chief. But he does not take for granted that on any day, a single tweet could upend his world, just like it did two years ago. 'The military is the troops and their families' Now that Jordan is out, the couple is focused on finding their people in the military community of Colorado Springs, Colorado. They moved here almost two years ago for Jordan's job as a combat medic. Although he's based out of Fort Carson, he's gone for months at a time on deployment, providing emergency medical treatment to infantry and reconnaissance platoons in Afghanistan. As much as he loves his job, he feared how fellow soldiers would treat him if he came out. He's heard the cruel, dismissive way some of them speak about transgender people and worried they might turn on him. But he has also met allies and other gender nonconforming people, and they helped ground him, he said. That's how the Livelys found themselves surrounded by other LGBTQ military families on Easter Sunday at Logan and Laila Ireland's home on Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. Laila Ireland, an Army veteran, transitioned while serving when it was against policy to do so. As noon approached, guests streamed into the home with arms full of desserts and sides, leaving their shoes at the door. Some children clung to their parents while others hovered at the back door, gleefully spotting hidden Easter eggs in the backyard. ""This is the military,"" Laila said, gesturing to the room full of adults and children, as she chopped vegetables. ""The military is the troops and their families."" A guitar came out and an impromptu sing-along commenced, all before the crowd joined hands in a prayer circle to bless the food. The Irelands host regular ""family gatherings"" like this, an intimate extension of their public advocacy as a transgender military couple that fights for LGBTQ-friendly policies. The Irelands both transitioned while serving when it was against policy to do so. Logan had the support of his command, Laila didn't. Now he's an Air Force staff sergeant and she works at the Army Hospital in Colorado Springs, their home for the past three years. Framed magazine spreads and newspaper articles hang on a wall, creating a timeline of their work. One story recounts Logan's transition. Another marks the day in 2016 when the open service policy took effect, thanks in part to Logan's advocacy. The latest spread from 2018, which includes Laila, reads ""Transgender and under siege."" In their backyard, Logan grilled meat for the crowd growing inside. He says he has no doubt that the ban will end one day, because there's no factual basis or evidence supporting its necessity. Current military leaders have testified to Congress that transgender troops have not affected cohesion, while retired military leaders have decried the policy as misguided and damaging. A 2016 RAND Corporation study commissioned by the Defense Department concluded the number of transgender service members ""seeking transition related care is so small"" that it would likely have a ""marginal impact"" on health care costs and military readiness. Logan Ireland is a staff sergeant in the Air Force who says he has no doubt that the ban will end one day. But Logan admits he's not sure how the ban will be repealed. The best hope, he says, is four lawsuits challenging the ban on constitutional grounds, which are still in play. Although the US Supreme Court lifted an injunction that let the ban take effect, the high court did not rule on the ban's constitutionality. Congress could also take action, although Logan acknowledges it's not likely under this administration. But he has faith that common sense will prevail, he said, because it happened before in 2016 with the open service policy, and at other points in American history, including the Civil Rights era, when barriers to equal treatment came down. ""I have no doubt that we have the support of military leadership,"" he said. ""I believe in our country, in our values as Americans, to do the right thing."" In the meantime, he regards his service as more vital than ever to proving his detractors wrong, especially as the number of transgender service members will gradually dwindle. Besides, he acknowledged, he's among the lucky few who were ""grandfathered"" in to service. He said he's more worried about those who are transitioning under the new policy, given what he and others consider its confusing and conflicting language. Other transgender troops who were grandfathered in under the new policy are wondering if it will influence how colleagues treat them. Army Capt. Alivia Stehlik is one of those people. A graduate of West Point and Ranger School, she spent long periods in the field as a soldier before becoming a physical therapist stationed at Fort Carson. Army Capt. Alivia Stehlik, the physical therapist for the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, hopes she can keep her job in the military. She loves caring for soldiers. Each day of positive interactions with patients and coworkers confirms that she's in the right job, she said. Since transitioning under the open service policy, she can't recall a single instance when someone reacted negatively to her -- or gave her preferential treatment -- because she's transgender. Now, she worries that may change. ""I just will always wonder if I am being recognized for what I've done -- the good or the bad -- or if it's become I'm trans,"" she said. ""I grew up as a heterosexual white man in America. It never occurred to me that I would be judged on anything other than my merits,"" she said. ""Now, I'm going to wonder."" Stehlik greeted the Livelys as they entered the Irelands' home. She met Jordan in 2018 when they were both deployed in Afghanistan. But Jordan never discussed being transgender with Stehlik. Jordan said he wasn't ready then. But now, he is, despite the uncertainty that clouds his employment. Waiting for the final step The change in Jordan was instant as soon he came out to the therapist, his wife says. ""He couldn't stop smiling for two weeks,"" she says. And with that, he decided to start transitioning, physically and socially. The policy allowed active servicemembers with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before April 12 to transition if they wished to do so -- as long as their command signed off on their treatment plan and it does not affect troop readiness. Jordan Lively and his wife Malaina Lively waited anxiously for Jordan's company commander to sign off on the paperwork for his gender transition. Jordan's therapist started making calls and scheduling appointments the same day he was in the office, the couple says. Within the next few weeks, he had a gender dysphoria diagnosis and the necessary blood tests had been performed so he could start taking testosterone, the first step in physically transitioning. But in order to start hormone treatment, Jordan's company commander had to sign off on paperwork. For weeks, Malaina tried not to think about it as they waited for the phone call. ""It was another reminder of how they control our lives,"" she said. Fort Carson's public affairs office referred CNN to the Department of Defense for comment. Then, finally, days before he was set to leave again, his command approved his treatment plan, he said. It's a day he'll never forget, he said, when his first sergeant handed him back his treatment plan and told him congratulations and good luck. It gives him hope, he said, that no matter what happens, his military family will always have his back."

And the policy nevertheless allows active transgender troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria before April 12 to serve openly. Or so it seems, for the time being. The badges and rank for Jordan Lively, a specialist in the US Army, are seen on his uniform. With the April 12 ""deadline"" looming, Jordan said he obtained a diagnosis of gender dysphoria to avoid having to choose between a job he loved and being himself. As long as he had the diagnosis, he could choose if and when to come out to his command and start transitioning. ""I wanted that choice to be mine, regardless of the ban,"" he said. It turned out to be a positive step forward for him, but the policy has left others in limbo while shutting out prospective troops at a time when recruitment goals are not being met. Meanwhile, Jordan's wife worries that President Trump might still do something to interrupt her husband's service -- or his transition. ""I feel like he wants an army of people just like him and I fear that he's going to do something incredibly insane to get what he wants,"" Malaina said. Jordan echoes her concern, albeit in less strident tones. He's still serving, after all, and the President is his commander in chief. But he does not take for granted that on any day, a single tweet could upend his world, just like it did two years ago. 'The military is the troops and their families' Now that Jordan is out, the couple is focused on finding their people in the military community of Colorado Springs, Colorado. They moved here almost two years ago for Jordan's job as a combat medic. Although he's based out of Fort Carson, he's gone for months at a time on deployment, providing emergency medical treatment to infantry and reconnaissance platoons in Afghanistan. As much as he loves his job, he feared how fellow soldiers would treat him if he came out. He's heard the cruel, dismissive way some of them speak about transgender people and worried they might turn on him. But he has also met allies and other gender nonconforming people, and they helped ground him, he said. That's how the Livelys found themselves surrounded by other LGBTQ military families on Easter Sunday at Logan and Laila Ireland's home on Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. Laila Ireland, an Army veteran, transitioned while serving when it was against policy to do so. As noon approached, guests streamed into the home with arms full of desserts and sides, leaving their shoes at the door. Some children clung to their parents while others hovered at the back door, gleefully spotting hidden Easter eggs in the backyard. ""This is the military,"" Laila said, gesturing to the room full of adults and children, as she chopped vegetables. ""The military is the troops and their families."" A guitar came out and an impromptu sing-along commenced, all before the crowd joined hands in a prayer circle to bless the food. The Irelands host regular ""family gatherings"" like this, an intimate extension of their public advocacy as a transgender military couple that fights for LGBTQ-friendly policies. The Irelands both transitioned while serving when it was against policy to do so. Logan had the support of his command, Laila didn't. Now he's an Air Force staff sergeant and she works at the Army Hospital in Colorado Springs, their home for the past three years. Framed magazine spreads and newspaper articles hang on a wall, creating a timeline of their work. One story recounts Logan's transition. Another marks the day in 2016 when the open service policy took effect, thanks in part to Logan's advocacy. The latest spread from 2018, which includes Laila, reads ""Transgender and under siege."" In their backyard, Logan grilled meat for the crowd growing inside. He says he has no doubt that the ban will end one day, because there's no factual basis or evidence supporting its necessity. Current military leaders have testified to Congress that transgender troops have not affected cohesion, while retired military leaders have decried the policy as misguided and damaging. A 2016 RAND Corporation study commissioned by the Defense Department concluded the number of transgender service members ""seeking transition related care is so small"" that it would likely have a ""marginal impact"" on health care costs and military readiness. Logan Ireland is a staff sergeant in the Air Force who says he has no doubt that the ban will end one day. But Logan admits he's not sure how the ban will be repealed. The best hope, he says, is four lawsuits challenging the ban on constitutional grounds, which are still in play. Although the US Supreme Court lifted an injunction that let the ban take effect, the high court did not rule on the ban's constitutionality. Congress could also take action, although Logan acknowledges it's not likely under this administration. But he has faith that common sense will prevail, he said, because it happened before in 2016 with the open service policy, and at other points in American history, including the Civil Rights era, when barriers to equal treatment came down. ""I have no doubt that we have the support of military leadership,"" he said. ""I believe in our country, in our values as Americans, to do the right thing."" In the meantime, he regards his service as more vital than ever to proving his detractors wrong, especially as the number of transgender service members will gradually dwindle. Besides, he acknowledged, he's among the lucky few who were ""grandfathered"" in to service. He said he's more worried about those who are transitioning under the new policy, given what he and others consider its confusing and conflicting language. Other transgender troops who were grandfathered in under the new policy are wondering if it will influence how colleagues treat them. Army Capt. Alivia Stehlik is one of those people. A graduate of West Point and Ranger School, she spent long periods in the field as a soldier before becoming a physical therapist stationed at Fort Carson. Army Capt. Alivia Stehlik, the physical therapist for the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, hopes she can keep her job in the military. She loves caring for soldiers. Each day of positive interactions with patients and coworkers confirms that she's in the right job, she said. Since transitioning under the open service policy, she can't recall a single instance when someone reacted negatively to her -- or gave her preferential treatment -- because she's transgender. Now, she worries that may change. ""I just will always wonder if I am being recognized for what I've done -- the good or the bad -- or if it's become I'm trans,"" she said. ""I grew up as a heterosexual white man in America. It never occurred to me that I would be judged on anything other than my merits,"" she said. ""Now, I'm going to wonder."" Stehlik greeted the Livelys as they entered the Irelands' home. She met Jordan in 2018 when they were both deployed in Afghanistan. But Jordan never discussed being transgender with Stehlik. Jordan said he wasn't ready then. But now, he is, despite the uncertainty that clouds his employment. Waiting for the final step The change in Jordan was instant as soon he came out to the therapist, his wife says. ""He couldn't stop smiling for two weeks,"" she says. And with that, he decided to start transitioning, physically and socially. The policy allowed active servicemembers with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before April 12 to transition if they wished to do so -- as long as their command signed off on their treatment plan and it does not affect troop readiness. Jordan Lively and his wife Malaina Lively waited anxiously for Jordan's company commander to sign off on the paperwork for his gender transition. Jordan's therapist started making calls and scheduling appointments the same day he was in the office, the couple says. Within the next few weeks, he had a gender dysphoria diagnosis and the necessary blood tests had been performed so he could start taking testosterone, the first step in physically transitioning. But in order to start hormone treatment, Jordan's company commander had to sign off on paperwork. For weeks, Malaina tried not to think about it as they waited for the phone call. ""It was another reminder of how they control our lives,"" she said. Fort Carson's public affairs office referred CNN to the Department of Defense for comment. Then, finally, days before he was set to leave again, his command approved his treatment plan, he said. It's a day he'll never forget, he said, when his first sergeant handed him back his treatment plan and told him congratulations and good luck. It gives him hope, he said, that no matter what happens, his military family will always have his back."
Inside the prestigious NYPD team with one focus: hate crimes,rss.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_us/~3/jnwKzbWnHdg/index.html,"(CNN) When a subway ride in Queens last November became the setting of an anti-gay attack, New York Police turned to a team set up for just such an incident: the Hate Crime Task Force.
Just two weeks later, a 54-year-old man was arrested in the case. And that swift resolution, detective Ashley Breton told CNN, was one of the most memorable cases he's solved since he decided to join the prestigious task force two years ago. ""I would say that it's a very important unit to have because at any time, any incident could cause community unrest, which is something that no one wants to deal with -- (as) a member of the community or (as) a member of the New York City police department,"" he said. CNN recently spoke to Breton and other members of the Hate Crime Task Force as New York City is set to host WorldPride , an international celebration of the LGBTQ movement in June. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, the series of riots in Greenwich Village that is considered the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, the commanding officer of the Hate Crime Task Force, said he has not seen a hate crime incident at a Pride event in New York City. And his team is working with the FBI and the Department of Justice to keep it that way. Read More ""As far back as I've looked up, I've never seen an incident related to Pride Week,"" Molinari said. ""But as a response unit to an event, we have to be ready to respond."" But their absence at Pride does not mean hate crimes aren't an issue in a city as diverse as New York. There were a total of 353 hate crime complaints in 2018, according to data from the NYPD. The number of anti-LGBT hate crime complaints declined slightly from 2017 to 2018, falling from 59 to 51 complaints, according to NYPD stats . Of the 51 anti-LGBT hate crime complaints last year, 35 were anti-gay, 5 were anti-lesbian and 11 were anti-transgender, the data shows. For Molinari and the Hate Crime Task Force, each one is important, no matter its severity. ""Criminal mischief, swastikas, property damage are no different to us than robberies and assaults. They're all victimizing an entire community -- sometimes a world-wide community -- so not being able to get closure for that community is difficult for all of us here,"" Molinari said. ""Our cases don't just victimize the victim. They victimize a group,"" he added. How the task force works The Hate Crime Task Force was launched under Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2000 as part of an initiative to enhance hate crime investigations and prosecutions. ""Every hate crime is a crime against our city, since it strikes at the diversity upon which New York thrives,"" Giuliani said at the time. It's now made up of 17 detectives and is called into action when investigators believe that a crime has some elements of bias. At that point, a task force detective will go and interview the victim, inspect the scene and conduct other investigative work. Many of the task force's members have diverse backgrounds or language skills that come in handy when speaking with victims and their communities. Detective Breton, for example, speaks French, and his partner Salah Ali speaks Arabic. Ali said he joined the task force specifically because he thought his background as a Muslim of Arab descent would be of value to the team. Finding their authentic selves: Transgender and over 50 ""A place like this there's definitely a lot of great feelings when you do find the perpetrators, and you give the victims justice and be able to give them peace of mind,"" Ali said. ""Because once they are victimized in this type of cases it's hard. It's not your typical assault. There's a lot of trauma that goes into it because of the way they are being targeted because of their race, religion, gender,"" he said. Molinari said some detectives average two to three cases a month. And that low case load means they get to work their cases hard, he said. However, Molinari said they have seen spikes in hate crimes during the last few election seasons. ""Looking back over (a) 25-year history, any world events that go on usually causes a little bit of a spike,"" he said. But overall, he said not all LGBTQ hate crimes are reported to police because of the victim's fears. ""I've read reports on that victims are afraid of being outed if their family, their friends, their employer don't know their sexual orientation or gender they identify as,"" he explained. ""They don't want to report to the police because then they're going to be outed that they were attacked for their gender (identity) or sexual orientation. So that is a stumbling block for us."" Hate crimes in New York The names of victims of bias crimes are displayed on ribbons at a church on Christopher Street in New York City on May 22, 2013. The majority of hate crimes in New York City are anti-Jewish, and they are primarily instances of property damage, such as swastika graffiti or broken property, Molinari said. Anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, on the other hand, tend to be physical confrontations, Molinari said. ""When you're getting into LGBTQ (hate crimes), a lot of them are more personal interaction,"" he said. ""There's aggravated harassments, which (are) just basically a threat or a push with some slurs thrown in, or because their identities are related, or assaults coupled with derogatory language."" Pride beyond parades: How the LGBTQ celebration is enjoyed around the US For example, in March 2017, a man stabbed two people and threatened another outside a gay night club in Brooklyn in what police said was an anti-gay attack. The Hate Crime Task Force investigated, and a 34-year-old local rapper turned himself into police after surveillance video of the incident was released. The man was found guilty earlier this year and sentenced to 21 years in prison, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said . Focusing on the victims While the Hate Crime Task Force focuses on finding the perpetrator of a hate crime, a related group focuses on the victims. Kathryn Clark-Hilliard is the manager of the Crime Victims Assistance Program, which works in partnership with the NYPD to put victim advocates in every police precinct in all five boroughs of New York. Their job is to work with crime victims who may be fearful or traumatized and provide them with support and resources. ""It can be very traumatizing after (an attack), and to be able to have an advocate that's able to talk with them in the precinct and link them to services that they may not even know about can be really supportive,"" Clark-Hilliard said. Clark-Hilliard said that work can mean setting victims up with community-based organizations, counseling or walking them through the police process ahead of them. ""For someone that has experienced a hate crime, that is really an attack on their identity,"" she said. ""It affects their personhood because, essentially, they feel that something that's true to themselves has been really attacked, and that can leave them feeling quite vulnerable."""
Trump's not 'personally bothered' by North Korea's missile tests - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,Kevin Liptak,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/politics/trump-japan-visit/index.html,"Tokyo (CNN) President Donald Trump refused to back away from his positive assessment of North Korea on Monday, saying he wasn't ""personally bothered"" by the regime's recent short-range missile tests despite the contradictory views of his Japanese hosts and his own national security adviser.
It was a notable break in the aggressive display of camaraderie that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe orchestrated for Trump during his state visit in Tokyo, which began with golf and a sumo tournament and continued Monday with a formal visit to Japan's new Emperor and empress. The show of unity was meant to solidify the US-Japan alliance -- and at a press conference Monday, Abe insisted he and Trump were exactly aligned on the threat from Pyongyang. Donald Trump greets Shinzo Abe at Tokyo's Akasake Palace on Monday. Yet moments later, Trump's answer to a question about the missile tests revealed a different reality. He said he did not believe the short-range launches violated United Nations resolutions -- the view held by Japan. ""My people think it could have been a violation, as you know. I view it differently,"" Trump said. ""I view it as a man, perhaps he wants to get attention, and perhaps not. Who knows? It doesn't matter."" Read More By ""his people,"" Trump was referring to his national security adviser John Bolton, who told reporters in a briefing over the weekend that the missile tests did violate UN resolutions . Trump has grown agitated with his hawkish adviser in recent weeks, chafing at the impression he's being led toward war in Iran and Venezuela by an underling. Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Saturday that North Korea's weapons tests this month violated UN resolutions Still, when asked by CNN's Pamela Brown as he departed the press conference, Trump said he had confidence in Bolton. The President said he was willing to give Kim more opportunities to strike an agreement on abandoning his country's nuclear program. And he did not back away from his assessment, made earlier on Twitter, that North Korea was correct in questioning former vice president Joe Biden's intelligence. ""Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low IQ individual . He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that,"" Trump said, another startling example of the US President siding with the violent authoritarian and swiping at his political rivals -- this time on foreign soil. His answers on North Korea came minutes after hearing from family members of Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea decades ago. Abe has promised to press their case with Kim during his own summit meeting, and said Trump vowed to help arrange that encounter during their talks. Trade tensions Part of the reason Abe is so intent on securing a friend in Trump is Japan's reliance on the US in security matters -- particularly North Korea. Japan views any missile test as a threat, and Abe has made that case in more than 40 phone calls and meetings over the past two years. Yet on North Korea and trade issues, the payoff for Abe's efforts has sometimes been difficult to discern. Trump this week maintained a bullish stance on reorienting the US trade relationship with Japan, insisting the $68 billion trade deficit be reduced. He's ignored Abe's pleas to remove tariffs on steel and aluminum, though he did delay new auto tariffs for six months while a deal is worked out. He said this week that real work on a new trade agreement would not begin until after Japanese parliamentary elections in July, and added on Monday that an announcement would likely be made in August. He sounded less optimistic on a trade accord with China, which remains in a tit-for-tat tariff war with the US after talks broke down earlier this month. ""We're not ready to make a deal,"" Trump said in Tokyo, before casting an optimistic view of an eventual resolution. ""I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future,"" Trump said Royal Pageantry This week's state visit was meant as an extension of Trump and Abe's friendship, coming with the trappings of ceremony that Trump is known to relish. After a day of casual diplomatic male bonding -- which including golf, sumo and a hibachi dinner -- Monday's events were more stately and formal. Sumo, golf and barbeque: Trump and Abe bond after a tweet underscored divides In a sunny outdoor ceremony at the Imperial Palace, Trump shook hands with Emperor Naruhito and his wife, engaging warmly as he became the first foreign leader to meet the new monarch . ""How are you? Thank you very much,"" Trump mouthed as he approached the Emperor and empress, who were both educated at Western universities and speak English. Later, Trump stood alone on a podium to review a cordon of Japanese troops and greeted yellow-hatted children waving flags -- an honor in keeping with the royal family's traditions. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are escorted by Emperor Naruhito and empress Masako during a welcome ceremony at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on Monday. The White House said the two couples exchanged gifts: a viola and sheet music from Trump to the Emperor, who plays the instrument, and a desk set carved from a tree in Harvard Yard for the empress, who went to school there. Emperor Naruhito assumed the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier this month. Oxford-educated with an academic interest in waterways, the 59-year-old is ushering in the Reiwa era in Japan, a historic moment for the world's oldest monarchy. The US-drafted Japanese constitution stripped the Japanese emperor of any political power after World War II. But the monarch holds a powerful symbolic role in a country deeply rooted in tradition. Japan's new Emperor Naruhito ascends throne as Reiwa era begins President Barack Obama drew criticism when he performed a deep bow to Emperor Akihito, a show of deference his political opponents decried as unseemly for a US leader. When Trump met Akihito in 2017, he offered a nod and a handshake instead -- and he repeated that Monday as he greeted Akihito's son. It's customary for Japanese guests not to touch the royal couple, but the practice is common for visiting foreign leaders. Unlike other royal families, the Japanese emperor can only be a man. When female members of the royal family get married, they are forced to give up their titles and become commoners. Naruhito's wife, Empress Masako, began a career as a diplomat before marrying into the royal family. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump participate in a welcome ceremony with Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on Monday. "
A 5-year-old Utah girl is missing. Police have a suspect but won't say why,edition.cnn.com,Susannah Cullinane,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/utah-elizabeth-shelley-what-we-know/index.html,"(CNN) Police are searching for a 5-year-old Utah girl who went missing from her family's home Saturday morning.
Elizabeth Shelley was last seen with her uncle, 21-year-old Alex Whipple, who police arrested Saturday afternoon on unrelated probation violation charges. Police say he is the main suspect in the case, which will ""not end well,"" but they have not explained why. ""We know there are many who want to help and there are some who think they are helping by posting their concern about the perceived lack of details of this investigation,"" Logan City Police said in a Facebook post. ""They do not have all the information because we cannot release everything pertinent to this investigation."" Read More So here's what we know and don't know so far. When Elizabeth was last seen Elizabeth was last seen at home in Logan City -- about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City -- by her mother on Saturday at 2 a.m., according to Logan City Police Capt. Tyson Budge. Whipple showed up at the home on Friday night and they were all together at 2 a.m., police said . When they woke up in the morning a little after 9 a.m., though, they couldn't find Elizabeth and Whipple was no longer in the home, police said. The family searched for a while and then called police around 10 a.m. We don't know when she left her home or with whom she left. What Elizabeth looks like According to the police missing poster, Elizabeth is three feet six inches tall, weighs 40 pounds and has a slim build. She has brown eyes and brown hair, which she wears just past the shoulders. She is white and of fair complexion and is believed to have been wearing a red tank top and blue jeans. Her uncle's movements Whipple had come to the family's home for a visit on Friday night and was last seen around the same time as his niece, police say. Alexander Whipple, 21, was arrested early Sunday. CNN affiliate KSTU said police had confirmed Whipple had been seen on surveillance video at the Hyrum Shortstop gas station Saturday afternoon. It quoted a staff member as saying that Whipple had come into the store alone about 1:30 p.m. Saturday looking ""disheveled, like he had been on a binge of some kind."" Whipple bought cigarettes and beer, the employee said, according to KSTU. Cache County deputies located Whipple at about 3 p.m.. He failed to identify himself and had a warrant for his arrest for not checking in with probation after recent charges of receiving stolen property and driving under the influence, Logan City Police said. He was also in possession of drug paraphernalia, police said. Detectives interviewed him and he lied, police said. ""Mr. Whipple made several inconsistent statements at the very beginning and lied about his whereabouts which were already known. He was uncooperative throughout the interrogation,"" Logan City Police said . But we don't know Whipple's movements between Elizabeth's house and Hyrum and police are asking for any sightings of him Friday evening onward. Where police are searching The search spans a 20-mile range at south end of Cache County -- from Elizabeth's residence to where they found the suspect, KSTU reports. Police have asked residents in the Logan, Nibley, Hyrum and Mount Sterling areas to watch for any suspicious items on their property. They have also asked businesses or residences with outdoor camera systems or doorbell cameras to review the footage for suspicious activity CNN affiliate KUTV reported that police visited residents in the area where the little girl lived two or three times. CNN affiliate KSL reported that searchers had drained a canal near Elizabeth's home. We don't know what specific items they are seeking. What evidence police have recovered ""We were able to obtain some new information this morning, some evidentiary items that we've located, so we believe that we'll locate her,"" KSL quoted Budge as saying. ""There are several locations where we believe we've found evidentiary items that'll help link Mr. Whipple to this case."" But we don't know what the items are. Which agencies are conducting the search Police said Sunday that additional search and rescue support had been called in from several other counties. The search has been expanded to the Hyrum area and we continue to work leads that have come forward. We now have over 200 individuals assisting in the search effort,"" the police department said on Facebook Sunday evening. KSL said Logan City Police, the Cache County Sheriff's Office, Cache County Search and Rescue, the FBI's Child Exploitation Task Force and the Utah Department of Public Safety were involved in the search. But we don't know why they have concerns about the outcome of the search. Budge, the police captain, told CNN the case is ""not going to end well."" Where Whipple is being held Whipple was located Saturday and arrested on a warrant for a probation violation, police said. He was booked into Cache County jail and was being held Sunday on $25,000 bond. Elizabeth was not with him when he was found, police said. KSTU says Whipple also faces unrelated drug and gun-related charges. But we don't know why police have made Whipple the main suspect. ""All I can say at this time, is we have evidence to believe that he is the reason that she is missing,"" KSTU quoted Budge as saying."
Inspiring photo shows college grad standing in the fruit fields where her immigrant parents work - CNN,www.cnn.com,Amir Vera,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/us/graduation-photo-honors-immigrant-parents-trnd/index.html,"Inspiring photo shows college grad standing in the fruit fields where her immigrant parents work By Amir Vera and Andrea Diaz, CNN Updated 3:27 PM EDT, Tue May 28, 2019
(CNN) Erica Alfaro says she never forgot the advice her mom gave her when the two worked long hours together in California's Central Valley tomato fields.
""One day, I was very tired and told my mom and she said to me, 'This is how life is going to be from now on. The only people who don't have to go through this get an education.' Those words stuck with me,"" Alfaro, 29, told CNN on Saturday.
Those wise words inspired Alfaro, who dropped out of high school when she got pregnant at 15, to dive back into education.
On May 19, Alfaro graduated from San Diego State University with a master's degree in education, with a concentration in counseling. She decided to honor her parents in her graduation photos, standing in her cap and gown with her parents, in work clothes, in the middle of the fruit fields where her mother still works.
""With love I dedicate my master's to my parents. Their sacrifice to come to this country to give us a better future was well worth it,"" Alfaro said when she shared her graduation photos on her Facebook and Instagram accounts this month. Growing up, Alfaro crossed the US-Mexico border for school
Alfaro said her parents are farmers who were never able to go to school. Her mother, Teresa Herrera, 51, and father, Claudio Alfaro, 50, are from Oaxaca, Mexico, and speak Mixtec, an indigenous language of Mexico. Both migrated to the United States separately and met later. Erica Alfaro poses with her father, Claudio Alfaro.
Erica Alfaro was born in Fresno, California, but raised in Tijuana as her parents moved back to Mexico in order for her mother to obtain a US residency.
During her time in Tijuana, Alfaro would cross the border every day to go to school. When she turned 13, the family moved to Oceanside, California, with another family and 11 people shared a one-bedroom apartment.
Alfaro said she, her brother and sister used to work with her parents in the fruit fields during their summer vacations. Alfaro overcame obstacles to earn her two degrees
When she got pregnant at 15, she moved in with her boyfriend, who she says made her sleep outside with the baby months after giving birth. She moved back in with her parents.
Alfaro credits her mother's advice on education as her inspiration for going back to school. At 17, she enrolled in a homeschool program in Fresno. Erica Alfaro poses with her mother, Teresa Herrera.
She was accepted at California State University San Marcos, but during her first semester, in 2012, her son was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Alfaro's grades suffered, but she kept going, determined to give her and her son a better life -- the life her parents worked hard to give her.
""It took me almost six years to get my bachelor's degree,"" Alfaro said.
Alfaro earned her degree in psychology from the university in 2017. She was selected to be the commencement speaker at the graduation ceremony.
""The reason I share my story is because I want to encourage undocumented single mothers, and people who suffer from domestic violence, to get an education and achieve their goals,"" Alfaro said.
She said she hopes posting her graduation photos in the fruit fields will inspire others in the Latino community who are facing similar struggles.
""These photos represent many of us,"" she said. ""Our parents came to this country to give us a better life and we wouldn't be here without them.""
Alfaro said her main goal now is to be a school counselor. She said she hopes to encourage underrepresented students to continue their education. She also wants to work with domestic violence victims and teenage mothers. "
China is not the source of our problems -- corporate greed is (opinion) - CNN,www.cnn.com,Jeffrey Sachs,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/opinions/china-is-not-the-enemy-sachs/index.html,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University . The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) China is not an enemy. It is a nation trying to raise its living standards through education, international trade, infrastructure investment, and improved technologies. In short, it is doing what any country should do when confronted with the historical reality of being poor and far behind more powerful countries. Yet the Trump administration is now aiming to stop China's development, which could prove to be disastrous for both the United States and the entire world.
Jeffrey Sachs China is being made a scapegoat for rising inequality in the United States. While US trade relations with China have been mutually beneficial over the years, some US workers have been left behind, notably Midwestern factory workers facing competition due to rising productivity and comparatively low (though rising) labor costs in China. Instead of blaming China for this normal phenomenon of market competition, we should be taxing the soaring corporate profits of our own multinational corporations and using the revenues to help working-class households, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, promote new job skills and invest in cutting-edge science and technology. We should understand that China is merely trying to make up for lost time after a very long period of geopolitical setbacks and related economic failures. Here is important historical background that is useful to understand China's economic development in the past 40 years. In 1839, Britain attacked China because it refused to allow British traders to continue providing Chinese people with addictive opium. Britain prevailed, and the humiliation of China's defeat in the First Opium War, ending in 1842, contributed in part to a mass uprising against the Qing Dynasty called the Taiping Rebellion that ended up causing more than 20 million deaths . A Second Opium War against Britain and France ultimately led to the continued erosion of China's power and internal stability. Toward the end of the 19th century , China lost a war to the newly industrializing Japan, and was subjected to yet more one-sided demands by Europe and the United States for trade. These humiliations led to another rebellion, followed by yet another defeat, at the hands of foreign powers. Read More China's Qing Dynasty fell in 1911, after which China quickly succumbed to warlords , internal strife and Japan's invasion of China beginning in 1931. The end of World War II was followed by civil war , the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 and then the upheavals of Maoism, including millions of deaths from famine in the Great Leap Forward , which ended in the early 1960s, and the mass destabilization of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath until 1977. Donald Trump shows why he's a stunningly bad deal maker China's rapid development on a market basis therefore started only in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping came to power and launched sweeping economic reforms. While China has seen incredible growth in the past four decades, the legacy of more than a century of poverty, instability, invasion and foreign threats still looms large. Chinese leaders would like to get things right this time, and that means they are unwilling to bow to the United States or other Western powers again. China is now the second-largest economy in the world, when GDP is measured at market prices. Yet it is a country still in the process of catching up from poverty. In 1980, according to IMF data , China's GDP per capita was a mere 2.5% of the United States, and by 2018 had reached only 15.3% of the US level. When GDP is measured in purchasing-power-parity terms, by using a common set of ""international prices"" to value GDP in all countries, China's income per capita in 2018 was a bit higher at 28.9% of the United States. China has roughly followed the same development strategy as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore before it. From an economic standpoint, it is not doing anything particularly unusual for a country that is playing catch up.The constant US refrain that China ""steals"" technologies is highly simplistic. Countries that are lagging behind upgrade their technologies in many ways, through study, imitation, purchases, mergers, foreign investments, extensive use of off-patent knowledge and, yes, copying. And with any fast-changing technologies, there are always running battles over intellectual property. That's true even among US companies today -- this kind of competition is simply a part of the global economic system. Technology leaders know they shouldn't count on keeping their lead through protection, but through continued innovation. Democrats have an advantage in 2020, but it may not win them the White House The United States relentlessly adopted British technologies in the early 19th century. And when any country wants to close a technology gap, it recruits know-how from abroad. The US ballistic missile program , as it is well known, was built with the help of former Nazi rocket scientists recruited to the United States after World War II. If China were a less populous Asian country, say like South Korea, with a little more than 50 million people , it would simply be hailed by the United States as a great development success story -- which it is. But because it is so big, China refutes America's pretensions to run the world. The United States, after all, is a mere 4.2% of the world's population, less than a fourth of China's. The truth is that neither country is in a position to dominate the world today, as technologies and know-how are spreading more quickly across the globe than ever before. Trade with China provides the United States with low-cost consumer goods and increasingly high-quality products. It also causes job losses in sectors such as manufacturing that compete directly with China. That is how trade works. To accuse China of unfairness in this is wrong -- plenty of American companies have reaped the benefits of manufacturing in China or exporting goods there. And US consumers enjoy higher living standards as a result of China's low-cost goods. The US and China should continue to negotiate and develop improved rules for bilateral and multilateral trade instead of stoking a trade war with one-sided threats and over-the-top accusations. The most basic lesson of trade theory, practice and policy is not to stop trade -- which would lead to falling living standards, economic crisis and conflict. Instead, we should share the benefits of economic growth so that the winners who benefit compensate the losers. Yet under American capitalism, which has long strayed from the cooperative spirit of the New Deal era, today's winners flat-out reject sharing their winnings. As a result of this lack of sharing, American politics are fraught with conflicts over trade. Greed comprehensively dominates Washington policies. The real battle is not with China but with America's own giant companies, many of which are raking in fortunes while failing to pay their own workers decent wages. America's business leaders and the mega-rich push for tax cuts, more monopoly power and offshoring -- anything to make a bigger profit -- while rejecting any policies to make American society fairer.

Trump is lashing out against China, ostensibly believing that it will once again bow to a Western power. It is willfully trying to crush successful companies like Huawei by changing the rules of international trade abruptly and unilaterally. China has been playing by Western rules for the past 40 years, gradually catching up the way that America's Asian allies did in the past. Now the United States is trying to pull the rug out from under China by launching a new Cold War. Unless some greater wisdom prevails, we could spin toward conflict with China, first economically, then geopolitically and militarily, with utter disaster for all. There will be no winners in such a conflict. Yet such is the profound shallowness and corruption of US politics today that we are on such a path. A trade war with China won't solve our economic problems. Instead we need homegrown solutions: affordable health care, better schools, modernized infrastructure, higher minimum wages and a crackdown on corporate greed. In the process, we would also learn that we have far more to gain through cooperation with China rather than reckless and unfair provocation. "
Fiat Chrysler proposes merger with Renault to create carmaking powerhouse,www.cnn.com,admin,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/27/business/fiat-chrysler-renault-merger/index.html/,"Home / WORLD NEWS / Fiat Chrysler proposes merger with Renault to create carmaking powerhouse Fiat Chrysler proposes merger with Renault to create carmaking powerhouse 2 hours ago WORLD NEWS Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) said Monday that it had submitted a merger proposal to French rival Renault. Each carmaker would control half of the merged entity, it added. Renault ( RNLSY ) said in a statement that its board of directors would meet on Monday to discuss the proposal. The French carmaker’s stock surged 13%, while Fiat Chrysler shares jumped nearly 18% in Milan. The companies had been discussing ways to cooperate on products and new technologies, but Fiat Chrysler said more could be gained from a merger.
“These discussions made clear that broader collaboration through a combination would substantially improve capital efficiency and the speed of product development,” the Italian-American company said. Fiat Chrysler owns brands including Jeep, Dodge, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. It said a merger would create a company with annual vehicle sales of 8.7 million,ranking behind only Volkswagen and Toyota ( TM ) .
The proposal is the latest example of established automakers seeking partnerships to share the costs of developing new technologies including electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems. German carmakers BMW ( BMWYY ) and Daimler ( DDAIF ) have formed a joint venture that will develop ride-sharing and charging services. Ford ( F ) and Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) are working together to develop some new vehicles. The trend toward cooperation has accelerated in recent months as carmakers more under increased pressure from electric-car upstarts like Tesla ( TSLA ) and tech companies including Uber ( UBER ) . Renault is already a member of the world’s biggest automotive alliance with Japanese carmakers Nissan ( NSANF ) and Mitsubishi Motors. It’s not clear how a merger with Fiat Chrysler would affect that alliance, which was thrown into turmoil following the arrest last year of its former leader Carlos Ghosn.
Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault. The French carmaker, which sells fewer cars than its Japanese partner, had been pushing for the companies to merge.
Nissan declined to comment on Monday. Representatives of Mitsubishi Motors were not immediately available.
Regulators are likely to scrutinize any deal between Fiat Chrysler and Renault. Yet the French government, which owns 15% of Renault, indicated Monday that it would support a merger. “We have large companies which have been built outside of Europe, and today we need big companies to be built within Europe,” Sibeth Ndiaye, a spokesperson for the French government, told BFMTV.

Simon Mbo Wemba, mayor of the town of Innogo in western Congo told CNN local divers leading the search operation have also found 183 survivors from the site of the sinking. Wemba said the overloaded vessel departed from Innogo but sank off Lake Mai-Ndombe in the country's west after it hit ""violent winds"" a few kilometers before arriving at its destination Saturday night. ""There are 183 survivors, but the ship had more than 350 people on board. This is provisional as we are still working day and night looking for more people,"" Wemba said. 150 people feared missing after passenger boat sinks in Congo Boat accidents with high fatalities are common on Congo waterways, where water is a major form of transport for many living in rural areas. Read More In 2015, more than 100 people were declared missing after two boats collided on the Congo River in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. The agency said passenger boats often sink in Congo due to the age of the vessels and their operators' failure to follow rules of navigation. As many as 150 people went missing after a boat sank on a lake in eastern Congo in April. President Felix Tshisekedi declared three days of national mourning after the boat disaster and said all boats plying its waterways must have life buoys."
Germany's Bild newspaper prints cut-out kippah in campaign against anti-Semitism,edition.cnn.com,"Jack Guy, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/europe/bild-kippah-anti-semitism-scli-intl-grm/index.html,"(CNN) German newspaper Bild published a cut-out kippah skullcap on its front page Monday, urging readers to show their solidarity with the country's Jewish community in the face of rising anti-Semitism.
The move comes after a leading government official warned Jews in Germany not to wear the traditional skullcaps in public because of an increase in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. Felix Klein, the government's anti-Semitism commissioner, told the Funke media group Saturday: ""I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere all the time in Germany."" In response, Germany's most popular daily newspaper asked readers to wear the cut-out kippah as a mark of solidarity with the Jewish community, and even posted a video on its website showing how to make it. Wenn auch nur einer in unserem Land nicht Kippa tragen kann, ohne sich in Gefahr zu bringen, kann die Antwort nur lauten, dass wir alle Kippa tragen.
Die Kippa gehört zu Deutschland!

A German official said Jews are not advised to wear a kippah ""everywhere all the time in Germany."" Reichelt rejected Klein's call for Jews to limit their use of the kippah. ""To that, there is only one answer: No, that must not be the case!"" he wrote. ""If it is so, and if it stays that way, then we have failed in the face of our history."" He called on readers to support the Jewish community. ""If even one person in our country cannot wear the kippah without putting themselves in danger, then the only answer must be that we all wear the kippah,"" wrote Reichelt. ""The kippah belongs to Germany!"" How Borussia Dortmund is leading football's fight against the far-right in Germany There is mounting concern over the rise of anti-Semitism in Germany, and government figures point to an increase in anti-Semitic attacks. Data released by the interior ministry reveals that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose by nearly 20% from 2017-18, while the number of physical attacks against Jews increased from 37 in 2017 to 69 last year. Horst Seehofer, the interior minister, has said that around 90% of the reported incidents were perpetrated by supporters of far-right groups. ""This is a development that we have to confront, especially in this country,"" Seehofer told a press conference in May. ""This is a job for the police as well as the whole society."" Chancellor Angela Merkel has also denounced anti-Semitic crime in Germany and called for a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to tackling it. ""People growing up today must know what people were capable of in the past, and we must work proactively to ensure that it is never repeated,"" she said in January. This story has been updated to reflect the correct number of physical attacks against Jews in Germany in 2018. It was 69."
What's for breakfast in 21 different nations,www.cnn.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-food-around-the-world/index.html,"Breakfast around the world: How different countries start the day Casey Barber, CNN • Updated 27th May 2019 Facebook Twitter Email 21 Pictures (CNN) — When it comes to breakfast foods across the globe, there are as many ways to enjoy the first meal of the day as there are to say ""good morning."" From creamy cornbread cake in Brazil to savory Tunisian chickpea soup, from fluffy Ukrainian pancakes to sweet coconut jam toasts in Singapore, these 21 international specialties offer a breakfast option for every palate. And even if the flavors in some of these dishes might be unexpected based on what your first meal of the day typically consists of, the presentations are likely familiar. Read through our list -- in no particular order -- and learn about the delicious diversity of our world's breakfast cultures, and maybe even find food inspiration for your next trip. Switzerland On weekdays, the Swiss frequently stick to quick but filling breakfasts like the traditional birchermüesli, the granola-style blend of oats with fruit and nuts that's usually served over thick yogurt. But on weekends, it's time for Swiss brunch. Along with roesti (potato pancakes), cheeses, and cold cuts, the centerpiece of the brunch table is zopf. This braided egg bread is similar to challah or brioche, and served with honey, butter, and jam. Ethiopia Genfo is a thick porridge made with barley, wheat and corn flour, and it's a traditional porridge. Shutterstock When you're having qurs (that's ""breakfast"" in Amharic, Ethiopia's official language), chances are you'll be eating porridge. While there are many varieties and names for hot grain cereals served throughout the country, savory genfo is one of the most popular. Genfo is made by mixing barley flour with boiling water until a thick, sticky dough forms, then shaped into a mound with a well in the center. The well is then filled with clarified butter blended with berbere, the complex spice blend, and dollops of yogurt are often spooned around the edges of the genfo. Japan Japanese breakfasts fall squarely on the savory side of the food spectrum: In fact, much of what you can eat for breakfast in Japan wouldn't be out of place at any other meal of the day. Many morning repasts consist of a selection of small plates, each with a few bites of a traditional Japanese dish. Fish like salmon or mackerel, miso soup, pickled vegetables and rice are all represented. There's also tamagoyaki, a slightly sweet rolled omelet made from thin layers of egg in a rectangular pan that gives it its signature shape. Iceland Start your day in Iceland with a jolt of life-giving lysi: cod liver oil, a plentiful source of omega-3 fatty acids and one of the byproducts of the country's fish industry. Though it's been said to combat seasonal affective disorder, among other health benefits, it's not the only breakfast option. For a more palatable morning meal, have a bowl of hafragrautur, a thick oatmeal. Top it with nuts, raisins, and sugar, or add a helping of skyr, the thick yogurt-like cultured dairy product that's actually a fresh cheese. Singapore If ""Crazy Rich Asians"" didn't already whet your appetite for Singapore, let the multitude of dishes served in the hawker centers entice you further. These open-air food courts are always open for business, and it's not uncommon to see hungry people scooping up bowls of savory curry noodles first thing in the morning. For a traditional hawker-style breakfast, kaya toast is a must-have. This unassuming-looking toasted sandwich is spread with flavorful kaya, a sweet jam made with coconut milk, eggs, and sometimes pandan leaf for vibrant green color and flavor. It's great with coffee or tea, and each stall or shop makes kaya toast its own way -- so why not try a few? Morocco Along with mint tea, semolina breads are mainstays on the Moroccan breakfast table. Baghrir are thin, yeasted rounds studded with tiny holes that give them the name ""thousand-hole pancakes"" or ""thousand-hole crepes."" Instead of maple syrup, these light semolina breads are topped with butter and honey. Harcha are thicker, griddled biscuit-style rounds that have a crispy crust from a dusting of coarse semolina. They can be split like English muffins and served with cheese or butter, jam, and honey. Australia Australian breakfasts range, but a mainstay is avocado toast topped with an egg. Ben Kolde/Unsplash For those who love grain bowls, avocado and other savory toasts, and other staples of all-day café culture, Australia's ""brekkie"" will be a match made in heaven. With a focus on fresh produce, whole grains, and nourishing combinations, Australian breakfasts can range from the classic avocado toast on seeded bread to a farro bowl topped with a poached egg and pickled vegetables or rice pudding with yogurt, seeds and berries. Don't forget the flat white -- an espresso with a high ratio of steamed milk that even Starbucks can't get enough of. Argentina There's one word that defines the Argentinean breakfast spread: facturas. The overarching term for pastries encompasses a sweet and doughy world of shapes, sizes, and flavors. Some of the more popular offerings include medialunes, a croissant-shaped brioche pastry; bombas and bolas de fraille, or fried doughnuts; and churros, which are often dipped in chocolate. Many are filled with dulce de leche or crema pastelera, a vanilla custard. Pair a platter of facturas with highly caffeinated yerba mate or coffee. Germany In the land of many wurst, it's not surprising that sausage and other meats take a starring role in frühstück, the traditional German breakfast. This buffet spread is filled with variety: sausages, cold cuts, cheeses, bread and rolls (including pretzels), as well as fresh fruit, soft-boiled eggs and condiments like homemade jam. The abundant choices are meant for sampling and assembling as you please. Brazil Brazil's bolo de fuba is a cornbread-style cake with a texture both moist and creamy. Shutterstock If you can't stop eating pao de queijo, the puffy baked cheese rolls that are a staple of Brazilian culture, you'll be happy to know you can eat them for breakfast too. But for a variation on Brazilian breakfast breads, try bolo de fuba. It's a cornbread-style cake with a moist and creamy texture that comes from the addition of grated Parmesan cheese and/or shredded coconut. Sliced and served like a pound cake, it's frequently an afternoon pick-me-up too. Tunisia Fans of savory meals will love lablabi, a spiced chickpea soup that, yes, is a breakfast food in Tunisia. Chickpeas and harissa paste are the two constants in virtually every lablabi recipe, but the customizations of this simple, soul-warming soup are up to every cook. Sometimes thickened with pieces of stale crusty bread, sometimes brightened by a squeeze of a lemon, sometimes made creamy with yogurt or topped with olives, there are infinite ways to enjoy it. And because it's often topped with a poached egg, it's a breakfast that will fill you up all day. Related content 50 of the world's best desserts Bulgaria Popara follows in the long tradition of using leftover bread as the next day's meal. This warm, comforting breakfast is a childhood favorite of many Bulgarians -- it's not quite a porridge and not quite a bread pudding, but shares characteristics of both. Warm milk or tea is poured over a bowl of cubed bread, crumbled Bulgarian sirene cheese, butter and sugar, and left to soak until soft and spoonable. Sirene is a feta-style cheese that's creamier and softer than many of the Eastern European brined cheeses, so it doesn't give the dish as much of a salty flavor and more of a fresh, goat cheese-like tanginess. Turkey Kahvalti, the traditional Turkish breakfast spread, is a lavish affair that has a little something for everyone. For those who love to graze and snack, the abundant options will leave nothing lacking. Turkish breads like simit, a circular seeded loaf, or pide, a chewy flatbread, accompany bowls of feta or other fresh, salty cheeses; olives; halvah; and honey and preserves. Eggs are often cooked with pan-fried slices of sucuk, a dried beef sausage spiced with garlic, red pepper, cumin and sumac. Guam This small island -- technically an American territory -- In the Pacific Ocean is a melting pot of culinary culture, with foods that show the influence of the various countries that colonized the land over the centuries. Like many Asian Pacific nations, Spam is a favorite add-in for breakfasts of fried rice and eggs. But just as popular is the local chamorro pork sausage, a fresh chorizo-style sausage named after the indigenous population of the island. Grilled in links or patties, it's breakfast sausage like no other. Portugal Portugal's egg custard tarts pair perfectly with the caffeinated beverage of your choice. Shutterstock Coffee drinks with lots of milk are the first order of business when getting breakfast in Portugal. Uma mei de leite, a half-and-half blend of coffee and milk, or um galao, which is mostly milk with a shot of coffee, are an easy way to ease into the day. Though many Portuguese have a simple piece of toast or bread alongside their drink, the perfect pairing for these milky coffees are pasteis de nata, or egg custard tarts. With a flaky puff pastry shell and a creamy custard filling, they're equally popular as a snack for the 11 a.m. cafe break, another Portuguese morning ritual. Related content How CBD has become the USA's coolest food and drink ingredient Ukraine Tender and fluffy on the inside and crispy golden brown on the outside, Ukrainian syrniki pancakes wouldn't be out of place on a five-star brunch buffet. Yet they're made with a simple ingredient: fresh farmer's cheese, known as tvorog, with a consistency similar to ricotta or cottage cheese. The crisp exterior comes from a quick dredge in flour, like a breakfast fritter. Like American pancakes or French toast, they can be topped with fresh fruit, preserves, or powdered sugar, but like potato pancakes or blintzes, they can go savory with a side of sour cream. Jamaica For breakfast in Jamaica, it couldn't get more patriotic than eating the national dish: ackee and saltfish. Ackee, a delicately sweet pear-shaped fruit, is sautéed with salt cod, tomatoes, garlic, chilies and onion in a breakfast scramble that brings together sweet, salty, and spicy for a one-of-a-kind island taste. Though it looks similar to scrambled eggs, that's just the creamy yellow ackee, Jamaica's national fruit, in the dish. Taiwan While a glass of milk is often advertised in the US as ""part of a balanced breakfast,"" dòu jiāng takes the tradition to new levels. This fresh soy milk is a specialty of Taiwan, typically made fresh by street vendors and restaurants every morning for their customers. Served hot in the winter and cold in the summer, it's a refreshing contrast to the chewy scallion pancakes, dumplings and dough fritters that are also part of the usual Taiwanese breakfast. Dip your fritters in the soy milk for an extra treat. Related content Best 23 cities for street food from Miami to Tokyo Italy Italians are almost too busy for breakfast -- or so you'd think from the number of coffee bars where guests take their espresso standing up for a quick jolt at the beginning of the day. But whether standing or relaxing for a moment at a café table, there's always time for a coffee and Italian pastry to go with it. For the morning, espresso or cappuccino is frequently paired with a simple sweet like a cornetto, or croissant, filled with custard or Nutella. Sfogliatelle, a crunchy and flaky multi-layered pastry with a sweet ricotta cheese filling, is another breakfast standard. United States of America Fluffy American-style pancakes served with a generous pat of butter and real maple syrup (bacon if you're lucky) is one of the best breakfasts in the US. Kobby Mendez/Unsplash When it comes to classic American brunch, you can't go wrong with fluffy buttermilk pancakes stacked high alongside a pile of crispy bacon. The contrasting textures and salty-sweet flavor pairing make this breakfast a favorite of kids and adults alike. And while pancakes can be dressed up by adding in everything from fresh blueberries to chocolate chips to pecans, the classic toppings of butter and maple syrup remain the gold standard. Russia Though it sounds indulgent, caviar is actually a Russian breakfast food. Whether red or black caviar, it remains a favorite topping for large, folded crepe-like blini or small, thick oladyi pancakes at weekend brunches. On weekdays, however, breakfasts are simpler. On these mornings, caviar is spread across dark, sweet rye bread, known simply as black bread, sometimes with a smear of butter as well. Most importantly, a pot of black tea is a fixture on every breakfast table.

Huawei CEO says China shouldn't punish Apple - CNN,www.cnn.com,Sherisse Pham,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/27/tech/china-apple-huawei-ren-zhengfei/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Ren Zhengfei, the CEO and founder of embattled Chinese tech company Huawei, is defending US rival Apple.
Asked in an interview with Bloomberg about calls in China to boycott Apple ( AAPL ) , Ren said he would be opposed to any such retaliatory action from Beijing even as tensions with the United States escalate. ""That will not happen first of all, and second of all if that happens, I'll be the first to protest,"" Ren told Bloomberg. ""Apple is the world's leading company. If there was no Apple, there would be no mobile internet,"" Ren said. ""Apple is my teacher, it's advancing in front of us, as a student why should I oppose my teacher?"" he added. The comments come as Ren's company is in crisis mode. Microsoft pulls Huawei laptops from its online store Read More The US Department of Commerce placed Huawei on a trade blacklist earlier this month, effectively barring it from conducting business with American companies. The ban forced suppliers like Google ( GOOGL ) and ARM Holdings to cut off ties with the Chinese company . Top carriers in the UK and Japan are also delaying the launch of Huawei smartphones. The US restrictions threaten Huawei's position as the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone brand. Washington's ban on the Chinese company ""could stir up the smartphone industry by pausing Huawei's positive momentum,"" analysts at Fitch Ratings wrote in a note on Sunday. The ban could also benefit industry leader Samsung as consumers around the world look for alternatives to Huawei smartphones, they added. What did Huawei do to land in such hot water with the US? Huawei and Apple have had vastly different fortunes in Huawei's home market of China. Huawei shipped nearly 30 million phones in China in the quarter ended March, up 41% compared to the same period last year, according to research firm Canalys. Meanwhile, Apple saw its iPhone sales in China drop 30% in the same period. The country remains a key market for Apple. Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, accounted for nearly 18% of net sales in the quarter ended March. During an earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales in China should be boosted by ""improved trade dialogue"" between Beijing and Washington and ""very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market."" Huawei could be the first big casualty of China's clash with America But since then, trade talks between Washington and Beijing broke down , and both sides ratcheted up tensions by slapping more penalties on billions of dollars worth of American and Chinese products. The renewed trade dispute could hurt Apple, according to Fitch Ratings analysts. ""Apple could be another victim of the US-China trade war and its market-share loss may accelerate in the Chinese market,"" they said. US President Donald Trump last week called Huawei ""very dangerous,"" but then said he could see the company being included in a broader trade deal with China. Ren told Bloomberg that using his company as a bargaining chip is ""a big joke.""' ""How are we related to China-US trade?"" he said. "
Michael Flynn's case could prompt release of some redacted parts of Mueller report - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/politics/michael-flynn-emmet-sullivan-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) Sought-after parts of the Mueller investigation may be made public this week, thanks to a federal judge who's taken an unusual approach in former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn's case .
Judge Emmet Sullivan of the US District Court in DC set a Friday deadline for the Justice Department to make public unredacted portions of the Mueller report that pertain to Flynn, plus transcripts of Flynn's calls with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and of a voicemail during which someone connected to Trump referenced Flynn's cooperation. Taken together, the judge's orders look like a shortcut to transparency in a moment of executive branch stonewalling. Each of the documents, once made public, could bring revelations about Mueller's work. The transcripts alone could answer lingering questions about what exactly Flynn said to the Russians that caused so much concern among US intelligence and how a message that factored into the obstruction of justice probe into President Donald Trump played out. So far, the Justice Department hasn't pushed back on the judge's demands. But it could before the May 31 deadline. Read More Outside of the Flynn case, the Justice Department is fighting on several fronts to hold back the redacted portions of the Mueller report from the public. It's not clear at this time how many redactions in the Mueller report that aren't protected by grand jury secrecy relate to Flynn's case. It appears to be very few based on how Mueller structured the report. What's in the documents The conversations between Flynn and Kislyak during the presidential transition have only been summarized in court papers and the Mueller report so far. Transcripts of them, which may still be classified, could flesh out the public's knowledge of a major event that Mueller investigated. The calls between Flynn and the ambassador, in which they discussed Russian reaction to US sanctions and an upcoming United Nations vote about Israeli settlements, led to Flynn lying to the FBI . The calls also set in motion some of Trump's potentially obstructive acts, including his request of then-FBI Director James Comey to let Flynn go. The other transcript Sullivan demanded, apparently of a voicemail from Trump's personal attorney to Flynn's lawyer as he neared his December 2017 plea deal, is excerpted in the Mueller report but hasn't been published in full. Dive deep into the Mueller report • Read and search the full report
• CNN found 77 instances of lies and false assertions in Mueller's report. Trump told the greatest number
• 77 lies and falsehoods Mueller called out
• What Trump associates told the public vs. what they told Mueller
• 4 times Barr twisted and cherry-picked Mueller's report
Mueller instead used ample ellipses to quote from it. ""[I]t wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with ... the government. ... [I]f ... there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue, . . . so, you know, . . . we need some kind of heads up,"" Mueller quoted from the transcript in his report. In theory, the transcripts may have come out in court if Flynn had fought his criminal charge from Mueller to a trial. But his plea agreement stopped the evidence from being aired. The redacted parts of the Mueller report have also been closely guarded. Another federal judge in Washington, Amy Berman Jackson, has already received an unredacted copy of the Mueller report so she can weigh it in Roger Stone's criminal case , after his team asked to view it to prepare for his trial. It is not available to the public nor to Stone and his legal team at this time. And the Justice Department has agreed to let the House and Senate Intelligence committees look at redacted parts of the report on Russian interference as early as this week , under conditions that it must be kept secret. Even with that plan, the committees wouldn't get to see secret grand jury information cited in the report, or redacted parts of the obstruction investigation summary. Separately, BuzzFeed News and the transparency-oriented Electronic Privacy Information Center have sued over the redactions but won't have a court hearing in their case until July. Even the Washington Post, which had sued for other sealed filings in the Flynn case, hadn't asked for the transcripts or the unredacted Mueller report sections pertaining to Flynn. They didn't have the ability to ask the court for those particular documents because the documents don't appear to be in the court record. So without prompting, Judge Sullivan went there. There's also no suggestion that he's already seen the documents he's requested or has them under seal in the Flynn case file already, as is sometimes the case. ""He's certainly familiar with going rogue,"" said Brad Moss, a Washington-based lawyer who frequently sues the government for public access to documents. Because Sullivan can be so unpredictable for the attorneys practicing in front of him, ""it's not necessarily surprising,"" Moss said. ""It's certainly something I wish we saw more from judges."" A no-nonsense judge Sullivan has cultivated a no-nonsense and sometimes unpredictable reputation. First appointed to a judgeship by President Ronald Reagan, Sullivan was elevated to the DC District Court, the trial-level federal court handling cases in Washington, DC, by President Bill Clinton. Since then, he's handled several public records transparency cases and many more cases of public interest. That includes the corruption case against the late Sen. Ted Stevens, whose conviction Sullivan set aside following allegations of misconduct by prosecutors. More recently, he dealt losses to the President in a lawsuit brought by congressional Democrats over Trump's business proceeds. The Justice Department is attempting to appeal. In overseeing the Flynn case, Sullivan has already made clear he won't tolerate shenanigans. Previously, he had set Flynn's sentencing for December, and brought the former national security adviser in for what was set to be his final appearance before a judge. But because of an argument from Flynn's defense team about how his case differed from others who pleaded guilty in the Mueller investigation, Sullivan questioned Flynn's sincerity. The proceeding went from a standard judge-defendant hearing, to one where Sullivan asked if Flynn could be prosecuted for treason. (Mueller's team told Sullivan no.) Sullivan was so harsh at the hearing that Flynn's team asked the judge to postpone giving a sentence. Flynn had been seeking no jail time, and the special counsel's office said that would be appropriate because of his cooperation. ""I am not hiding my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense,"" Sullivan said during the sentencing hearing , strongly suggesting he was considering jail time for Flynn. He also commented during the Flynn hearing his disagreement with the probation-only sentence given to Gen. David Petraeus by another judge for sharing classified information. At the end of the hearing, he told both Mueller's team and Flynn's he still had questions about the case, such as how Flynn's lies impacted Mueller's work. The sentencing hasn't been rescheduled yet. ""We saw a judge in Sullivan who was prepared to sentence Flynn to jail. He's trying to make an evaluation of whether this guy is a traitor, not in a legal sense, but behaved with bad purpose and judgment,"" said Michael Zeldin, a former federal prosecutor who is now a CNN legal analyst. While he's still handling Flynn, Sullivan appears to be using his authority to wedge open more public access to that part of the investigation. He's already ordered the Justice Department to put the redacted version of the Mueller report previously released on the agency's website into the court record, which is available online. But on May 17, when prosecutors tried to do this, the file was too big. Their backup plan was to hand-deliver a printed copy to Sullivan's chambers instead. That wouldn't do for Sullivan. He ordered the Justice Department to break it into pieces and still file the 448-page document publicly in the court record."

"As self-driving cars take to the road, drivers will still be in high demand - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Gad Levanon and Frank Steemers for CNN Business,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/perspectives/human-driver-jobs-self-driving-cars/index.html,"Gad Levanon is the chief US economist at The Conference Board. Frank Steemers is an associate economist at The Conference Board. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.
Tesla's Elon Musk recently announced plans to start deploying driverless taxis across the United States next year. It was the latest reminder of how a driverless-car future captures the imaginations of visionaries but terrifies those who drive for a living.
For the short term, however, those fears are overblown. Through at least the next decade, human truck drivers, bus drivers and taxi drivers will remain in strong demand. And during that time, self-driving technology will put little, if any, dent in that demand. What accounts for drivers being such a hot commodity? Labor shortages have afflicted a broad swath of blue-collar industries, including the transportation sector. Simple economics explains the gap: Demand exceeds supply. And in this case, by huge margins. Several factors have diminished the supply of available workers. According to our own calculations based on microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey , the transportation industry employs a relatively large share of older workers, who are steadily leaving the workforce. Read More Meanwhile, as these Baby Boomers retire in droves, the industry struggles to recruit enough workers to replace them. As an increasing number of young people pursue college degrees, they're shying away from such blue-collar work and flocking to white-collar jobs. The prospect of a future economy saturated with driverless cars and trucks probably isn't helping either. After all, why start a career in a job that AI may someday obviate? And then there are drug-testing requirements. Such rules reduce the number of prospects who can pass the needed test for working in some transportation jobs. It's not that the tests have become more stringent. Finding workers who can pass them has become more of a hurdle simply due to the number of states that have decriminalized or legalized marijuana . At the same time the supply of drivers has decreased, the demand for them has substantially increased. The swell of e-commerce accounts for much of the growing demand. For example, the ever-growing Amazon needs thousands of warehouse workers to store and package its products, and thousands of drivers to transport its products. Case in point: Our own analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that from 2013 to 2018, employment in the transportation and warehousing industries increased by over 20%, vs. 9% across the total economy . More Markets & Economy Perspectives Bernie Sanders: Banks have been ripping off Americans for too long
Where Trump went wrong in the US-China trade war
The US-China trade war hurts American families
This combination — strong demand and weak supply — has spelled good news for drivers: The Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment data shows that transportation and material-moving occupations — crane operators, tractor operators, gas station operators and hand packagers — boast an unemployment rate of 4.7% in the past year, the lowest since 2000 when the BLS started tracking consistent and comparable data for these occupations. And these days, not only are more of these workers employed; their wallets are bigger, too: Through the first quarter of 2019, wages for transportation and material-moving workers in the private sector grew by 4.2% . Shortages in transportation — which we expect to persist for at least the next decade — are forcing companies to rethink their recruiting strategies. Among other steps, that means hiring beyond their typical pools of candidates. Businesses are now hiring more women in traditionally male-dominated sectors such as transportation and material-moving. Based on microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, our own calculations find that since 2016, women have accounted for about 50% of the employment growth in these occupations. As a result, they now make up nearly one in five workers in these jobs. But what is good for drivers is less so for the sectors that rely on them. Rising labor costs are prompting price increases in transportation and warehousing goods and are expected to chip away at corporate profits. To some degree, these higher costs will be passed to consumers. Moreover, these ripples are impacting a wide swath of industries beyond just transportation and warehousing companies. In waste collection , for example, transportation and material-moving workers make up 70% of workers. Wholesalers — especially those specializing in food and beverages — also employ many drivers. And so do retailers that haul furniture, along with mining and manufacturing companies. In the past three years, the number of workers added to transportation and material-moving occupations was roughly equal to the number of workers added to all other blue-collar occupations combined. The growing need for transportation workers will also create pressure in industries with high demand for workers without a college degree that are capable of performing physically demanding labor, including manufacturing, agriculture and construction. Down the line, employers will be eager to take advantage of cheap, automated labor. But until that day comes — and it is probably still far away — human workers literally and figuratively will remain in the driver's seat."

Venezuela's gas shortages create days-long lines - CNN,www.cnn.com,Stefano Pozzebon,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/americas/gas-shortages-venezuela-intl/index.html,"(CNN) For many Venezuelans, oil is a birthright in the country blessed with the largest crude reserves in the world. Despite wild hyperinflation, Venezuela's government has never increased the price of gasoline. Today, amid a crushing economic crisis, filling up a tank in Venezuela is still basically free -- but only if you can afford to wait for days in line.
Over the last two weeks, people from several states in Venezuela have described severe gas shortages. It's not the first time that the country has suffered gas shortages, but previous crises were blamed on bad distribution and logistical inefficiency. This time, as citizens find themselves queuing for days at the gas stations, many are starting to fear there simply is not enough oil for all. Caracas is still fueled by a steady supply, which critics of the embattled President Nicolas Maduro describe as politically motivated favoritism: Keeping the capital well supplied helps prevent further anti-government protests, after months of violent unrest. But in the western city of San Cristobal del Tachira, Lorena Amaya, 42, spent three days sleeping in her car with her sister, as they waited in line to fill the tank with gas. The two sisters parked their vehicles one in front of the other and placed a mattress in the first one to create a bed. ""Today, it's my son's birthday, and look where am I,"" she told CNN. She only briefly left the gas queue to visit her 10-year-old son that morning, while her sister held the spot. Read More ""I ask the neighbor to keep an eye for him while I am here, but he's home by himself,"" she said. Her sister Ymara, 40, describes the fuel as ""the most expensive gasoline we ever bought"" because of the three days of lost work and life that she has spent waiting in line. How this happened In 1989, large riots hit Caracas after the government of then-president Carlos Andres Perez announced the end of a gasoline subsidy which had maintained the prices well beneath market level. Since then, increasing the price of oil has become taboo for Venezuelan politicians. Thirty years later, and after five years of deep economic crisis under Maduro, oil is still cheap, but production has dropped to levels unseen since the 1940s. In April 2019, Venezuela only produced 830,000 barrels per day, down from 1.2 million at the beginning of the year, according to new data from the United States' Energy Information Administration. State oil company PDVSA is struggling to keep production afloat. Most of its machinery is obsolete and its production facilities under-resourced. Since March, waves of blackouts have only made the situation worse. PDVSA does not publish production figures, so it is impossible to know exactly how much oil the country actually produces. However, shipments from key international allies such as Russia have increased this year, suggesting that the oil company is supplementing its dwindling production with foreign supply. Maduro's government has blamed the production crisis on corruption by former managers and the increasingly painful sanctions from the United States. Since the US sanctioned PDVSA in January 2019, the company has been unable to plug into the international oil market, where it buys ingredients needed to refine its thick, heavy crude into gasoline. Venezuela's Ombusdman, Alfredo Ruiz Angulo, has said that he intends to denounce US sanctions as human rights violations , saying ""All these unilateral coercive measures led by the United States are causing real trouble for the health of Venezuelans."" For the opposition, however, the shortages are proof of Maduro's inability to run the country sustainably. On social media, the hashtag campaign #VenezuelaSinGasolina has attacked the government for failing to maintain the country's most prized industry. ""The solution to get out of this mess is for Maduro to go,"" said Miguel Pizarro, a leading opposition congressman in a statement to CNN. The shortages are also compounding Venezuela's already dire food insecurity. Venezuela doesn't have a rail system, and most of its largest cities are far away from the coast; without petrol, food supplies cannot be moved from city to city. On May 20, the country's Federation of Cattle Ranchers issued a public plea for fuel to the government, citing their difficulty in moving the cattle across the country. "
Malaysia's last male Sumatran rhino dies,edition.cnn.com,"Amy Woodyatt, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/asia/malaysias-last-male-sumatran-rhino-dies-intl-scli/index.html,"(CNN) Malaysia's last male Sumatran rhino has died, leaving behind just one female of the same rare species in captivity in the country.
The Borneo Rhino Alliance (BORA) confirmed the animal's death in a statement on Facebook on Monday, saying: ""It is with heavy hearts that we share the tragic news that Tam, Malaysia's last male Sumatran rhino, has passed away."" Tam had been suffering from organ failure before his death, BORA said. For the first time, a rare rhino was born by artificial insemination at the Miami zoo Sumatran rhinos are the world's smallest rhinoceros species, standing at around 4 feet 3 inches high, when fully grown. They are the only Asian rhinos with two horns, and are covered in hair. The animals are found in Indonesia, Malaysia's Sabah state (part of the island of Borneo) and peninsular Malaysia; some are also thought to live in southern Thailand, according to the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF). Read More Tam was the only male Sumatran rhino left in Malaysia. It is unclear precisely how many Sumatran rhinos remain, but experts at the International Rhino Foundation believe there are fewer than 80 still in the wild. BORA describes the rhinos as ""functionally extinct,"" meaning that the few animals remaining are insufficient to save the species from dying out. Tam's death means there is only one Sumatran rhino, a female called Iman, left in Malaysia. The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) considers the creatures to be critically endangered as a result of poaching and habitat fragmentation. One million species threatened with extinction because of humans Tam was captured and brought to live in Sabah's Tabin Wildlife Reserve. It was hoped he would breed with captive female rhinos, but these hopes were dashed when it was discovered that the two female rhinos at the reserve were infertile. ""I remember so well when Tam was captured and the high hopes everyone had that he could be the founding member of a successful captive breeding program in Sabah, and join the then-international efforts involving the US and Indonesia,"" Susie Ellis, executive director of the International Rhino Foundation, said in a statement . ""Sadly, those hopes were repeatedly dashed over the next decade by a series of incidents, some sociopolitical, some biological, and some simply bad luck."" Efforts to save the species in Malaysia have since focused on reproductive technology, including in vitro fertilization, but have so far proved unsuccessful. Rhinos are under threat across the globe. The western black rhino, native to western Africa, was declared extinct in 2013 . The last male northern white rhino died last year, bringing the species to the brink of extinction."

After writing and starring in a string of blockbuster movies like ""Superbad"" and ""Pineapple Express,"" Rogen, 37, has also become a respected director and producer, whose latest movie, ""Long Shot"" pairs him with Charlize Theron. With just one ""disaster"" on his resume, ""The Green Hornet,"" he's got an impressive track record at the box office. And his attempt at ""Hornet"" only failed, he suggests in a new interview with GQ, because, he didn't follow the tried and true formula he developed with his writing and producing partner Evan Goldberg: Stay under studio execs radar with a reasonable budget, and don't become a nuisance to executives. ""Twenty to thirty-five million dollars is where you're never going to be their biggest problem. That's literally what it is,"" Rogen told the publication. ""As long as they're making some $150 million movie that's a f***ing disaster, they're not paying attention to us. We're the smartest business decision they made that week, because they just don't have to worry about us. A lot of our career is just based on not being their biggest headache. Every once in a while, I meet someone, or one of my friends, [who] is their biggest headache, and it's like, 'Oh yeah, thanks to you, we can do whatever the f*** we want.' "" He also carried a major eye-opener with him into adulthood from when he was a kid growing up in Canada, taking karate lessons at the local community center. Read More ""I really always worked hard, because I recognized from a pretty young age it was one of the only things I could control,"" Rogen said. ""I remember I did karate as a kid, at the Jewish Community Center, and when I started I was the worst in the class, I was the worst of 25 Jewish kids who were afraid of getting picked on. And then just because everyone else quit, three years later I was at the top of the class, and there were 25 Jewish kids who were worse than me. And that was always tangible: Just by not stopping I became the best one. It wasn't this, like, ferocious leap. I just kept going, and slowly [other] people stopped. Because a lot of people will stop."" There you have it. Work harder than everyone around you and stay within a reasonable budget. Call it The Seth Rogen School of Success."
"Rat lungworm disease confirmed in three Hawaii visitors, CDC says",edition.cnn.com,Susan Scutti,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/health/rat-lungworm-hawaii-cdc-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Rat lungworm disease has sickened three more visitors to the state of Hawaii recently, bringing the total number of cases to 10 for 2018 and five so far this year, the state's Department of Health said.
The three cases newly confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are unrelated, and affected three adult travelers from mainland United States. All five of this year's cases were contracted on Hawaii Island, also known as the Big Island. That island is one of several in the state of Hawaii. Newlyweds contract rare brain parasite during Hawaiian honeymoon A parasitic infection c auses the disease formally known as angiostrongyliasis, which is often mild and goes undetected. However, rat lungworm can also cause severe effects on a person's brain and spinal cord, according to the CDC. Symptoms vary, and the most common are severe headaches and neck stiffness. The most serious cases experience neurological problems, severe pain and long-term disability, the CDC says. Read More The exact moment of infection is unknown for each of the three newly confirmed Hawaii cases, though one individual remembers ""eating many homemade salads while on vacation,"" while another ate unwashed raw fruits, vegetables and other plants straight from the land, according to the Department of Health. 'Kissing bug' case in Delaware raises alarm for summer One of last year's 10 total confirmed cases became sick after purposely eating a slug on a dare, according to the Department of Health. Most people, though, become ill by accidentally ingesting a snail or slug infected with the parasite, it said. The illness usually lasts between two weeks and two months, and on average, the incubation period is one to three weeks. However, an infection can incubate in only a single day or in six weeks, according to the CDC. Endemic in Hawaii Heather Stockdale Walden, an assistant professor of parasitology at the University of Florida, previously told CNN that rat lungworm disease has ""been endemic in Hawaii for at least 50 years."" He ate a slug on a dare, became paralyzed and died The parasite can fully mature in rats. Garden-variety slugs and snails, which eat rat feces, can serve as intermediate hosts, allowing the parasite to grow to a stage where it's capable of causing infection, though never to full adulthood (and so never capable of reproduction). When the parasite gets into a human, it can get lost, and in some cases ""go to the brain,"" Walden explained. In such cases, meningitis, a swelling of the thin membrane covering the spinal cord and brain, may be the result. The ingested parasite ""can also move to the eye, and you can get ocular angiostrongylus,"" Walden said. Surgical removal may be necessary in these cases. In the best of cases, patients develop mild illness and simply get better on their own. People sick with rat lungworm disease do not become contagious. Preventing an infection ""It's important that we ensure our visitors know the precautions to take to prevent rat lungworm disease,"" Hawaii Health Director Bruce Anderson said in a statement. Foodborne disease infections are on the rise. Here are the most common The state's Health Department recommends you wash all fruits and vegetables -- especially leafy greens -- under clean, running water to remove any tiny slugs or snails. Snail, slug and rat populations need to be controlled around homes, gardens and farms by clearing debris where they might live, and also using traps and baits. Also inspect, wash and store produce in sealed containers, regardless of whether it came from a local retailer, farmer's market or backyard garden. In the Hawaiian islands, about 80% of land snails are carriers of the parasite, according to a 2014 research paper .
First discovered in China in 1935, rat lungworm disease has spread to Asia, Australia, the Americas (including Brazil, the Caribbean islands and the United States) and the Pacific islands. More than 2,800 cases of human infection have been reported in 30 countries. Anyone worried that they might be infected should consult a health care provider."
Fiat Chrysler proposes merger with Renault to create carmaking powerhouse - CNN,www.cnn.com,Rishi Iyengar,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/27/business/fiat-chrysler-renault-merger/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN Business) Renault is considering a merger with Fiat Chrysler, a deal that would reshape the global auto industry and help the carmakers compete in the race for electric and self-driving vehicles.
The French automaker said Monday that it would ""study with interest"" a proposal from Fiat Chrysler that would give its shareholders 50% ownership of a combined business with annual vehicle sales of 8.7 million. If completed, the merger would create the world's third largest carmaker behind Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) and Toyota ( TM ) . General Motors ( GM ) would fall to fourth in the global rankings. Renault ( RNLSY ) stock surged more than 15% in Paris on Monday, while Fiat Chrysler shares jumped around 11% in Milan. The companies had been discussing ways to cooperate on products and new technologies, but Fiat Chrysler said in a statement outlining its proposal that more could be gained from a merger. Read More ""These discussions made clear that broader collaboration through a combination would substantially improve capital efficiency and the speed of product development,"" the Italian-American company said. Fiat Chrysler owns brands including Jeep, Dodge, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. Among its top markets is North America, where Renault does not have a significant presence. The proposal is the latest example of established automakers seeking partnerships to share the costs of developing new technologies including electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems. Ford, VW alliance may create the cars of the future German carmakers BMW ( BMWYY ) and Daimler ( DDAIF ) have formed a joint venture that will develop ride-sharing and charging services. Ford ( F ) and Volkswagen are working together to develop some new vehicles. The trend toward cooperation has accelerated in recent months as carmakers are under increased pressure from electric-car upstarts like Tesla ( TSLA ) and tech companies including Uber ( UBER ) . Fiat Chrysler said a merger with Renault would produce annual cost savings of more than €5 billion ($5.6 billion). The company said no plants would be closed as a result of a merger. Fiat Chrysler was formed as a merger of two struggling automakers. Fiat bought a controlling stake in a Chrysler out of bankruptcy following the US government bailout of the company in 2009. They were formally merged in 2014. But Fiat Chrysler is a distant fourth in US sales and 8th globally. The company has also trailed its competitors in adopting electric vehicle and self-driving technology, which many deem the industry's inevitable future. Sergio Marchionne, its former CEO who passed away a year ago, had spoken openly of the need to merge Fiat Chrysler with a larger automaker to give it the scale and resources to compete. He had even sought a merger with General Motors, only to be rebuffed. He had been far more blunt than other auto executives about the threat to the industry that new entrants such as Google ( GOOGL ) posed to old-line automakers. Nissan hits 'rock bottom' as Renault pushes for a merger Renault is already a member of the world's biggest automotive alliance with Japanese carmakers Nissan ( NSANF ) and Mitsubishi Motors. It's not clear how a merger with Fiat Chrysler would affect that alliance, which was thrown into turmoil following the arrest last year of its former leader Carlos Ghosn . Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault. The French carmaker, which sells fewer cars than its Japanese partner, had been pushing for the companies to merge but was rebuffed. While the relationship between Nissan and Renault has been strained following Ghosn's arrest, adding Fiat Chrysler would increase the alliance's annual vehicle sales to 15 million. Renault and Fiat Chrysler both said Monday that a merger would benefit the alliance. Nissan declined to comment. Representatives of Mitsubishi Motors were not immediately available. Regulators are likely to scrutinize any deal between Fiat Chrysler and Renault. Yet the French government, which owns 15% of Renault, indicated Monday that it would support a merger. ""We have large companies which have been built outside of Europe, and today we need big companies to be built within Europe,"" Sibeth Ndiaye, a spokesperson for the French government, told BFMTV. "

"The world's rivers are contaminated with antibiotics, new study shows",edition.cnn.com,"Kara Fox, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/health/antibiotics-contaminate-worlds-rivers-intl-scli/index.html,"(CNN) The world's rivers are widely contaminated with antibiotics, according to a new global study, the first of its kind.
Researchers from the University of York in the UK analyzed samples from rivers in 72 countries and found that antibiotics were present in 65% of them. Dangerous levels of contamination were most frequently found in Asia and Africa, the team said, with sites in Bangladesh, Kenya, Ghana, Pakistan and Nigeria exceeding safe levels by the greatest degree. The worst case was found at a site in Bangladesh, where concentrations of the drug Metronidazole -- which is used to treat bacterial infections, including skin and mouth infections -- exceeded safe levels by up to 300 times. Safe levels can range from 20,000 to 32,000 nanograms per liter (ng/l), depending on the antibiotic, according to new guidelines established by the AMR Industry Alliance, a coalition of biotech, diagnostics and pharmaceutical companies set up to provide sustainable solutions to curb antimicrobial resistance. Read More Our antibiotics are no match for superbugs, and it's a 'global crisis,' UN report says Researchers looked for 14 commonly used antibiotics in their samples. They found Trimethoprim -- a drug primarily used to treat urinary tract infections -- at 43% of the river sites tested, making it the most prevalent antibiotic found in the study. The bacteria-fighting Ciprofloxacin most frequently exceeded safe levels, surpassing the safety threshold in 51 places, according to researchers. The data was collected from 711 sites, and from some of the world's best-known rivers, including the Chao Phraya, Danube, Mekong, Seine, Thames, Tiber and Tigris. Where antibiotics are more common than water, superbugs thrive Researchers found that high-risk sites were typically next to wastewater treatment plants, waste or sewage dumps and in some areas of political turmoil. While safe limits were most frequently exceeded in the developing world, data from sites in Europe, North America and South America show that antibiotic contamination is a ""global problem,"" according to the researchers. 5 things you need to know about antimicrobial resistance John Wilkinson, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of York's Department of Environment and Geography, who coordinated the monitoring work, said the ""real important part of the work is beginning to answer the question of: 'So what?' Or more specifically: ""Does this contamination pose a risk to health in humans or the environment?' "" A 'global crisis' Last month, the United Nations called resistance to antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiprotozoals a ""global crisis."" Drug-resistant diseases cause at least 700,000 deaths globally a year, including 230,000 deaths from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, according to a report by the United Nations' Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance. Superbugs 'as big a global threat as climate change and warfare' Without concerted global action, the authors of the UN report estimate that up to 10 million people a year may die from drug-resistant diseases by 2030. Alistair Boxall, professor of environmental science at York, called the river study's findings ""eye opening and worrying,"" saying they demonstrate that the antibiotic contamination of rivers could be an ""important contributor"" to antimicrobial resistance.
To counter that, Boxall said, it will be necessary to invest in infrastructure for waste and wastewater treatment, tighten regulations and clean up already contaminated sites. ""Solving the problem is going to be a mammoth challenge,"" he said. The researchers will present their findings at the annual meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in Helsinki on Monday and Tuesday."

Stanley Cup Final rematch between the Bruins and Blues is 49 years in the making,edition.cnn.com,Jill Martin,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/sport/stanley-cup-final-preview-boston-bruins-st-louis-blues/index.html,"(CNN) A word to describe this year's Stanley Cup playoffs: chaos.
For the first time, all four wild card teams advanced out of the first round and all division winners were knocked out. It also marked the first time that the top teams from each conference -- the Tampa Bay Lightning in the East and Calgary Flames in the West -- were eliminated in round one. Left standing for the Stanley Cup Final are the Boston Bruins and St. Louis Blues, with the best-of-seven series beginning Monday in Boston. They last met in the Stanley Cup Final in 1970, when Boston's Bobby Orr flew through the air after scoring in overtime in Game 4 for the sweep. In an iconic hockey photo, Bobby Orr dives into the air after scoring against the St. Louis Blues on May 10, 1970. The goal clinched the Stanley Cup for the Boston Bruins. The Bruins, the third-best team from the regular season, are less of a surprise to get this far. The six-time champions are back in the final for the third time in the last nine postseasons, last winning in all in 2011. Their road to the finals had them defeating Toronto, Columbus and then Carolina to win the Eastern Conference. ""We've earned the right to be where we are, to go to the Stanley Cup Final,"" Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""We've beaten three good teams. There is some unfinished business, so that's part of the emotion that you want to keep in check. You want to enjoy it, but I think our guys understand there are still four more steps to take."" Read More For the Blues, meanwhile, it's been a long wait, and their journey from worst to first -- in the same season -- is almost complete. St. Louis fired head coach Mike Yeo and replaced him with Craig Berube in November. The team was at the bottom of the league on January 2. Now, after climbing up the NHL standings to finish 12th overall, the Blues are in the final. The Blues have never won the Stanley Cup, having been swept in their other appearances, which came three straight years from 1968-1970. ""Once we got going in January and February, I knew we had a good hockey team,"" Berube said. ""We get in the playoffs, and anything can happen. You've got to get here, and we did. Credit to our players. They battled and they believed we were going to make the playoffs, and we made it, and now we're here."" The Blues are the 10th team to reach the Stanley Cup Final after ranking 12th place or lower during the regular season. Six of those instances have come since 2006, including three under the current playoff format. St. Louis advanced through the Western Conference playoffs with wins over Winnipeg, Dallas and San Jose. Despite the nearly half century gap in ice hockey, the cities of St. Louis and Boston have a lengthy championship history.

Governor Janet Mills (D) signed a bill into law on Friday removing all non-medical exemptions to vaccination from the books. ""As governor, it is my responsibility to protect the health and safety of all Maine people, and it has become clear that our current laws do not adequately protect against the risks posed to Mainers,"" Mills said in a statement shared with CNN.

The State Senate's Republican leadership did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The law will take effect in September 2021. Schoolchildren who claimed a non-medical exemption prior to the law taking effect will be allowed to attend school if their parent or guardian provides a written statement from a healthcare professional indicating they've been informed of the risks of refusing immunization.

California, West Virginia, and Mississippi also lack non-medical exemptions from school immunization requirements, according to data maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures . Maine's new law comes amid a resurgence of measles across the nation. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 880 cases of measles were confirmed across 24 states between January 1 and May 17 of this year. Measles vaccinations are 97% effective, according to the CDC. The disease had previously been declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. Vaccines Fast Facts Maine recorded its first case of measles since 2017 this month, in a child who had been vaccinated against the disease. Maine's Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the child has since made a full recovery . Maine's CDC reported in April that immunization rates among school-age children was on the decline across the state for most diseases, and was already below the level required for so-called ""herd immunity"" -- the threshold at which enough individuals in a population are immune that disease transmission is unlikely even among the unvaccinated. The agency reported that roughly half of the state's kindergarten classes do not meet the herd immunity threshold of 95% vaccination."
The Murph Challenge: What is it,edition.cnn.com,"Mallory Hughes, CNN",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/memorial-day-murph-challenge-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) It's Memorial Day, it's incredibly hot out, and instead of lounging by the pool, a bunch of your friends are talking about doing Murph.
Murph is a popular workout created by CrossFit in memory of Navy Lt. Michael Murphy who died in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. Known as a Hero WOD (WOD = workout of the day), Murph was first posted on August 18, 2005, and is completed every year on Memorial Day by CrossFitters and Navy SEALs alike. Complete the following movements for time: 1-mile run 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 air squats 1-mile run ... in a 20-lb. weight vest or body armor Read More According to CrossFit, this workout was one of Murphy's favorites. He'd named it ""Body Armor,"" though it was renamed as Murph in his honor. It sounds intense. And it is. It takes roughly 45 minutes to an hour (or more) and is one of the most well known workouts in all of CrossFit. In 2014, 'The Murph Challenge ' became the official fundraiser of the Lt. Michael P. Murphy Memorial Scholarship Foundation. Since 2014, the organization started by Murphy's family has raised more than $1 million. Lt. Murphy was killed during a reconnaissance mission to find a key Taliban leader in Afghanistan. When the team came under fire from a much larger enemy force, Murphy knowingly left his position of cover to get a clear signal in order to communicate with his headquarters, the U.S. Navy said. He died fighting, the Navy said. So, today, when the sun is beating down on your back, when your palms are ripping open from the rig, when your legs feel like a bowl of Jell-O, keep pushing forward in his honor."

Prince William, a devoted Villa fan, looked on from a private box in the stadium and joyously celebrated after the final whistle as his team won what is billed as the world's most lucrative match. Follow @cnnsport Dutch international Anwar El Ghazi scored for the Birmingham club just before halftime, while Derby goalkeeper Kelle Roos bungled a save in the 59th minute that allowed John McGinn to head the ball out of his hands for the second goal. A late goal by Martyn Waghorn gave Derby some life in the 81st minute, but it was too little too late. ""The fans are amazing,"" El Ghazi said on Sky Sports about the Wembley crowd shortly after the final whistle. ""If you can score there it's unbelievable, it's a dream that comes true for me. It's not me that scored, the whole team scored, the fans scored, Aston Villa scored, we did it all together throughout the whole season.""

READ: Rivals are jealous, says Man City chairman READ: How Bob Marley's daughter saved women's football in Jamaica High stakes Villa is set to reap $215 million as a result of broadcasting and commercial revenue associated with entry into football's richest league, according to Deloitte's Sports Business Group. Since 1990, the third to sixth-placed teams in England's second-tier have battled in a three-match playoff to determine promotion into the top flight. Villa, which finished fifth in the Championship, defeated West Bromwich Albion on penalties to earn its spot in the playoff final in front of a capacity crowd in north London. The win marks a return to the EPL for Villa after it was relegated in 2016. It also helps ease the heartache suffered last year after the team lost the 2018 Championship playoff final to Fulham. Villa enjoyed nearly 30 years in England's top division and in 1982 won the European Cup, but it will have its work cut out next season, given that four of the last five playoff champions have been relegated from the Premier League after just one year. Last year's winner Fulham finished 19th in the top flight this season -- scoring less than one goal per match -- and will return to Championship play. Should it manage finish in the top 17 in the EPL, Villa will reap an additional $166 in revenue according to Deloitte. ""Promotion to the Premier League provides clubs with the financial resources to make strategic investments both on and off the pitch,"" said Sam Boor, senior manager at Deloitte's Sports Business Group. ""And given the relatively equal distribution of revenue amongst Premier League clubs, it provides promoted clubs with a chance to avoid relegation when they get there."" Even if the club is relegated after one season in the EPL, it will still receive parachute payments worth $95 million over the following two years, according to Deloitte. Aston Villa's Scottish midfielder John McGinn celebrates after scoring the decisive second goal on Monday. Sporting redemption Aston Villa is partly owned by American investor Wes Edens, who was redeemed after his other big sporting investment, the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, were denied their first trip to the NBA finals in over four decades by the Toronto Raptors on Saturday. The world's most lucrative match is worth at least $215 million Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videos Edens -- who spoke of meeting Prince William before the season -- and co-owner Nassef Sawiris were on hand to celebrate their club's promotion.

""It just feels great to be able to do something for all these great fans behind us, the sky is the limit,"" Sawiris said. ""Our vision is not just to get promoted, but to do well in the Premier League."" Aston Villa owners Nassef Sawiris (r) and Wes Edens looked on during a friendly match between Aston Villa and West Ham United at Banks' Stadium in July.

Paris (CNN) At stake over this long weekend, when Europe went to the polls to select its new leaders, were the seats of the 751 members of the European Parliament -- but also the very character of an increasingly discordant, even fragmented, Europe.
More than 400 million voters in 28 countries were eligible to vote over four momentous days that have now begun to yield a taste of just where the continent is headed. For Donald Trump, May has been a momentous month. First, his great friend Narendra Modi, the ultranationalist prime minister of India, swept to a landslide reelection victory. And now, in France, Italy and across parts of central and eastern Europe , nationalists cemented their hold over an important (though not as dominant as they'd hoped) voting bloc in the European Parliament. After India's, the European Parliament's elections are the world's second largest democratic vote. Who protects democracy when democrats won't? The real story of this year's election for the European Parliament, however, is the weakening of the vast middle that has ruled Europe since its creation and that has held together through any number of internal and external crises. Read More Many of these crises have helped to shape this year's contests -- waves of immigration that have galvanized the far right, growing gulfs between haves and have nots, rising oil prices, and spreading fears of environmental catastrophes. In my 40 years of reporting all over Europe, the arrival of this new European Parliament seems to hold the promise of the most seismic shifts on the continent I have ever seen. No single group appears to have achieved a controlling interest in a pan-European body that will increasingly find forces of left and right contesting for dominance. In France, even the narrow victory of right-wing leader Marine Le Pen will make it that much more difficult for the nation's centrist president, Emmanuel Macron. His party managed a close second-place finish, but as his grim-faced prime minister, Edouard Philippe, told a national television audience Sunday night, ""When you finish second, you can't say you won."" JUST WATCHED Juncker slams 'stupid nationalists' ahead of elections Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Juncker slams 'stupid nationalists' ahead of elections 03:49 Macron will struggle now to play the role he lusts after: power broker to all of Europe. This role is essential in the upcoming choice of a replacement to Jean-Claude Juncker as head of the European Commission -- and shaping the future of the EU going forward. Macron had hoped to emerge as Europe's unchallenged leader when German Chancellor Angela Merkel steps down next year as she has promised. As a first step, Macron anticipated that even a narrow victory Sunday might re-legitimize his rule in France, which has suffered from months of upheavals at the hand of the yellow vest movement and scandals within his inner circle . ""For a European Renaissance"" was the title of the platform Macron published March 5 in all 28 European states. Not to be outdone, the head of the German CDU party Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, countered with ""Let's do Europe right now,"" a chance she may have, if as expected she succeeds Merkel as Germany's leader. Just as Macron was proposing a vast centrist heart for Europe, Steve Bannon was also crisscrossing the continent, campaigning for a right-wing surge that could carry it to a dangerous dominance in the new parliament. After all, the bright and shining dream of the far right is quite simply a continent-wide Brexit just as Britain moves toward its anticipated departure from the European Union. Ultimately, this dream of the European right is centered on an end to or dramatic weakening of a single, fully united Europe. Secretly recorded video casts harsh light on Europe's far right Such an ultranationalist dream has captured many voters' imagination, sweeping its leading figures into power from Poland across Hungary and to Italy as well. Now, it threatens to seize hold in France, together with Germany the two motor nations of Europe. But in pure numbers, while they will assume an important role in the new body, it is clear after Sunday their influence will be far from dominant. But perhaps the most surprising story emerging on the back benches of the new European Parliament is the so-called green wave -- the surge of Europe's Green Parties to second- or third-place finishes in a number of countries, leapfrogging other more establishment groups. They placed third in France, second behind Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats in Germany and tied for second in Ireland. The Green showing was especially striking In Germany, where the vocal far-right party finished a distant fourth. The right finished first in Austria, where right-wing Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's party managed a substantial first-place finish even after a widely-publicized scandal , but Kurz's government did not survive a vote of no confidence in the Austrian Parliament on Monday. Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz loses confidence vote Italy's far-right leader and Interior Minister, Matteo Salvini, trumpeted that after his first-place finish in his country, he had spoken with like-minded Le Pen in France and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, fresh from a warm meeting in the Oval Office with President Trump. ""This is a vote that allows us to try to change Europe,"" Salvini said . The resounding victory of Nigel Farage's Brexit party in the UK will translate into no votes in the European Parliament if Britain does succeed in exiting Europe. Despite the surging role of the extreme right in some countries, it is still hardly a force that Europeans broadly are prepared to accept wholeheartedly. For the first time since 1979, though, the center left and center right ""no longer have a majority together. No solid majority is possible without our new group,"" Guy Verhofstadt, president of the ALDEGroup and Europe's Brexit coordinator, tweeted . Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Indeed, if there is one lesson to be learned from these elections, it is that as in much of the world, fracturing the vast political center is the rule of the day -- making any real consensus far more difficult to achieve, and a central role on the world stage for even Donald Trump's America even more difficult to realize. What leaders and observers alike will need going forward are deeply sensitive political antennae to judge the direction the new Europe may be taking."

In fact, he said he pushed producers of ""Rocketman"" for an honest portrayal of his sex and cocaine-fueled days of the past.
""Some studios wanted to tone down the sex and drugs so the film would get a PG-13 rating. But I just haven't led a PG-13 rated life,"" John wrote in a piece for The Guardian. ""I didn't want a film packed with drugs and sex, but equally, everyone knows I had quite a lot of both during the '70s and '80s, so there didn't seem to be much point in making a movie that implied that after every gig, I'd quietly gone back to my hotel room with only a glass of warm milk and the Gideon's Bible for company."" Prior to landing at Paramount Pictures, ""Rocketman"" passed through Focus Features and Walt Disney Studios.

""Like I said, I lived in my own head a lot as a kid. And when my career took off, it took off in such a way that it almost didn't seem real to me. I wasn't an overnight success by any means -- I'd been slogging around the clubs, making records, writing songs with Bernie [Taupin] and trying to sell them to people who weren't interested for four or five years before anything big happened. But when it happened, it went off like a missile: there's a moment in 'Rocketman' when I'm playing onstage in the Troubadour club in LA and everything in the room starts levitating, me included, and honestly, that's what it felt like."""

'Running With Beto' provides inside look at life on the campaign trail.,edition.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/entertainment/running-with-beto-review/index.html,"(CNN) Temporarily setting politics aside, ""Running With Beto"" is an intriguing fly-on-the-wall look at Beto O'Rourke's losing 2018 Texas Senate bid, and the nature of a grass-roots Democratic campaign in a red state. The HBO documentary functions less successfully as a window into the candidate, other than the sacrifices and occasionally frayed nerves that go hand in hand with such a pressure-cooker environment.
Like ""Knock Down the House,"" the documentary featuring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upstart run that recently premiered on Netflix , director David Modigliani captures the passion that powered O'Rourke's candidacy and his near-upset of Sen. Ted Cruz. Filmed over the course of a year, that includes highs and lows -- the thrill of victory to the agony of defeat, from O'Rourke's gone-viral response about NFL players kneeling to teary-eyed campaign workers watching election results pour in, dashing their hopes. The filmmaker enjoyed such extensive access to the candidate that the title can be taken literally, following O'Rourke as it does on his early-morning jog, as well as in quieter moments with his family. In the process, O'Rourke is shown occasionally snapping at staffers while lamenting time missed with his children as he crisscrosses the state in an effort to leave no stone -- and potential undecided voter -- unturned. Beto O'Rourke That portrait is almost relentlessly flattering, and as such, perhaps the least interesting aspect of ""Running With Beto."" There's more meat, rather, in those drawn to his message, from the volunteer clashing with her conservative family to another who posts road signs in what she calls ""Trumpghanistan,"" eventually adopting a ""Cry today, work tomorrow"" attitude when it's all over. Read More The awkward part of ""Running With Beto"" is that it comes as O'Rourke has moved on to run for president. The result is that this film could easily be construed as a 90-minute infomercial, obscuring its broader insights about the nature of campaigning in the social-media age, and the possibilities of turning GOP-dominated Texas into a battleground state. ""We've gotta run like there's nothing to lose,"" O'Rourke says at one point, having stirred the imaginations of those who rallied around him with the soaring rhetoric that turned him into a national political figure. Nevertheless, the documentary is most useful and effective as a snapshot of a moment in time, and the inherent challenges of campaigning as an underdog. ""Running With Beto"" works best, in other words, when viewed as a marathon, not a sprint. ""Running With Beto"" premieres May 28 at 8 p.m. on HBO. Like CNN, HBO is a unit of WarnerMedia."
What you need to know about the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,us.cnn.com,"Gabrielle Sorto, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is at Arlington National Cemetery. It stands on the top of a hill overlooking Washington DC. Congress approved the burial of an unidentified World War I soldier in the plaza of the then-new Memorial Amphitheater in 1921.
The white marble sarcophagus has three Greek figures sculpted on the side representing Peace, Victory, and Valor. There are also six wreaths, three sculpted on each side, that represent the six major campaigns of World War I. On the back on the tomb, there is an inscription that reads: Here rests in honored glory an American soldier known but to God. Who is buried there? Memorial Day marks the day in 1921 when four unknowns were exhumed from four World War I American cemeteries in France. Army Sgt. Edward F. Younger chose the Unknown Soldier of World War I, who now lies in the tomb. President Warren G. Harding officiated at the interment ceremonies at the Memorial Amphitheater on November 11, 1921. There are three other soldiers buried at the tomb. In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a bill to select and pay tribute to the unknowns of World War II and Korea. The selection ceremonies and the interment of those unknowns took place in 1958. Read More The Unknown of Vietnam was only unknown for a short time. After being placed into the tomb in 1984, the Unknown was exhumed in 1988. Thanks to mitochondrial DNA testing, Department of Defense scientists were able to identify the remains as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie. It was decided that the crypt that contained the remains of the Vietnam Unknown will remain vacant. The crypt cover was replaced with a new inscription that now reads: Honoring and Keeping Faith with America's Missing Servicemen, 1958-1975. Who are the Tomb Guards? The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is guarded 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and in any weather by Tomb Guard sentinels. Tomb Guards are volunteers -- part of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as ""The Old Guard."" It is the oldest active-duty infantry unit in the Army, serving the US since 1784. The honor of Tomb Guard is incredibly rare. The badge is the least awarded in the Army. It takes a high level of dedication to be a Tomb Guard. They work in 24-hour shift and when they aren't walking the mat, they are living in the quarters beneath it. During that time, they complete training and prepare their uniforms, which can take up to eight hours. What is the Changing of the Guard? Changing of the Guard is an elaborate ritual that happens every hour on the hour October 1 to March 31 and every half hour from April 1 to September 30. Visitors are welcome to watch the ceremony, but must stand and remain silent. The ceremony starts with the relief commander announcing the Changing of the Guard on the plaza. The Tomb Guard marches 21 steps behind the Tomb, turns, faces east for 21 seconds, turns and faces north for 21 seconds, then takes 21 steps down the mat and repeats the process. After the turn, the sentinel executes a sharp ""shoulder-arms"" movement to place the weapon on the shoulder closest to visitors watching the ceremony. This signifies that the sentinel stands between the Tomb and any potential threat. Doing things in increments of 21 symbolizes the 21-gun salute, which is the highest military honor that can be bestowed."
Michael Flynn's case could prompt release of some redacted parts of Mueller report CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/politics/michael-flynn-emmet-sullivan-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) Sought-after parts of the Mueller investigation may be made public this week, thanks to a federal judge who's taken an unusual approach in former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn's case .
Judge Emmet Sullivan of the US District Court in DC set a Friday deadline for the Justice Department to make public unredacted portions of the Mueller report that pertain to Flynn, plus transcripts of Flynn's calls with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and of a voicemail during which someone connected to Trump referenced Flynn's cooperation. Taken together, the judge's orders look like a shortcut to transparency in a moment of executive branch stonewalling. Each of the documents, once made public, could bring revelations about Mueller's work. The transcripts alone could answer lingering questions about what exactly Flynn said to the Russians that caused so much concern among US intelligence and how a message that factored into the obstruction of justice probe into President Donald Trump played out. So far, the Justice Department hasn't pushed back on the judge's demands. But it could before the May 31 deadline. Read More Outside of the Flynn case, the Justice Department is fighting on several fronts to hold back the redacted portions of the Mueller report from the public. It's not clear at this time how many redactions in the Mueller report that aren't protected by grand jury secrecy relate to Flynn's case. It appears to be very few based on how Mueller structured the report. What's in the documents The conversations between Flynn and Kislyak during the presidential transition have only been summarized in court papers and the Mueller report so far. Transcripts of them, which may still be classified, could flesh out the public's knowledge of a major event that Mueller investigated. The calls between Flynn and the ambassador, in which they discussed Russian reaction to US sanctions and an upcoming United Nations vote about Israeli settlements, led to Flynn lying to the FBI . The calls also set in motion some of Trump's potentially obstructive acts, including his request of then-FBI Director James Comey to let Flynn go. The other transcript Sullivan demanded, apparently of a voicemail from Trump's personal attorney to Flynn's lawyer as he neared his December 2017 plea deal, is excerpted in the Mueller report but hasn't been published in full. Dive deep into the Mueller report • Read and search the full report
• CNN found 77 instances of lies and false assertions in Mueller's report. Trump told the greatest number
• 77 lies and falsehoods Mueller called out
• What Trump associates told the public vs. what they told Mueller
• 4 times Barr twisted and cherry-picked Mueller's report
Mueller instead used ample ellipses to Quote: from it. ""[I]t wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with ... the government. ... [I]f ... there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue, . . . so, you know, . . . we need some kind of heads up,"" Mueller Quote: d from the transcript in his report. In theory, the transcripts may have come out in court if Flynn had fought his criminal charge from Mueller to a trial. But his plea agreement stopped the evidence from being aired. The redacted parts of the Mueller report have also been closely guarded. Another federal judge in Washington, Amy Berman Jackson, has already received an unredacted copy of the Mueller report so she can weigh it in Roger Stone's criminal case , after his team asked to view it to prepare for his trial. It is not available to the public nor to Stone and his legal team at this time. And the Justice Department has agreed to let the House and Senate Intelligence committees look at redacted parts of the report on Russian interference as early as this week , under conditions that it must be kept secret. Even with that plan, the committees wouldn't get to see secret grand jury information cited in the report, or redacted parts of the obstruction investigation summary. Separately, BuzzFeed News and the transparency-oriented Electronic Privacy Information Center have sued over the redactions but won't have a court hearing in their case until July. Even the Washington Post, which had sued for other sealed filings in the Flynn case, hadn't asked for the transcripts or the unredacted Mueller report sections pertaining to Flynn. They didn't have the ability to ask the court for those particular documents because the documents don't appear to be in the court record. So without prompting, Judge Sullivan went there. There's also no suggestion that he's already seen the documents he's requested or has them under seal in the Flynn case file already, as is sometimes the case. ""He's certainly familiar with going rogue,"" said Brad Moss, a Washington-based lawyer who frequently sues the government for public access to documents. Because Sullivan can be so unpredictable for the attorneys practicing in front of him, ""it's not necessarily surprising,"" Moss said. ""It's certainly something I wish we saw more from judges."" A no-nonsense judge Sullivan has cultivated a no-nonsense and sometimes unpredictable reputation. First appointed to a judgeship by President Ronald Reagan, Sullivan was elevated to the DC District Court, the trial-level federal court handling cases in Washington, DC, by President Bill Clinton. Since then, he's handled several public records transparency cases and many more cases of public interest. That includes the corruption case against the late Sen. Ted Stevens, whose conviction Sullivan set aside following allegations of misconduct by prosecutors. More recently, he dealt losses to the President in a lawsuit brought by congressional Democrats over Trump's business proceeds. The Justice Department is attempting to appeal. In overseeing the Flynn case, Sullivan has already made clear he won't tolerate shenanigans. Previously, he had set Flynn's sentencing for December, and brought the former national security adviser in for what was set to be his final appearance before a judge. But because of an argument from Flynn's defense team about how his case differed from others who pleaded guilty in the Mueller investigation, Sullivan questioned Flynn's sincerity. The proceeding went from a standard judge-defendant hearing, to one where Sullivan asked if Flynn could be prosecuted for treason. (Mueller's team told Sullivan no.) Sullivan was so harsh at the hearing that Flynn's team asked the judge to postpone giving a sentence. Flynn had been seeking no jail time, and the special counsel's office said that would be appropriate because of his cooperation. ""I am not hiding my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense,"" Sullivan said during the sentencing hearing , strongly suggesting he was considering jail time for Flynn. He also commented during the Flynn hearing his disagreement with the probation-only sentence given to Gen. David Petraeus by another judge for sharing classified information. At the end of the hearing, he told both Mueller's team and Flynn's he still had questions about the case, such as how Flynn's lies impacted Mueller's work. The sentencing hasn't been rescheduled yet. ""We saw a judge in Sullivan who was prepared to sentence Flynn to jail. He's trying to make an evaluation of whether this guy is a traitor, not in a legal sense, but behaved with bad purpose and judgment,"" said Michael Zeldin, a former federal prosecutor who is now a CNN legal analyst. While he's still handling Flynn, Sullivan appears to be using his authority to wedge open more public access to that part of the investigation. He's already ordered the Justice Department to put the redacted version of the Mueller report previously released on the agency's website into the court record, which is available online. But on May 17, when prosecutors tried to do this, the file was too big. Their backup plan was to hand-deliver a printed copy to Sullivan's chambers instead. That wouldn't do for Sullivan. He ordered the Justice Department to break it into pieces and still file the 448-page document publicly in the court record."
A 5-year-old Utah girl is missing. Police have a suspect but won't say why,us.cnn.com,Susannah Cullinane,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/utah-elizabeth-shelley-what-we-know/index.html,"(CNN) Police are searching for a 5-year-old Utah girl who went missing from her family's home Saturday morning.
Elizabeth Shelley was last seen with her uncle, 21-year-old Alex Whipple, who police arrested Saturday afternoon on unrelated probation violation charges. Police say he is the main suspect in the case, which will ""not end well,"" but they have not explained why. ""We know there are many who want to help and there are some who think they are helping by posting their concern about the perceived lack of details of this investigation,"" Logan City Police said in a Facebook post. ""They do not have all the information because we cannot release everything pertinent to this investigation."" Read More So here's what we know and don't know so far. When Elizabeth was last seen Elizabeth was last seen at home in Logan City -- about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City -- by her mother on Saturday at 2 a.m., according to Logan City Police Capt. Tyson Budge. Whipple showed up at the home on Friday night and they were all together at 2 a.m., police said . When they woke up in the morning a little after 9 a.m., though, they couldn't find Elizabeth and Whipple was no longer in the home, police said. The family searched for a while and then called police around 10 a.m. We don't know when she left her home or with whom she left. What Elizabeth looks like According to the police missing poster, Elizabeth is three feet six inches tall, weighs 40 pounds and has a slim build. She has brown eyes and brown hair, which she wears just past the shoulders. She is white and of fair complexion and is believed to have been wearing a red tank top and blue jeans. Her uncle's movements Whipple had come to the family's home for a visit on Friday night and was last seen around the same time as his niece, police say. Alexander Whipple, 21, was arrested early Sunday. CNN affiliate KSTU said police had confirmed Whipple had been seen on surveillance video at the Hyrum Shortstop gas station Saturday afternoon. It Quote: d a staff member as saying that Whipple had come into the store alone about 1:30 p.m. Saturday looking ""disheveled, like he had been on a binge of some kind."" Whipple bought cigarettes and beer, the employee said, according to KSTU. Cache County deputies located Whipple at about 3 p.m.. He failed to identify himself and had a warrant for his arrest for not checking in with probation after recent charges of receiving stolen property and driving under the influence, Logan City Police said. He was also in possession of drug paraphernalia, police said. Detectives interviewed him and he lied, police said. ""Mr. Whipple made several inconsistent statements at the very beginning and lied about his whereabouts which were already known. He was uncooperative throughout the interrogation,"" Logan City Police said . But we don't know Whipple's movements between Elizabeth's house and Hyrum and police are asking for any sightings of him Friday evening onward. Where police are searching The search spans a 20-mile range at south end of Cache County -- from Elizabeth's residence to where they found the suspect, KSTU reports. Police have asked residents in the Logan, Nibley, Hyrum and Mount Sterling areas to watch for any suspicious items on their property. They have also asked businesses or residences with outdoor camera systems or doorbell cameras to review the footage for suspicious activity CNN affiliate KUTV reported that police visited residents in the area where the little girl lived two or three times. CNN affiliate KSL reported that searchers had drained a canal near Elizabeth's home. We don't know what specific items they are seeking. What evidence police have recovered ""We were able to obtain some new information this morning, some evidentiary items that we've located, so we believe that we'll locate her,"" KSL Quote: d Budge as saying. ""There are several locations where we believe we've found evidentiary items that'll help link Mr. Whipple to this case."" But we don't know what the items are. Which agencies are conducting the search Police said Sunday that additional search and rescue support had been called in from several other counties. The search has been expanded to the Hyrum area and we continue to work leads that have come forward. We now have over 200 individuals assisting in the search effort,"" the police department said on Facebook Sunday evening. KSL said Logan City Police, the Cache County Sheriff's Office, Cache County Search and Rescue, the FBI's Child Exploitation Task Force and the Utah Department of Public Safety were involved in the search. But we don't know why they have concerns about the outcome of the search. Budge, the police captain, told CNN the case is ""not going to end well."" Where Whipple is being held Whipple was located Saturday and arrested on a warrant for a probation violation, police said. He was booked into Cache County jail and was being held Sunday on $25,000 bond. Elizabeth was not with him when he was found, police said. KSTU says Whipple also faces unrelated drug and gun-related charges. But we don't know why police have made Whipple the main suspect. ""All I can say at this time, is we have evidence to believe that he is the reason that she is missing,"" KSTU Quote: d Budge as saying."
What it's like to be transgender in the military as new recruits are banned CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/politics/transgender-military-ban-jordan-lively-profile/index.html,"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) Jordan Lively, a specialist in the US Army, hated using the women's facilities at basic training and wearing the cinched top of a woman's uniform.
His wife, Malaina Lively, hated lying to friends and family about his gender before he came out to them as a transgender man. She hated the toll the secret took on their relationship. But as soon as Jordan spoke his truth to a therapist, he faced another decision: Would he come out to his command and start transitioning under the Trump administration's policy limiting transgender people from serving? The new policy , which took effect on April 12, prevents transgender people from joining the military as new recruits unless they are willing to serve in the sex they were assigned at birth, in what's widely regarded as a de facto ban. Read More Yet those who began -- or had since finished -- transitioning under the military's short-lived open service policy could continue serving openly under certain conditions. Now, many wonder how long the stalemate between the administration and active transgender troops will last -- and what could come next. The updated policy affected an estimated 14,700 transgender troops , most of whom faced a difficult choice in the weeks before the effective date arrived: whether to out themselves prematurely, remain closeted, or face being discharged. The Department of Defense says the policy aims to ensure a military force that is ""worldwide deployable and combat effective."" It is not a ban, a spokesperson said in an email to CNN, but ""a policy on gender dysphoria ,"" a condition in which a person's gender does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. The updated policy excludes prospective recruits who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria from serving, even though no evidence suggests that gender dysphoria impairs readiness. And the policy nevertheless allows active transgender troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria before April 12 to serve openly. Or so it seems, for the time being. The badges and rank for Jordan Lively, a specialist in the US Army, are seen on his uniform. With the April 12 ""deadline"" looming, Jordan said he obtained a diagnosis of gender dysphoria to avoid having to choose between a job he loved and being himself. As long as he had the diagnosis, he could choose if and when to come out to his command and start transitioning. ""I wanted that choice to be mine, regardless of the ban,"" he said. It turned out to be a positive step forward for him, but the policy has left others in limbo while shutting out prospective troops at a time when recruitment goals are not being met. Meanwhile, Jordan's wife worries that President Trump might still do something to interrupt her husband's service -- or his transition. ""I feel like he wants an army of people just like him and I fear that he's going to do something incredibly insane to get what he wants,"" Malaina said. Jordan echoes her concern, albeit in less strident tones. He's still serving, after all, and the President is his commander in chief. But he does not take for granted that on any day, a single tweet could upend his world, just like it did two years ago. 'The military is the troops and their families' Now that Jordan is out, the couple is focused on finding their people in the military community of Colorado Springs, Colorado. They moved here almost two years ago for Jordan's job as a combat medic. Although he's based out of Fort Carson, he's gone for months at a time on deployment, providing emergency medical treatment to infantry and reconnaissance platoons in Afghanistan. As much as he loves his job, he feared how fellow soldiers would treat him if he came out. He's heard the cruel, dismissive way some of them speak about transgender people and worried they might turn on him. But he has also met allies and other gender nonconforming people, and they helped ground him, he said. That's how the Livelys found themselves surrounded by other LGBTQ military families on Easter Sunday at Logan and Laila Ireland's home on Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. Laila Ireland, an Army veteran, transitioned while serving when it was against policy to do so. As noon approached, guests streamed into the home with arms full of desserts and sides, leaving their shoes at the door. Some children clung to their parents while others hovered at the back door, gleefully spotting hidden Easter eggs in the backyard. ""This is the military,"" Laila said, gesturing to the room full of adults and children, as she chopped vegetables. ""The military is the troops and their families."" A guitar came out and an impromptu sing-along commenced, all before the crowd joined hands in a prayer circle to bless the food. The Irelands host regular ""family gatherings"" like this, an intimate extension of their public advocacy as a transgender military couple that fights for LGBTQ-friendly policies. The Irelands both transitioned while serving when it was against policy to do so. Logan had the support of his command, Laila didn't. Now he's an Air Force staff sergeant and she works at the Army Hospital in Colorado Springs, their home for the past three years. Framed magazine spreads and newspaper articles hang on a wall, creating a timeline of their work. One story recounts Logan's transition. Another marks the day in 2016 when the open service policy took effect, thanks in part to Logan's advocacy. The latest spread from 2018, which includes Laila, reads ""Transgender and under siege."" In their backyard, Logan grilled meat for the crowd growing inside. He says he has no doubt that the ban will end one day, because there's no factual basis or evidence supporting its necessity. Current military leaders have testified to Congress that transgender troops have not affected cohesion, while retired military leaders have decried the policy as misguided and damaging. A 2016 RAND Corporation study commissioned by the Defense Department concluded the number of transgender service members ""seeking transition related care is so small"" that it would likely have a ""marginal impact"" on health care costs and military readiness. Logan Ireland is a staff sergeant in the Air Force who says he has no doubt that the ban will end one day. But Logan admits he's not sure how the ban will be repealed. The best hope, he says, is four lawsuits challenging the ban on constitutional grounds, which are still in play. Although the US Supreme Court lifted an injunction that let the ban take effect, the high court did not rule on the ban's constitutionality. Congress could also take action, although Logan acknowledges it's not likely under this administration. But he has faith that common sense will prevail, he said, because it happened before in 2016 with the open service policy, and at other points in American history, including the Civil Rights era, when barriers to equal treatment came down. ""I have no doubt that we have the support of military leadership,"" he said. ""I believe in our country, in our values as Americans, to do the right thing."" In the meantime, he regards his service as more vital than ever to proving his detractors wrong, especially as the number of transgender service members will gradually dwindle. Besides, he acknowledged, he's among the lucky few who were ""grandfathered"" in to service. He said he's more worried about those who are transitioning under the new policy, given what he and others consider its confusing and conflicting language. Other transgender troops who were grandfathered in under the new policy are wondering if it will influence how colleagues treat them. Army Capt. Alivia Stehlik is one of those people. A graduate of West Point and Ranger School, she spent long periods in the field as a soldier before becoming a physical therapist stationed at Fort Carson. Army Capt. Alivia Stehlik, the physical therapist for the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, hopes she can keep her job in the military. She loves caring for soldiers. Each day of positive interactions with patients and coworkers confirms that she's in the right job, she said. Since transitioning under the open service policy, she can't recall a single instance when someone reacted negatively to her -- or gave her preferential treatment -- because she's transgender. Now, she worries that may change. ""I just will always wonder if I am being recognized for what I've done -- the good or the bad -- or if it's become I'm trans,"" she said. ""I grew up as a heterosexual white man in America. It never occurred to me that I would be judged on anything other than my merits,"" she said. ""Now, I'm going to wonder."" Stehlik greeted the Livelys as they entered the Irelands' home. She met Jordan in 2018 when they were both deployed in Afghanistan. But Jordan never discussed being transgender with Stehlik. Jordan said he wasn't ready then. But now, he is, despite the uncertainty that clouds his employment. Waiting for the final step The change in Jordan was instant as soon he came out to the therapist, his wife says. ""He couldn't stop smiling for two weeks,"" she says. And with that, he decided to start transitioning, physically and socially. The policy allowed active servicemembers with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before April 12 to transition if they wished to do so -- as long as their command signed off on their treatment plan and it does not affect troop readiness. Jordan Lively and his wife Malaina Lively waited anxiously for Jordan's company commander to sign off on the paperwork for his gender transition. Jordan's therapist started making calls and scheduling appointments the same day he was in the office, the couple says. Within the next few weeks, he had a gender dysphoria diagnosis and the necessary blood tests had been performed so he could start taking testosterone, the first step in physically transitioning. But in order to start hormone treatment, Jordan's company commander had to sign off on paperwork. For weeks, Malaina tried not to think about it as they waited for the phone call. ""It was another reminder of how they control our lives,"" she said. Fort Carson's public affairs office referred CNN to the Department of Defense for comment. Then, finally, days before he was set to leave again, his command approved his treatment plan, he said. It's a day he'll never forget, he said, when his first sergeant handed him back his treatment plan and told him congratulations and good luck. It gives him hope, he said, that no matter what happens, his military family will always have his back."

Inside the prestigious NYPD team with one focus: hate crimes,us.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/hate-crimes-nypd-pride-progress/index.html,"(CNN) When a subway ride in Queens last November became the setting of an anti-gay attack, New York Police turned to a team set up for just such an incident: the Hate Crime Task Force.
Just two weeks later, a 54-year-old man was arrested in the case. And that swift resolution, detective Ashley Breton told CNN, was one of the most memorable cases he's solved since he decided to join the prestigious task force two years ago. ""I would say that it's a very important unit to have because at any time, any incident could cause community unrest, which is something that no one wants to deal with -- (as) a member of the community or (as) a member of the New York City police department,"" he said. CNN recently spoke to Breton and other members of the Hate Crime Task Force as New York City is set to host WorldPride , an international celebration of the LGBTQ movement in June. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, the series of riots in Greenwich Village that is considered a turning point for the modern gay rights movement. Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, the commanding officer of the Hate Crime Task Force, said he has not seen a hate crime incident at a Pride event in New York City. And his team is working with the FBI and the Department of Justice to keep it that way. Read More ""As far back as I've looked up, I've never seen an incident related to Pride Week,"" Molinari said. ""But as a response unit to an event, we have to be ready to respond."" Mark Molinari leads the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force as it investigates crimes of bias in New York City. But their absence at Pride does not mean hate crimes aren't an issue in a city as diverse as New York. There were a total of 353 hate crime complaints in 2018, according to data from the NYPD. The number of anti-LGBT hate crime complaints declined slightly from 2017 to 2018, falling from 59 to 51 complaints, according to NYPD stats . Of the 51 anti-LGBT hate crime complaints last year, 35 were anti-gay, 5 were anti-lesbian and 11 were anti-transgender, the data shows. For Molinari and the Hate Crime Task Force, each one is important, no matter its severity. ""Criminal mischief, swastikas, property damage are no different to us than robberies and assaults. They're all victimizing an entire community -- sometimes a world-wide community -- so not being able to get closure for that community is difficult for all of us here,"" Molinari said. ""Our cases don't just victimize the victim. They victimize a group,"" he added. How the task force works The Hate Crime Task Force was launched under Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2000 as part of an initiative to enhance hate crime investigations and prosecutions. ""Every hate crime is a crime against our city, since it strikes at the diversity upon which New York thrives,"" Giuliani said at the time. It's now made up of 17 detectives and is called into action when investigators believe that a crime has some elements of bias. At that point, a task force detective will go and interview the victim, inspect the scene and conduct other investigative work. Finding their authentic selves: Transgender and over 50 Many of the task force's members have diverse backgrounds or language skills that come in handy when speaking with victims and their communities. Detective Breton, for example, speaks French, and his partner Salah Ali speaks Arabic. Ali said he joined the task force specifically because he thought his background as a Muslim of Arab descent would be of value to the team. ""A place like this there's definitely a lot of great feelings when you do find the perpetrators, and you give the victims justice and be able to give them peace of mind,"" Ali said. ""Because once they are victimized in this type of cases it's hard. It's not your typical assault. There's a lot of trauma that goes into it because of the way they are being targeted because of their race, religion, gender,"" he said. Molinari said some detectives average two to three cases a month. And that low case load means they get to work their cases hard, he said. However, Molinari said they have seen spikes in hate crimes during the last few election seasons. ""Looking back over (a) 25-year history, any world events that go on usually causes a little bit of a spike,"" he said. The names of victims of bias crimes are displayed on ribbons at a church on Christopher Street in New York City on May 22, 2013. But overall, he said not all LGBTQ hate crimes are reported to police because of the victim's fears. ""I've read reports on that victims are afraid of being outed if their family, their friends, their employer don't know their sexual orientation or gender they identify as,"" he explained. ""They don't want to report to the police because then they're going to be outed that they were attacked for their gender (identity) or sexual orientation. So that is a stumbling block for us."" Hate crimes in New York The majority of hate crimes in New York City are anti-Jewish, and they are primarily instances of property damage, such as swastika graffiti or broken property, Molinari said. Anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, on the other hand, tend to be physical confrontations, Molinari said. Pride beyond parades: How the LGBTQ celebration is enjoyed around the US ""When you're getting into LGBTQ (hate crimes), a lot of them are more personal interaction,"" he said. ""There's aggravated harassments, which (are) just basically a threat or a push with some slurs thrown in, or because their identities are related, or assaults coupled with derogatory language."" For example, in March 2017, a man stabbed two people and threatened another outside a gay night club in Brooklyn in what police said was an anti-gay attack. The Hate Crime Task Force investigated, and a 34-year-old local rapper turned himself into police after surveillance video of the incident was released. The man was found guilty earlier this year and sentenced to 21 years in prison, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said . Focusing on the victims While the Hate Crime Task Force focuses on finding the perpetrator of a hate crime, a related group focuses on the victims. Kathryn Clark-Hilliard is the manager of the Crime Victims Assistance Program, which works in partnership with the NYPD to put victim advocates in every police precinct in all five boroughs of New York. Their job is to work with crime victims who may be fearful or traumatized and provide them with support and resources. ""It can be very traumatizing after (an attack), and to be able to have an advocate that's able to talk with them in the precinct and link them to services that they may not even know about can be really supportive,"" Clark-Hilliard said. Clark-Hilliard said that work can mean setting victims up with community-based organizations, counseling or walking them through the police process ahead of them. ""For someone that has experienced a hate crime, that is really an attack on their identity,"" she said. ""It affects their personhood because, essentially, they feel that something that's true to themselves has been really attacked, and that can leave them feeling quite vulnerable."""
The Murph Challenge: What is it,us.cnn.com,"Mallory Hughes, CNN",05-28-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/memorial-day-murph-challenge-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) It's Memorial Day, it's incredibly hot out, and instead of lounging by the pool, a bunch of your friends are talking about doing Murph.
Murph is a popular workout created by CrossFit in memory of Navy Lt. Michael Murphy who died in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. Known as a Hero WOD (WOD = workout of the day), Murph was first posted on August 18, 2005, and is completed every year on Memorial Day by CrossFitters and Navy SEALs alike. Complete the following movements for time: 1-mile run 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups 300 air squats 1-mile run ... in a 20-lb. weight vest or body armor Read More According to CrossFit, this workout was one of Murphy's favorites. He'd named it ""Body Armor,"" though it was renamed as Murph in his honor. It sounds intense. And it is. It takes roughly 45 minutes to an hour (or more) and is one of the most well known workouts in all of CrossFit. In 2014, 'The Murph Challenge ' became the official fundraiser of the Lt. Michael P. Murphy Memorial Scholarship Foundation. Since 2014, the organization started by Murphy's family has raised more than $1 million. Lt. Murphy was killed during a reconnaissance mission to find a key Taliban leader in Afghanistan. When the team came under fire from a much larger enemy force, Murphy knowingly left his position of cover to get a clear signal in order to communicate with his headquarters, the U.S. Navy said. He died fighting, the Navy said. So, today, when the sun is beating down on your back, when your palms are ripping open from the rig, when your legs feel like a bowl of Jell-O, keep pushing forward in his honor."
8 key takeaways from the European election 2019 results,us.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Helen Regan, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/europe/european-elections-takeaways-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The results of the European elections revealed some unexpected outcomes Monday as the full picture from the world's biggest multi-country vote became clearer.
Over four days last week voters across 28 countries delivered the highest turnout in a European election for 20 years as they selected new representatives to sit in the European Parliament. Here are some of the key takeaways from some of the provisional results so far: Traditional centrist parties took a drubbing , with the so-called Grand Coalition -- which consists of the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) bloc and the center-right European People's Party (EPP) -- losing more than 70 seats and its majority in the EU parliament. One of the key figures in the S&D is Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, while German chancellor Angela Merkel is part of the EPP. In contrast, liberal-centrist grouping the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE&R), which includes French President Emmanuel Macron, picked up 32 seats and will now play an important role in nominating officials for key EU positions. In the UK, the Brexit Party, led by arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, took home 31.71% of the vote . This is almost equivalent to the vote share of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats combined and reflects growing dissatisfaction with traditional UK parties. It's worth noting that the Brexit Party took most of its seats from the UK Independence Party, Farage's previous political vehicle. Read More Spain's Socialist party recorded another strong performance following a general election win in late April, winning 32.84% of the vote. Center-right parties the People's Party (20.13%) and Ciudadanos (12.17%) came second and third as Spain bucked the general European trend towards political extremes. Far-right party Vox won just 6.2% of the vote. Results in France provided further evidence that a predicted surge in support for far-right populist parties did not materialize . Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally won with 23.31% of the votes, according to the French Ministry of Interior, beating French president Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche alliance on 22.41%. However Le Pen's vote share was a slight decrease compared to 2014, when her Front National party gained 24.86% of the vote. In Italy, the right-wing Lega Party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, took victory with 34.33% of the vote. Euroskeptic Salvini said that he will try to form an anti-EU bloc with Marine Le Pen and Hungary's Viktor Orban. It's unclear if that will materialize. Salvini (L), Farage (center) and Le Pen (R) all won in their respective countries. Orban, Hungary's far-right nationalist prime minister, scored a huge win after his Fidesz party received 52.33% of the country's votes. That's more than three times the amount of the second most popular party, the left-wing Democratic Coalition, which received just 16.19%. The Green Party alliance posted its strongest ever performance in European elections , winning 69 seats according to provisional results -- a rise from 2014 when they took 50 seats. Much of the party's gains came from northern Europe, including the UK, Ireland, France and Germany, where young people have staged marches calling for political action over climate change. Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he would call a snap election after a poor performance for his party at European and local elections. The opposition conservative party ""New Democracy"" won 33.25% of the vote, with a lead over the governing Coalition of the Radical Left ""Syriza"", currently at 23.74%."
Germany's Bild newspaper prints cut-out kippah in campaign against anti-Semitism,us.cnn.com,"Jack Guy, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/europe/bild-kippah-anti-semitism-scli-intl-grm/index.html,"(CNN) German newspaper Bild published a cut-out kippah skullcap on its front page Monday, urging readers to show their solidarity with the country's Jewish community in the face of rising anti-Semitism.
The move comes after a leading government official warned Jews in Germany not to wear the traditional skullcaps in public because of an increase in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. Felix Klein, the government's anti-Semitism commissioner, told the Funke media group Saturday: ""I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere all the time in Germany."" In response, Germany's most popular daily newspaper asked readers to wear the cut-out kippah as a mark of solidarity with the Jewish community, and even posted a video on its website showing how to make it. Wenn auch nur einer in unserem Land nicht Kippa tragen kann, ohne sich in Gefahr zu bringen, kann die Antwort nur lauten, dass wir alle Kippa tragen.

A German official said Jews are not advised to wear a kippah ""everywhere all the time in Germany."" Reichelt rejected Klein's call for Jews to limit their use of the kippah. ""To that, there is only one answer: No, that must not be the case!"" he wrote. ""If it is so, and if it stays that way, then we have failed in the face of our history."" He called on readers to support the Jewish community. ""If even one person in our country cannot wear the kippah without putting themselves in danger, then the only answer must be that we all wear the kippah,"" wrote Reichelt. ""The kippah belongs to Germany!"" How Borussia Dortmund is leading football's fight against the far-right in Germany There is mounting concern over the rise of anti-Semitism in Germany, and government figures point to an increase in anti-Semitic attacks. Data released by the interior ministry reveals that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose by nearly 20% from 2017-18, while the number of physical attacks against Jews increased from 37 in 2017 to 69 last year. Horst Seehofer, the interior minister, has said that around 90% of the reported incidents were perpetrated by supporters of far-right groups. ""This is a development that we have to confront, especially in this country,"" Seehofer told a press conference in May. ""This is a job for the police as well as the whole society."" Chancellor Angela Merkel has also denounced anti-Semitic crime in Germany and called for a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to tackling it. ""People growing up today must know what people were capable of in the past, and we must work proactively to ensure that it is never repeated,"" she said in January. This story has been updated to reflect the correct number of physical attacks against Jews in Germany in 2018. It was 69."

"The world's rivers are contaminated with antibiotics, new study shows",us.cnn.com,"Kara Fox, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/health/antibiotics-contaminate-worlds-rivers-intl-scli/index.html,"(CNN) The world's rivers are widely contaminated with antibiotics, according to a new global study, the first of its kind.
Researchers from the University of York in the UK analyzed samples from rivers in 72 countries and found that antibiotics were present in 65% of them. Dangerous levels of contamination were most frequently found in Asia and Africa, the team said, with sites in Bangladesh, Kenya, Ghana, Pakistan and Nigeria exceeding safe levels by the greatest degree. The worst case was found at a site in Bangladesh, where concentrations of the drug Metronidazole -- which is used to treat bacterial infections, including skin and mouth infections -- exceeded safe levels by up to 300 times. Safe levels can range from 20,000 to 32,000 nanograms per liter (ng/l), depending on the antibiotic, according to new guidelines established by the AMR Industry Alliance, a coalition of biotech, diagnostics and pharmaceutical companies set up to provide sustainable solutions to curb antimicrobial resistance. Read More Our antibiotics are no match for superbugs, and it's a 'global crisis,' UN report says Researchers looked for 14 commonly used antibiotics in their samples. They found Trimethoprim -- a drug primarily used to treat urinary tract infections -- at 43% of the river sites tested, making it the most prevalent antibiotic found in the study. The bacteria-fighting Ciprofloxacin most frequently exceeded safe levels, surpassing the safety threshold in 51 places, according to researchers. The data was collected from 711 sites, and from some of the world's best-known rivers, including the Chao Phraya, Danube, Mekong, Seine, Thames, Tiber and Tigris. Where antibiotics are more common than water, superbugs thrive Researchers found that high-risk sites were typically next to wastewater treatment plants, waste or sewage dumps and in some areas of political turmoil. While safe limits were most frequently exceeded in the developing world, data from sites in Europe, North America and South America show that antibiotic contamination is a ""global problem,"" according to the researchers. 5 things you need to know about antimicrobial resistance John Wilkinson, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of York's Department of Environment and Geography, who coordinated the monitoring work, said the ""real important part of the work is beginning to answer the question of: 'So what?' Or more specifically: ""Does this contamination pose a risk to health in humans or the environment?' "" A 'global crisis' Last month, the United Nations called resistance to antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiprotozoals a ""global crisis."" Drug-resistant diseases cause at least 700,000 deaths globally a year, including 230,000 deaths from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, according to a report by the United Nations' Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance. Superbugs 'as big a global threat as climate change and warfare' Without concerted global action, the authors of the UN report estimate that up to 10 million people a year may die from drug-resistant diseases by 2030. Alistair Boxall, professor of environmental science at York, called the river study's findings ""eye opening and worrying,"" saying they demonstrate that the antibiotic contamination of rivers could be an ""important contributor"" to antimicrobial resistance.
To counter that, Boxall said, it will be necessary to invest in infrastructure for waste and wastewater treatment, tighten regulations and clean up already contaminated sites. ""Solving the problem is going to be a mammoth challenge,"" he said. The researchers will present their findings at the annual meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in Helsinki on Monday and Tuesday."
Malaysia's last male Sumatran rhino dies,us.cnn.com,"Amy Woodyatt, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/asia/malaysias-last-male-sumatran-rhino-dies-intl-scli/index.html,"(CNN) Malaysia's last male Sumatran rhino has died, leaving behind just one female of the same rare species in captivity in the country.
The Borneo Rhino Alliance (BORA) confirmed the animal's death in a statement on Facebook on Monday, saying: ""It is with heavy hearts that we share the tragic news that Tam, Malaysia's last male Sumatran rhino, has passed away."" Tam had been suffering from organ failure before his death, BORA said. For the first time, a rare rhino was born by artificial insemination at the Miami zoo Sumatran rhinos are the world's smallest rhinoceros species, standing at around 4 feet 3 inches high, when fully grown. They are the only Asian rhinos with two horns, and are covered in hair. The animals are found in Indonesia, Malaysia's Sabah state (part of the island of Borneo) and peninsular Malaysia; some are also thought to live in southern Thailand, according to the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF). Read More Tam was the only male Sumatran rhino left in Malaysia. It is unclear precisely how many Sumatran rhinos remain, but experts at the International Rhino Foundation believe there are fewer than 80 still in the wild. BORA describes the rhinos as ""functionally extinct,"" meaning that the few animals remaining are insufficient to save the species from dying out. Tam's death means there is only one Sumatran rhino, a female called Iman, left in Malaysia. The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) considers the creatures to be critically endangered as a result of poaching and habitat fragmentation. One million species threatened with extinction because of humans Tam was captured and brought to live in Sabah's Tabin Wildlife Reserve. It was hoped he would breed with captive female rhinos, but these hopes were dashed when it was discovered that the two female rhinos at the reserve were infertile. ""I remember so well when Tam was captured and the high hopes everyone had that he could be the founding member of a successful captive breeding program in Sabah, and join the then-international efforts involving the US and Indonesia,"" Susie Ellis, executive director of the International Rhino Foundation, said in a statement . ""Sadly, those hopes were repeatedly dashed over the next decade by a series of incidents, some sociopolitical, some biological, and some simply bad luck."" Efforts to save the species in Malaysia have since focused on reproductive technology, including in vitro fertilization, but have so far proved unsuccessful. Rhinos are under threat across the globe. The western black rhino, native to western Africa, was declared extinct in 2013 . The last male northern white rhino died last year, bringing the species to the brink of extinction."
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz loses confidence vote,us.cnn.com,"Denise Hruby and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/europe/austria-sebastian-kurz-intl/index.html,"Vienna, Austria (CNN) Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his government have lost a no-confidence vote following a corruption scandal prompted by a secretly-filmed video.
Kurz's former coalition partners from the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) said they would support the motion of no-confidence put forward by the Socialist Party (SPÖ) on Monday afternoon. There was no official count for the vote. Instead, a majority of deputies in the chamber stood to indicate their unwillingness to put further trust in Kurz. Kurz, who at 32 is one of the world's youngest leaders, is the first Austrian chancellor since World War II to be defeated by a motion of no-confidence. President Alexander Van der Bellen must now dismiss Kurz and appoint a new caretaker government until snap elections can be held in September. In a televised address Monday night, Van der Bellen named current Vice-Chancellor Hartwig Löger as Kurz's replacement. He also said he intends to dismiss the government on Tuesday morning and at the same time appoint them to continue carrying out their work in the following days while he finds a proper replacement.

""I hope that this will not take longer than a week."" Sebastian Kurz attends a special session of Austrian parliament focusing on a no-confidence vote against him on Monday in Vienna. Earlier in the evening, Kurz asked his supporters to respect Parliament's decision before adding that he would support the interim government. ""The opposition always had the goal to get rid of Kurz. And today, they succeeded,"" Kurz told his supporters who were chanting his name in the rain. ""I ask you to recognize this decision, it's a democratic decision and there is no room for anger, sadness or hatred,"" he added. Kurz also asked voters to support the coming election race. ""I ask you to spend the next month [campaigning] for the support of the people and at the end the people will decide in September."" The vote was triggered after Kurz's government became embroiled in a political crisis over an undercover recording. A secretly-filmed video emerged recently of Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache -- of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) -- appearing to offer state contracts to a woman falsely claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. Strache resigned after the tape was revealed by Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine and Süddeutsche Zeitung daily newspaper over a week ago. Filmed in Ibiza two years ago, it is not known who recorded the video or set up the meeting. Strache denied any wrongdoing but apologized to ""everyone I have disappointed with my behavior."" The scandal has been the biggest crisis Austria's governing coalition has faced since forming in 2017. Kurz's conservative People's Party (ÖVP) was quick to distance itself from its coalition partners. Austrian Chancellor Sebastion Kurz sits next to former Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache in this file photo. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, the head of the SPÖ, told parliament before Monday's vote that ""irresponsible behavior is the foundation of distrust."" Addressing Kurz directly, she said, ""You have decided to walk on this path alone, and you have chosen to leave the path of stability that the people in this country would need so much."" Rendi-Wagner continued, ""Austrians have wished for you to behave responsibly, and you have not lived up to that."" Austria's Sebastian Kurz, a rock star to conservatives, walks a 'thin red line' in Europe While Kurz was ousted on Monday, he could return in September when Austrians go to the polls. He remains a popular politician in the country, enjoying a successful night just hours before as results from the European parliamentary elections came in. The ÖVP comfortably won garnering 34.5% of the vote -- a 7.5% increase from 2014. Europe's populist parties had been expected to triumph at the EU elections. Austria's FPÖ is in an alliance with Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's League but the party appeared to have lost support, according to an exit poll for CNN affiliate ORF."
"As self-driving cars take to the road, drivers will still be in high demand",us.cnn.com,Gad Levanon and Frank Steemers for CNN Business,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/perspectives/human-driver-jobs-self-driving-cars/index.html,"Gad Levanon is the chief US economist at The Conference Board. Frank Steemers is an associate economist at The Conference Board. commentary are their own.
Tesla's Elon Musk recently announced plans to start deploying driverless taxis across the United States next year. It was the latest reminder of how a driverless-car future captures the imaginations of visionaries but terrifies those who drive for a living.
For the short term, however, those fears are overblown. Through at least the next decade, human truck drivers, bus drivers and taxi drivers will remain in strong demand. And during that time, self-driving technology will put little, if any, dent in that demand. What accounts for drivers being such a hot commodity? Labor shortages have afflicted a broad swath of blue-collar industries, including the transportation sector. Simple economics explains the gap: Demand exceeds supply. And in this case, by huge margins. Several factors have diminished the supply of available workers. According to our own calculations based on microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey , the transportation industry employs a relatively large share of older workers, who are steadily leaving the workforce. Read More Meanwhile, as these Baby Boomers retire in droves, the industry struggles to recruit enough workers to replace them. As an increasing number of young people pursue college degrees, they're shying away from such blue-collar work and flocking to white-collar jobs. The prospect of a future economy saturated with driverless cars and trucks probably isn't helping either. After all, why start a career in a job that AI may someday obviate? And then there are drug-testing requirements. Such rules reduce the number of prospects who can pass the needed test for working in some transportation jobs. It's not that the tests have become more stringent. Finding workers who can pass them has become more of a hurdle simply due to the number of states that have decriminalized or legalized marijuana . At the same time the supply of drivers has decreased, the demand for them has substantially increased. The swell of e-commerce accounts for much of the growing demand. For example, the ever-growing Amazon needs thousands of warehouse workers to store and package its products, and thousands of drivers to transport its products. Case in point: Our own analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that from 2013 to 2018, employment in the transportation and warehousing industries increased by over 20%, vs. 9% across the total economy . More Markets & Economy Perspectives Bernie Sanders: Banks have been ripping off Americans for too long
Where Trump went wrong in the US-China trade war
The US-China trade war hurts American families
This combination — strong demand and weak supply — has spelled good news for drivers: The Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment data shows that transportation and material-moving occupations — crane operators, tractor operators, gas station operators and hand packagers — boast an unemployment rate of 4.7% in the past year, the lowest since 2000 when the BLS started tracking consistent and comparable data for these occupations. And these days, not only are more of these workers employed; their wallets are bigger, too: Through the first quarter of 2019, wages for transportation and material-moving workers in the private sector grew by 4.2% . Shortages in transportation — which we expect to persist for at least the next decade — are forcing companies to rethink their recruiting strategies. Among other steps, that means hiring beyond their typical pools of candidates. Businesses are now hiring more women in traditionally male-dominated sectors such as transportation and material-moving. Based on microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, our own calculations find that since 2016, women have accounted for about 50% of the employment growth in these occupations. As a result, they now make up nearly one in five workers in these jobs. But what is good for drivers is less so for the sectors that rely on them. Rising labor costs are prompting price increases in transportation and warehousing goods and are expected to chip away at corporate profits. To some degree, these higher costs will be passed to consumers. Moreover, these ripples are impacting a wide swath of industries beyond just transportation and warehousing companies. In waste collection , for example, transportation and material-moving workers make up 70% of workers. Wholesalers — especially those specializing in food and beverages — also employ many drivers. And so do retailers that haul furniture, along with mining and manufacturing companies. In the past three years, the number of workers added to transportation and material-moving occupations was roughly equal to the number of workers added to all other blue-collar occupations combined. The growing need for transportation workers will also create pressure in industries with high demand for workers without a college degree that are capable of performing physically demanding labor, including manufacturing, agriculture and construction. Down the line, employers will be eager to take advantage of cheap, automated labor. But until that day comes — and it is probably still far away — human workers literally and figuratively will remain in the driver's seat."

Director Jeanie Finlay spent a year chronicling the production, spanning locations from Belfast to Croatia to Spain. While the stars and producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss received a bit of screen time, the project went the extra mile to showcase those who don't walk red carpets, from background actors -- shown noshing on snacks during breaks, under hideous makeup -- to construction, the cheerful folks who fed this small army and even those responsible for all that fake snow. Among the unlikely stars of the documentary were Andrew McClay, an extroverted background actor who choked up when his watch finally ended; and Vladimir Furdik, the stunt coordinator who garnered an unexpected taste of stardom as the villainous Night King, who muttered ""Back to normal"" when his stretch under that guise finished.

The stars did get their moments, from Kit Harington's tearful farewell on his final day of shooting to Emilia Clarke quietly musing in her makeup chair about what life will be like after the show, which both propelled her into the public consciousness and left a lot of people debating the wisdom of having named a daughter ""Daenerys."" Read More ""It's exciting to think, 'Who am I without this?'"" Clarke said. Perhaps foremost, ""The Last Watch"" served as a testament to the massive logistical hurdles that the final season of ""Thrones"" posed, delivering six episodes with the heft of feature films. Executive producer Bernie Caulfield seemed to sum up the mixed feelings that evoked, which oscillated between nostalgia and somewhat guilty relief as the finish line neared. The narrative choices that defined the closing run will be debated for some time, with the hoopla surrounding the series stoking smaller controversies -- from a battle sequence that many deemed too dark and murky to an errant coffee cup being left in a shot -- that will surely fade more quickly. Beyond giving the foot soldiers in the battle to produce ""Game of Thrones"" their moments in the spotlight, ""The Last Watch"" provided a clear sense of the toil that goes into such an enterprise. ""That new GoT doc is pretty incredible, one of the best portraits I've seen of what a huge production feels like from the POV of all the folks doing the day to day work,"" Rian Johnson, the director of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" tweeted on Sunday night. In that regard, wherever and however the series came up short, the message was that for those in the trenches, it wasn't for lack of trying."

Seth Rogen reveals his formula to becoming a successful filmmaker,us.cnn.com,"Marianne Garvey, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/entertainment/seth-rogen-filmmaking/index.html,"(CNN) Seth Rogen lives by a two-part rule. One, when everyone else stops, keep going. Two, don't become anyone's biggest problem.
After writing and starring in a string of blockbuster movies like ""Superbad"" and ""Pineapple Express,"" Rogen, 37, has also become a respected director and producer, whose latest movie, ""Long Shot"" pairs him with Charlize Theron. With just one ""disaster"" on his resume, ""The Green Hornet,"" he's got an impressive track record at the box office. And his attempt at ""Hornet"" only failed, he suggests in a new interview with GQ, because, he didn't follow the tried and true formula he developed with his writing and producing partner Evan Goldberg: Stay under studio execs radar with a reasonable budget, and don't become a nuisance to executives. ""Twenty to thirty-five million dollars is where you're never going to be their biggest problem. That's literally what it is,"" Rogen told the publication. ""As long as they're making some $150 million movie that's a f***ing disaster, they're not paying attention to us. We're the smartest business decision they made that week, because they just don't have to worry about us. A lot of our career is just based on not being their biggest headache. Every once in a while, I meet someone, or one of my friends, [who] is their biggest headache, and it's like, 'Oh yeah, thanks to you, we can do whatever the f*** we want.' "" He also carried a major eye-opener with him into adulthood from when he was a kid growing up in Canada, taking karate lessons at the local community center. Read More ""I really always worked hard, because I recognized from a pretty young age it was one of the only things I could control,"" Rogen said. ""I remember I did karate as a kid, at the Jewish Community Center, and when I started I was the worst in the class, I was the worst of 25 Jewish kids who were afraid of getting picked on. And then just because everyone else quit, three years later I was at the top of the class, and there were 25 Jewish kids who were worse than me. And that was always tangible: Just by not stopping I became the best one. It wasn't this, like, ferocious leap. I just kept going, and slowly [other] people stopped. Because a lot of people will stop."" There you have it. Work harder than everyone around you and stay within a reasonable budget. Call it The Seth Rogen School of Success."

Automaker mergers: Fiat Chrysler and Renault show why carmakers desperately need each other,edition.cnn.com,Julia Horowitz,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/business/auto-merger-fiat-chrysler-renault/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Developing the cars of the future is expensive.
That's one big reason France's Renault is considering a merger with Fiat Chrysler that would create the world's third largest carmaker and reshape the global auto industry. Carmakers are facing a huge challenge. Global sales are falling at the exact time they need to be spending more to develop electric and autonomous vehicles. There's also new competition from the likes of Tesla ( TSLA ) and Uber ( UBER ) . The pressure is forcing established automakers into arrangements that allow them to shore up revenue while sharing costs. ""There's been talk of consolidation for a long time,"" said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader, who noted that former Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne was a big proponent. ""It's not surprising it comes now."" Read More Under pressure Carmakers need to focus on the future of transportation. But the first major problem is flagging sales. In China, annual car sales declined for the first time in two decades last year amid economic weakness and the trade war with the United States. Sales of cars in the United States are also sliding. Fiat Chrysler's US sales dropped more than 3% in the first three months of 2019 compared to the previous year. ""We are in a post-peak era where sales have hit records then come down a bit,"" Krebs said. The auto industry barely survived the Great Recession. Now it faces its biggest hurdle yet Meanwhile, the amount of money that car companies need to earmark for research and development is ballooning, especially as competition with Silicon Valley heats up. A number of car companies have responded to this pressure by making cuts. Ford last week announced that cutting 10% of its salaried staff worldwide in order to save $600 million a year. Yet others are also moving to deepen partnerships and alliances so they can spread out development costs. Germany's BMW ( BMWYY ) and Daimler ( DDAIF ) are putting $1 billion into a joint venture to develop ride-sharing and charging services. Ford and Volkswagen are building some new vehicles together. A merger between Fiat Chrysler and Renault would take such cooperation a step further. The companies had been discussing ways to team up on new products and tech, but Fiat Chrysler argued Monday that a merger would be best. Merger moves Combining Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) and Renault ( RNLSY ) could benefit both companies. Fiat Chrysler owns brands such as Jeep and Ram that have a lot of growth potential abroad, especially in the Middle East and Africa where Renault is strong, Krebs said. Renault, on the other hand, does not have a significant presence in North America, where Fiat Chrysler is a major player. Additionally, Renault is seen as a leader in electric vehicles, while Fiat Chrysler has lagged behind. The Italian-American company said a merger with Renault would produce annual cost savings of more than €5 billion ($5.6 billion). Nissan hits 'rock bottom' as Renault pushes for a merger One wild card is Renault's existing relationship with Nissan ( NSANF ) . Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault, as part of an alliance that also includes Mitsubishi Motors. The French carmaker, which sells fewer cars than Nissan, had been pushing for the companies to merge but faced pushback. ""The biggest mystery in all of this is where does Nissan fit,"" Krebs said. Auto mergers don't always work out, however. Fiat Chrysler would know: its merger with Daimler in 1998 ended less than a decade later, in part because of differences in corporate culture."
'Running With Beto' provides inside look at life on the campaign trail.,us.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,05-28-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/entertainment/running-with-beto-review/index.html,"(CNN) Temporarily setting politics aside, ""Running With Beto"" is an intriguing fly-on-the-wall look at Beto O'Rourke's losing 2018 Texas Senate bid, and the nature of a grass-roots Democratic campaign in a red state. The HBO documentary functions less successfully as a window into the candidate, other than the sacrifices and occasionally frayed nerves that go hand in hand with such a pressure-cooker environment.
Like ""Knock Down the House,"" the documentary featuring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upstart run that recently premiered on Netflix , director David Modigliani captures the passion that powered O'Rourke's candidacy and his near-upset of Sen. Ted Cruz. Filmed over the course of a year, that includes highs and lows -- the thrill of victory to the agony of defeat, from O'Rourke's gone-viral response about NFL players kneeling to teary-eyed campaign workers watching election results pour in, dashing their hopes. The filmmaker enjoyed such extensive access to the candidate that the title can be taken literally, following O'Rourke as it does on his early-morning jog, as well as in quieter moments with his family. In the process, O'Rourke is shown occasionally snapping at staffers while lamenting time missed with his children as he crisscrosses the state in an effort to leave no stone -- and potential undecided voter -- unturned. Beto O'Rourke That portrait is almost relentlessly flattering, and as such, perhaps the least interesting aspect of ""Running With Beto."" There's more meat, rather, in those drawn to his message, from the volunteer clashing with her conservative family to another who posts road signs in what she calls ""Trumpghanistan,"" eventually adopting a ""Cry today, work tomorrow"" attitude when it's all over. Read More The awkward part of ""Running With Beto"" is that it comes as O'Rourke has moved on to run for president. The result is that this film could easily be construed as a 90-minute infomercial, obscuring its broader insights about the nature of campaigning in the social-media age, and the possibilities of turning GOP-dominated Texas into a battleground state. ""We've gotta run like there's nothing to lose,"" O'Rourke says at one point, having stirred the imaginations of those who rallied around him with the soaring rhetoric that turned him into a national political figure. Nevertheless, the documentary is most useful and effective as a snapshot of a moment in time, and the inherent challenges of campaigning as an underdog. ""Running With Beto"" works best, in other words, when viewed as a marathon, not a sprint. ""Running With Beto"" premieres May 28 at 8 p.m. on HBO. Like CNN, HBO is a unit of WarnerMedia."

Historic flooding expected as 3.6 million under flash flood watch,www.cnn.com,admin,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/severe-weather-flood-watch-wxc/index.html/,"Home / WORLD NEWS / Historic flooding expected as 3.6 million under flash flood watch Historic flooding expected as 3.6 million under flash flood watch 4 hours ago WORLD NEWS
Spring storms have resulted in five deaths in Missouri, one in Iowa and six in Oklahoma. In Indiana, a 4-year-old boy is missing after strong currents from heavy rains swept him away.
CNN Meteorologist Robert Shackelford said 3.6 million people were under a flash flood watch, and 1.3 million under a severe thunderstorm watch overnight Sunday, with nearly 50 million at risk of severe weather impacts on Monday.
“Severe thunderstorms are continuing along the central High Plains, bringing damaging winds and the possibility for a few tornadoes, but these systems will weaken throughout the night,” he said.
Shackelford said the Arkansas River is experiencing record flooding, with one site at Van Buren already over 38 feet — the record set in 1945 — and an expected crest at 42.5 feet late Tuesday into early Wednesday. Tulsa levees under strain, record flooding expected
Oklahoma and other parts of the Midwest are still reeling from a deadly spring storm system that has resulted in more than 170 reported tornadoes plus strong winds, flash flooding and hail.
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Army Corps of Engineers said it was increasing the release of water at Keystone Dam to 265,000 cubic feet per second (CFS) Sunday evening and to 275,000 CFS Monday morning “with the expectation to leave it at this level through Thursday.” “Due to the additional release at Keystone Dam, flood water is expected to rise and residents and businesses along the Arkansas River must remain vigilant and take precautions based on the new data available,” the city said in a release. On Twitter, it said that emergency services had responded to reports of a man in the river Sunday evening. “We are hopeful he somehow made his way safely to the bank. It’s extremely important to avoid the river to ensure your safety,” it said. Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said the Oklahoma Guard was patrolling the city’s levee system 24 hours a day. “We continue to urge residents along the river to plan for the flood of record (the worst flood in Tulsa history), which was equivalent to 305,000 CFS,” the mayor said on Facebook.
“The levees continue to operate as designed, but this will place an even greater load on them,” he said, urging residents living behind Levees A and B to relocate. Evacuations underway in Arkansas Arkansas fully activated its State Emergency Operations Center on Sunday morning in response to rising water levels and anticipated continued flooding along the Arkansas River. Governor Asa Hutchinson on Friday declared a state of emergency in relation to the storms and flooding that began May 21, saying that “severe flooding of historic proportion will likely result.” After a briefing on flooding along the Arkansas River Sunday morning, Hutchinson approved $100,000 in emergency funding to support sandbagging work.
“I appreciate all the neighbors and volunteers filling sandbags and assisting with evacuations. The state team is continuing to respond to assistance requests, and more funds will be allocated as the situation demands,” the governor said in a statement.
Ten Arkansas counties had verbally declared Sunday morning — meaning they can request disaster resources. Another two had submitted written declarations, the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management said in a statement.
As of 6 p.m. local time Sunday (7p.m. ET), areas of Crawford, Franklin, Jefferson and Perry counties had already been evacuated and officials were encouraging some residents of low lying areas to evacuate in Conway, Faulkner and Logan counties. Visitors to RV parks in low lying areas of Pope County were also being encouraged to leave, the department said. Deadly tornado hits Oklahoma
A state of emergency has also been in place across all 77 counties of Oklahoma since Friday due to the severe weather.
Six people have died in the state after flooding, severe storms and tornadoes.
Two people were killed when a powerful EF-3 tornado touched down in El Reno, about 29 miles west of Oklahoma City, late Saturday.
A mobile home park was “devastated” after the twister made landfall, Mayor Matt White said. El Reno has a population of about 19,000.
“It’s a lot of devastation here, it’s leveled, it’s just devastated,” White said in a phone interview with CNN. “It’s tore all to pieces, it was terrible.”
Two people were killed earlier in Mayes County, according to a tally Sunday from the state medical examiner’s office. A 53-year-old woman also died in Payne County and a 58-year-old man died in Stephens County, according to officials.
Area hospitals reported 92 injuries, the state health department said.

Paris (CNN) At stake over this long weekend, when Europe went to the polls to select its new leaders, were the seats of the 751 members of the European Parliament -- but also the very character of an increasingly discordant, even fragmented, Europe.
More than 400 million voters in 28 countries were eligible to vote over four momentous days that have now begun to yield a taste of just where the continent is headed. For Donald Trump, May has been a momentous month. First, his great friend Narendra Modi, the ultranationalist prime minister of India, swept to a landslide reelection victory. And now, in France, Italy and across parts of central and eastern Europe , nationalists cemented their hold over an important (though not as dominant as they'd hoped) voting bloc in the European Parliament. After India's, the European Parliament's elections are the world's second largest democratic vote. Who protects democracy when democrats won't? The real story of this year's election for the European Parliament, however, is the weakening of the vast middle that has ruled Europe since its creation and that has held together through any number of internal and external crises. Read More Many of these crises have helped to shape this year's contests -- waves of immigration that have galvanized the far right, growing gulfs between haves and have nots, rising oil prices, and spreading fears of environmental catastrophes. In my 40 years of reporting all over Europe, the arrival of this new European Parliament seems to hold the promise of the most seismic shifts on the continent I have ever seen. No single group appears to have achieved a controlling interest in a pan-European body that will increasingly find forces of left and right contesting for dominance. In France, even the narrow victory of right-wing leader Marine Le Pen will make it that much more difficult for the nation's centrist president, Emmanuel Macron. His party managed a close second-place finish, but as his grim-faced prime minister, Edouard Philippe, told a national television audience Sunday night, ""When you finish second, you can't say you won."" JUST WATCHED Juncker slams 'stupid nationalists' ahead of elections Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Juncker slams 'stupid nationalists' ahead of elections 03:49 Macron will struggle now to play the role he lusts after: power broker to all of Europe. This role is essential in the upcoming choice of a replacement to Jean-Claude Juncker as head of the European Commission -- and shaping the future of the EU going forward. Macron had hoped to emerge as Europe's unchallenged leader when German Chancellor Angela Merkel steps down next year as she has promised. As a first step, Macron anticipated that even a narrow victory Sunday might re-legitimize his rule in France, which has suffered from months of upheavals at the hand of the yellow vest movement and scandals within his inner circle . ""For a European Renaissance"" was the title of the platform Macron published March 5 in all 28 European states. Not to be outdone, the head of the German CDU party Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, countered with ""Let's do Europe right now,"" a chance she may have, if as expected she succeeds Merkel as Germany's leader. Just as Macron was proposing a vast centrist heart for Europe, Steve Bannon was also crisscrossing the continent, campaigning for a right-wing surge that could carry it to a dangerous dominance in the new parliament. After all, the bright and shining dream of the far right is quite simply a continent-wide Brexit just as Britain moves toward its anticipated departure from the European Union. Ultimately, this dream of the European right is centered on an end to or dramatic weakening of a single, fully united Europe. Secretly recorded video casts harsh light on Europe's far right Such an ultranationalist dream has captured many voters' imagination, sweeping its leading figures into power from Poland across Hungary and to Italy as well. Now, it threatens to seize hold in France, together with Germany the two motor nations of Europe. But in pure numbers, while they will assume an important role in the new body, it is clear after Sunday their influence will be far from dominant. But perhaps the most surprising story emerging on the back benches of the new European Parliament is the so-called green wave -- the surge of Europe's Green Parties to second- or third-place finishes in a number of countries, leapfrogging other more establishment groups. They placed third in France, second behind Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats in Germany and tied for second in Ireland. The Green showing was especially striking In Germany, where the vocal far-right party finished a distant fourth. The right finished first in Austria, where right-wing Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's party managed a substantial first-place finish even after a widely-publicized scandal , but Kurz's government did not survive a vote of no confidence in the Austrian Parliament on Monday. Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz loses confidence vote Italy's far-right leader and Interior Minister, Matteo Salvini, trumpeted that after his first-place finish in his country, he had spoken with like-minded Le Pen in France and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, fresh from a warm meeting in the Oval Office with President Trump. ""This is a vote that allows us to try to change Europe,"" Salvini said . The resounding victory of Nigel Farage's Brexit party in the UK will translate into no votes in the European Parliament if Britain does succeed in exiting Europe. Despite the surging role of the extreme right in some countries, it is still hardly a force that Europeans broadly are prepared to accept wholeheartedly. For the first time since 1979, though, the center left and center right ""no longer have a majority together. No solid majority is possible without our new group,"" Guy Verhofstadt, president of the ALDEGroup and Europe's Brexit coordinator, tweeted .
Indeed, if there is one lesson to be learned from these elections, it is that as in much of the world, fracturing the vast political center is the rule of the day -- making any real consensus far more difficult to achieve, and a central role on the world stage for even Donald Trump's America even more difficult to realize. What leaders and observers alike will need going forward are deeply sensitive political antennae to judge the direction the new Europe may be taking."

Automaker mergers: Fiat Chrysler and Renault show why carmakers desperately need each other,us.cnn.com,Julia Horowitz,05-28-2019,2019,5,http://us.cnn.com/2019/05/27/business/auto-merger-fiat-chrysler-renault/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Developing the cars of the future is expensive.
That's one big reason France's Renault is considering a merger with Fiat Chrysler that would create the world's third largest carmaker and reshape the global auto industry. Carmakers are facing a huge challenge. Global sales are falling at the exact time they need to be spending more to develop electric and autonomous vehicles. There's also new competition from the likes of Tesla ( TSLA ) and Uber ( UBER ) . The pressure is forcing established automakers into arrangements that allow them to shore up revenue while sharing costs. ""There's been talk of consolidation for a long time,"" said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader, who noted that former Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne was a big proponent. ""It's not surprising it comes now."" Read More Under pressure Carmakers need to focus on the future of transportation. But the first major problem is flagging sales. In China, annual car sales declined for the first time in two decades last year amid economic weakness and the trade war with the United States. Sales of cars in the United States are also sliding. Fiat Chrysler's US sales dropped more than 3% in the first three months of 2019 compared to the previous year. ""We are in a post-peak era where sales have hit records then come down a bit,"" Krebs said. The auto industry barely survived the Great Recession. Now it faces its biggest hurdle yet Meanwhile, the amount of money that car companies need to earmark for research and development is ballooning, especially as competition with Silicon Valley heats up. A number of car companies have responded to this pressure by making cuts. Ford last week announced that cutting 10% of its salaried staff worldwide in order to save $600 million a year. Yet others are also moving to deepen partnerships and alliances so they can spread out development costs. Germany's BMW ( BMWYY ) and Daimler ( DDAIF ) are putting $1 billion into a joint venture to develop ride-sharing and charging services. Ford and Volkswagen are building some new vehicles together. A merger between Fiat Chrysler and Renault would take such cooperation a step further. The companies had been discussing ways to team up on new products and tech, but Fiat Chrysler argued Monday that a merger would be best. Merger moves Combining Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) and Renault ( RNLSY ) could benefit both companies. Fiat Chrysler owns brands such as Jeep and Ram that have a lot of growth potential abroad, especially in the Middle East and Africa where Renault is strong, Krebs said. Renault, on the other hand, does not have a significant presence in North America, where Fiat Chrysler is a major player. Additionally, Renault is seen as a leader in electric vehicles, while Fiat Chrysler has lagged behind. The Italian-American company said a merger with Renault would produce annual cost savings of more than €5 billion ($5.6 billion). Nissan hits 'rock bottom' as Renault pushes for a merger One wild card is Renault's existing relationship with Nissan ( NSANF ) . Renault holds a 43.5% stake in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault, as part of an alliance that also includes Mitsubishi Motors. The French carmaker, which sells fewer cars than Nissan, had been pushing for the companies to merge but faced pushback. ""The biggest mystery in all of this is where does Nissan fit,"" Krebs said. Auto mergers don't always work out, however. Fiat Chrysler would know: its merger with Daimler in 1998 ended less than a decade later, in part because of differences in corporate culture."
The mystique of Mount Everest is fueled by a lot of myths,www.cnn.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/mount-everest-myths-trnd/index.html,"These myths about Mount Everest feed its mystique (and its traffic jams) Doug Criss, CNN • Updated 28th May 2019 Facebook Twitter Email (CNN) — Ever since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers to summit Mount Everest in 1953, adventurers the world over have tried to follow in their footsteps. It seems like a record number of climbers are attempting to do so this year. That's led to traffic jams at the summit , with hundreds of people waiting in line to reach Everest's top. So far, at least 11 people have died during this spring's climbing season. Last year, five climbers died, while six died in both 2017 and 2016. People are still drawn to try to climb the mountain. However, Everest's mystique, while a huge lure for climbers, is based on a number of myths. MYTH: It's the tallest mountain in the world Yes, we've all been taught that Mount Everest, standing at an elevation of 29,035 feet, is the highest above sea level. But actually the world's tallest mountain is half a world away, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. That's where you'll find Mauna Kea, on the island of Hawaii. Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano, rises 13,796 feet above sea level, but if you measure it from ocean floor to its summit, its total height is nearly 33,500 feet . And Everest isn't even the highest point above Earth's center. That honor belongs to Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. Chimborazo's summit is 20,564 feet above sea level, but because the planet is a little thicker at the equator (thanks to centrifugal force caused by Earth's constant rotation) Chimborazo's peak is more than 6,800 feet farther from the center of the Earth than Everest's summit. MYTH: Only a select few get to climb Climbing Everest is no walk in the park. Icy temperatures, fierce winds and limited oxygen make it a dangerous climb. More than 200 people have died on the mountain since 1922, when the first climbers' deaths on Everest were recorded. The success rate of Mount Everest climbers is only 29% . Despite all that, hundreds of people get permission to climb Everest every year. Would-be climbers must obtain a permit, which cost about $11,000 . For this year's spring climbing season, Nepal's tourism board has issued 381 permits so far. There were about 11,000 attempts to reach the summit between 1922 and 2006, the website Adventurestats.com reports. And the age range of climbers is wider that you'd expect. The oldest person to successfully reach Everest's peak was 80-year-old Yuichiro Miura of Japan in 2013. The youngest? A 13-year-old American teen named Jordan Romero . He conquered Everest, accompanied by his father and stepmother, in 2010. MYTH: You're required to endure years of preparation Not true. The Nepalese government doesn't require a certain number of training hours that climbers must complete before attempting to summit Everest. Several of the trekking agencies in Nepal that help facilitate adventurers' climb to the top will charge thousands of dollars for training to prepare climbers. The kinds of training offered by the different trekking agencies varies. And even before going to Nepal, people who want to climb Everest are encouraged to commit to a heightened exercise schedule several months before their climb to try to achieve optimum fitness. One of the first steps for anyone considering an Everest trek should be consulting with a physician to evaluate physical health. It's also a way to discover any pre-existing conditions that might be amplified by high altitude, Jon Kedrowski, a geographer and climber who summited Mount Everest in 2012, told CNN in 2016. If Kedrowski is leading a peak expedition, he screens his clients and designs training programs to help them prepare for the journey. When altitude is a consideration, cardio is the emphasis, rather than strength, he said. MYTH: It's a way to be one with nature That may have been the case once. But the enormous increase in visitors in recent decades has had a severe impact on the mountain's sensitive environment, the Everest Summiteers Association says. A clean-up effort last month collected more than 6,613 pounds garbage in just the first two weeks: empty cans, bottles, plastic and discarded climbing gear. CNN's Ashley Strickland and Rob Picheta contributed to this report."
Fact-checking North Korea's missiles and the UN Resolution - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Holmes Lybrand,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/politics/trump-bolton-north-korea-missile-test-fact-check/index.html,"(CNN) In early May, North Korea test fired short-range ballistic missiles, the first such launch since late 2017 and the first since President Donald Trump began meeting with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un. Speaking to reporters over the weekend about these missile tests, US national security adviser John Bolton took a strong line.
""The UN Security Council resolution prohibits the launch of any ballistic missiles and there is no doubt that North Korea has violated the resolution,"" said Bolton. President Donald Trump downplayed the tests, tweeting Saturday that ""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me."" He went on to say he has ""confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me"" in regards to the de-nuclearization of North Korea. Facts first: Bolton is correct, current UN resolutions demand that North Korea not launch any ballistic missiles. Back in October 2006, the UN responded to North Korea's first nuclear test by passing Resolution 1718 which imposed sanctions and demanded that North Korea ""not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile."" During this time Bolton served as US ambassador to the UN, playing a significant role in the resolution. Read More These sanctions were expanded in 2009 with resolution 1874, following North Korea's second nuclear test. In 2012, when North Korea tested ballistic missile technology, the UN condemned the country saying that the use of this tech was in violation of resolutions 1718 and 1874.

According to the report, North Korea is attempting to create a nuclear warhead to fit on a ballistic missile -- and these short to medium range ballistic missile tests are working to beat any missile defense system they might face. Trump does not see these tests as related to his stated goal of de-nuclearization, telling Politico in an interview following the missile tests ""these were short-range missiles and very standard stuff. Very standard."" While working to negotiate trade deals with China (one of North Korea's few allies) and working to re-engage with North Korea on de-nuclearization negotiations that failed in February, Trump is downplaying North Korea's missile tests -- in clear disagreement with his national security advisor."
The abdication of King Trump (opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ted Gup,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/opinions/pelosi-gave-trump-what-he-wants-gup/index.html,"Ted Gup is an author and writer-in-residence at Durham University in the UK. He has been a contributor to the Washington Post, New York Times, NPR, Slate, The Guardian, National Geographic and other publications. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.
(CNN) In recent weeks, nearly all the talk in Washington centered around impeachment -- would they or wouldn't they? Now the nation faces a new worry -- abdication. That's right, the President who imagines himself a king, and expects others to treat him the same way, has declared that he will have nothing to do with Congress on infrastructure legislation -- perhaps the one area where he could have won bipartisan support -- so long as the Dems insist on holding him accountable. In effect, Donald Trump has announced that he has abdicated, having no longer any wish to serve.
Ted Gup Fittingly, the word ""abdication"" has two meanings . The first applies to when a monarch relinquishes his throne (in Trump's case, not likely); the second, when anyone in a position of authority chooses to neglect or ignore his duties. The latter is what this petulant President has said he will do so long as anyone dares question him. He has announced, in effect, that America now has a government in absentia. To understand what happened last week, it is best viewed through the lens of medieval times, which is the domain in which our President/king resides. What House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did by accusing him of a cover-up amounted to what monarchs call ""Lese Majeste"" -- an insult to the sovereign. (For Trump, there is no real issue of constitutionality. The only separation of powers he seems to recognize is that which he has doled out between his advisers, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, and his son Don Jr.) Which helps explain the calculated and choreographed Rose Garden hissy fit (complete with posters on the podium) and why it is that Trump, who was always accustomed to getting his own way, has done so again. His threat not to deal with Congress so long as it has the temerity to question him, creates for him the ideal scenario: he gets to hold on to the throne without having to govern, which is most likely what he wanted from the beginning. For all his scorn and righteous indignation, he's probably experiencing a measure of relief and even gratitude that the weight of the crown has been at least temporarily lifted.

It is only fitting that he was the host of the TV program ""The Apprentice,"" a show about sycophants vying for his favor. Trump is himself a lifelong apprentice, first desperately vying for the acceptance of his martinet father, and later, the nation. Look at his life -- he is a success at courtship and wooing; fidelity, not so much. In many ways, his inauguration was the high point of his presidency. What followed was the bewildering realization that something more was expected of him. He is perpetually on the campaign trail in pursuit of validation, and another win.

His singular talents span the spectrum from bluff to bluster, which work well enough in inherited wealth and reality TV, but less so for those enterprises requiring actual hands-on governance. And is it not the ultimate expression of executive privilege, the right not to behave as an executive at all? He is drawn to the prerogatives of power, and not what that power can do for others. So in threatening to eschew all manner of presidential engagement, save the pomp and circumstance for which he lives, he has simply shed all pretense and shown his true self. State dinners, motorcades, the pandering of Fox & Friends and endless ego-stroking were all that he ever wanted.

The problem is that Trump, in his own inimitable way, has created a most imperfect vacuum for the nation.

Meanwhile, the nation's bridges are left to crack, highways buckle, tracks heave, illicit drugs proliferate, medications grow ever-more expensive; diplomats scratch their heads and hind parts, idled by kingly disinterest, allies wonder whether we have their backs or should watch their backs, enemies salivate, polar ice caps slip into the sea, and poor, poor Doral Country Club -- under Trump's storied management -- continues, like the rest of us, to struggle.

"Facebook's Zuckerberg ignores subpoena from Canadian parliament, risks being held in contempt - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Donie O'Sullivan,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/tech/zuckerberg-contempt-canada/index.html,"Ottawa and New York (CNN Business) Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg did not attend a hearing in Ottawa on Tuesday, despite receiving summonses from the Canadian parliament.
The decision could result in the executives being held in contempt of parliament, the senior Canadian politician who sent the summons told CNN. The last time a member of the public was held in contempt by the parliament was 1913, according to the legislature's records. Facebook instead sent two representatives from its public policy team to the hearing, which was tied to a gathering of an international committee examining Silicon Valley's impact on privacy and democracy. Multiple lawmakers pointed out that Zuckerberg's failure to show up contradicted what he wrote in an op-ed in March when he wrote he was ""looking forward to discussing them [online issues] with lawmakers around the world."" Bob Zimmer MP, the chair of the committee, slammed the executives for not attending. Read More ""Shame on Mark Zuckerberg and shame on Sheryl Sandberg for not showing up today,"" he said toward the end of the meeting. In a contentious exchange, British MP Damian Collins asked why Facebook had not removed a manipulated video of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that went viral last week. Collins suggested that Facebook's refusal to remove the video was ""irresponsible"" and gave a ""green light"" to anyone to make false videos about politicians. YouTube removed the video. Neil Potts, Facebook's director of public policy, said the company had downranked the video, meaning it will show up in fewer people's News Feeds. Both Zuckerberg and Sandberg received formal requests from the Canadian Parliament earlier this month. Zuckerberg and Sandberg have testified before the United States Congress on the subject. Zimmer said Monday night that Facebook had not told the committee whether its two most senior executives would be attending. He said committee members learned on CNN that Zuckerberg and Sandberg would not testify. A Facebook spokesperson disputed that on Tuesday morning, saying the company had told the committee it would be sending Kevin Chan, its head of public policy for Facebook Canada, and Neil Potts, its director of public policy, to the meeting. The spokesperson added the company had been in ongoing communication with the committee. Google and Twitter also sent representatives to address the committee, but the committee doesn't appear to have sent summons to those companies' top executives. Lawmakers from at least ten countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, were expected to attend the meeting, which is the second of its kind. The first meeting of the committee last year in London resulted in the release of secret internal Facebook documents. Facebook removed 2.2 billion fake accounts in three months ""Collectively we represent about 450 million people, it's a bigger population group than the US,"" Zimmer, whose committee is hosting the international meeting, told CNN Monday. Zimmer sent both Facebook executives summonses earlier this month. He said the company had submitted alternate names of people to attend in their place, but that he wants to hear directly from the social network's top two executives. Their presence is important, he said, because, ""Knowing the structure of Facebook and how it is micro-managed right from the top, any change on the platform is done through Mr. Zuckerberg or through Ms. Sandberg."" ""It's not that hard to jump on a plane and make some time to hear from legislators and answer their questions,"" he told CNN. The decision to hold them in contempt, Zimmer said, would be voted on by the whole of Parliament. ""Nobody is going to come with some handcuffs and arrest them, but to be held in contempt by an entire country would not serve any platform well,"" he added. A Facebook ( FB ) spokesperson said in a statement earlier Monday: ""Ultimately this is a decision for Parliament — we're not in a position to speculate. We share the Committee's desire to keep people safe and to hold companies like ours accountable. Right now we're focused on engaging in meaningful dialogue with the committee and look forward to answering their questions."" ""We look forward to answering their questions and remain committed to working with world leaders, governments, and industry experts to address these complex issues,"" the spokesperson said."

The surface known as ""terre battue"" in French softens power games and has a way of extending battles, which can create problems, especially at late stages of careers. On a blustery day in Paris on Monday, Williams looked in danger of losing in the opening round at the tournament for a second time, before defeating 83rd-ranked Vitalia Diatchenko of Russia 2-6 6-1 6-0 for her 800th main-draw professional win. Such comebacks have been a hallmark of Williams' unprecedented career . But showing rust in just her 10th match of 2019 -- against the same opponent who stunned Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon last year -- Williams appeared more vulnerable than usual.

Williams appeared hot under the collar with some of her 14 unforced errors in the first set but in the last two combined for 20 winners and a mere 10 unforced errors. A roar and stomp of the foot after making one error at the start of the second set might have sparked the turnaround. ""I just was so frustrated at that point, because I have been training well,"" she continued to reporters. ""The past week and a half has been really good and it was like, 'This isn't the Serena I have been practicing with or that I see every day. ""I just let out this roar, and here I am."" The famous Williams serve kicked in too, resulting in just three dropped points behind her first serve in the final two frames. Assuming Williams adequately recovers physically, it is difficult to envisage either Kurumi Nara or Dalila Jakupovic -- their match was suspended due to darkness -- ousting her in the second round. Greater tests could await in round three, through either Canadian Bianca Andreescu or another North American enjoying a breakout season, American Sofia Kenin. Williams has her sights set on a deeper stay. ""There is only one way for me to enjoy it here. I don't enjoy places when I don't win, so that's why I like playing in all four Grand Slams,"" she said.

On paper the 44th-ranked Hurkacz presented a tough test but the Serb clinically dispatched the fast-rising Pole. Last year's finalist, Dominic Thiem, trailed American Tommy Paul 4-0 in a key third-set tiebreak but stormed back for a more difficult 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 win on his favored Suzanne Lenglen court. Follow @cnnsport It is still early going at Roland Garros but there was little to suggest from Monday's performances that Djokovic -- bidding to win four straight majors for a second time -- and 11-time champion Nadal won't face off in the final in under two weeks. Williams wasn't as convincing -- but no one dares count her out."
Mount Everest death toll rises to 11 - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Sugam Pokharel,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/asia/mount-everest-deaths-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Another mountaineer has died after summiting Mount Everest, bringing the death toll for the 2019 climbing season to 11 people .
American attorney Christopher John Kulish, 62, died on Monday after reaching the top of Everest on the Nepalese side of the mountain in the morning, Meera Acharya, the Director of Nepal's Tourism Department told CNN. American lawyer Christopher Kulish died while climbing Mount Everest, making him the 11th death on the mountain in 2019. While descending, he was strong and safely reached the South Col (situated at an altitude of around 7,900 meters, or 25,918 feet) late Monday evening before he suddenly passed away, she said. In a statement, the family of the Colorado man said they were ""heartbroken"" at the news. ""Chris, who turned 62 in April, went up with a very small group in nearly ideal weather after the crowds of last week had cleared Everest."" ""He saw his last sunrise from the highest peak on Earth. At that instant, he became a member of the '7 Summit Club' having scaled the highest peak on each continent,"" the statement continued. His family said he died doing what he loved and that he is survived by his mother and younger siblings. Read More Also on Monday, an Austrian family confirmed the death of one of their relatives. Sixty-four-year-old Ernst Landgraf died on Thursday, hours after fulfilling his dream of scaling Everest, according to his obituary and funeral announcement placed by his family.

The human impact on Everest 02:22 Mountaineers have suggested difficult weather conditions, a lack of experience and the growing commercialization of expeditions as contributing factors to the backlog. British climber Robin Haynes Fisher was one of those who had warned of the dangers of overcrowding. ""With a single route to the summit, delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people. Unless of course everyone else plays the same waiting game,"" he wrote in a captioned Instagram post on May 19. He died after suffering from what appeared to be altitude sickness at 8,600 meters (28,215 feet), while returning from the summit on Saturday.
View this post on Instagram Climbed up to camp 3, 7500m but the jet stream had returned closing the summit after only 2 days so I descended to basecamp. Around 100 climbers did summit in those 2 days with sadly 2 deaths, an Indian man found dead in his tent at camp 4 and an Irish climber lost, assumed fallen, on his descent. A go fund me page has been set up for a rescue bid for the Irish climber but it is a well meaning but futile gesture. Condolences to both their friends and families. Both deaths happened above 8000m in the so called death zone where the majority of deaths of foreign climbers happen. Around 700 more people will be looking to summit from Tuesday the 21st onwards. My revised plan, subject to weather that at the moment looks promising, is to return up the mountain leaving basecamp Tuesday the 21st 0230 and, all being well and a lot of luck, arriving on the summit the morning of Saturday the 25th. I will be climbing with my Sherpa, Jangbu who is third on the all time list with an incredible 19 summits. The other 4 members of our team decided to remain on the mountain and are looking to summit on the 21st. My cough had started to return at altitude so I couldn't wait with them at altitude for the window to open without the risk of physically deteriorating too much. Furthermore as I had missed due to sickness the earlier camp 3 rotation best practice was for me to descend to allow my body to recover from the new altitude high so I could come back stronger. This was not an easy decision as the 13 hours climbing from basecamp to camp 2 in a day was the hardest physical and mental challenge I had ever done, now I have it all to do again. Finally I am hopeful to avoid the crowds on summit day and it seems like a number of teams are pushing to summit on the 21st. With a single route to the summit delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people.

During the week beginning May 20, crowds of climbers became stuck in a queue to the summit, above the mountain's highest camp at 8,000 meters (26,247 feet). The summit of Mount Everest is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) high. Most people can only spend a matter of minutes at the summit without extra oxygen supplies, and the area where mountaineers have been delayed is known to many as the ""death zone."" Climbers wait to reach the summit of Everest in this image taken May 22. Mountain guide Adrian Ballinger told CNN many see Everest as the ""ultimate challenge"" but the problem he has seen is the ""lower level of experience of the climbers trying to come here and also of the companies that are trying to offer services on the mountain."" He continued, ""That lack of experience, both with the commercial operators and the climbers themselves, is causing these images we see where people make bad decisions, get themselves in trouble up high and end up having unnecessary fatalities."" Ballinger explained that seasoned climbers call any part of the mountain above 26,000 feet ""the death zone,"" adding that ""humans just really aren't meant to exist there."" ""Even when using bottled oxygen, supplemental oxygen, there's only a very few number of hours that we can actually survive up there before our bodies start to shut down. So that means if you get caught in a traffic jam above 26,000 feet ... the consequences can be really severe,"" he added. Veteran climber David Morton spoke to CNN from base camp on the Tibetan side of Mt. Everest. He had just descended after getting around 100 meters from the summit for a research project. The biggest myths about Mount Everest that feeds into its mystique ""The major problem is inexperience, not only of the climbers that are on the mountain but also the operators supporting those climbers,"" he explained. ""Everest is primarily a very complicated logistical puzzle and I think when you have a lot of inexperienced operators as well inexperienced climbers along with, particularly, the Nepal government not putting some limitations on the numbers of people, you have a prime recipe for these sorts of situations happening."" Morton said he had gone up the mountain from the Tibetan side, where the government has put limitations on numbers. ""We were up just 100 meters below the summit on the 24th on a beautiful day and there were maybe 30 or 40 people going to the summit from the Tibet side, the north side. It was a completely different dynamic,"" he continued. JUST WATCHED What happens to the body on Everest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Nepali climbing guide Dhruba Bista fell ill on the mountain and was transported by helicopter to the base camp, where he died Friday. And Irish climber Kevin Hynes, 56, died Friday morning on the Tibetan side of Everest in his tent at 7,000 meters (22,966 feet). Two died Wednesday after descending from the summit: Indian climber Anjali Kulkarni, 55, and American climber Donald Lynn Cash , 55. Kalpana Das, 49, and Nihal Bagwan, 27, both from India, also died on Everest this week. Both died Thursday on their return from the summit. Ravi, a 28-year-old Indian climber who goes by one name, died the previous week on May 17. Last week, a search for Irish climber Seamus Lawless, 39, was called off, after the Trinity College Dublin professor fell while descending from the peak, according to the Press Assocation. Lawless is missing, presumed dead. More than 200 mountaineers have died on the peak since 1922, when the first climbers' deaths on Everest were recorded. The majority of bodies are believed to have remained buried under glaciers or snow. Correction: This story has been updated with Kulish's correct age."
The global fishing fleet has exploded and that could be bad for the planet - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Jen Christensen,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/world/fishing-boats-overfishing-study-scn/index.html,"(CNN) The global fishing fleet has more than doubled since 1950, but it's not because the fishing has gotten easier.
Rather, fishing boats travel farther and work longer hours to catch a declining stock of fish, according to a study to be released Tuesday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America -- and that could have an impact on the environment. JUST WATCHED Divers swim with rare great white shark Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Divers swim with rare great white shark 01:00 Looking at data on the number of fishing vessels, researchers determined the global fishing fleet went from 1.7 million to 3.7 million boats between 1950 and 2015, the study says. Technology is a large driver of the increase: Fishing boats that had been powered for centuries by sails and oars are now primarily powered by engines. By 2015, 68% of the global fishing fleet was motorized. North America and Europe traditionally have strong fishing industries. In the United States, commercial and recreational fishing generated $212 billion in sales, according to NOAA's Fisheries report , supporting 1.7 million full- and part-time jobs. But there has been a general decline in the fishing fleet in North America and Europe, and growth is largely coming from Asia, where fleets have grown by 400% alone. This latest study anticipates there will be a million more fishing vessels on the water by mid-century. That could be a serious problem for the world's fish stock. Read More United Nations research shows that nearly 90% of the world's marine fish stocks are already depleted, overfished or fully exploited. That problem is compounded by climate change and ocean warming .

The authors argue their estimates of fishing vessels should be used by local governments to better set regulations to protect the environment from overfishing. Overfishing can change the size of the fish that remain and impact how quickly they reproduce, further depleting fish stocks. And fewer fish can make more people who depend it for protein vulnerable to food insecurity. Depleted fish stocks also hurt the $362 billion industry that relies on this highly traded commodity."
Study finds e-cig flavors can damage cardiovascular cells,edition.cnn.com,"Michael Nedelman, CNN",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/health/vaping-heart-cells-study/index.html,"(CNN) E-cigarette flavors can damage the cells that line your blood vessels and perhaps your heart health down the line, according to a new study of human cells in the lab.
The study, published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology , adds to growing evidence that the flavored ""e-liquids"" used in vapes can hinder human cells' ability to survive and function. The authors say these changes, some observed in the absence of nicotine, are known to play a role in heart disease. ""The public has this notion that e-cigarettes are safe,"" said study author Dr. Joseph Wu, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and a professor in the medical school's departments of medicine and radiology. Experts say this belief stems not just from the presence of fewer cancer-causing chemicals than combustible cigarettes, but also from the fact that many vaping products are sold in sweet or fruity flavors that may appear harmless. ""As a result of this perception, a lot of kids pick up e-cigarette smoking,"" Wu said. ""There's so many kids who are smoking e-cigarettes. And these kids are going to become adults. And these adults can become elderly patients that I as a cardiologist will take care of later on."" Read More When your child vapes, what's a parent to do? The US Food and Drug Administration announced in November that vaping had increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since the year before. Experts also worry that the devices could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs . But the long-term effects aren't clear. In the new study, which included six e-liquids with varying nicotine concentrations, Wu's team found evidence of toxic effects -- including poorer cell survival and signs of increased inflammation -- on a type of cardiovascular cell. As proxy for what might happen in someone's blood vessels, the researchers observed how these cells responded when in contact with e-liquids as well as fluid from the blood of a small group of participants who had vaped. These effects varied between the liquids, with the most potent being a cinnamon-flavored product. While the researchers tested six liquids in the new study, experts say there are thousands of unique flavors being sold online. Which flavor component is most responsible for these effects and how it works is yet unclear, Wu added. In a related commentary published in the same journal, doctors from the University of Massachusetts Medical School said that it will be important to perform tests in animal models -- and not just in cultured cells -- in order to unravel the science at play. But these findings, they said, come amid growing concern that vaping products, and flavors in particular, may be more harmful than initially thought. ""In addition to harm from the nicotine, the additives are a potential source of adverse vascular health and one that is being disproportionately placed on the young,"" they said. Flavors have been at the center of a regulatory debate, and a number of local and national policymakers have taken steps to ban them. Advocates for flavors say they're an important tool in getting adults to switch over from combustible cigarettes, while others want to ban them entirely because they appeal to kids and minimize how harmful and addictive vapes are perceived to be.

Other studies have observed the impact of vaping products at the cellular level and on cardiovascular health more broadly. A study last year showed that daily e-cigarette users had an increased risk of having a heart attack, though not as high as daily smokers. ""We're seeing more and more evidence that e-cigarettes do have a relationship with increased chance of having a heart attack,"" Dr. Lawrence Phillips, an assistant professor of medicine and director of outpatient cardiology at NYU Langone Health, previously told CNN. ""When we compare traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes, we're really not comparing apples to apples,"" said Phillips, who was not involved in the new research. ""What we're finding is that both are having increased risk."""

Cuccinelli did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Monday. The rebuke comes several days after L. Francis Cissna, the agency's current head, announced he would be stepping down amid a major shakeup in the last month among the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.

Texas just passed a bill to let people carry their handguns for a full week after natural disasters - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ryan Prior,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/texas-guns-after-natural-disasters-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers in Texas just approved a bill that will allow licensed gun owners to carry handguns in public for up to a week following a natural disaster.
It squeaked through the Senate 16-15. Now it's heading to Gov. Greg Abbott's desk, as lawmakers close out this year's legislative session. According to a summary , bill supporters don't want to be ""forced to leave handguns behind in vehicles or homes, where they could be at risk from looters."" The bill, which has the backing of the National Rifle Association , grants immunity to gun owners without conceal carry permits to keep their weapons with them when fleeing disaster areas. Sen. Charles Brandon Creighton, who represents a district north of Houston, sponsored HB 1177 in the Senate. Read More In the floor debate, Creighton said that following Hurricane Harvey, Gov. Abbott issued evacuation orders for effected areas on August 23, 2017, and that ""mandatory and voluntary evacuations were ongoing through the 28th of August."" He said that lawmakers felt a full week was necessary for gun-owners to evacuate a disaster area and to find a safe place to stay. He added that the bill doesn't require relief shelters to admit those carrying handguns, and shelters in the state can make their own rules around guns, including ""checking them and storing them,"" when people take refuge. According to a fiscal note attached to the bill, the state currently punishes those who carry weapons illegally by a misdemeanor or felony based on the type of offense. The bill wouldn't cause a ""significant fiscal impact"" to the state because it wouldn't add to the burden on prison facilities, the note says. Legislators sent the bill back and forth between bodies before narrowly passing it After the original bill carried in the House, the Senate amended the bill to narrow the window for carrying a concealed handgun to 48 hours after a mandatory evacuation order, rather than a more general disaster declaration. The Senate easily passed their new version 23-8 . But when the Senate's take on the policy got kicked back to the House, representatives stood their ground, and passed a version 91-52 that kept the week-long period and expanded the grace period back to apply following natural disasters, even if a mandatory evacuation hadn't been ordered. And last night, the House version managed to clear the Senate as well. While support for the bill largely fell along party lines, Republican Sen. Joan Huffman joined two other GOP Senate members in opposing it. During the floor debate, Huffman said the bill amounted to ""permitless carry, open and concealed,"" and that the latest Senate version was being rushed through the body as this year's legislative session was about to close. In opposing the bill, she cited ""strong law enforcement objection"" to the bill from ""individuals who didn't have an opportunity"" to voice their objections. She called it ""poor public policy that's not well thought out."" Noting that she was ""as pro-Second Amendment as anyone,"" she said she felt that the policy was ""not solving a problem, it is creating a problem."" The new law takes effect September 1, 2019."
Santa Anita: Horses keep dying at California track. Here's what we know - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eliott C.

River Derby was galloping during a morning training session Thursday at the track in Arcadia when it was injured, the California Horse Racing Board said. A board spokesman, Mike Marten, said veterinarians at an equine hospital in Chino determined surgery was not a viable option. CNN reached out to the owners, the Stronach Group, but didn't receive an immediate reply. Santa Anita Park officials also didn't respond to CNN's request for comment. Animal rights activists have called for races to be suspended at Santa Anita Park, one of the most famous horse racing parks in the United States. The track has instituted several safety measures and briefly closed the track. Read More Santa Anita is one of the busiest race tracks in the nation.

We are committed to working with the entire California horse racing industry in the protection of horses and riders."" Before River Derby, the last horse to die at Santa Anita was Kochees, on May 26. Here is what we know about Santa Anita: Why are the horses dying? Many have pointed to Southern California's wettest winter in almost a decade, saying the rain has made the dirt track where most of the deaths occurred too soft.

In preparation for storms, a sealant can be used to prevent the track surface from washing away, but when the rain stops, trainers complain the track is too hard. While there's been a lot of focus on track conditions, some experts said that is only part of the equation and that the industry needs to take a closer look at its training practices and the drugs that can be administered to horses. Is Santa Anita the most dangerous track? Deaths happen, no matter where horse racing events are staged. From 2009 to 2018, there were 6,134 horse deaths in 3.4 million starts nationwide, according to a tally kept by the Jockey Club, an organization focusing on the integrity, health and safety of horse racing. The rate over that decade rises for dirt tracks and for races shorter than six furlongs. A furlong is an eighth of a mile. Deaths at other popular U.S. tracks, 2014-19 New York's Belmont Park

Fatalities are on the decline. Where there were 790 racehorse deaths in 2009 (617 of them on dirt), last year saw 493 deaths (394 of them on dirt) nationwide, the Jockey Club reports. Santa Anita's problems have centered on its 1-mile dirt track, though there have been deaths on its turf track and deaths not associated with racing or training. ""To those who say, 'Well, horse deaths are eventual,' we don't accept that and we are doing everything possible to bring that number as close to zero as possible,"" track spokesman Stefan Friedman told CNN last month. ""If we aren't out there shooting for zero, we aren't doing our job, and that's the No. 1 priority for us is horse safety."" Analysis of five years of data from California's three busiest parks show Santa Anita has been the deadliest, with 232 racing and training deaths of horses in 44,475 starts, the state horse racing board says. That's 5.2 deaths per 1,000 starts, and while that appears to be significantly higher than the national numbers, the Jockey's Club's data does not include training deaths. Los Alamitos in Orange County, which has only a dirt track, had 177 deaths in 47,893 starts (3.7 deaths per 1,000 starts) and Golden Gate Fields in Albany, which has only turf and synthetic tracks, recorded 134 deaths in 43,020 starts (3.1 per 1,000), the racing board says. Is the industry taking a closer look? After a 4-year-old filly shattered her leg on a training run, marking the 21st death at Santa Anita since December, the park closed for evaluation March 5. Experts conducted numerous tests, including simulations and soil sample analyses, during the closure, the track said, and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced it was assigning investigators to look into the fatalities. Santa Anita's reopening came with numerous changes: Trainers must apply two days in advance before working out a horse; jockeys must replace whips with softer ""cushion crops;"" and restrictions on steroids, anti-inflammation drugs and race-day medications, including Lasix, were instituted.

Jockey tossed from horse: I was in trouble from the start 00:39 Lasix is a ""performance enhancer cloaked as therapeutic medication that less than 10% of the horses need"" despite 95% of horses receiving it, the Jockey Club said in a recent paper . A coalition of tracks and industry associations has agreed to begin phasing out Lasix next year, with stakes races -- including all Triple Crown venues and the Breeders' Cup -- ending its use by 2021. When does the season end? Racing will continue until June 23. Races are generally held on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. After the season ends, the next race will be the Breeders' Cup World Championships on November 1 and 2. The event is considered one of the sport's biggest and richest with about $28 million in prizes doled out across 14 races last year. Why are they being euthanized? A horse's leg bones support an enormous amount of weight, typically more than a 1,100 pounds, so when they break the effect is catastrophic. Keeping a horse still so that its leg will heal properly is impossible, and it could open the horse to the risk of infection, inflammation and circulation issues. What's more, the chances of a complete recovery are unlikely. Given the cost of treatment and risk to the animal, owners tend to euthanize injured horses.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz loses confidence vote,rss.cnn.com,"Denise Hruby and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/weRlwQsUC6Q/index.html,"Vienna, Austria (CNN) Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his government have lost a no-confidence vote following a corruption scandal prompted by a secretly-filmed video.
Kurz's former coalition partners from the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) said they would support the motion of no-confidence put forward by the Socialist Party (SPÖ) on Monday afternoon. There was no official count for the vote. Instead, a majority of deputies in the chamber stood to indicate their unwillingness to put further trust in Kurz. Kurz, who at 32 is one of the world's youngest leaders, is the first Austrian chancellor since World War II to be defeated by a motion of no-confidence. President Alexander Van der Bellen must now dismiss Kurz and appoint a new caretaker government until snap elections can be held in September. In a televised address Monday night, Van der Bellen named current Vice-Chancellor Hartwig Löger as Kurz's replacement. He also said he intends to dismiss the government on Tuesday morning and at the same time appoint them to continue carrying out their work in the following days while he finds a proper replacement. Read More ""I will make sure that the new chancellor will be someone who has broad trust within Parliament, also to avoid a situation like today,"" the President said. ""I hope that this will not take longer than a week."" Sebastian Kurz attends a special session of Austrian parliament focusing on a no-confidence vote against him on Monday in Vienna. Earlier in the evening, Kurz asked his supporters to respect Parliament's decision before adding that he would support the interim government. ""The opposition always had the goal to get rid of Kurz. And today, they succeeded,"" Kurz told his supporters who were chanting his name in the rain. ""I ask you to recognize this decision, it's a democratic decision and there is no room for anger, sadness or hatred,"" he added. Kurz also asked voters to support the coming election race. ""I ask you to spend the next month [campaigning] for the support of the people and at the end the people will decide in September."" The vote was triggered after Kurz's government became embroiled in a political crisis over an undercover recording. A secretly-filmed video emerged recently of Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache -- of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) -- appearing to offer state contracts to a woman falsely claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. Strache resigned after the tape was revealed by Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine and Süddeutsche Zeitung daily newspaper over a week ago. Filmed in Ibiza two years ago, it is not known who recorded the video or set up the meeting. Strache denied any wrongdoing but apologized to ""everyone I have disappointed with my behavior."" The scandal has been the biggest crisis Austria's governing coalition has faced since forming in 2017. Kurz's conservative People's Party (ÖVP) was quick to distance itself from its coalition partners. Austrian Chancellor Sebastion Kurz sits next to former Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache in this file photo. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, the head of the SPÖ, told parliament before Monday's vote that ""irresponsible behavior is the foundation of distrust."" Addressing Kurz directly, she said, ""You have decided to walk on this path alone, and you have chosen to leave the path of stability that the people in this country would need so much."" Rendi-Wagner continued, ""Austrians have wished for you to behave responsibly, and you have not lived up to that."" Austria's Sebastian Kurz, a rock star to conservatives, walks a 'thin red line' in Europe While Kurz was ousted on Monday, he could return in September when Austrians go to the polls. He remains a popular politician in the country, enjoying a successful night just hours before as results from the European parliamentary elections came in. The ÖVP comfortably won garnering 34.5% of the vote -- a 7.5% increase from 2014. Europe's populist parties had been expected to triumph at the EU elections. Austria's FPÖ is in an alliance with Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's League but the party appeared to have lost support, according to an exit poll for CNN affiliate ORF."
8 key takeaways from the European election 2019 results,rss.cnn.com,"Jack Guy and Helen Regan, CNN",05-27-2019,2019,5,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/hDsk5N59p-o/index.html,"(CNN) The results of the European elections revealed some unexpected outcomes Monday as the full picture from the world's biggest multi-country vote became clearer.
Over four days last week voters across 28 countries delivered the highest turnout in a European election for 20 years as they selected new representatives to sit in the European Parliament. Here are some of the key takeaways from some of the provisional results so far: Traditional centrist parties took a drubbing , with the so-called Grand Coalition -- which consists of the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) bloc and the center-right European People's Party (EPP) -- losing more than 70 seats and its majority in the EU parliament. One of the key figures in the S&D is Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, while German chancellor Angela Merkel is part of the EPP. In contrast, liberal-centrist grouping the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE&R), which includes French President Emmanuel Macron, picked up 32 seats and will now play an important role in nominating officials for key EU positions. In the UK, the Brexit Party, led by arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, took home 31.71% of the vote . This is almost equivalent to the vote share of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats combined and reflects growing dissatisfaction with traditional UK parties. It's worth noting that the Brexit Party took most of its seats from the UK Independence Party, Farage's previous political vehicle. Read More Spain's Socialist party recorded another strong performance following a general election win in late April, winning 32.84% of the vote. Center-right parties the People's Party (20.13%) and Ciudadanos (12.17%) came second and third as Spain bucked the general European trend towards political extremes. Far-right party Vox won just 6.2% of the vote. Results in France provided further evidence that a predicted surge in support for far-right populist parties did not materialize . Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally won with 23.31% of the votes, according to the French Ministry of Interior, beating French president Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche alliance on 22.41%. However Le Pen's vote share was a slight decrease compared to 2014, when her Front National party gained 24.86% of the vote. In Italy, the right-wing Lega Party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, took victory with 34.33% of the vote. Euroskeptic Salvini said that he will try to form an anti-EU bloc with Marine Le Pen and Hungary's Viktor Orban. It's unclear if that will materialize. Salvini (L), Farage (center) and Le Pen (R) all won in their respective countries. Orban, Hungary's far-right nationalist prime minister, scored a huge win after his Fidesz party received 52.33% of the country's votes. That's more than three times the amount of the second most popular party, the left-wing Democratic Coalition, which received just 16.19%. The Green Party alliance posted its strongest ever performance in European elections , winning 69 seats according to provisional results -- a rise from 2014 when they took 50 seats. Much of the party's gains came from northern Europe, including the UK, Ireland, France and Germany, where young people have staged marches calling for political action over climate change. Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he would call a snap election after a poor performance for his party at European and local elections. The opposition conservative party ""New Democracy"" won 33.25% of the vote, with a lead over the governing Coalition of the Radical Left ""Syriza"", currently at 23.74%."

Williams appeared hot under the collar with some of her 14 unforced errors in the first set but in the last two combined for 20 winners and a mere 10 unforced errors. A roar and stomp of the foot after making one error at the start of the second set might have sparked the turnaround.

Wozniacki and another former No. 1, Angelique Kerber -- downed Sunday by a Russian, Anastasia Potapova -- faced a race against time to play at Roland Garros due to calf and ankle injuries, respectively, so their departures weren't entirely surprising.

American attorney Christopher John Kulish, 62, died on Monday after reaching the top of Everest on the Nepalese side of the mountain in the morning, Meera Acharya, the Director of Nepal's Tourism Department told CNN.

The human impact on Everest 02:22 Mountaineers have suggested difficult weather conditions, a lack of experience and the growing commercialization of expeditions as contributing factors to the backlog. British climber Robin Haynes Fisher was one of those who had warned of the dangers of overcrowding. ""With a single route to the summit, delays caused by overcrowding could prove fatal so I am hopeful my decision to go for the 25th will mean fewer people. Unless of course everyone else plays the same waiting game,"" he wrote in a captioned Instagram post on May 19. He died after suffering from what appeared to be altitude sickness at 8,600 meters (28,215 feet), while returning from the summit on Saturday.
View this post on Instagram Climbed up to camp 3, 7500m but the jet stream had returned closing the summit after only 2 days so I descended to basecamp. Around 100 climbers did summit in those 2 days with sadly 2 deaths, an Indian man found dead in his tent at camp 4 and an Irish climber lost, assumed fallen, on his descent. A go fund me page has been set up for a rescue bid for the Irish climber but it is a well meaning but futile gesture. Condolences to both their friends and families. Both deaths happened above 8000m in the so called death zone where the majority of deaths of foreign climbers happen. Around 700 more people will be looking to summit from Tuesday the 21st onwards. My revised plan, subject to weather that at the moment looks promising, is to return up the mountain leaving basecamp Tuesday the 21st 0230 and, all being well and a lot of luck, arriving on the summit the morning of Saturday the 25th. I will be climbing with my Sherpa, Jangbu who is third on the all time list with an incredible 19 summits. The other 4 members of our team decided to remain on the mountain and are looking to summit on the 21st. My cough had started to return at altitude so I couldn't wait with them at altitude for the window to open without the risk of physically deteriorating too much. Furthermore as I had missed due to sickness the earlier camp 3 rotation best practice was for me to descend to allow my body to recover from the new altitude high so I could come back stronger. This was not an easy decision as the 13 hours climbing from basecamp to camp 2 in a day was the hardest physical and mental challenge I had ever done, now I have it all to do again. Finally I am hopeful to avoid the crowds on summit day and it seems like a number of teams are pushing to summit on the 21st.

During the week beginning May 20, crowds of climbers became stuck in a queue to the summit, above the mountain's highest camp at 8,000 meters (26,247 feet). The summit of Mount Everest is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) high. Most people can only spend a matter of minutes at the summit without extra oxygen supplies, and the area where mountaineers have been delayed is known to many as the ""death zone."" Climbers wait to reach the summit of Everest in this image taken May 22. Mountain guide Adrian Ballinger told CNN many see Everest as the ""ultimate challenge"" but the problem he has seen is the ""lower level of experience of the climbers trying to come here and also of the companies that are trying to offer services on the mountain."" He continued, ""That lack of experience, both with the commercial operators and the climbers themselves, is causing these images we see where people make bad decisions, get themselves in trouble up high and end up having unnecessary fatalities."" Ballinger explained that seasoned climbers call any part of the mountain above 26,000 feet ""the death zone,"" adding that ""humans just really aren't meant to exist there."" ""Even when using bottled oxygen, supplemental oxygen, there's only a very few number of hours that we can actually survive up there before our bodies start to shut down. So that means if you get caught in a traffic jam above 26,000 feet ... the consequences can be really severe,"" he added. Veteran climber David Morton spoke to CNN from base camp on the Tibetan side of Mt. Everest. He had just descended after getting around 100 meters from the summit for a research project. The biggest myths about Mount Everest that feeds into its mystique ""The major problem is inexperience, not only of the climbers that are on the mountain but also the operators supporting those climbers,"" he explained. ""Everest is primarily a very complicated logistical puzzle and I think when you have a lot of inexperienced operators as well inexperienced climbers along with, particularly, the Nepal government not putting some limitations on the numbers of people, you have a prime recipe for these sorts of situations happening."" Morton said he had gone up the mountain from the Tibetan side, where the government has put limitations on numbers. ""We were up just 100 meters below the summit on the 24th on a beautiful day and there were maybe 30 or 40 people going to the summit from the Tibet side, the north side.

And Irish climber Kevin Hynes, 56, died Friday morning on the Tibetan side of Everest in his tent at 7,000 meters (22,966 feet).

Last week, a search for Irish climber Seamus Lawless, 39, was called off, after the Trinity College Dublin professor fell while descending from the peak, according to the Press Assocation. Lawless is missing, presumed dead. More than 200 mountaineers have died on the peak since 1922, when the first climbers' deaths on Everest were recorded.

According to analysis from Deloitte's Sports Business Group , the winner will enjoy a financial boost of at least $215 million (£170m) through a combination of broadcasting and commercial revenue across the next three seasons. That figure will rise to a minimum of $381 million (£300m) if whichever team is promoted avoids instant relegation in its first season.

""I think there's something deeply wrong in bringing ethnicity into the conversation,"" Mubarak said, responding to the comments made by Tebas at FT's Business of Football summit .

Serena Williams rallies after French Open first round scare,rss.cnn.com,"Ravi Ubha, CNN",05-28-2019,2019,5,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/18VbvHnfJbE/index.html,"(CNN) For all her singles titles on the grass at Wimbledon -- seven of them -- Serena Williams can still thrive on clay, despite its challenges.
The surface known as ""terre battue"" in French softens power games and has a way of extending battles -- which can create problems, especially at late stages of careers. On a blustery day in Paris on Monday, Williams looked in danger of losing in the opening round at the tournament for a second time, before defeating 83rd-ranked Vitalia Diatchenko of Russia 2-6 6-1 6-0 for her 800th main-draw professional win. Such comebacks have been a hallmark of Williams' unprecedented career. But showing rust in just her 10th singles match of 2019 -- against the same opponent who stunned Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon last year -- Williams appeared more vulnerable than usual. Ultimately she came through it during a stretch of the campaign Williams enjoys. Read More The French Open buildup tournament of Rome, for example, holds special memories -- husband Alexis Ohanian first met and proposed to her in the Italian capital -- and Williams has long owned an apartment in Paris. She likes competing on clay, too. But that's not to say things have gone entirely smoothly for Williams at Roland Garros. Visit CNN Sport for more news and videos Of the American's open era record 23 majors, only three have come at the French Open. And the only time in three decades Williams ever lost a first-round grand slam match came at the same venue in 2012 against France's Virginie Razzano.

She will certainly hope to complete a second match, something she has failed to do at any tournament since January's Australian Open. A knee injury and illness ruled her out at Indian Wells, Miami and Rome, where the knee problem scuppered a meeting with older sister Venus.

A rare audience with Richard Williams 05:11 A year after wearing a catsuit that displeased tournament officials, Williams donned a zebra printed outfit on center court that eventually required a sweat top due to a dip in temperatures. Williams appeared hot under the collar with some of her 14 unforced errors in the first set but in the last two combined for 20 winners and a mere 10 unforced errors. The famous Williams serve kicked in too, resulting in just three dropped points behind her first serve in the final two frames. JUST WATCHED Rise of Naomi Osaka Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Rise of Naomi Osaka 03:07 Assuming Williams adequately recovers physically, it is difficult to envisage either Kurumi Nara or Dalila Jakupovic ousting her in the second round. Greater tests could await in round three, through either Canadian Bianca Andreescu or another North American enjoying a breakout season, American Sofia Kenin. Kvitova, Wozniacki out As Williams focused on staying healthy on the court, another tournament contender, Petra Kvitova, pulled out ahead of her tussle with Sorana Cirstea due to a forearm injury. Then former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki departed in three sets to Diatchenko's countrywoman, Veronika Kudermetova, 0-6 6-3 6-3. Wozniacki and another former No. 1, Angelique Kerber -- downed Sunday by a Russian, Anastasia Potapova -- faced a race against time to play at Roland Garros due to calf and ankle injuries, respectively, so their departures weren't entirely surprising.

On paper the 44th-ranked Hurkacz presented a tough test but the Serb clinically dispatched the fast-rising Pole. Follow @cnnsport It is still early going at Roland Garros but there was little to suggest from Monday's performances that Djokovic -- bidding to win four straight majors for a second time -- and 11-time champion Nadal won't face off in the final in under two weeks. Williams wasn't as convincing -- but no one dares count her out."
"Burnout is an official medical diagnosis, World Health Organization says - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Ryan Prior,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/27/health/who-burnout-disease-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) It's a feeling of extreme work stress that's long been embedded in the cultural lexicon, and now it might be codified in your medical records as well.
Burnout is now a legitimate medical diagnosis, according to the International Classification of Diseases , or the ICD-11, the World Health Organization's handbook that guides medical providers in diagnosing diseases. Burnout now appears in the ICD-11's section on problems related to employment or unemployment. According to the handbook, doctors can diagnose someone with burnout if they meet the following symptoms: 1. feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion 2. increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job Read More 3. reduced professional efficacy Before making the call, the document says doctors should first rule out adjustment disorder as well as anxiety and mood disorders. And the diagnosis is limited to work environments, and shouldn't be applied to other life situations. Researchers have been studying burnout for decades Burnout has long been a blurry cultural concept that has defied attempts to create a specific consensus definition scientists can all agree on. Psychologist Herbert Freudenberger is credited with inaugurating the formal study of the state of burnout with a scientific article published in 1974, according to a 2017 review of literature published in the journal SAGE Open. The authors of that review, Linda and Torsten Heinemann, say that over the next four decades, hundreds of studies appeared on the subject. During that time, they noted burnout was not considered an actual mental disorder even though it is ""one of the most widely discussed mental health problems in today's society."" One reason for that, the Heinemanns argue, is that much of the research on burnout focused on ""causes and associated factors,"" rather than on attempts to develop specific diagnostic criteria. That led to ""vagueness and ambiguity"" around the concept of burnout. In their review, they note that the question of whether researchers could differentiate depression and burnout was also a major obstacle in elevating burnout to a disease."
