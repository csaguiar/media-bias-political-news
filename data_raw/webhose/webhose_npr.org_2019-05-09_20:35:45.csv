Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's apparent return to power after Israeli elections Tuesday reaffirms the country's right-wing shift. That could impact a peace plan and help him fend off corruption allegations.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
After elections yesterday, it looks like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is headed for a fourth consecutive term. In a moment, we'll hear more about Netanyahu's decade of leadership. First, his main challenger, retired general and centrist candidate Benny Gantz has conceded. And Netanyahu can now look towards smaller right-wing parties to build a new, more conservative government.
To talk about how that works and what it means, NPR's Daniel Estrin joins us from Jerusalem. Hi, Daniel.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: You've been talking to voters and analysts today. What's the message that the Israeli electorate was trying to send with this vote?
ESTRIN: I think Israelis are saying, we want Netanyahu to continue. His party and his right-wing allies got the most votes. And it appears that all the parties in his previous government will be in his new one with some very, very significant differences. The moderate right party that used to be aligned with Netanyahu and is expected to continue to be aligned with him is much smaller. Meanwhile, ultra-orthodox parties grew in number in terms of the number of lawmakers, and far-right politicians are more prominent. And that's worrying a voter we met at the beach. His name is Nick Kolyohin. He's in Tel Aviv. And he says he sees Israel going in a direction he doesn't like.
NICK KOLYOHIN: It looks like the country will be more religious, more extreme, more militant and not willing to go for a peace agreement.
ESTRIN: But I met a lot of voters who supported Netanyahu and who think Israel's situation has never been better. They see a great economy. They see Netanyahu jetting off to meet Putin and Trump. And they see less Palestinian violence in the last decade under Netanyahu. They don't see anyone in his league. And even though he faces corruption allegations, they're not really concerned with that. Take a listen to Svide Godeen (ph).
SVIDE GODEEN: Right now everything is clear. Until will be a trial, will be a sentence, he's - to me, is as clear as snow.
SHAPIRO: Daniel, explain how this works. You say all the parties in Netanyahu's previous government will be in his new one. This is a coalition that he has to build.
ESTRIN: Right. His party - Netanyahu's party did not get enough votes for a majority. It only got about 35 seats. And the Parliament is 120 seats. So a majority is 61. He needs to do the math and build a coalition of other parties to reach a majority. And he's expected to do that with the right-wing and the far-right and the ultra-orthodox Jewish parties.
SHAPIRO: Let's talk about some of the issues Netanyahu is expected to face. The Trump administration keeps promising a peace proposal if the Netanyahu government moves farther to the right. Does that make a peace agreement with Palestinians less likely?
ESTRIN: Well, we don't know what's in the Trump peace plan, but we do know that Netanyahu's own party and his expected coalition are not interested in any significant concessions to the Palestinians. They don't believe in a Palestinian state. And furthermore, just a few days ago, Netanyahu vowed to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, which many see as a point of no return in terms of a peace deal with the Palestinians. So it's very hard to see how any kind of peace plan goes forward.
SHAPIRO: I also want to ask you about these legal charges that Netanyahu faces. The attorney general is preparing to indict Netanyahu for corruption. Does this re-election change any of that?
ESTRIN: Well, Netanyahu is banking on having received a fresh mandate from his voters sending a very clear signal that he has the mandate of the people; the people want him to serve. But it's not going to change the fact that the attorney general may likely submit corruption charges, criminal charges. And so as Netanyahu negotiates with the parties to enter his coalition, he wants to make sure they're going to stand by his side and they're not going to bolt when he likely does face these charges.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Thanks, Daniel.

What A Fourth Consecutive Term Of Netanyahu Will Mean For Israel : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951866/what-a-fourth-consecutive-term-of-netanyahu-will-mean-for-israel,"What A 4th Consecutive Term Of Netanyahu Will Mean For Israel What A 4th Consecutive Term Of Netanyahu Will Mean For Israel Embed Embed
NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's tenure so far, and what another term will mean for the region.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Well, if things go as expected, Netanyahu is on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister. To talk about Netanyahu's long career as prime minister of Israel, we're joined now by Daniel Shapiro. He was the U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Obama administration, and he joins us from Tel Aviv. Welcome.
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Thank you. Great to be with you.
CHANG: So this will be Netanyahu's fourth consecutive term, but it's his fifth term overall as prime minister. Describe how you think Netanyahu has changed from the day he was first elected prime minister in 1996.
SHAPIRO: I think he's gone through several phases, at least on the issue that is so central to any Israeli prime minister - the Palestinian issue. He started as a real hard-liner. He dragged his feet on implementing the Oslo Accords they inherited from Prime Minister Rabin and worked on with the Clinton administration. And then when he left office in 1999 and returned 10 years later, he encountered President Obama, who wanted to try, yet again, to press forward on trying to achieve a two-state solution with the Palestinians.
And I - was then that I felt he really went through an intellectual transformation. He gave a very important speech in 2009, where he, for the first time, endorsed a two-state solution. But also, he told us privately that he really understood, in a new way, the strategic imperative for Israel of separating from the Palestinians, which would have to be in some form of two states. And we tried two rounds of negotiations. They both failed. And I think after the failure, he somewhat reverted back to his roots and fell into the embrace of his base. He concluded there was no Palestinian partner, but he also decided that was going to be his last attempt at trying to achieve a two-state solution.
CHANG: Has Netanyahu grown more and more right-wing? Because Israel has grown more and more right-wing.
SHAPIRO: When he came back into office in 2009, he sought a coalition that had balance in it that placed him almost in the middle of the coalition with parties to his right and parties to his left. And that allowed him to sort of play the forces back and forth against each other. And he was the little linchpin, and he could curve - move forward. He had two consecutive governments like that from the 2009 election and the 2013 election. Starting with the 2015 election, the coalition math didn't offer that possibility to him. And his most recent government - the one that's outgoing now - was much more to the right. In fact, he may have been one of the most left-wing members of his government. And that very much looks like it will be the case in the new government that he's likely to form.
So as any politician has done, he's adjusted. He's followed where the winds have gone, and he has governed from a more right-wing perspective. He doesn't have the left-wing balancer. And the indication of that came in this final weekend...
CHANG: Right.
SHAPIRO: ...Of the campaign when he, for the first time in his career, said that he would be open to annexation of parts of the West Bank. He's always resisted that, always knowing that that could pull Israel down a path of irreversible permanent control of Palestinians. Nevertheless, that's what many of his own supporters in other parties in the coalition and even in his Likud party are looking for. And he viewed that as a necessary commitment in the closing phase of the campaign. They're going to try to hold him to it once they take office in a few weeks' time.
CHANG: How would you say Netanyahu has changed Israel in the past decade? I know that's a huge question.
SHAPIRO: Yeah.
CHANG: But I'm curious how you would answer that.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. He's changed Israel, in part, by responding to the changing views and attitudes of Israelis that have moved in the direction of a more right-wing approach and a less accommodating approach toward a two-state solution. He has changed Israel by heavily promoting Israel's high tech sector with research and development funds and helping open markets in new countries all over the world. He's changed Israel by developing relations with many of Israel's Sunni Arab neighbors, besides Egypt and Jordan that it has peace treaties with.
But Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, several of the other Gulf states see Israel under Netanyahu as a partner - a partner in confronting their common enemy, which is Iran, and a partner in trying to convince the United States under President Trump to take a very hard line. But those relationships may be set up for a test now if he does indeed proceed with annexation moves in the West Bank. It may be very hard for those Arab states to sustain the kind of momentum that he and they have built together toward warmer relations between Israel and those countries while the two-state solution appears to be nearing its final stage of life.
CHANG: Daniel Shapiro was the former U.S. ambassador to Israel under President Obama. Thank you very much for joining us today.

Attorney General Barr Says He's Looking Into The Origins Of The Russia Investigation,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951891/attorney-general-barr-says-hes-looking-into-the-origins-of-the-russia-investigat,"Attorney General Bill Barr told Congress he's looking into the origins of the Russia investigation. He told members he has no evidence of wrongdoing but some ""unanswered questions.""
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Attorney General William Barr was back on Capitol Hill for a second consecutive day today, this time before the Senate. Barr provided a couple new details related to special counsel Robert Mueller's final report. But the attorney general also said something else that we're going to dig into now. He said that the U.S. government spied on the Trump campaign.
NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas was listening in, and he joins us now. Hey, Ryan.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.
CHANG: So President Trump has accused the Obama administration before of spying on his campaign. Then this comes up at the Barr hearing today. What exactly did the attorney general say?
LUCAS: So Barr was asked by Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen whether he actually thinks that the U.S. government spied on the Trump campaign. And this is what Barr had to say.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: I think there was - spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur.
JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, let me...
BARR: The question is whether it was predicated - adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated.
CHANG: Adequately predicated.
LUCAS: Right. To translate that out of kind of lawyer speak, what Barr is saying is that he wants to figure out whether that, quote, unquote, ""spying"" was done legally. Now, he said it would be a big deal if the government had, indeed, illegally spied on a political campaign. He says that he's putting a team together of people at the Justice Department to look into this. He says it's not a formal investigation.
Now, these allegations are actually something that the department's inspector general is already looking at. And Barr said yesterday, actually, that that investigation is expected to wrap up in May or June.
CHANG: Another probe, OK. So this is an idea that the president's allies in Congress have been long pushing for, you know, for months. So do you feel like it carries more weight now when it comes from the attorney general?
LUCAS: Well, it's a big deal for the attorney general to say this. He's a very good, very experienced lawyer - Bill Barr is. He's usually pretty circumspect with his language. And his decision to call this spying, which, of course, echoes the president's own language, raised a lot of eyebrows. Here's Democrat Brian Schatz.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BRIAN SCHATZ: I think the word spying could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out.
LUCAS: Senator Schatz said that it's different when the attorney general uses the word spying in this context. He says it's provocative. It's inflammatory. And he gave a chance, actually, of Barr to reconsider his word choice. Here's how that exchange went.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BARR: I'm not sure of all the connotations of that word that you're referring to. But, you know, unauthorized surveillance. I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.
SCHATZ: OK. Thank you.
BARR: Is that more appropriate in your mind?
CHANG: Sounds a little testy there.
So I mean, we do know that there was some surveillance targeting people involved in the Trump campaign. Did Barr get into what his specific concerns are?
LUCAS: That's right. We know, for example, that - a court-approved surveillance against Trump campaign aide Carter Page. This was because the FBI had concerns that Page might have been working with the Russian government. We know this because the government's top-secret application to the court to get the authority to conduct that surveillance was actually made public.
Barr said he doesn't have any specific evidence that the FBI or other U.S. intelligence agencies did anything wrong, but he does have concerns about how all of this went down. He said, normally, law enforcement would tell a campaign if they thought that it was targeted by foreign intelligence. We know that the Trump campaign did receive a counterintelligence briefing in the summer of 2016. We just don't know what they were told.
Bottom line here, though - Barr has concerns. He wants to look into it.
CHANG: All right. That's NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thanks, Ryan.
LUCAS: Thank you.

In Alaska Shrinking Oil Revenues May Mean Severe Cutbacks To State Ferry System,www.npr.org,Nat Herz,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711580000/in-alaska-shrinking-oil-revenues-may-mean-severe-cutbacks-to-state-ferry-system,"Enlarge this image The ferries Malaspina and LeConte are docked near Juneau at sunrise. Both ships are part of Alaska's state ferry system, which could face steep budget cuts Oct. 1, under a proposal by Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy. Nat Herz/Alaska Public Media Nat Herz/Alaska Public Media The ferries Malaspina and LeConte are docked near Juneau at sunrise. Both ships are part of Alaska's state ferry system, which could face steep budget cuts Oct. 1, under a proposal by Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
Nat Herz/Alaska Public Media Just after 6 a.m., a handful of cars drive down the ramp into the LeConte, the Alaska state ferry docked in Juneau.
The LeConte's destinations that day include Angoon, an indigenous village of 450, and Tenakee Springs, a town of about 150. Both sit on islands with no connection to the state's road system and airports. To get to Angoon or Tenakee Springs from Juneau, you can buy a seaplane ticket for $150, or spend $50 to ride the ferry.
But Alaska's new Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, is taking aim at the ferry system's budget , proposing sharp cuts that are threatening its future. He's also pushing major reductions to public schools, health care and the state university system. The savings would be used to boost dividends from the state's oil-wealth fund up to $3,000.
Oil revenue once was sufficient for Alaska to run its state government and pay dividends from the fund, according to a decades-old legal formula. But amid lower oil prices and a longstanding decline in production, there's no longer enough money to do both. Dunleavy's plan to boost the dividends by cutting government programs is spurring a debate here about what residents value and are willing to pay for.
""I'm having a difficult time believing that we take that money off of elders in rural Alaska, we take that money off of 10-year-olds who are saving it up for college, we take that money off of single parents that have three or four children in their families that are struggling. And we bring it into government to continue spending at the rate we're spending,"" Dunleavy said during a recent appearance on Alaska Public Media.
Opponents of the governor's proposals have turned out at demonstrations and public meetings, where they've said his plans would change the character of Alaska – particularly its rural communities. They've also said they're willing to give up some of their dividends or pay taxes – Alaskans currently pay no state taxes on income or sales.
It's like a giant step back in time.
Shayne Thompson, store owner in Angoon
School buses and freight transport
Onboard the LeConte, Shayne Thompson was contemplating what would happen if the state ferry system stops running Oct. 1, as Dunleavy is proposing. The system, with nearly a dozen vessels, functions as school buses, freight transport and even hearses in the southeast part of the state, a 300-mile-long archipelago where only a few towns are connected to the road system.
Thompson runs the store in Angoon, and he puts supplies on the ferry every week. He could hire a barge for deliveries instead, but prices would likely rise by 25 percent and food would come less often, he says.
""It's like a giant step back in time,"" Thompson says. ""We would have, basically, fresh produce and dairy for a week or two of the month. And then the rest of the month it would be all dry goods.""
Southeast Alaska residents and political leaders have staged rallies at the Capitol where they've advocated for the preservation of the system, which is known as the marine highway.
Diminishing oil production
Alaska once pumped 2 million barrels of oil a day and accounted for one-fourth of U.S. crude production. But production from the state's massive North Slope fields has been declining for 30 years, and it's now about 500,000 barrels a day.
For more than two decades, state lawmakers had debated filling budget deficits with money from Alaska's oil-wealth fund. But they'd never voted to do so until a 2014 crash in oil prices led to the depletion of the state's savings accounts.
[T]he best thing to do is reduce the government side of the economy.
Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy
Last year, for the first time ever, the Legislature voted to use some of the fund's money on general government programs — reducing residents' dividends from an estimated $2,900 to $1,600.
Dunleavy campaigned on boosting dividends back to roughly $3,000 this year, and paying residents back for reductions in previous years. He held public forums last month — sponsored by the anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity — where he continued making the case that individuals should decide how to spend their dividends, rather than the government.
""We feel that for the sake of the private economy to get that back on its feet, and to grow the private economy, that the best thing to do is reduce the government side of the economy,"" he said at an Anchorage forum.
Campaign promises
The governor's critics have argued that, when Dunleavy was a candidate, he promised to pay larger dividends without acknowledging the deep cuts to services that would be required to afford them. At one campaign stop in the Southeast Alaska city of Ketchikan, he said there was ""no plan to hack, cut or destroy"" the state ferry system.
Dunleavy's budget ultimately proposed cutting more than two-thirds from the ferry system's budget, justifying the move by saying that a short-term decline in oil prices had reduced the state's expectations for oil revenue.
Thompson, the Angoon store owner, is a Republican who voted for Dunleavy after hearing he would protect the state ferry system.
""I feel like a fool, because of listening to somebody that had a totally different agenda in mind when they were on the campaign trail,"" Thompson says.
The state legislature, which is still in the middle of its budget process, has so far rejected or softened many of the governor's proposed cuts.
But Dunleavy has line-item veto power that would require three-fourths of the legislature to vote to overturn, prompting anxiety among people who depend on the services that he's proposing to cut.
Economy Alaska Faces Budget Deficit As Crude Oil Prices Slide Bert Stedman, a state senator from Sitka who co-chairs his chamber's budget committee, says political dynamics are likely to force residents from his region to accept some level of reduced service.
When the ferry system was established a half-century ago, Southeast Alaska's timber industry was booming. Now, Stedman says, ""there's no more pulp mills,"" and there are now two senators that represent Southeast, down from five.
""We have had a significant dilution, since the creation of the marine highway, of political influence. And that is continuing to erode,"" Stedman says. ""We are not in the position where we can, frankly, dictate what we want to do. We just don't have the numbers."""
Advanced Safety Technologies For Cars Come At A Price That Many Won't Pay,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951898/advanced-safety-technologies-for-cars-come-at-a-price-that-many-wont-pay,"NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with David Friedman, vice president of advocacy for Consumer Reports, about the availability of advanced safety technologies such as automatic emergency braking in new cars.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The investigations into the fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes have revealed troubling details about safety. For example, Boeing was charging extra for a safety feature - one that might've helped the pilots in those flights. Boeing says it will now make that feature standard. We wondered whether the same could be true of safety features in cars.
Some new cars have features to avoid collisions or stay in a lane. Depending on the make and model, features like those could come standard or cost extra. David Friedman was acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and he's now on the policy side of Consumer Reports. Welcome to the studio.
DAVID FRIEDMAN: Thanks a lot for having me, Ari.
SHAPIRO: Let's start by talking about a feature called automatic emergency braking. I understand this is a technology that has been really widely adopted, largely because of a voluntary agreement where automakers said they'll make it standard by 2022. What does this do? How important is it?
FRIEDMAN: Well, this technology is fantastic. Basically, if you're about to rear-end someone, this technology will first warn you. And if you don't act, it will hit the brakes for you. And the data show that it could reduce rear-end crashes by 40 percent or more.
SHAPIRO: Now, I said it will be standard by 2022, but if I buy a new car today, am I likely to have this feature?
FRIEDMAN: Honestly, it's 50-50. If we look at 2019 model year data, about half of the automakers sell vehicles where the technology comes standard. Toyota, for example, and Honda have been making a lot of this technology standard on their vehicles. With the others, you may have to pay thousands of dollars to get that technology.
SHAPIRO: Is there something troubling about offering a safety feature that can save lives that costs thousands of dollars extra?
FRIEDMAN: I mean, to me, safety should never be a luxury, and that's effectively what the car companies are creating in these scenarios, or at least some of them.
SHAPIRO: So that's automatic emergency braking. Tell me about another technology that you think might not be standard but perhaps should be.
FRIEDMAN: Well, there's a few that we could think of. I mean, first, automatic emergency braking itself is great, but what about adding pedestrian detection so that if you're driving around town, you're much less likely to run into a pedestrian or bicyclist?
Or how about if you're driving down the highway and you're about to steer into another lane and you don't know a car's in your blind spot? A blind spot warning system could help save your life or help avoid you running someone else off the road.
SHAPIRO: You know, features like air bags and seat belts used to not be in every car. Today, they are. Do you think it's just a matter of time until these kinds of features are standard in every new vehicle?
FRIEDMAN: Well, time and again, automakers have developed amazing technology, but they have tried to get consumers to pay a lot for it and refused to put them standard in every car. So usually, regulators have to force them to put them standard in each car. And honestly, that's part of what happened with automatic emergency braking.
The federal government was getting ready to require all car companies to equip it, and so the companies, instead, said, hey, let's do this voluntarily.
SHAPIRO: So it's voluntary, but voluntary under duress.
FRIEDMAN: Exactly.
SHAPIRO: Do you see the kind of regulatory pressure that could make automakers standardize these other safety features that you're talking about?
FRIEDMAN: Certainly not right now, not under this administration.
SHAPIRO: If I'm an automaker and I've invested a huge amount of money in research and development of a safety technology, why shouldn't I try to recoup some of that money by asking buyers to pay a little extra for their car?
FRIEDMAN: If it was a little extra, that wouldn't bug me one bit. I mean, you look at Toyota, who has all that same technology. Almost all of it's standard in their base model of the RAV4, a car that costs around $27,000, $28,000. And Toyota's not having a problem making a profit. This is technology that can cost a few hundred dollars at the end of the day. This isn't bank-breaking technology.
SHAPIRO: Commercial pilots do get so much more training than anyone who gets behind the wheel of a car. Is there a risk that if you put all of these technologies in place - from automatic breaking to lane change, pedestrian sensor - that drivers start getting lazy?
FRIEDMAN: Well, the key to a lot of the technologies that we are talking about is they're proven to have on-road safety benefits. So they're out there in the market, and we can see them saving lives.
It's some of the more advanced technologies, where you can truly take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the accelerator and brake - those are the ones that concern us because of the way they're implemented today. Another technology we'd like to start seeing coming standard in cars is a simple driver monitoring system that can tell whether or not you're actually still driving.
SHAPIRO: David Friedman is vice president of advocacy for Consumer Reports. Thanks for coming into the studio today.
FRIEDMAN: Thank you.

The Army and Air Force Exchange Service, one of the largest retailers in the United States which serves millions of active-duty military members and their families, is clarifying a memo sent this week which recommended that stores stop displaying the news on their televisions.
The message, obtained by NPR, told managers, ""News channels should not be shown on common area TVs due to their divisive political nature.""
Instead, the Defense Department agency suggested that stores feature something less controversial: sports. ""The Exchange has elected to play sports channels/sports programming on all common area TVs,"" the message stated.

Televisions mounted in common areas have often displayed Fox and CNN, allowing customers to watch news reports as they eat in food courts and shop in stores.
Chris Ward, AAFES' senior public affairs manager, tells NPR that the memo was not a policy change but ""general guidance"" for the stores.
Ward says the recommendation to feature sports channels over the news reflected a desire to appeal to as many customers as possible.
""We've gotten comments from customers, 'Why is this TV on Fox?' 'Why is this TV on CNN?' You're never going to appeal to everyone,"" Ward says."

AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Today in Parliament, British Prime Minister Theresa May expressed regret but stopped short of an apology for one of the worst massacres of the British Empire. One hundred years ago this Saturday, a British general gave an order to open fire on thousands of unarmed civilians in India, which was then ruled by the British. NPR's Lauren Frayer traveled to the exact spot where it happened - a park in the northern city of Amritsar.

LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: It's a bustling city park, families having picnics under trees, birds chirping, and then you start to notice something different about Jallianwala Bagh - a brick wall with bullet holes in it. And there's a little plaque that says 1,650 rounds were fired, and it says these were fired into the crowd by the order of General Dyer.
AMANDEEP BAL: Every Indian knows about General Dyer.
FRAYER: His name is seared on India's painful colonial past, says historian Amandeep Bal. On April 13, 1919, General Reginald Dyer, a British army commander, responded to the scene of what he thought was an unauthorized gathering at Jallianwala Bagh, or park.
BAL: One hundred years ago, it was just an open space. General Dyer - he blocked the entrance, stationed his troops and immediately started firing.
FRAYER: No warning.
BAL: No warning - nothing.
FRAYER: The British identified nearly 400 dead, but there was a curfew. Families were frightened to go out and collect the bodies. Locals put the death toll at about 1,500, maybe more.
BAL: It definitely changed the mindset of the people. There were many who had full faith in the British sense of justice. Even they lost that faith.
FRAYER: Among them, a certain freedom campaigner named Mohandas Gandhi.
(SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED FILM)
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, vocalizing).
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Jallianwala Bagh.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) Jallianwala Bagh.
FRAYER: Bollywood films have dramatized the tragedy. It's a big part of how Indians tell their freedom story.
(CROSSTALK)
FRAYER: In an artist's workshop a few hundred yards from Jallianwala Bagh, elderly brothers chant a prayer for the dead.
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Foreign language spoken).
FRAYER: The Singh family are painters. On their workshop wall is a drawing by the family prodigy, a 15-year-old boy gunned down 100 years ago. Surinder Singh, now 82, is his nephew.
SURINDER SINGH: (Through interpreter) My grandfather was heartbroken. He lost his son and also a dedicated worker, his apprentice. Our family has kept all of his original drawings.
FRAYER: Singh keeps newspaper clippings about the massacre. General Dyer was relieved of command but never jailed. He died in England of natural causes, and no one ever apologized to the Singh family.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: A moment of silence as David Cameron becomes the first sitting British prime minister to visit the site.
FRAYER: Not even when then-British Prime Minister David Cameron visited Jallianwala Bagh in 2013. But some U.K. lawmakers of Indian descent are lobbying for an apology now. The problem, says historian Kim Wagner, is how to word it.
KIM WAGNER: You can say, oh, yes, we acknowledge there was the Amritsar massacre, but that was really a fluke event and General Dyer is a rogue officer, which is basically what David Cameron said in 2013 when he visited.
FRAYER: But Wagner says it was no fluke. The massacre reveals how scared British rulers were of their subjects, how unequal they were and how unfair the Empire had become.
WAGNER: No British government would ever apologize for the system of colonialism. They would only ever conceivably apologize for Dyer's actions.
FRAYER: The kind of apology that might help people heal here, Wagner says, is not the kind Britain might be willing to make. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, India.

British Prime Minister Theresa May Asks For Another Delay Of Brexit : NPR,www.npr.org,Frank Langfitt,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951912/british-prime-minister-theresa-may-asks-for-another-delay-of-brexit,"British Prime Minister Theresa May went to Brussels again on Wednesday asking for a further delay to Britain's exit from the European Union, amid continued political deadlock in the U.K. parliament.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The European Union has agreed to extend Brexit until Halloween. That means the U.K. will not crash out of the EU with no deal this Friday. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, just spoke, and he said he had this message for his British friends.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DONALD TUSK: This extension is as flexible as I expected and a little bit shorter than I expected. But it's still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time.
CHANG: For more on this story, we turn now to NPR's Frank Langfitt in London. Hey, Frank.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, Alisa. How are you?
CHANG: I'm sorry. It's really late over there. So what does this extension mean?
LANGFITT: Well, what he said - you just heard from Donald Tusk - this is a flexible extension. And the idea is that the United Kingdom could have up until October 31 to get its ducks in a row, to get some kind of Brexit withdrawal agreement passed through the Parliament. But if it does it before the 31st, they can leave earlier, and that will be attractive to a lot of members of Parliament who don't want to be stuck in the EU for a long time.
CHANG: Yeah.
LANGFITT: The other thing that Donald Tusk said is that during this time, the United Kingdom would still have all the regular rights of an EU member but would be expected to kind of behave itself and not try to disrupt things. And there's a concern that if there's a Brexiteer prime minister who comes in after Prime Minister May, they might try to cause some trouble.
CHANG: And why the choice of Halloween for the next deadline? I mean...
LANGFITT: So (laughter)...
CHANG: Is someone trying to be funny here?
LANGFITT: They're not trying to be funny, but I think it's totally appropriate given that the way Brexit has gone, it has been pretty much a horror story from pretty early on. But that's not the real reason for this. This is actually a compromise between Emmanuel Macron, the president of France. He wanted a much shorter window for the United Kingdom to get this done. He is concerned about the U.K. hanging around too long in the EU and maybe being disruptive.
Other - many other countries were willing to go nine months, perhaps even a year. So they're splitting the difference. And that's also for another reason. The European Commission - this is the group that proposes legislation within the EU. They take their seats on November 1. So the idea is get the U.K. out before then. You know, the whole idea is for the U.K. to leave. But as time goes on, they have to keep, you know, running for offices and continuing to stay very involved in the EU.
CHANG: Now, where does Prime Minister Theresa May go from here because she has been trying and trying and trying to get an agreement.
LANGFITT: She has. And I think what you'll see is - we haven't heard from her yet this evening. We may hear very soon. But she is probably going to come back to the United Kingdom and continue to try to work out a compromise with the opposition Labour Party. The Labour Party would like a customs union that would keep basically goods being able to trade practically seamlessly between the EU and the United Kingdom. Brexiteers are not happy with that. They don't want that at all. They would like to see much more of a firm walking away from the European Union. They hope that the U.K. could then strike new trade deals with other countries.
I think you could see pressure building for the prime minister to resign. The longer this is going to go on, the - her conservative party is going to have to be thinking she is very damaged goods of course. She's not very popular. Who would they have lead them forward? And I think it's going to be fascinating to see how that plays out because she doesn't look like she's going anywhere. She looks like she'll probably stand her ground.
CHANG: That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London. Thanks so much, Frank.
LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Ailsa.

Wrangler On His Booty: Lil Nas X On The Making And The Magic Of 'Old Town Road',www.npr.org,Rodney Carmichael,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711167412/wrangler-on-his-booty-lil-nas-x-on-the-making-and-the-magic-of-old-town-road,"Enlarge this image ""I never want my name to be more hot because of controversy than my music,"" Lil Nas X says. ""It's like a blessing and a curse."" Eric Lang/Courtesy of the artist Eric Lang/Courtesy of the artist ""I never want my name to be more hot because of controversy than my music,"" Lil Nas X says. ""It's like a blessing and a curse.""
Eric Lang/Courtesy of the artist Magical things keep happening to Lil Nas X. Crazy, serendipitous things. Take last Sunday, just two days before his 20 th birthday: He's sitting in the stands at L.A.'s Staples Center, when out of nowhere the ball in play falls into his possession. ""Like literally, I was at the Lakers game, and the ball flew in my hands,"" he says. ""It was just a sign in a way. Or, at least, that's how I felt. And I'm not even a superstitious person, but yeah.""
The next day he met an even bigger fate. Having already consumed the nation in a debate over race, genre and their unholy miscegenation over the last century in the music industry, his country-trap ditty ""Old Town Road"" topped the Billboard Hot 100. It wasn't totally unexpected, especially after he released a twangy remix last Friday featuring another country disrupter, Billy Ray Cyrus. But in the aftermath of Billboard removing ""Old Town Road"" from the Hot Country Songs chart the week prior — while declaring that the song ""does not embrace enough elements of today's country music"" — his success proves the gatekeepers comically incapable of reining him in as he hops genres, busts formats and breaks all the old-school taboos.
YouTube Every few years it feels like another artist emerges from Atlanta who challenges tradition and reinvents the sound of music. It's something hip-hop heads and pop prognosticators have been hyper-tuned to over the last decade. What we're still learning to grasp is how a generation of digital natives is reconfiguring the way songs are made, marketed, even manipulated online for mass consumption. Lil Nas X happens to be expert at all of the above — an Atlanta-based artist who's an Internet baby, first and foremost, raised on a steady diet of memes. Among the last decade's rotating cast of ATLiens, his blueprint bears more in common with Soulja Boy's early social media sorcery than Future 's modulated robocroon.
It took some luck to lasso in everything from the Yeehaw Agenda to a potential cowboy-hat wearing Will Smith for the soon-promised second video, but the real magic behind the college dropout's No. 1 hit might be hidden in his algorithmic skills as a viral meme-maker. New York magazine's politics and tech blog Intelligencer linked him to a suspended Nicki Minaj stan account on Twitter (@nasmaraj), known for creating elaborate choose-your-own-adventure scenario threads and tweetdecking its way to virality. Lil Nas X denied any association with the account during our conversation, but he does admit to being ""Internet savvy."" His innate understanding of the matrix led him to label ""Old Town Road"" a country song when he uploaded it to streaming platforms like SoundCloud. But he's less beholden to any radio format than he is to the shape-shifting nature of online identity. It's even inherent in his approach to songwriting. But don't dismiss his musical talent for mere trolling. If the worldwide web is his wild west, he's one black cowboy who's transferred his skills from URL to IRL.
When we spoke by phone on Monday, just a few hours before ""Old Town Road"" became the No. 1 song on this week's Hot 100, he was in a hotel room in L.A., where he'd been for a week, ""making a lot of music, and having a lot of interviews and meetings,"" he told me during a 25-minute phone call sandwiched into his packed schedule. The only plans he had for his birthday the following day were to ""celebrate by being happy where I'm at,"" he said. He sounded present despite the whirlwind around him, and surprisingly hesitant to claim any credit for capitalizing off of the surrounding controversy — ""I never want my name to be more hot because of controversy than my music, but it's also bringing attention, so it's like a blessing and a curse,"" he said at one point — even as he smartly reaps the benefits.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity
A lot of people are calling what happened to you — in terms of Billboard taking down the original song off the country chart — evidence of enduring racism and segregation in the music industry. Did you ever think that your song would spark such a historic cultural moment?
Initially I was like, ""I think I'm being discriminated against."" But then as I went on to think about it, I felt like it was more of a purist situation, like, ""We want this to stay this way."" And even though they have a lot of changes going on with country [music] — like a lot of pop country and even the [songs] with trap influence — maybe this was [them saying], ""Hey, we let some stuff fly, but this was too far."" You feel me?... One of those scared [responses], like, ""We don't want this to evolve this far,"" basically.
Every year there's some new artist that emerges from Atlanta who totally changes how we listen to music. But it seems like you're more of an Internet baby than anything else.
Definitely. That would probably be the best term for me.
What are some of your earliest experiences using the internet?
I started using the Internet heavily right around the time when memes started to become their own form of entertainment. I started to get into every side of the Internet around 13-ish. Not even intentionally, just learning how it works and how to use it to my advantage.
When did music and the Internet begin to intersect for you?
When I started to make music I wasn't as serious at first. I would make some songs that I really felt like making [but] I would make other songs that I felt like people wanted to hear from me. Once I started to make music that I wanted to make, I didn't care at that point. ""Old Town Road""'s the peak of me doing whatever I want to do with music. I was like, ""This one is special,"" and I promoted it heavily on my account on Twitter. Then it caught onto Tik Tok, and the rest is history .... I was like, ""OK, this is my destiny.""
And It looks like you might pull this epic music video off. Will Smith says he's down .
Yeah. This is gonna be insane. Oh, and what's being planned is gonna be perfectly executed. You know, it's Will Smith in like my second music video ever. So that'll be a big upgrade.
Music News Lil Nas X, Country Music's Unlikely Son, Sparks Conversation On Genre And Race You've talked about writing lines that you knew would be meme-able. Which ones stick out?
Even though it's something so simple: ""I got the horses in the back."" I was like this is gonna be the highlight of the memes right here. And then, ""The cowboy hat from Gucci / Wrangler on my booty."" ... ""Riding on a horse / You can whip your Porsche,"" I was like, ""These are all quotables."" I was just doing that the entire month of making the song: ""Put this right here ... oh, this is gonna be the best plan ever."" And, you know, it worked. So it's a manifestation of itself.
So you worked on it for about a month?
Yeah, just switching melodies and flows in and out, seeing what would fit best. And you know, I had to do that wait time anyway, because whatever way I was making money at that time, it wasn't definitely not a lot. And it was my first studio made song, because I was like this can't be no butt-quality song.
Being that you're pretty crafty on the Internet, I almost have to wonder if you had anything to do with the whole Yeehaw Agenda exploding in recent months?
Yeah, that was crazy. That was definitely not intentional. I didn't even know that was going on at the moment. It was like a fall-into-place thing.
Once you saw it, did you make conscious moves to capitalize on it?
Not necessarily. I was already doing what I was planning on doing for the song. That was just a bonus. That was just luck that that happened.
How intentional have you been in every other step of the way — in terms of releasing the song and labeling it country, milking that controversy when it came about, and then planning the remix with Billy Ray Cyrus?
When I uploaded the song and I labeled it country I knew the song was country-trap, but I feel like if I had to choose — which I had to — I thought it would lean more on the country side. So I labeled it as country. And this is during the time I'm not expecting my song to actually hop up on charts. So, it wasn't intentional. I'm not expecting to have the No. 1 spot on the country charts, but it happened.
Do you consider yourself a fan of country music?
I'm a fan of all genres of music. I have a few country songs I like. I'm not gonna say I'm a huge country fan but, you know, I listen around.
When did you first reach out to Billy Ray Cyrus, and when did y'all record the remix?
December 4th is when I first was like trying to get him on the song through Twitter. I was like, ""Everybody retweet this. Please help get Billy Ray on it."" But once I got with Columbia [Records], it was easy to get in contact with him. We got together, we did it and it came out amazing. It's like a moment.
YouTube What kind of doors do you think the success of the song will open up for what you hope to do next?
It opens several doors for me and it feels like a weight lifted off of my shoulders. It's like I got this now and it's nothing that's gonna stop what's about to happen. So it puts me in a good position.
I'm sure a lot of people are betting on you being a one-hit wonder.
Yeah, definitely, a lot.
I imagine it's because the things that made this song a huge success are also the same things that could end up boxing you in — if you try to duplicate it the sound will get old, but if you don't replicate it people won't recognize you in it. So what's your way around that?
I'm already Internet savvy, so it's nothing to promote. Plus, I have an entire label behind me now. I have my name and I have a growing fan base, so I'm gonna do whatever I want. And I feel like people are gonna like it because people always think they know what they want, but they don't know what they want. So that's always gonna be the situation.
What's your reaction to the theories linking you to the @nasmaraj (Nicki Minaj stan) Twitter account? It would really add an incredible layer to your story if it's true.
It's like a big misunderstanding and it's not one that I even want to give the time, because I'm never putting someone as the face of my career. So I don't even speak on it. I just don't even acknowledge it, really. I know even more things are being made up and they're gonna be out there. It is disappointing when a big blog will post something without me talking about it but, I mean, it happens.
A couple of days ago, you tweeted: ""I have been recording a documentary for four months as a social experiment after dropping Old Town Road, and you all are a part of it.""
Yeah, I say some things but a lot of times it's as a joke. But the funny thing is I did record a video back in January. I was gonna do videos of ""Old Town Road"" going up each day, but [realized] I don't have time for that and I don't have the phone space. So that didn't happen. But that tweet was just like comedy.
How do you respond to people that say y'all are taking Lil Nas X too seriously, he's really like trolling the industry, or this is more of a joke to him than it is to us?
I mean, hey, you feel how you wanna feel. I know the truth. And people know the truth. Even if they like [""Old Town Road""] as a joke, they're not liking this as a joke and putting it at No. 1, too, so something's going on."
Secretary Of State Mike Pompeo Defends Aid Cuts To Central America,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951933/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-defends-aid-cuts-to-central-america,"Secretary Of State Mike Pompeo Defends Aid Cuts To Central America Secretary Of State Mike Pompeo Defends Aid Cuts To Central America Embed Embed
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was back on the Hill Wednesday, defending budget cuts, including to Central America. He says aid is on pause until countries do more to stop migration.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on Capitol Hill today defending the Trump administration's decision to cut aid to Central America. Pompeo tried to convince lawmakers that money to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras should be withheld until those countries do more to stop their citizens from coming to the U.S. Some lawmakers said that is backwards thinking, as NPR's Michele Kelemen reports.
MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: The ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez, says U.S. aid to Central America is meant to address the root causes of migration.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ROBERT MENENDEZ: Why are people fleeing? They're fleeing because of violent crime. Their choice is stay or die or flee and have a chance at living. Or stay and see my daughter raped or stay and see my son forcibly put into a gang. We need to fight at the very essence of that. And the very essence of that is not at our border. It's in Central America.
KELEMEN: But Pompeo argues that U.S. aid programs in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are not working. His evidence - the situation at the U.S. southern border.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: You can see it's a fact of this crisis at the southern border that it has not been effective. And so we are endeavoring to change that, right? This is the - we deal in reality. It's not enough to take taxpayer money and spend it there. You need to get something for that, and that's what we are engaged in now.
KELEMEN: The secretary told Senate appropriators Tuesday that the U.S. has stopped allocating new funds until those countries take seriously the need to control their own borders. Some lawmakers see this as a major departure. Congressman Tom Malinowski, a former State Department official, says it's one thing to help these countries deal with the causes of migration. It's another to demand that they stop people from leaving.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TOM MALINOWSKI: Can you think of any precedent, historical precedent, in which the United States has urged another country to stop people from leaving? I mean, we urged the Soviet Union to allow Soviet Jews to leave. We would - we have condemned North Korea from stopping people from leaving its country. We would be outraged if the Maduro regime were to stop people from leaving.
KELEMEN: He was addressing his mostly rhetorical questions to the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development at a hearing Tuesday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MALINOWSKI: How would this even work? Are we advising the Honduran police to arrest or shoot people if they try to leave their country?
KELEMEN: Fellow Democrat Brad Sherman raised similar doubts, pointing out that the U.S. has seen a dramatic decline in migration from Mexico because things are better there now. He says the same could be true for Central America if aid is used well. Secretary Pompeo, though, has a different priority. He's urging lawmakers to change asylum laws so that Central Americans can stay in Mexico.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
POMPEO: I worked on an agreement where we would allow those with proper asylum claims to wait for their asylum hearing - the numbers are overwhelming - to wait in Mexico. And we had a court fundamentally misread the law and deny us the ability to do that. We need your help.
KELEMEN: Today, Senator Tom Udall pressed him on why.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TOM UDALL: Do you believe our country is, quote, ""full"" as the president has said and that we should not accept any more asylum-seekers or immigrants to the United States?
POMPEO: This is the most generous nation in the history of civilization. It's just the case.
KELEMEN: The secretary of state carefully avoids answering the question or showing any daylight with a president determined to stem the flow of migrants from Central America.

Climate Change Is Forcing Farmers In Guatemala To Leave Their Land For The U.S.,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951941/climate-change-is-forcing-farmers-in-guatemala-to-leave-their-land-for-the-u-s,"Climate Change Is Forcing Farmers In Guatemala To Leave Their Land For The U.S. Climate Change Is Forcing Farmers In Guatemala To Leave Their Land For The U.S. Embed Embed
NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Jonathan Blitzer of The New Yorker about how climate change is forcing farmers in Guatemala to leave their land and attempt to make it to the United States.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
As we just heard, Central American migrants who arrive at the U.S. border often talk about violence and poverty driving them north. Jonathan Blitzer writes in The New Yorker about another big factor in this crisis - climate change. He spent time in Guatemala reporting on how the changing climate is helping to drive people to leave. Jonathan Blitzer, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
JONATHAN BLITZER: Thank you.
SHAPIRO: Tell me about one of the small towns in Guatemala you visited where the impact of climate change is really apparent.
BLITZER: There was a small town about 9,000 feet above sea level called Climentoro. And basically the way you'd begin to feel the impact of climate change, which sometimes feels so vast as to almost be impossible to fully survey, is in the form of, first of all, how few young men were visible on the streets of this town. Most of the young men in this town had already left for the U.S. And the reason specifically is it's a community that consists almost entirely of subsistence farmers who grow potatoes, maize, a few other vegetables. It's hard to grow things at that altitude.
SHAPIRO: Under the best of circumstances, it's hard to grow things at that altitude.
BLITZER: Exactly, exactly. And in recent years, and what everyone said, almost to a person, was that over the last six or seven years, things really began to change. The weather patterns started to become erratic. The rains didn't come when they were supposed to come. And increasingly, it became impossible for people to grow their staple crops - to grow potatoes, to grow maize. And as a result, they had not only nothing to eat but also nothing to survive on to sell. And so as a result, increasingly, people were abandoning their land and heading north.
SHAPIRO: In this town of Climentoro, you say there were almost no young men of working age, but the migration crisis at the border is a lot of parents with young children. And you saw evidence of those departures, too. Tell us about that.
BLITZER: That's true. The new dynamic, as you say, is that increasingly families are coming to the U.S. seeking asylum. And you saw that, too, in a lot of these communities. People would say, for example, that, look; we're going to leave anyway, but if we go as a family, we at least have a better shot of making it across the U.S. border.
SHAPIRO: A lot of these subsistence farmers were barely scraping by anyway. How do you know that the struggles they're having today are a result of climate change?
BLITZER: It's a good question. I mean, I think for one thing, there's a general stipulation that has to be made, which is that climate change kind of on its own isn't the single thing that's driving people north, but it seriously exacerbates the existing problems in the region. But concretely, the descriptions of how weather patterns were changing, the increasing spikes and then drops in temperature, people spoke extremely specifically about how their crops were affected. So people, for example, planting potatoes would say, look; now we have new fungus that are growing that weren't here four years ago. We need to invest more money in pesticides to kill some of these new fungus that are growing as a result of increased humidity. Now, it's impossible for us to make any profit on our crops. All of this stuff was identifiable as being a new force, a new phenomenon in the last few years.
SHAPIRO: Well, this makes me think about what we hear from the U.S. government that countries like Guatemala need to do more to address the migration crisis. And generally, they're referring to problems of instability and violence, but problems of climate change can't be addressed by the government of Guatemala, right?
BLITZER: That's right. And in fact, all of the problems really that that are affecting this region and that are forcing people to leave, everything from violence to massive entrenched corruption to years of poverty, all of these things are too big and too complex for any single government on its own to solve as a policy matter. The U.S. needs to take the lead on this. And the fact that the Trump administration seems to be moving in the exact opposite direction, that is to say planning to cut aid, seeming to penalize these governments basically for the desperation of their situation, is just obviously counterproductive.
SHAPIRO: There was a U.S.-funded program to help some of the farmers who are struggling with the changing climate. And it sounds from your reporting like it actually had a positive impact. Tell us about it.
BLITZER: There was a small tiny hamlet called Paraje Leon where beginning in around 2015, the community received help from a group of local NGOs that had money from the U.S. We're talking about tiny sums of money - $190,000 over the course of a three-year period. And this community basically had agronomists and forestry experts come to the community, instruct them on how to diversify their crops, help them begin to respond to some of these acute pressures wrought by climate change, and more and more people decided they did not need to leave because they saw a viable future in this community. This funding stream ended in 2017 because of the Trump administration's hostility to climate change as a force in the region and as a problem that needed to be solved. And so everyone was very much buoyed by the money that came through and the opportunities that that presented for them. And now that that money is gone and that some of those opportunities have been taken away, it's harder, I think, for many of them to imagine staying.

The last veteran of a World War II bombing raid on Japan died Tuesday at age 103 in San Antonio. Richard Cole was part of the Doolittle raid — named for Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
A hero of the Second World War died yesterday. Retired Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole was 103. He was the last of what were known as the Doolittle Raiders.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
To strike back at the Japanese after they attacked Pearl Harbor, a bombing of Tokyo was organized by U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle. Dick Cole was Doolittle's co-pilot in the lead plane.
SHAPIRO: Three movies were made about the mission. Spencer Tracy played Doolittle in ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO"")
SPENCER TRACY: (As Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle) Hello? Hello, York? I want you to get 24 B-25s with volunteer crews down to Eglin Field as soon as you can. The job will take them out of the country for about three months. Tell them it's a secret mission.
CHANG: Doolittle's raid really didn't do much to weaken the Japanese war effort, but it put Japan on the defensive. Tokyo hadn't realized the U.S. could attack their homeland. Meanwhile, the raid boosted morale back in the U.S.
SHAPIRO: After dropping his bombs, Lieutenant Colonel Dick Cole's plane ran out of fuel. The crew bailed out over China before the plane crashed. Chinese locals and Western missionaries helped Cole, Doolittle and their crews evade the Japanese so they could eventually make it back to America.
CHANG: Years later, Dick Cole talked to NPR about his attitude toward the mission.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
DICK COLE: I'm going to say something very trite, but it's the truth. That was our job. You're on a mission, and you don't believe it's a suicide mission.
CHANG: For Dick Cole, the Tokyo raid was just the beginning of his wartime service. He went on to fly the hump, which meant flying cargo planes over the Himalayan mountains between India and China.
SHAPIRO: Yesterday, Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein paid tribute to Dick Cole. Here's what he said.
CHANG: There's another hole in our formation, and our last remaining Doolittle Raider has slipped the surly bonds of Earth and is now reunited with his fellow raiders. And what a reunion they must be having.

The Army and Air Force Exchange Service, which oversees military retail facilities, recommended this week that stores show sports instead of news on their common-area televisions.
Nati Harnik/AP The Army and Air Force Exchange Service, one of the largest retailers in the United States which serves millions of active-duty military members and their families, is clarifying a memo sent this week which recommended that stores stop displaying the news on their televisions.
The message, obtained by NPR, told managers, ""News channels should not be shown on common area TVs due to their divisive political nature.""
Instead, the Defense Department agency suggested that stores feature something less controversial: sports. ""The Exchange has elected to play sports channels/sports programming on all common area TVs,"" the message stated.
AAFES operates more than 3,000 facilities at military installations across the world — including fast-food restaurants, clothing stores and convenience shops.
National Pentagon Takes $1 Billion From Military Personnel Account To Build Border Fence Televisions mounted in common areas have often displayed Fox and CNN, allowing customers to watch news reports as they eat in food courts and shop in stores.
Chris Ward, AAFES' senior public affairs manager, tells NPR that the memo was not a policy change but ""general guidance"" for the stores.
Ward says the recommendation to feature sports channels over the news reflected a desire to appeal to as many customers as possible.
""We've gotten comments from customers, 'Why is this TV on Fox?' 'Why is this TV on CNN?' You're never going to appeal to everyone,"" Ward says.
National After Falling Short, U.S. Army Gets Creative With New Recruiting Strategy AAFES issued similar guidance in the past, he adds, and ""it's not just the political climate we're in now.""
Ward said the agency planned to send out an updated memo to clarify the recommendation.
That message includes leeway for facilities to make adjustments ""based on the news of the day and local needs,"" he says.
Ric Chavez, an Army veteran who retired in 2018, tells NPR that he frequently saw both CNN and Fox on televisions at barber shops in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait and throughout the United States.
Chavez, 40, describes being conflicted on AAFES' guidance. He says that news programming in AAFES facilities ""should be blocked because regardless of your political affiliation, you still have to have an allegiance to your president."" But he is also concerned about denying people information. ""It shouldn't be blocked because it could be viewed as a form of censorship,"" Chavez says.
AAFES also has prohibited his friend from making craft items with political affiliations that would be sold at a military base in California, he added.
Over a meal at U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan in South Korea, Pfc. Tyler White told Stars and Stripes , ""I just think politics should stay out of the work environment.""
Another soldier, Staff Sgt. Manuel Cardona, told the military newspaper that he disagreed with AAFES decision. The broadcasts were ""informative,"" and often his only way of catching up on the day's news.

Shrinking Oil Revenues In Alaska May Force Cutbacks To Ferry System,www.npr.org,"Shayne Thompson, store owner in Angoon",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711580000/in-alaska-shrinking-oil-revenues-may-mean-severe-cutbacks-to-state-ferry-system?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image The ferries Malaspina and LeConte are docked near Juneau at sunrise.

toggle caption Nat Herz/Alaska Public Media The ferries Malaspina and LeConte are docked near Juneau at sunrise. Both ships are part of Alaska's state ferry system, which could face steep budget cuts Oct. 1, under a proposal by Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
Nat Herz/Alaska Public Media Just after 6 a.m., a handful of cars drive down the ramp into the LeConte, the Alaska state ferry docked in Juneau.
The LeConte's destinations that day include Angoon, an indigenous village of 450, and Tenakee Springs, a town of about 150. Both sit on islands with no connection to the state's road system and airports. To get to Angoon or Tenakee Springs from Juneau, you can buy a seaplane ticket for $150, or spend $50 to ride the ferry.
But Alaska's new Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, is taking aim at the ferry system's budget , proposing sharp cuts that are threatening its future. He's also pushing major reductions to public schools, health care and the state university system. The savings would be used to boost dividends from the state's oil-wealth fund up to $3,000.
Oil revenue once was sufficient for Alaska to run its state government and pay dividends from the fund, according to a decades-old legal formula. But amid lower oil prices and a longstanding decline in production, there's no longer enough money to do both. Dunleavy's plan to boost the dividends by cutting government programs is spurring a debate here about what residents value and are willing to pay for.
""I'm having a difficult time believing that we take that money off of elders in rural Alaska, we take that money off of 10-year-olds who are saving it up for college, we take that money off of single parents that have three or four children in their families that are struggling. And we bring it into government to continue spending at the rate we're spending,"" Dunleavy said during a recent appearance on Alaska Public Media.
Opponents of the governor's proposals have turned out at demonstrations and public meetings, where they've said his plans would change the character of Alaska – particularly its rural communities. They've also said they're willing to give up some of their dividends or pay taxes – Alaskans currently pay no state taxes on income or sales.
It's like a giant step back in time.
Shayne Thompson, store owner in Angoon
School buses and freight transport
Onboard the LeConte, Shayne Thompson was contemplating what would happen if the state ferry system stops running Oct. 1, as Dunleavy is proposing. The system, with nearly a dozen vessels, functions as school buses, freight transport and even hearses in the southeast part of the state, a 300-mile-long archipelago where only a few towns are connected to the road system.
Thompson runs the store in Angoon, and he puts supplies on the ferry every week. He could hire a barge for deliveries instead, but prices would likely rise by 25 percent and food would come less often, he says.
""It's like a giant step back in time,"" Thompson says. ""We would have, basically, fresh produce and dairy for a week or two of the month. And then the rest of the month it would be all dry goods.""
Southeast Alaska residents and political leaders have staged rallies at the Capitol where they've advocated for the preservation of the system, which is known as the marine highway.
Diminishing oil production
Alaska once pumped 2 million barrels of oil a day and accounted for one-fourth of U.S. crude production. But production from the state's massive North Slope fields has been declining for 30 years, and it's now about 500,000 barrels a day.
For more than two decades, state lawmakers had debated filling budget deficits with money from Alaska's oil-wealth fund. But they'd never voted to do so until a 2014 crash in oil prices led to the depletion of the state's savings accounts.
[T]he best thing to do is reduce the government side of the economy.
Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy
Last year, for the first time ever, the Legislature voted to use some of the fund's money on general government programs — reducing residents' dividends from an estimated $2,900 to $1,600.
Dunleavy campaigned on boosting dividends back to roughly $3,000 this year, and paying residents back for reductions in previous years. He held public forums last month — sponsored by the anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity — where he continued making the case that individuals should decide how to spend their dividends, rather than the government.
""We feel that for the sake of the private economy to get that back on its feet, and to grow the private economy, that the best thing to do is reduce the government side of the economy,"" he said at an Anchorage forum.
Campaign promises
The governor's critics have argued that, when Dunleavy was a candidate, he promised to pay larger dividends without acknowledging the deep cuts to services that would be required to afford them. At one campaign stop in the Southeast Alaska city of Ketchikan, he said there was ""no plan to hack, cut or destroy"" the state ferry system.
Dunleavy's budget ultimately proposed cutting more than two-thirds from the ferry system's budget, justifying the move by saying that a short-term decline in oil prices had reduced the state's expectations for oil revenue.
Thompson, the Angoon store owner, is a Republican who voted for Dunleavy after hearing he would protect the state ferry system.
""I feel like a fool, because of listening to somebody that had a totally different agenda in mind when they were on the campaign trail,"" Thompson says.
The state legislature, which is still in the middle of its budget process, has so far rejected or softened many of the governor's proposed cuts.
But Dunleavy has line-item veto power that would require three-fourths of the legislature to vote to overturn, prompting anxiety among people who depend on the services that he's proposing to cut.
Economy Alaska Faces Budget Deficit As Crude Oil Prices Slide Bert Stedman, a state senator from Sitka who co-chairs his chamber's budget committee, says political dynamics are likely to force residents from his region to accept some level of reduced service.
When the ferry system was established a half-century ago, Southeast Alaska's timber industry was booming. Now, Stedman says, ""there's no more pulp mills,"" and there are now two senators that represent Southeast, down from five.
""We have had a significant dilution, since the creation of the marine highway, of political influence. And that is continuing to erode,"" Stedman says. ""We are not in the position where we can, frankly, dictate what we want to do. We just don't have the numbers."""
Advanced Safety Technologies For Cars Come At A Price That Many Won't Pay,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951898/advanced-safety-technologies-for-cars-come-at-a-price-that-many-wont-pay?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with David Friedman, vice president of advocacy for Consumer Reports, about the availability of advanced safety technologies such as automatic emergency braking in new cars.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The investigations into the fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes have revealed troubling details about safety. For example, Boeing was charging extra for a safety feature - one that might've helped the pilots in those flights. Boeing says it will now make that feature standard. We wondered whether the same could be true of safety features in cars.
Some new cars have features to avoid collisions or stay in a lane. Depending on the make and model, features like those could come standard or cost extra. David Friedman was acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and he's now on the policy side of Consumer Reports. Welcome to the studio.
DAVID FRIEDMAN: Thanks a lot for having me, Ari.
SHAPIRO: Let's start by talking about a feature called automatic emergency braking. I understand this is a technology that has been really widely adopted, largely because of a voluntary agreement where automakers said they'll make it standard by 2022. What does this do? How important is it?
FRIEDMAN: Well, this technology is fantastic. Basically, if you're about to rear-end someone, this technology will first warn you. And if you don't act, it will hit the brakes for you. And the data show that it could reduce rear-end crashes by 40 percent or more.
SHAPIRO: Now, I said it will be standard by 2022, but if I buy a new car today, am I likely to have this feature?
FRIEDMAN: Honestly, it's 50-50. If we look at 2019 model year data, about half of the automakers sell vehicles where the technology comes standard. Toyota, for example, and Honda have been making a lot of this technology standard on their vehicles. With the others, you may have to pay thousands of dollars to get that technology.
SHAPIRO: Is there something troubling about offering a safety feature that can save lives that costs thousands of dollars extra?
FRIEDMAN: I mean, to me, safety should never be a luxury, and that's effectively what the car companies are creating in these scenarios, or at least some of them.
SHAPIRO: So that's automatic emergency braking. Tell me about another technology that you think might not be standard but perhaps should be.
FRIEDMAN: Well, there's a few that we could think of. I mean, first, automatic emergency braking itself is great, but what about adding pedestrian detection so that if you're driving around town, you're much less likely to run into a pedestrian or bicyclist?
Or how about if you're driving down the highway and you're about to steer into another lane and you don't know a car's in your blind spot? A blind spot warning system could help save your life or help avoid you running someone else off the road.
SHAPIRO: You know, features like air bags and seat belts used to not be in every car. Today, they are. Do you think it's just a matter of time until these kinds of features are standard in every new vehicle?
FRIEDMAN: Well, time and again, automakers have developed amazing technology, but they have tried to get consumers to pay a lot for it and refused to put them standard in every car. So usually, regulators have to force them to put them standard in each car. And honestly, that's part of what happened with automatic emergency braking.
The federal government was getting ready to require all car companies to equip it, and so the companies, instead, said, hey, let's do this voluntarily.
SHAPIRO: So it's voluntary, but voluntary under duress.
FRIEDMAN: Exactly.
SHAPIRO: Do you see the kind of regulatory pressure that could make automakers standardize these other safety features that you're talking about?
FRIEDMAN: Certainly not right now, not under this administration.
SHAPIRO: If I'm an automaker and I've invested a huge amount of money in research and development of a safety technology, why shouldn't I try to recoup some of that money by asking buyers to pay a little extra for their car?
FRIEDMAN: If it was a little extra, that wouldn't bug me one bit. I mean, you look at Toyota, who has all that same technology. Almost all of it's standard in their base model of the RAV4, a car that costs around $27,000, $28,000. And Toyota's not having a problem making a profit. This is technology that can cost a few hundred dollars at the end of the day. This isn't bank-breaking technology.
SHAPIRO: Commercial pilots do get so much more training than anyone who gets behind the wheel of a car. Is there a risk that if you put all of these technologies in place - from automatic breaking to lane change, pedestrian sensor - that drivers start getting lazy?
FRIEDMAN: Well, the key to a lot of the technologies that we are talking about is they're proven to have on-road safety benefits. So they're out there in the market, and we can see them saving lives.
It's some of the more advanced technologies, where you can truly take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the accelerator and brake - those are the ones that concern us because of the way they're implemented today. Another technology we'd like to start seeing coming standard in cars is a simple driver monitoring system that can tell whether or not you're actually still driving.
SHAPIRO: David Friedman is vice president of advocacy for Consumer Reports. Thanks for coming into the studio today.
FRIEDMAN: Thank you.

toggle caption Washington County sheriff Three seasoned deputies — one with at least 20 years on the force — a detective who happened to be in the area, and two canine officers all responded to the call of a burglary in progress at a Cedar Hills home near Portland, Ore. Instead, they found a trapped robotic vacuum cleaner.
Washington County sheriff The Washington County sheriff in Oregon says there was nothing unusual about the call. Sure, it was broad daylight — 1:48 p.m. local time exactly — but ""crime can happen anytime.""
So the frantic call from a house guest about a burglar making loud rustling noises inside the house, specifically from within the locked bathroom, deserved an urgent response, Sgt. Danny DiPietro, a sheriff's spokesman, tells NPR.
""The man had just gone for a walk with his nephew's dog and when he came back, he could see shadows moving back and forth under the bathroom door,"" DiPietro says.
Resources were immediately deployed: three seasoned deputies — one with at least 20 years on the force — a detective who happened to be in the area, and two canine officers from Beaverton Police Department, about 7 miles outside Portland.
They surrounded the Cedar Hills house, then made their way inside, guns unholstered. ""And the whole time they were yelling, 'Sheriff' and 'Police' but the burglar wouldn't come out. He wouldn't say anything,"" DiPietro says.
Instead, the banging got louder. ""Like a loud thud, thud, thud on glass."" Officers assumed the burglar was trying to escape. ""That he was trying to open a window and jump out and run away.""
Hearts pounding, guns ready to fire, they counted down and entered the bathroom. But instead of confronting a suspect, they found ... a rogue Roomba robot vacuum that was apparently doing ""a very thorough"" job.
""It was just this little round machine, slamming against the glass [shower] wall,"" DiPietro says.
The entire group erupted into peals of laughter.
""Everyone just started cracking up. It was such huge relief because it's the kind of situation that could go either way. It could end peacefully or ..."" DiPietro trailed off. ""No one had any idea what was waiting for them behind the door but they definitely didn't expect that.""
DiPietro, who has been on the force for 13 years and has some experience working with canine officers, says the responding officers were especially perplexed by the lack of response when they said a dog was outside the bathroom door.
""That was confusing because usually, when you say, 'We've got a dog,' people are done. They're like, 'OK, I'm not fighting a dog!' and they'll just give up,"" he says.
The fact that the individual inside the bathroom didn't do that was chilling, he added.
From start to finish the incident took 25 minutes, according to a play-by-play post on the department's Facebook page.
As for the man who reported the call, DiPietro said he felt ""awful.""
""But I would have done the exact same thing if I was visiting someone and didn't know there was a robot vacuum cleaner that was set to go off on its own. And even the responding officers, when they saw the shadow under the door and the sound of someone trying to get out ... well, they fell for it too,"" he added.
Plus, DiPietro says, the sheriff's office Facebook followers are loving the story, coming up with punny reports of their own as well as demands to see the bodycam footage.
""After sweeping the premises, the perpetrator was nabbed. Later, the room was dusted for prints,"" Richard Cox commented.
Marti McCleskey offered a compliment: ""Great job catching the sucker!"""

Historian Robert Caro has many impatient fans. They're waiting for the final installment of his thoroughly researched series on President Lyndon B. Johnson.
But his latest book isn't the final one in the series, to the dismay of some of those fans. It's called ""Working,"" a hybrid of memoir and research guide.
There are so many readers waiting for this final book on LBJ that The Wall Street Journal recently reported a piece about them. One fan weighed in on Caro's latest book:
Jim Sather, a retiree and former attorney who lives in a Chicago suburb, says he isn't sure ""Working"" was a wise use of Mr. Caro's time. ""What the hell is he writing that book for?"" says Mr. Sather, 71. ""I'm not getting any younger and neither is he.""
Caro is 83 years old.
The New York Times recently asked Caro what he wants people to understand about him and his work.
During all these years I did come to understand stuff about power that I wanted people to know. You read in every textbook that cliché: Power corrupts. In my opinion, I've learned that power does not always corrupt. Power can cleanse. When you're climbing to get power, you have to use whatever methods are necessary, and you have to conceal your aims. Because if people knew your aims, it might make them not want to give you power. Prime example: the southern senators who raised Lyndon Johnson up in the Senate. They did that because he had made them believe that he felt the same way they did about black people and segregation. But then when you get power, you can do what you want. So power reveals. Do I want people to know that? Yes.
We speak with Robert Caro about the powerless and the powerful, fact-finding and the best advice he's ever gotten. Facebook"
Consumer Product Safety Commission Warns Parents About 'Rock 'n Play' Infant Rocker : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951948/consumer-product-safety-commission-warns-parents-about-rock-n-play-infant-rocker,"The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission along with toy maker Fisher-Price are warning parents about using the ""Rock 'n Play"" infant rocker — which has been linked to at least 10 infant deaths.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is warning parents to stop using the Rock 'n Play sleeper for infants made by Fisher-Price. So far, at least 10 infant deaths have been linked to the product since 2015. NPR's Patti Neighmond reports.
PATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: The Rock 'n Play is sort of a cushioned seat where infants can be placed on their back. Ann Marie Buerkle, acting chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, has issued this warning to parents and caregivers.
ANN MARIE BUERKLE: If you're using this Rock 'n Play made by Fisher-Price, and your baby is 3-months-old or has exhibited signs of being able to roll over, do not use this product.
NEIGHMOND: That's because if parents don't use the straps that come with the product to restrain their infant's movement, there can be dangerous consequences.
BUERKLE: The infant rolls to their side or to their tummies - to the front. And they're face down. And because they are unable to move their heads, and they're younger babies, they suffocate in the bedding.
NEIGHMOND: In addition to the 10 infant deaths reported so far, the commission is investigating another 22 deaths to determine whether they are also the result of an infant rolling over and suffocating. Buerkle says these other deaths could have been caused by something else, but are all linked to the same product.
The Safety Commission is now examining which steps to take next, and that could include a recall of the product. The American Academy of Pediatrics says just warning parents isn't enough. The product is deadly, says pediatrician Benjamin Hoffman, spokesperson for the Academy, and should be recalled immediately.
BENJAMIN HOFFMAN: The fact of the matter is babies are dying in the Rock 'n Play.
NEIGHMOND: Which is marketed as a place where infants can sleep. But Hoffman says it is not a safe place.
HOFFMAN: The safest place for a baby to sleep is on a firm, flat mattress in their own space.
NEIGHMOND: With no toys, stuffed animals or pillows - not even in a car seat.
HOFFMAN: Less is more in this circumstance because of the risk of suffocation, strangulation.
NEIGHMOND: In a statement, Fisher-Price says they stand by the safety of the Rock 'n Play sleeper but continue to work closely with the Consumer Product Safety Commission to determine what comes next. Patti Neighmond, NPR News.

Historic Former Publisher Of Ebony And Jet Magazines Files For Bankruptcy,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951955/historic-former-publisher-of-ebony-and-jet-magazines-files-for-bankruptcy,"Johnson Publishing, the historic former publisher of Ebony and Jet magazines, has filed for bankruptcy. After it sold its magazines in 2016, the company focused on fashion and its vast photo archives.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
It is all over for Johnson Publishing Company. For more than seven decades, the iconic black company, the former owner of Ebony and Jet magazines, was at the forefront of African-American culture. The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy late yesterday, and it plans to sell all its assets. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports.
CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: There is, perhaps, no better example of Johnson Publishing Company's disappearing act than here on Chicago's Michigan Avenue.
(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN HONKING)
CORLEY: I'm standing in front of the company's former headquarters. Once a luxurious monument to black business success and the first building in the city designed by a black architect, it's now an apartment building.
CHARLES WHITAKER: Oh, my.
CORLEY: Northwestern University journalism professor Charles Whitaker worked at Johnson Publishing for a decade at Ebony magazine. He says it's just sad to pass by the building and see leasing signs.
WHITAKER: Seeing this monument that John Johnson built that was such a source of pride to black America - to see that pass is - does, you know, put a lump in your throat.
CORLEY: The late John H. Johnson and his wife, Eunice, founded Johnson Publishing in the early 1940s to showcase the achievements of black Americans. The historic photos and coverage of the 1955 lynching of Chicagoan Emmett Till helped spark the country's civil rights movement.
Lynn Norment, a former Ebony managing editor, says she grew up with the magazines, like so many other African-Americans. They were always on the coffee table at her home.
LYNN NORMENT: It was used as a resource for homework, for school, but also as a way to let me know, growing up in a small town in Tennessee, that there's a bigger world out here.
CORLEY: Circulation and ad revenue for the flagship magazines plummeted, though, over the years. And in 2011, Johnson Publishing took a crucial step, selling an equity stake to banker JPMorgan Chase. It sold Ebony and Jet to a pair of African-American venture capitalists in 2016. And a few years ago, the company tried relaunching its Fashion Fair cosmetics line.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""FLAWLESS"")
BEYONCE: (Singing) You wake up flawless, post up flawless.
CORLEY: The upbeat commercial featured Beyonce's ""Flawless"" song and shots of lipsticks and other cosmetics. People commenting online said they love the products, but they never seem to be in stock. In its bankruptcy statement, Johnson Publishing blamed e-commerce competition in part and said it couldn't get alternative financing.
Northwestern's Charles Whitaker says there had long been signs of Johnson's demise.
WHITAKER: It just had not become a 21st century company. It was a company that was still operating on kind of the mid-century business model on which it was founded.
CORLEY: Johnson Publishing will try to sell the assets that remain, the Fashion Fair cosmetics line and an extensive photo archive chronicling the life of black America from the mid-20th century on. Former editor Lynn Norment calls it a treasure trove.
NORMENT: Mr. Johnson would not be happy. He would not be happy. He was a very proud man.
CORLEY: In its statement, the company says the impact Johnson Publishing has had on society cannot be overstated, and the decision to fold was not easy. Cheryl Corley, NPR News, Chicago.

Former Sex Toy Salesperson Says Toys Won't Solve The Biggest Bedroom Problems,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951919/former-sex-toy-salesperson-says-toys-wont-solve-the-biggest-bedroom-problems,"Talking about sex can be hard. For some, it can be easier to talk to a stranger about it, than a partner. A woman called ""Fancy Feast"" was that stranger. She worked at a sex toy shop for seven years.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Here on the program, we're bringing you a series about a topic you don't hear a lot about on public radio, sex - how we talk about sex and how we don't. And today we'll hear from someone who has had a lot of conversations about sex. She goes by the name Fancy Feast. That's her burlesque name. And she spent seven years working at a sex toy shop in New York, talking to customers day in and day out about their sex lives. And a quick warning here - this five-minute piece includes subject matter that some listeners might find objectionable.
FANCY FEAST: We had so many experiences where people would come in and immediately reveal some of the most intimate aspects of their lives, whether that was an abuse history, whether that was their deepest unfulfilled desires and wishes, whether that was questions that they just didn't ever have an answer to.
CHANG: It was a lot like therapy, which is actually why we're not using Fancy's real name here. She left the sex toy store and is now in grad school to become a therapist. And we want to protect the privacy of her and her patients. She told us about some of the people she met at the store and how they changed her.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
FANCY FEAST: One time a woman came in, and she looked very fearful. She was walking around the store and eyeing me. And I came up to her and greeted her and asked her if she was looking for anything in particular. And she said something that we hear pretty often at the store, which is, I'm looking for a toy. I don't want anything intimidating.
I decided to start small, and I found this white Jimmyjane bullet vibrator. So I put it in her hands, and to my surprise, her eyes welled up with tears, and she just started crying. And I asked her what was going on, and she was nodding and saying, thank you; this is the first thing I've seen that actually looks right for me.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
FANCY FEAST: Knowing that she felt for the first time, like, I had been able to hear and interpret what she had been looking for - that was really meaningful.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
FANCY FEAST: There are some things that sex toys can be absolutely perfect for, but sex toys will not solve all problems. If the problem is the person that I'm seeing disregards my pleasure or has no interest in my sexual desire, that's not something that you can buy something to solve.
So one day, a couple came in, and I could tell right away that the woman in the couple was surprised to be there. But the guy was not willing to relent, so he was kind of dragging this woman around the store and looking at different things. And he threw the toy at the counter and said, yeah, I'm going to get this. And she looked absolutely miserable. And as I checked them out, my skin was crawling because this did not feel like a consensual situation. And ordinarily we have a no-return policy as you might imagine. But I wrote on the receipt, you know, if you bring this back, I will return this no questions asked. Here's my name.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
FANCY FEAST: Human sexuality can be so fraught for so many people. And I think of the sex educators who are working in the store as kind of working on the frontlines. Towards the very end of my time working at the store, a young boy - like, an adolescent boy and his mom came into the store. And she explains to me her son is trans, and he wants to get a packer, which is a thing that you put in the front of the pants to simulate a bulge. And the one that he liked 'cause he had excellent taste was the most expensive one. And it was designed to be worn with a specific packing strap, something that would go round the waist and really secure the packer in place.
And he didn't have enough money, so I asked if it would be OK if I could buy the packing underwear. And the mom started crying. And then the boy started crying. And then I was crying. And we all hugged each other. And it was really one of the most special moments I had in the store.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
FANCY FEAST: A lot of the work felt like some form of therapy. And now that I am in school to become a therapist, I see how many of those skills have been transferable. I thought of the work that we did as a kind of field work or triage work. And so I realized that the work that I had been doing was really leading towards finding satisfaction in being able to reach people even more.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
CHANG: That is former sex toy shop employee Fancy Feast. You can find more of her work under that name. We first read about her in a BuzzFeed essay she wrote last year called ""Sex Toys Will Never Be Able To Do The Hardest Work For You."" Our story was produced by Alyssa Edes.

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with sports radio host Donovan Lewis about Dirk Nowitzki's 21-year NBA career with the Dallas Mavericks after his final home game.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
All right, Dallas, Texas, has long been known as a football town where the silver star looms large. But sports fans paid new attention to basketball when a 7-foot German player named Dirk Nowitzki joined the Dallas Mavericks in 1998. Now Nowitzki has officially announced he's retiring after this season, his 21st with the Mavericks. Here he is at last night's ceremony.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DIRK NOWITZKI: As you guys might expect, this was my last home game - yeah.
CHANG: Over the decades, Nowitzki and his Dallas fan base forged a deep bond. And to talk more about that, let's bring in Donovan Lewis, who's a sports radio host at The Ticket in Dallas. Hey, Donovan.
DONOVAN LEWIS: Hello. How are you?
CHANG: I'm good. So you've been there for most of Nowitzki's career. What was the atmosphere like last night for his final game in Dallas?
LEWIS: I think we all thought that this was his final year and his final home game, but Dirk never let on that it was officially the end. So, you know, you always hold on hope because this guy brought so much joy to every single basketball fan in Dallas because we all thought for a long time that basketball just wasn't going to be king around here and we never would...
CHANG: Yeah.
LEWIS: ...Get a title. But this guy came in. And all of a sudden, he just won us over. And they played relevant basketball in Dallas for a decade and a half. And I don't think a lot of people realize or appreciate that because we just got spoiled because basketball was so good, and it was...
CHANG: Yeah.
LEWIS: ...All because of this one guy. We won a title...
CHANG: Yeah.
LEWIS: ...In 2011, and that's climbing a mountain. And that's like, OK, this is the ultimate. You know what? I'll take that back. I love the title, but the ultimate was celebrating the guy that's been here for two decades...
CHANG: Yeah, yeah.
LEWIS: ...Playing basketball. He's one of ours, and I just absolutely loved it.
CHANG: I mean, it wasn't just the fans who adored him. He loved Dallas. He spent 21 seasons with the Mavericks. Why do you think Nowitzki felt so loyal to Dallas?
LEWIS: I think Mark Cuban, the owner of the Mavericks, had a lot to do with it. And I think winning that title had a lot to do it also - with it all so. This town was so starved for success in basketball.
CHANG: (Laughter).
LEWIS: And OK, maybe you were close to climbing that mountain, and it didn't happen. So being here for so long, he wanted to do it for this city. And once that happened, it was like, OK, this guy sacrificed blood, sweat and tears. We see, we hear that all the time.
CHANG: Yeah.
LEWIS: But that's literally what happened.
CHANG: Now, a few of Nowitzki's his favorite players, I understand, were in attendance last night. They made speeches about him. Here's what Charles Barkley had to say.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHARLES BARKLEY: Let me say this about Dirk Nowitzki. He's the nicest man ever.
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
CHANG: There it is, that love again. Why do you think so many people felt such a personal connection to this guy?
LEWIS: A, because it's true. He is the nicest guy ever. And for him to be a superstar, one of - I guess we kind of equate superstars as being a little standoffish. I mean, you have to because a lot of people demand a lot of your time, whether it's pictures or autographs or whatnot. Social media yesterday was filled with people posting their pictures with Dirk, just ordinary people.
CHANG: Well what about you? Do you have a favorite personal story with Dirk?
LEWIS: You know, on our radio show, we have a yearly interview with Dirk. The first time I met him was 2007, and I'm starstruck. This is the - my favorite basketball player, and he's sitting right down and talking to us. Even every year after that, he'd come up, and he would remember my name and sit down and talk and all that stuff. So it's really crazy to think that this guy that you see on TV that's doing all the things that he's doing and winning championships will sit down and, you know, know you by name. It's - it kind of blows your mind a little bit. But he's just that kind of guy.
CHANG: Donovan Lewis with The Ticket in Dallas, thanks so much for joining us.
LEWIS: Thank you for having me. It's my pleasure - anytime. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Senate Approves Trump's Nominee To Be Ambassador To Saudi Arabia,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951962/senate-approves-trumps-nominee-to-be-ambassador-to-saudi-arabia,"Senate Approves Trump's Nominee To Be Ambassador To Saudi Arabia Senate Approves Trump's Nominee To Be Ambassador To Saudi Arabia Embed Embed
President Trump's nominee to be ambassador to Saudi Arabia was approved by the Senate Wednesday. NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Brian Katulis of the Center for American Progress about the new ambassador.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Over the past few years, Saudi's crown prince has tightened his grasp on power. He's had critics and activists detained and reportedly tortured. And the CIA believes that he ordered the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. All the while, Saudi Arabia has continued to drop bombs in neighboring Yemen. And during all of this, the U.S. has not had an ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
Well, that changed today. The Senate confirmed retired four-star General John Abizaid to the post. To understand what Abizaid brings to this daunting task, we're joined now by Brian Katulis of the Center for American Progress. Welcome.
BRIAN KATULIS: Great to be with you.
CHANG: So I want to start by visiting an important time in General Abizaid's career. This is the last few months when he was overseeing U.S. Central Command. It was right before the 2007 surge of U.S. troops in Iraq. How did Abizaid feel about that strategy?
KATULIS: Abizaid was concerned at the time about the focus on military tools. What he tried to do in the debates inside of the Bush administration was broaden the discussion to include diplomatic tools. His essential point was that we don't need to be throwing more U.S. troops into a problem that, essentially, is political.
And he largely - his arguments largely fell on deaf ears, which is why we did the surge. But I think he was ahead of the curve. He understood the thing that I think many of us now who look at the region know fully from our experiences there, that it's how do you motivate - whether it's Iraqis or Saudis or others - to pull their weight, to actually settle their conflicts and then deliver services to their people that we can't do that - from the U.S. perspective - that it's too costly. And it's better for these partners to do it, you know, less effectively and over a longer timescale perhaps.
CHANG: So what do you think of Abizaid's fitness for his new role as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia? I mean, we should say that he's Lebanese-American. He speaks Arabic. But what additional qualifications do you see in this man?
KATULIS: I think he's an ideal candidate. He's steady. He's practical. He's very knowledgeable of the region. He knows the Saudis very well by virtue of his past positions. They know him very well. So the Saudis won't be able to pull the wool over his eyes.
I think he faces a number of challenges. First, he's going to have to figure out how to make sure he's part of the conversation between the royal palace and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince.
CHANG: You mean because there's such a close relationship already between the crown prince and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
KATULIS: That's it, yeah. This linkage between the royal palace and the West Wing, he's going to have to figure out how to navigate that and make sure that he's in the loop. Secondly, he arrives in this position at a very heated and hyper-partisan moment about U.S.-Saudi relations in our politics. There are a lot of understandable and legitimate questions because of Jamal Khashoggi's murder and the Yemen war.
CHANG: And these are concerns that even Republicans have about the White House's approach to Saudi Arabia.
KATULIS: Absolutely. It's not simply just a partisan issue. But I think with our elections, it will become even more so. You know, the Democrats are much more skeptical about Saudi Arabia these days. So he'll have to serve in this position and try to buffer the working relationship from a lot of those political tensions.
CHANG: So given those sprawling challenges, what do you think his first priority should be as he ventures forth on this new job as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia?
KATULIS: Well, first, I think he's got to work with the Saudis to find a way to resolve the conflict in Yemen. And the U.S. has substantial leverage it can use to help the Saudis defend themselves but then also resolve the conflict. Second, I think he needs to keep these very important issues of Saudi Arabia's human rights record on the agenda, even though the Trump administration has downgraded those issues. It's a very important issue for the sake of bilateral relations. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi, their detention of human rights activists - all of these things create turbulence in the U.S.-Saudi relationship and are of deep moral concern to a lot of Americans.
CHANG: Brian Katulis is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. Thanks so much for joining us today.
KATULIS: Great. Thanks for having me. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

British Drug Maker Indivior Indicted On Fraud And Conspiracy Charges In The U.S.,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951969/british-drug-maker-indivior-indicted-on-fraud-and-conspiracy-charges-in-the-u-s?station=KXJZ_FM,"The federal government is charging the maker of the addiction drug Suboxone with fraud and conspiracy in marketing the drug to doctors.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Share prices for the British drugmaker Indivior plunged today on the London Stock Exchange. The drop came on news that the U.S. Justice Department indicted the company on fraud and conspiracy charges. Indivior makes the drug Suboxone, widely used to treat people suffering from opioid addiction. Federal prosecutors now claim the company falsely marketed Suboxone as safer and less prone to abuse than cheaper generic drugs. North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports.
BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: The 28-count indictment filed in a Virginia court claims Indivior executives lied when they claimed dissolvable Suboxone films placed under the tongue would be safer, harder to misuse than generic tablets that were about to come on the market. Government investigators say, in some cases, Indivior's version of the drug was more risky. The indictment claims taxpayer-funded programs like Medicare and Medicaid were cheated out of billions of dollars. Justice Department officials declined NPR's request for an interview. Robert Bird is a professor of business law at the University of Connecticut who follows opioid cases closely. He says this criminal indictment sends a powerful signal to a drug industry already snared in the opioid addiction crisis.
ROBERT BIRD: Not only the companies that are being indicted but also other organizations and competitors who will look at these prosecutions and say, I don't want this to happen to me.
MANN: Indivior executives also declined to be interviewed by NPR. But company spokesperson Jennifer Ginther read from a prepared statement, denying any wrongdoing and describing the federal indictment as misguided.
JENNIFER GINTHER: Indivior's top priority has always been the treatment of patients struggling with opioid addiction. No other company has done more to fight the opioid crisis.
MANN: This point - Indivior's central role treating people addicted to opioids - represents a fascinating wrinkle in this case. The Justice Department has filed criminal charges against other opioid makers in the past, winning a guilty plea in a $600 million settlement from Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin in 2007. But Indivior doesn't actually make prescription painkillers. It makes drugs like Suboxone designed to treat people suffering from opioid dependency.
ALAN LESHNER: It's a highly effective medication that we endorse in our report.
MANN: Alan Leshner chaired a panel for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that released a new study last month finding that drugs like Suboxone are being underutilized. He worries that all the bad publicity surrounding drug companies and their products will make it harder for people struggling with opioid addiction to get treatment drugs.
LESHNER: So there's a tremendous amount of stigma surrounding everything related to addiction. And the stigma and misunderstanding has kept a tremendous number of people from getting the treatment that they need.
MANN: These recovery drugs matter because more than 100 Americans are still dying from opioid overdoses every day. But like other medications that contain opioids, Suboxone can be abused. This federal indictment claims that while Indivior downplayed the risks of their drugs, the company also boosted profits by helping create a black market connecting patients suffering from addiction with doctors writing too many prescriptions for Suboxone at too strong a dose. In its statement, Indivior rejected that claim, saying the company never deliberately diverted its product to increase sales.
The stakes here are high. If Indivior is found guilty, prosecutors say the company should forfeit at least $3 billion in penalties. Indivior and other big drugmakers, including Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson, already faced hundreds of civil lawsuits stemming from the opioid crisis. Brian Mann, NPR News.

Historic Former Publisher Of Ebony And Jet Magazines Files For Bankruptcy,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951955/historic-former-publisher-of-ebony-and-jet-magazines-files-for-bankruptcy?station=KXJZ_FM,"Johnson Publishing, the historic former publisher of Ebony and Jet magazines, has filed for bankruptcy. After it sold its magazines in 2016, the company focused on fashion and its vast photo archives.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
It is all over for Johnson Publishing Company. For more than seven decades, the iconic black company, the former owner of Ebony and Jet magazines, was at the forefront of African-American culture. The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy late yesterday, and it plans to sell all its assets. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports.
CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: There is, perhaps, no better example of Johnson Publishing Company's disappearing act than here on Chicago's Michigan Avenue.
(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN HONKING)
CORLEY: I'm standing in front of the company's former headquarters. Once a luxurious monument to black business success and the first building in the city designed by a black architect, it's now an apartment building.
CHARLES WHITAKER: Oh, my.
CORLEY: Northwestern University journalism professor Charles Whitaker worked at Johnson Publishing for a decade at Ebony magazine. He says it's just sad to pass by the building and see leasing signs.
WHITAKER: Seeing this monument that John Johnson built that was such a source of pride to black America - to see that pass is - does, you know, put a lump in your throat.
CORLEY: The late John H. Johnson and his wife, Eunice, founded Johnson Publishing in the early 1940s to showcase the achievements of black Americans. The historic photos and coverage of the 1955 lynching of Chicagoan Emmett Till helped spark the country's civil rights movement.
Lynn Norment, a former Ebony managing editor, says she grew up with the magazines, like so many other African-Americans. They were always on the coffee table at her home.
LYNN NORMENT: It was used as a resource for homework, for school, but also as a way to let me know, growing up in a small town in Tennessee, that there's a bigger world out here.
CORLEY: Circulation and ad revenue for the flagship magazines plummeted, though, over the years. And in 2011, Johnson Publishing took a crucial step, selling an equity stake to banker JPMorgan Chase. It sold Ebony and Jet to a pair of African-American venture capitalists in 2016. And a few years ago, the company tried relaunching its Fashion Fair cosmetics line.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""FLAWLESS"")
BEYONCE: (Singing) You wake up flawless, post up flawless.
CORLEY: The upbeat commercial featured Beyonce's ""Flawless"" song and shots of lipsticks and other cosmetics. People commenting online said they love the products, but they never seem to be in stock. In its bankruptcy statement, Johnson Publishing blamed e-commerce competition in part and said it couldn't get alternative financing.
Northwestern's Charles Whitaker says there had long been signs of Johnson's demise.
WHITAKER: It just had not become a 21st century company. It was a company that was still operating on kind of the mid-century business model on which it was founded.
CORLEY: Johnson Publishing will try to sell the assets that remain, the Fashion Fair cosmetics line and an extensive photo archive chronicling the life of black America from the mid-20th century on. Former editor Lynn Norment calls it a treasure trove.
NORMENT: Mr. Johnson would not be happy. He would not be happy. He was a very proud man.
CORLEY: In its statement, the company says the impact Johnson Publishing has had on society cannot be overstated, and the decision to fold was not easy. Cheryl Corley, NPR News, Chicago.

Consumer Product Safety Commission Warns Parents About 'Rock 'n Play' Infant Rocker,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711951948/consumer-product-safety-commission-warns-parents-about-rock-n-play-infant-rocker?station=KXJZ_FM,"The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission along with toy maker Fisher-Price are warning parents about using the ""Rock 'n Play"" infant rocker — which has been linked to at least 10 infant deaths.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is warning parents to stop using the Rock 'n Play sleeper for infants made by Fisher-Price. So far, at least 10 infant deaths have been linked to the product since 2015. NPR's Patti Neighmond reports.
PATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: The Rock 'n Play is sort of a cushioned seat where infants can be placed on their back. Ann Marie Buerkle, acting chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, has issued this warning to parents and caregivers.
ANN MARIE BUERKLE: If you're using this Rock 'n Play made by Fisher-Price, and your baby is 3-months-old or has exhibited signs of being able to roll over, do not use this product.
NEIGHMOND: That's because if parents don't use the straps that come with the product to restrain their infant's movement, there can be dangerous consequences.
BUERKLE: The infant rolls to their side or to their tummies - to the front. And they're face down. And because they are unable to move their heads, and they're younger babies, they suffocate in the bedding.
NEIGHMOND: In addition to the 10 infant deaths reported so far, the commission is investigating another 22 deaths to determine whether they are also the result of an infant rolling over and suffocating. Buerkle says these other deaths could have been caused by something else, but are all linked to the same product.
The Safety Commission is now examining which steps to take next, and that could include a recall of the product. The American Academy of Pediatrics says just warning parents isn't enough. The product is deadly, says pediatrician Benjamin Hoffman, spokesperson for the Academy, and should be recalled immediately.
BENJAMIN HOFFMAN: The fact of the matter is babies are dying in the Rock 'n Play.
NEIGHMOND: Which is marketed as a place where infants can sleep. But Hoffman says it is not a safe place.
HOFFMAN: The safest place for a baby to sleep is on a firm, flat mattress in their own space.
NEIGHMOND: With no toys, stuffed animals or pillows - not even in a car seat.
HOFFMAN: Less is more in this circumstance because of the risk of suffocation, strangulation.
NEIGHMOND: In a statement, Fisher-Price says they stand by the safety of the Rock 'n Play sleeper but continue to work closely with the Consumer Product Safety Commission to determine what comes next. Patti Neighmond, NPR News.

The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service did not meet House Democrats' deadline to turn over President Trump's past tax returns by Wednesday, escalating what will likely culminate in a legal battle in the investigation into the president's personal and business finances.
In a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin writes that he needs more time to consult with the Department of Justice given the ""unprecedented nature of this request.""
Secretary Mnuchin’s response to Chairman Neal’s letter requesting President Trump’s tax returns: pic.twitter.com/X2VsDYKpYh
— Tony Sayegh (@TreasurySpox) April 10, 2019 ""The Committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens,"" Mnuchin writes.
The treasury secretary goes on to argue that ""the legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power.""
Neal said in a statement after receiving Mnuchin's letter that he ""will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response to the commissioner in the coming days.""
Politics White House Lawyers Discussed Trump Tax Returns With Treasury Department Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, echoed Mnuchin and said such a request ""sets a dangerous precedent. The intent of Section 6103 is clear: the tax code must not to be used for political fishing expeditions. The Treasury Department is right to carefully review the privacy impact this request would have on every taxpayer.""
The battle over Trump's tax returns — after he was the first president in four decades not to release the annual filings — has been brewing since the 2016 campaign. Once Democrats regained control of the House in last November's midterm elections, trying to seek Trump's taxes to delve into both his personal and business ties and determine whether there could be any foreign financial entanglements has become a key oversight priority.
Trump has said he isn't releasing the returns because he's been under audit, and he repeated that on Wednesday to White House reporters before leaving for a trip to Texas.
""I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit,"" Trump said.
Politics Key House Democrat Formally Asks For Trump's Tax Returns When Neal made the request last week , he said it was about ""policy, not politics.""
""We have completed the necessary groundwork for a request of this magnitude and I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal, and oversight rights,"" Neal said in a statement at the time."

Mary Altaffer/AP American Media LLC announced that it is seeking a buyer for the National Enquirer and other newsprint tabloids it owns.
The company said in a statement that it has decided to ""explore strategic options for its National Enquirer (US and UK editions) , Globe and National Examiner brands, which will likely result in their sale in the near future.""
""We have been keenly focused on leveraging the popularity of our celebrity glossy, teen and active lifestyle brands while developing new and robust platforms including broadcast and audio programming, and a live events business, that now deliver significant revenue streams,"" said American Media President and CEO David J. Pecker in the statement. ""Because of this focus, we feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership.""
AMI, Pecker and the National Enquirer have been embroiled in controversies surrounding President Trump. The tabloid allegedly paid a former Playboy model Karen McDougal for exclusive rights to her claims that she had had an extramarital affair with Trump and then never published a story — a practice known as "" catch and kill ."" Pecker is a Trump ally.
In February, Washington Post owner and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos accused American Media LLC of extortion and blackmail by threatening to publish potentially embarrassing personal photos of him. At the time, Bezos said, the company wanted him to deny AMI had any political motivations behind its coverage of him."

Host Ailsa Chang speaks to NPR's David Folkenflik about the news that American Media intends to sell its tabloids, including National Enquirer .
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
This evening, the parent company of the National Enquirer announced its intention to sell the tabloid and several of its sister tabloids. This comes after a series of scandals and controversies that involved the Enquirer's ties to President Trump. NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik joins me now. Welcome.
DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.
CHANG: Hey. So what's the company saying about why they're interested in selling all of a sudden? Are they in financial trouble?
FOLKENFLIK: Well, if you believe the official line, they say they're exploring and intend to sell the Enquirer, a couple of the sister tabloids because they want to focus on some of their more upscale lifestyle magazines. In the last year and a half or so, they acquired US Weekly and Men's Journal from Jann Wenner's media outfit. There is a financial cloud hovering over AMI, American Media Inc, the parent company of the National Enquirer. It declared bankruptcy in 2010. It's got a lot of debt. But it's impossible to think about this intended sale without thinking about all the scandals and controversies that have just wrapped themselves around this publication.
CHANG: Yeah. Can you take a moment to walk us through some of those controversies?
FOLKENFLIK: Yeah. And they're pretty intense. Think back to what we learned over recent months from federal investigators about the Enquirer's role in the 2016 campaign of Donald Trump. You know, if you looked on the covers, you saw all these stories damaging Hillary Clinton badly, helping Trump, portraying him in tight light. What we didn't know during the campaign was that they had engaged by their own concession in an effort to pay a former Playboy model $150,000. She had said that she had had a significant romantic involvement with President Trump, and they did what they called catch and kill. They promised her a contract to print a column by her in Men's Journal. But actually it was an effort to keep her story of her involvement with President Trump out of the public, particularly before the election. And that was a big one. The editor and the CEO, David Pecker, collaborated with federal prosecutors in order to avoid prosecution themselves for crimes.
CHANG: And then most recently the Enquirer tangled with Jeff Bezos, who owns both Amazon and The Washington Post.
FOLKENFLIK: That's right. He's the controlling owner and one of the richest people on the globe. He is the personal owner of The Washington Post. And that's an important element. The National Enquirer had been intently going over his personal life intending to reveal elements of his extramarital involvement with his girlfriend. And he took to Medium and posted a long thing saying that actually National Enquirer was trying to blackmail him into making a statement saying that they weren't acting in any way out of political motivation and that he felt that they were.
And his people have suggested - he suggested that in fact they were acting on behest of Saudi Arabian interests, an interesting note to strike in part because it appeared as though there was some possible financial involvement of some Saudi investors in American media even if that didn't fully play out. So one of the elements of this of course is Jeff Bezos' Washington Post is one of the chief media antagonists of President Trump.
CHANG: Right.
FOLKENFLIK: It's really attacked the Post for its reporting. And so there seems to be that element at play there as well. The Washington Post is reporting that the hedge fund manager who essentially controls the parent company got fed up with all the scandal after the Jeff Bezos story.
CHANG: So what's next? Are there any potential buyers circling the Enquirer already?
FOLKENFLIK: Well, you know, it's an incredible brand. It's survived a lot of controversies in the past. In order to talk to you this evening, I ducked out of a Broadway show about Rupert Murdoch and The Sun, a British tabloid. It's had a lot of controversies in the past. It survived. I'd be surprised if the Enquirer didn't live to see another day.
CHANG: That's NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik. Thanks, David.

For two years she has covered the legislature, governor, and a wide range of political issues for public radio stations across Pennsylvania. Katie Meyer / WITF Republican Senator Ryan Aument testifies in favor of his bill to save two of Pennsylvania’s five nuclear plants from early retirement.
(Harrisburg) — A bill aimed at saving two of Pennsylvania’s nuclear power plants from early retirement is getting an expectedly mixed reception in the state Senate.
The first committee hearing on the measure Wednesday saw nuclear and natural gas proponents clash over how to make Pennsylvania’s energy markets fair.
The proposal would recognize Pennsylvania’s five nuclear plants as carbon-free energy, and add them to the commonwealth’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard.
That law requires electric utilities to buy power from clean sources, like wind and solar. By adding nuclear to the mix, proponents hope to bolster it in a market increasingly dominated by natural gas.
Gas lobbyists argue nuclear plants are already mostly profitable, save Three Mile Island, which has only one reactor.
Marcellus Shale Coalition President Dave Spigelmyer said giving them a leg up is unfair.
“No real reason has been given to pass this legislation, other than we need the money to enhance our profit margin and to charge more for nuclear power,” he said. “This is a battle being waged against your constituents, the rate payer of Pennsylvania.”
The bill is expected to add about $1.53 per month to the average consumer’s electric bill, according to the Public Utility Commission.
Lancaster County Republican Senator Ryan Aument, who’s sponsoring the bill, didn’t dispute that. But he argued that Pennsylvania “will end up paying far more in the future if our nuclear power plants are permitted to prematurely retire.”
He is basing that assessment on an analysis from the Brattle Group, which studied potential impacts of all five of the commonwealth’s nuclear plants shutting down.
The researchers reported that the reduction of in-state energy production would likely drive electric utilities to purchase power from other states at a markup to consumers. That, they estimated, would result in a markup of around $6.6 billion over 10 years — about 37 percent of which would fall on residential customers.
A parallel bill in the House has gotten similar responses.
The Senate version has a few major differences . For one, it includes a provision that requires a nuclear plant to refund money from the AEPS credit if it fails to produce electricity. And it gives non-nuclear resources more opportunity to use the new tier 3 credits — a potential boost to renewables.
That lack of inclusion was a key reason environmental groups balked at the House’s initial proposal. But after the Senate bill was released, a representative for the Natural Resources Defense Council said it was “deeply flawed.”
Without intervention, the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor near Harrisburg is expected to close in September. The Beaver Valley plant outside Pittsburgh faces a 2021 retirement. Explainers"

Charles Dharapak/AP Updated at 11:07 p.m. ET
Lawyers for former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig say he could be facing an indictment soon connected to his work with Paul Manafort on behalf of their onetime political clients in Ukraine.
Craig's legal team said Wednesday night they believe he may be charged soon by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., with making false statements to federal investigators.
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday night.
Craig and his former law firm, Skadden, Arps, were hired by the government of Ukraine in 2012 in a deal brokered by Manafort, who was working at the time as its advocate in the West.
The attorneys were commissioned to write a report assessing the prosecution by the Ukrainian regime of its political enemy, Yulia Tymoshenko .
The case against Tymoshenko had been widely criticized as an abuse of power aimed at silencing a critic, so the government of Viktor Yanukovych wanted to try to build some credibility in Western Europe and the United States.
National Security A 'Toothless' Old Law Could Have New Fangs, Thanks To Robert Mueller Skadden did not report that work as it should have under the Foreign Agents Registration Act , which requires disclosures by people and entities in the U.S. working on behalf of overseas entities. As part of a settlement , the law firm disgorged to the U.S. government all the money it was paid for the Ukraine representation. Another Skadden attorney pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about the matter and served jail time.
National Security All The Criminal Charges To Emerge From Robert Mueller's Investigation Manafort, who later served for a time as Donald Trump's campaign chairman during the 2016 presidential race, has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison in connection with tax fraud, bank fraud, FARA and conspiracy charges related to his work for Yanukovych.
The Craig case
The Justice Department's case now against Craig may not involve FARA, according to his lawyers, but may depend upon accounts he gave to investigators about a conversation he had with a New York Times correspondent about the Ukraine report.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Craig's lawyers said he had been told by the Justice Department's FARA unit that he wasn't required to register. The lawyers also said that he had not lied either to Skadden or the government about his conversations.
CNN reported last month that the Justice Department has been exploring a FARA case against Craig for so long that the statute of limitations on the original alleged offense had expired .
Craig, who served in the administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, resigned from Skadden last year without explanation.
If prosecutors aim to make a case against Craig now, they'll be making a mountain out of a molehill, argued his attorneys William W. Taylor III and William J. Murphy of the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder.
""Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion,"" they said.
The lawyers said they would fight any charges.

The European Union has agreed to delay the United Kingdom's departure from the EU, known as Brexit, until Oct. 31.
The deal, announced early Thursday in Brussels, averts a potential crisis as British leaders had failed to agree on their own plan for pulling out of the multi-state trade arrangement by Friday.
British Prime Minister Theresa May again called on Parliament to approve her Brexit deal.
""I know that there is a huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension,"" May said in a news conference . ""The U.K. should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not been able to persuade parliament to approve the deal.""
French President Emmanuel Macron called the six-month extension ""the best possible compromise"" with other EU leaders who were prepared to give the U.K. a year to work out its Brexit plan. Macron favored a shorter deadline fearing potential negative effects of the U.K. staying in the bloc before its exit.
""What is indispensable for us is that nothing can compromise the European project in the following months,"" the French president said as quoted by the Washington Post . ""We have a European renaissance to implement, and I do not want the issue of Brexit to block us at this point.""
Elections for the European Parliament are scheduled for next month. Macron said the British have to decide whether to participate in the elections with an eye toward soon leaving the EU.
""Please do not waste this time,"" said European Council President Donald Tusk, advising the U.K. to finally decide on the details of its planned departure from the EU.
Few observers missed that the Oct. 31 deadline coincides with Halloween.
""They're not trying to be funny, but I think it's totally appropriate given that, the way Brexit has gone, said NPR's Frank Langfitt on All Things Considered . ""It has been pretty much a horror story from early on.""
Langfitt said the real reason for the late October deadline is that the European Commission, the group that proposes legislation within the EU, will be seated on Nov. 1.
""So the idea is get the U.K. out before then,"" said Langfitt. ""There's a concern that if there is a Brexiteer prime minister who comes in after Prime Minister May, they might try to cause some trouble."" "

toggle caption Tyler Evert/AP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice delivers his State of the State speech on Jan. 9 in Charleston, W.Va. Mining companies belonging to the Justice family owe millions in safety violations.
Tyler Evert/AP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice promised to wipe out his family's debt from mine safety violations when he ran for governor in 2016. Instead, that debt has more than doubled since NPR first reported on it in 2014, amounting to millions of dollars.
""We'll absolutely ... make sure that every one of [the debts] is taken care of,"" Justice said at a news conference announcing his campaign for governor.
The Justice companies owe more than $4 million to the federal government, according to a new Ohio Valley ReSource analysis of federal data. That's the highest delinquent mine safety debt in the U.S. mining industry — and those unpaid violations have been a chronic problem for the Justice family for years, despite many promises to pay.
In 2014, an NPR investigation showed Justice companies owed just under $2 million in delinquent federal mine safety penalties, which are levied by the Mine Safety and Health Administration . Two years later, when Jim Justice was running for governor, the companies' debt had climbed to $2.6 million, according to a follow-up NPR investigation .

toggle caption Alexandra Kanik/Ohio Valley ReSource By the end of 2018, the Justice companies — now mainly controlled by the governor's children, James Justice III and Jillean Justice — owed millions more in delinquent mine safety penalties. Their delinquent debt ballooned to $4.3 million, according to the ReSource data analysis. The data were originally obtained by NPR's Howard Berkes through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
""[Gov. Justice] and his family has simply chosen to disregard, flagrantly violate, continually violate and increasingly violate the rules of mine safety and the penalties of mine safety,"" says Davitt McAteer, a former head of MSHA during the Clinton administration.
The delinquent penalties were accrued by the Justice companies between June 2009 and August 2018 at 71 mines in Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia. Collectively, the Justice companies' unpaid fines and penalties account for nearly 10 percent of all delinquent debt owed by mining companies in the country.
The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice companies referred questions to attorney Richard Getty, who represents the company in Kentucky. In a statement, Getty touted the company's safety record, despite owing millions in unpaid mine safety fines and violations.
""The Justice Group is also very proud to report that its accident and incident history of currently operated mines is very favorable,"" he stated.
Delinquent Mines Coal Mines Keep Operating Despite Injuries, Violations And Millions In Fines Delinquent Mines Billionaire Gubernatorial Candidate Owes $15 Million In Taxes And Fines The ReSource analysis found injury rates at delinquent Justice mines fall close to the national industry average. However, that does not mean those mines were free of unsafe conditions. From 2009 to 2019, Justice mines had 5,560 violations for things like failing to maintain equipment, accumulation of combustible materials, and failure to develop and follow ventilation plans.
About one-third of violations issued at delinquent Justice mines were listed as what MSHA calls ""Significant and Substantial,"" meaning the observed conditions at the mine present a reasonable likelihood that an injury or illness will occur. Nine violations were for conditions that federal regulators say placed miners in ""imminent danger"" of death or serious physical harm.
Getty, the attorney, acknowledged the $4.3 million in unpaid fines. But he said the company ""vehemently denies responsibility for this total."" According to Getty, a ""very significant portion"" of the penalties occurred at mines operated by a Russian company prior to their acquisition by the Justice family.
That's a claim Justice, his attorneys and spokesmen have made in the past. But the NPR and ReSource analyses of the federal data show none of the unpaid fines were incurred when mines were operated by the Russian company. The current $4.3 million in delinquent penalties are associated only with mines owned by the Justice companies when they owned them.
That was confirmed by an MSHA spokesperson in response to a direct question: The regulatory and enforcement agency ""stands by its assessment of fines and penalties for the Justice companies.""
Getty also claimed the Justices were ""currently involved in negotiations"" with MSHA to ""reach a fair and reasonable settlement."" But in a statement, MSHA said that's not true: The agency is not ""currently involved in negotiations with the Justice group.""
Investigations An Epidemic Is Killing Thousands Of Coal Miners. Regulators Could Have Stopped It Investigations 'I Figured It Was Going To Be A Horrible Death, And It Probably Will Be' While the Justice-owned companies are the top delinquents, they are not the only mining companies in the region that fail to pay their fines and penalties. Thousands of the country's mine operators continue to not pay fines assessed for health and safety violations. MSHA is owed more than $45 million in overdue fines, some as old as 1994, according to the ReSource analysis.
Delinquent mines represent about 8 percent of the nation's more than 40,000 coal, metal and nonmetal mines. Among the country's active coal mines, 23 percent are delinquent.
Working in mines that fail to pay penalties has potentially major impacts to the health and safety of miners. Injury rates for miners working in delinquent underground coal mines are 31 percent higher than rates at mines that are not currently delinquent, according to the ReSource analysis.
Mine inspections and citations exist to protect the nation's coal miners, says Patrick McGinley, a professor of environmental law at West Virginia University.
""Any friend of coal has to admit that there is no greater responsibility of a coal operator than to protect the lives of miners,"" he says. ""The failure to pay civil penalties is a way of saying, 'Safety doesn't matter. We don't care, we can get away with it.' ""

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images President Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in during a 2018 meeting in the Oval Office. Thursday's meeting is their first since Trump's unsuccessful summit with North Korea in February.
Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images President Trump will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House on Thursday, as Moon attempts to get U.S. talks with North Korea back on track.
World Trump And Kim's Second Nuclear Summit Ends With No Deal It will be the first meeting for Moon and Trump since the failed summit in Hanoi , which ended with no agreement from Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un on denuclearization.
For Moon, the summit was a setback. The South Korean leader has put his political legacy on the line in pursuit of better relations between the two Koreas.
""President Moon sees his No. 1 objective being to regain some momentum and some flexibility in Washington to sustain diplomacy with North Korea,"" said Patrick Cronin, Asia-Pacific security chair for the Hudson Institute.
The issue is whether there is any middle ground to be found for Washington and Pyongyang. The talks in Vietnam fell apart after Kim offered to dismantle parts of the Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for sanction relief. Trump said that was not enough to justify easing sanctions .
Asia Activity At 2nd North Korean Missile Site Indicates Possible Launch Preparations Since then, North Korean officials have said that Kim is considering resuming nuclear and missile tests . They also accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton of creating an atmosphere of ""hostility and distrust.""
One possible idea that Moon may float is a smaller agreement that would allow some joint economic projects between North and South Korea to move ahead if North Korea takes certain steps toward denuclearization.
Moon will be looking for a South Korean exception to international sanctions on North Korea, said David Fields, the associate director of the Center of East Asian Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
World After Madrid Embassy Raid, North Korean Defector Group Vows More Action ""These are things that Moon has been wanting to do for a long time, and I think he's probably going to pitch to Donald Trump that this might be a way to get the North Koreans back to the table,"" said Fields, who is the author of Foreign Friends, a book about the division of Korea.
So far, the Trump administration has resisted rolling back any of the economic sanctions on North Korea imposed as a part of a maximum pressure campaign. Administration officials have said Kim must first completely and permanently dismantle its nuclear program.
If joint projects are allowed to go forward, the administration would have to ensure that the money generated does not go to support weapons development, said Jung Pak, Korea chair at the Brookings Institution.
""We have seen that the revenue goes directly to the regime and not necessarily to the workers, the workers only get a small fraction,"" Pak said.
It remains an open question whether the administration would be willing to take action on sanctions for something less than complete and verifiable denuclearization.
At a press conference in Hanoi after the summit wrapped up, Trump was asked whether he would accept less than full denuclearization. He responded: ""I don't want to say that to you because I don't want to put myself in that position, from the standpoint of negotiation. But, you know, we want a lot to be given up.""
Asia President Trump Announces Halt To 'Additional Sanctions' On North Korea There seems to be some disagreement within the administration about how to handle negotiations going forward. Trump sent a tweet last month saying he had overruled his own administration and there would not be any 'large scale' additional sanctions on North Korea at this time. The tweet sparked confusion because it was not clear what sanctions Trump was referring to in the message.
""My sense is that there's different officials within the Trump administration giving (Trump) different advice because he seems to go back and forth on the this question of how far do we need to go with these negotiations,"" said Abraham Denmark, director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center.
""But, this is the president's negotiation ... so really the only opinion that matters in the U.S. government is what he believes,"" Denmark said."
Polls Open In The World's Largest Democracy: Fun Facts On India's Election,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712107668/polls-have-opened-in-the-worlds-largest-democracy-fun-facts-on-india-s-election,"Enlarge this image An Indian Mishing tribal woman looks back to ensure her vote has been cast as she prepares to leave the voting compartment during the first phase of general elections in Majuli, Assam, India, Thursday. Anupam Nath/AP Anupam Nath/AP An Indian Mishing tribal woman looks back to ensure her vote has been cast as she prepares to leave the voting compartment during the first phase of general elections in Majuli, Assam, India, Thursday.
Anupam Nath/AP An hour after sunrise in India on Thursday, the world's largest exercise of democracy got underway. That's when polls opened on the first day of voting in Indian elections.
A nationwide election in India is a massive undertaking — with a population of 1.3 billion and nearly 900 million eligible voters. This year, there are 543 parliamentary seats up for grabs, including that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who's running for a second term.
Balloting is no single-day affair. Poll workers must reach voters from the Himalayas to tropical islands in the Indian Ocean. So voting is done in seven stages, over more than five weeks — through May 19. Then votes will be counted on May 23.
Who is running?
Modi is the front-runner. He and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party are running for another five-year term. The BJP is a Hindu nationalist party that's brought India's majority Hindu faith into politics and public life in unprecedented ways. Under the BJP, many Indian states have banned beef, because cows are sacred to Hindus. They've revised school textbooks and changed the names of Indian cities with Muslim-sounding names. Modi has campaigned as a pro-business, anti-corruption candidate, and he sought to portray himself as a safe pair of hands during recent violence with neighboring Pakistan .
Modi's main challenger is India's main opposition party, the Congress party, and its leader Rahul Gandhi (no relation to India's freedom leader Mahatma Gandhi). Congress is a secular, socialist party that has pledged to protect India's minorities and improve life for the poor. It's a dynastic party; Gandhi's great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister. The party has been run by his descendants ever since, and it has dominated Indian politics until only recently.
World 'I Rue The Day We Ever Became Farmers': In Rural India, A Struggle To Survive If Modi wins and serves a full second term, it would be the longest stretch of non-Congress rule since India's independence from Britain in 1947.
What are the issues?
Many voters see this election as a referendum on Modi's past five years in office. India's economy is one of the fastest-growing in the world. But unemployment has hit a four-decade high . Crop prices are low, which means food is cheap. But it also means farmers' profits are meager , and they've been protesting in the streets . Voters also care about national security, after India and its archrival Pakistan — both nuclear powers — exchanged airstrikes this winter.
Asia Pakistan Says It's Holding Indian Pilot After Jet Shot Down In Cross-Border Airstrike How does voting work?
Indian law says no one should have to travel more than 2 kilometers (about 1.25 miles) to vote. So poll workers have fanned out across the country, setting up polling stations wherever there's even a tiny settlement. They trek through the jungle to bring voting machines to a man who lives alone in a lion-infested forest in the western state of Gujarat , and climb to nearly 15,000 feet above sea level to set up a polling station for 12 residents of a village in the northern province of Leh.
All voting is done by electronic voting machine, or EVM. The tabletop machine looks like a miniature piano keyboard, with buttons next to a list of political parties and also symbols — for those voters who might not be able to read. The machines fit into small suitcases, which poll workers have carried across glaciers and through deserts — even hoisting them overhead as they ford rivers to reach voters. Some poll workers have to take helicopters to reach remote settlements of voters.
By the numbers
1 in 8: Proportion of human beings eligible to vote in Indian elections
543: Seats at stake in the lower house of India's parliament
272: Seats any party needs, outright or by coalition, to form a government and choose India's next prime minister
2,293 : Political parties, national and local, contesting Indian elections
8,000 +: Candidates running for Indian parliament
2: Anglo-Indian seats in India's parliament. Those are seats reserved for members of the British community who stayed behind in India after the end of colonial rule.
1 million: Polling stations set up across India
11 million: Government employees deployed to oversee Indian voting
3.9 million : Electronic voting machines (EVMs) in use
1991: Year EVMs were introduced in India
At least $345 million: Value of cash, drugs, alcohol and goods confiscated so far from politicians attempting to bribe voters with gifts
15,256: Feet in elevation above sea level of India's highest-altitude polling station in Tashigang , a Buddhist settlement near the Chinese border
66 percent: Voter turnout for the last Indian elections, in 2014
$5 billion: Cost of 2014 elections; this year is expected to exceed that
300 million: Estimated number of Indians on Facebook. This is the social media site's largest market. The Indian government has expressed concern that fake news, spread on Facebook and the phone messaging app WhatsApp, could sway voters. Facebook says some 40 million rupees (half a million dollars) has been spent on political ads in India so far."

Eli Joshua Adé/Universal Pictures Eli Joshua Adé/Universal Pictures Marsai Martin stars as little Jordan Sanders in Little , a wrong-body comedy inspired by the 1988 Tom Hanks film Big.
Eli Joshua Adé/Universal Pictures The youngest executive producer working in Hollywood makes her big-screen debut this weekend.
Little is a comedy where a big and powerful tech executive wakes up as a little kid. In the end credits, the movie screen reads: ""Introducing Marsai Martin.""
Marsai may be new to the big screen, but she needs no introduction to fans of the ABC sitcom Black-ish , in which she's starred since 2014. In fact, she's been acting for almost a decade. She's now 14 years old — ""almost 15,"" she says.
""We stumbled upon this by accident,"" says her father, Joshua Martin. ""This was not planned — so you know.""
Martin says the family was minding its business at a mall near their home in Texas when a woman handed them a coupon for glamour shots. Marsai was 5 at the time, and they signed her up to get her portrait taken.
The photographer was so impressed with the way she took direction that he offered a bigger discount — if her dad promised to show the photos to a few talent agencies. Her parents kept that promise, and submitted the photos to four.
""Three of the four agencies said: 'We already have a girl who looks like that,'"" says Marsai's mother, Carol Martin. ""Basically, 'We already have our little black girl. We don't need two little black girls — we have our one.'""
But at agency number four, Marsai landed an interview.
""She had all the agents in a conga line around the room and they're like: 'We want to sign her!'"" Carol Martin says.

Shereen Marisol Meraji/NPR Marsai Martin is best known for her work on Black-ish , which is about an upper-middle-class black family living in a mostly white neighborhood. It's loosely based on the life of show creator Kenya Barris.
Code Switch 'Black-ish' Star Yara Shahidi, An Unofficial Ambassador For Gen Z The Week's Best Stories From NPR Books Jenifer Lewis Of 'Black-ish' Reflects On Her Role As Black Hollywood's Mother ""From the moment we met her, it was this pint-sized little ball of talent with these amazing glasses,"" Barris says.
He cast Marsai as one of the fraternal twins on the show, Diane. Diane is wise beyond her years and can intimidate most adults with a withering glance over her trademark glasses.
Barris says Marsai made that character her own by the second episode – with very little formal acting training. He calls her an old soul.
""I do think that there is a person who's been here before that speaks through her,"" Barris says. ""And I think that comes out in how she channels Diane and how she channels these characters that she becomes.""
Movie Reviews 'Little': A Wrong-Body Comedy That Can't Get Comfortable Her most recent character is Jordan from the comedy Little — a tech mogul who magically reverts back to her nerdy 13-year-old self. Marsai doesn't just play the lead; she pitched the idea.
If it sounds familiar, it's inspired by the 1988 film Big , starring Tom Hanks as a teenage boy who magically becomes an adult. Marsai says it was her mom's favorite movie growing up.
""That [movie] was kind of when it started to get into my head, and just saying to myself: 'What if we do this in a modern perspective?'"" she says. ""And, 'Maybe what if we do a female-empowerment, all-black-women cast?' So, I started talking about that with my parents, and then that's kind of how it got started.""
She ran the idea by her boss, Kenya Barris. She was 10.
""She said, 'Well a lot of people tell me I kind of remind them of Gabrielle Union or of Taraji P. Henson ,'"" Barris says. ""'Well, remember that movie Big ? I want to do a movie called Little .' And I was like, 'I'm going to stop you right there.' Nothing more needed to be said.""
Barris is one of the producers on Little , which is being distributed by Universal Pictures. In February, Universal signed what's called a ""first-look"" production deal with Genius Productions — the company Marsai runs with her parents.
""Basically, all the ideas you come up with, or anything that you have in mind for TV, film, any of that — in my case, you talk to Universal about it, and it goes to them first,"" she says.
Universal Pictures president Peter Cramer said he looks forward to moviegoers seeing Marsai in Little and ""watching her evolve as a filmmaker.""
Mia Mask is a little more cynical. She's a film professor at Vassar College who studies African-American cinema.
""I do think it's a way to sell the film,"" Mask says.
Mask hopes Marsai looks to other women of color creators for mentorship and inspiration. Specifically Ava DuVernay , Kasi Lemmons (director of Eve's Bayou ) and Dee Rees, whose screenplay for Mudbound was nominated for an Oscar.
""Because I'm concerned about what is going to happen after this film has been released and what comes next,"" Mask says. ""I mean, we know that it can be difficult to maintain a certain high-profile standing and standard within the industry, and that opportunities don't come along as often, as readily, as easily for women of color. It's a tough, tough industry and I would encourage her to take heart and find solace and community — in solidarity with other women of color.""
Marsai's mom Carol Martin says the family can already feel the difference between their daughter being on a sitcom vs. a heavily marketed film. Now, her face is everywhere.
""The billboards are now on the sides of buildings, and it's amplified in a way that is new for all of us,"" she says. ""So we are all kind of checking in on each other. Like, 'Are you good? Are you good?' OK, she's done 18 interviews in a row, you know.""
Marsai points out that anyone coming off 18 interviews would be tired.
""Like, a lot of people kind of underestimate me because I am a kid,"" she says.
Kenya Barris definitely has not underestimated Marsai Martin. When asked where he sees her in a decade, he laughs: ""as my boss.""
Until then, you can watch Marsai Martin playing the boss in Little — which opens on Friday.

Barris says Marsai made that character her own by the second episode – with very little formal acting training. He calls her an old soul.
""I do think that there is a person who's been here before that speaks through her,"" Barris says. ""And I think that comes out in how she channels Diane and how she channels these characters that she becomes.""
Her most recent character is Jordan from the comedy Little — a tech mogul who magically reverts back to her nerdy 13-year-old self. Marsai doesn't just play the lead; she pitched the idea.
If it sounds familiar, it's inspired by the 1988 film Big , starring Tom Hanks as a teenage boy who magically becomes an adult. Marsai says it was her mom's favorite movie growing up.
""That [movie] was kind of when it started to get into my head, and just saying to myself: 'What if we do this in a modern perspective?'"" she says. ""And, 'Maybe what if we do a female-empowerment, all-black-women cast?' So, I started talking about that with my parents, and then that's kind of how it got started.""
She ran the idea by her boss, Kenya Barris. She was 10.
""She said, 'Well a lot of people tell me I kind of remind them of Gabrielle Union or of Taraji P. Henson ,'"" Barris says. ""'Well, remember that movie Big ? I want to do a movie called Little .' And I was like, 'I'm going to stop you right there.' Nothing more needed to be said.""
Barris is one of the producers on Little , which is being distributed by Universal Pictures. In February, Universal signed what's called a ""first-look"" production deal with Genius Productions — the company Marsai runs with her parents.
""Basically, all the ideas you come up with, or anything that you have in mind for TV, film, any of that — in my case, you talk to Universal about it, and it goes to them first,"" she says.
Universal Pictures president Peter Cramer said he looks forward to moviegoers seeing Marsai in Little and ""watching her evolve as a filmmaker.""
Mia Mask is a little more cynical. She's a film professor at Vassar College who studies African-American cinema.
""I do think it's a way to sell the film,"" Mask says.
Mask hopes Marsai looks to other women of color creators for mentorship and inspiration. Specifically Ava DuVernay , Kasi Lemmons (director of Eve's Bayou ) and Dee Rees, whose screenplay for Mudbound was nominated for an Oscar.
""Because I'm concerned about what is going to happen after this film has been released and what comes next,"" Mask says. ""I mean, we know that it can be difficult to maintain a certain high-profile standing and standard within the industry, and that opportunities don't come along as often, as readily, as easily for women of color. It's a tough, tough industry and I would encourage her to take heart and find solace and community — in solidarity with other women of color.""
Marsai's mom Carol Martin says the family can already feel the difference between their daughter being on a sitcom vs. a heavily marketed film. Now, her face is everywhere.
""The billboards are now on the sides of buildings, and it's amplified in a way that is new for all of us,"" she says. ""So we are all kind of checking in on each other. Like, 'Are you good? Are you good?' OK, she's done 18 interviews in a row, you know.""
Marsai points out that anyone coming off 18 interviews would be tired.
""Like, a lot of people kind of underestimate me because I am a kid,"" she says.
Kenya Barris definitely has not underestimated Marsai Martin. When asked where he sees her in a decade, he laughs: ""as my boss.""
Until then, you can watch Marsai Martin playing the boss in Little — which opens on Friday.

toggle caption Dan Charles These Palmer amaranth — or pigweed — plants, seen growing in a greenhouse at Kansas State University, appear to be resistant to multiple herbicides.
Dan Charles There was a moment, about 20 years ago, when farmers thought that they'd finally defeated weeds forever.
Biotech companies had given them a new weapon: genetically engineered crops that could tolerate doses of the herbicide glyphosate, also known by its trade name, Roundup. Farmers could spray this chemical right over their crops, eliminate the weeds, and the crops were fine.
Stanley Culpepper remembers that moment. He'd left his family's farm to study weed science at North Carolina State University. ""I was trained by some really, really amazing people,"" he says, ""and I was even trained that there would never be a weed that was resistant to Roundup.""
These scientists believed that plants couldn't become immune to Roundup because it required too big of a change in a plant's biology.
In 2005, though, Stanley Culpepper reported that he'd found some weeds that Roundup could not kill. They were growing in a field in Georgia. And this was not just any weed. It was a kind of monster weed called Palmer amaranth, or pigweed.
Over the following years, these glyphosate-resistant pigweeds spread like a plague across America's farmland. They're practically everywhere in the South now, and increasingly common in the Midwest.
""The impact is just unbelievable,"" Culpepper says. ""We've invested over $1.2 billion, just in the cotton industry, for control of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth since we first discovered it.""
So biotech companies rolled out a new answer: new genetically engineered varieties of soybeans and cotton that can tolerate two other herbicides, called dicamba and 2,4-D . Farmers can plant these crops and then spray those chemicals, often in addition to glyphosate, to kill their weeds.
There's a lot riding on these new products, for farmers and for pesticide companies. Dicamba-tolerant crops, in particular, have provoked controversy . But now, even before they've been fully launched, there's evidence that this weed-killing tactic may be starting to fail.
The evidence is sitting in a greenhouse at Kansas State University, carefully tended by Chandrima Shyam , a graduate student there.

toggle caption Dan Charles Chandrima Shyam, a graduate student at Kansas State, is hoping to learn how these Palmer amaranth plants survive 2,4-D and other herbicides.
Dan Charles ""These are plants that were sprayed with 2,4-D. And these are the resistant plants,"" she says. ""You can see that the resistant plants are pretty vigorous.""
I see trays and trays of green, flourishing pigweeds. They are the offspring of weeds that another Kansas State scientist, Dallas Peterson , noticed last summer in a field where he conducts research. They seemed to survive every chemical he threw at them.
""We were just not able to control or kill those weeds following those herbicide applications,"" he says.
He called in a colleague who specializes in research on herbicide resistance, Mithila Jugulam , who in turn enlisted Shyam's help.
""So we went to the field. We dug out the whole plants, brought them to the greenhouse and kept them in isolation,"" Shyam says.
They grew 10 Palmer amaranth plants until they produced seeds, then replanted those seeds to produce new generations of plants in order to study them. They found that these pigweeds can survive sprays of 2,4-D. Some plants also appear to be immune to dicamba, although that still needs to be confirmed. The plants probably are resistant to glyphosate as well.
Basically, they're a farmer's nightmare. And if they showed up in one field, they're probably in other fields, too.
Stanley Culpepper, at the University of Georgia, says he's not surprised. Nobody should be surprised anymore by the superpowers of pigweed, he says. ""I'm telling you, as a weed scientist, it's just an absolutely fascinating plant,"" he says. ""You have to respect it, and the first thing to respect it is, [know that] this plant will outsmart me if I do the same thing over and over again.""
Culpepper tells farmers that they still can control this superweed, but they need to use a bunch of different tools. That means deploying multiple chemicals, alternating the crops that they plant, and planting extra ""cover crops"" in the off season to cover the soil and make it harder for weeds to emerge.
Matt Coley, a farmer in Vienna, Ga., says most growers learned a lot from their experience losing Roundup as a cure-all for weeds. ""As long as we continue to follow the recommendations not to rely just on one chemistry, I think we'll continue to be able to manage pigweed,"" he says.
But dicamba and 2,4-D are among the herbicides he uses on his cotton crop, and he admits it's a little unsettling to hear about Palmer amaranth plants that these chemicals won't kill. He's hoping for new weapons in his arsenal. ""The industry, the manufacturers — for them to be in business, they've got to have farmers,"" he says. ""Hopefully they're utilizing their research and development to continue to provide us with products that will help us control our pests in our crops.""
The arsenal is running out, though. And that's what worries Culpepper the most. ""We haven't had a new way to kill a weed with a herbicide since 1984,"" he says.
Meanwhile, weeds like Palmer amaranth and ryegrass have been defeating one chemical after another. ""This is a monumental challenge we're facing. Is dicamba- and 2,4-D-resistant pigweed surprising? No,"" he says. ""[But] the overall issue with resistance is flat-out overwhelming."""

Anupam Nath/AP An hour after sunrise Thursday in India, the world's largest exercise of democracy got underway. That's when polls opened on the first day of voting in Indian elections.
India is the world's largest democracy, with a population of 1.3 billion. Of that, nearly 900 million people are eligible to vote. There are 543 parliamentary seats up for grabs, including that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who's running for a second term.
But it's not a single-day affair. Poll workers must reach voters from the Himalayas to tropical islands in the Indian Ocean. So voting is done in seven stages, over more than five weeks — through May 19. Then votes will be counted on May 23.
Who is running?
Modi is the frontrunner. He and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, are running for another five-year term. The BJP is a Hindu nationalist party that's brought India's majority Hindu faith into politics and public life in unprecedented ways. Under the BJP, many Indian states have banned beef, because cows are sacred to Hindus. They've revised school textbooks, and changed the names of Indian cities with Muslim-sounding names. Modi has campaigned as a pro-business, anti-corruption candidate, and he sought to portray himself as a safe pair of hands during recent violence with neighboring Pakistan .
Modi's main challenger is India's main opposition party, the Indian National Congress Party, and its leader Rahul Gandhi (no relation to India's freedom leader Mahatma Gandhi). Congress is a secular, socialist party that's pledged to protect India's minorities and improve life for the poor. It's a dynastic party; Gandhi's great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister. The party has been run by his descendants ever since, and it's dominated Indian politics until only recently.
If Modi wins and serves a full second term, it would be the longest stretch of non-Congress rule since India's independence from Britain in 1947.
What are the issues?
Many voters see this election as a referendum on Modi's past five years in office. India's economy is one of the fastest-growing in the world. But unemployment has hit a four-decade high . Crop prices are low, which means food is cheap. But it also means farmers' profits are meager , and they've been protesting in the streets . Voters also care about national security, after India and its archrival Pakistan — both nuclear powers — exchanged airstrikes this winter.
How dies voting work?
Indian law says no one should have to travel more than two kilometers (about 1.25 miles) to vote. So poll workers have fanned out across the country, setting up polling stations wherever there's even a tiny settlement. They trek through the jungle to bring voting machines to a man who lives alone in a lion-infested forest in the western state of Gujarat , and climb to nearly 15,000 feet above sea level to set up a polling station for 12 residents of a village in the northern province of Leh.
All voting is done by Electronic Voting Machine, or EVM. The tabletop machines look like a miniature piano keyboard, with buttons next to a list of political parties, and also symbols — for those voters who might not be able to read. The machines fit into small suitcases, which poll workers have carried across glaciers, and through deserts — even hoisting them overhead as they ford rivers to reach voters. Some poll workers have to take helicopters to reach remote settlements of voters.
By the numbers
1 in 8 = Proportion of human beings eligible to vote in Indian elections
543 = Seats at stake in the lower house of India's parliament
272 = Seats any party needs, outright or by coalition, to form a government and choose India's next prime minister
2,293 = Political parties, national and local, contesting Indian elections
8,000 + = Candidates running for Indian parliament
2 = Anglo-Indian seats in India's parliament. Those are seats reserved for members of the British community who stayed behind in India after the end of colonial rule.
1 million = Polling stations set up across India
11 million = Government employees deployed to oversee Indian voting
3.9 million = Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in use
1991 = Year EVMs were introduced in India
At least $345 million = Value of cash, drugs, alcohol and goods confiscated so far from politicians attempting to bribe voters with gifts
15,256 = Feet in elevation above sea level of India's highest-altitude polling station in Tashigang , a Buddhist settlement near the Chinese border
66% = Voter turnout for the last Indian elections, in 2014
$5 billion = Cost of 2014 elections; this year is expected to exceed that
300 million = Estimated number of Indians on Facebook. This is the social media site's largest market. The Indian government has expressed concern that fake news, spread on Facebook and the phone messaging app WhatsApp, could sway voters. Facebook says some 40 million rupees (half a million dollars) has been spent on political ads in India so far."
"Justice Department Accuses Maker Of Suboxone With Fraud, Conspiracy",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711742397/justice-department-accuses-maker-of-suboxone-with-fraud-conspiracy?station=KXJZ_FM,"Federal prosecutors charge British drug maker Indivior with felony fraud and conspiracy for its marketing of opioid addiction products including Suboxone.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Suboxone has been marketed as a treatment drug that helps people who are addicted to opioids. It actually contains opioids. It's designed to treat withdrawal symptoms. But federal prosecutors say the drug itself is prone to abuse. Late Tuesday, the Department of Justice charged Indivior, the maker of Suboxone, with fraud and conspiracy. Brian Mann is a reporter with North Country Public Radio. He reports on the opioid crisis, and he joins us now.
Brian, what exactly are prosecutors charging? We say fraud and conspiracy. What else can you tell us about the charges?
BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yeah. They say this British company lied about the safety of Suboxone, claiming it was less prone to abuse. And the allegation here, really, is that Indivior's deceptive claims convinced a lot of health providers and insurers, like Medicare and Medicaid, to spend billions of dollars on their patented version of Suboxone rather than buying much cheaper, generic versions of the medication. An investigation by the Food and Drug Administration found Suboxone isn't actually safer. In fact, it may even be riskier in a lot of cases.
MARTIN: Which is really huge news because this was a drug that was seen to be a fix or at least something that was going to help people who were addicted to opioids, right?
MANN: Yeah. I mean, Suboxone is still widely used to treat people suffering from opioid dependency, prescription drugs and non-prescription opioids - designed to help with withdrawal symptoms and long-term maintenance. Medications like this are hugely important because so many Americans are addicted to opioids. But Suboxone itself contains opioids, and that means people sometimes abuse it too. And prosecutors say Indivior boosted profits illegally by setting up a system that connected people suffering from addiction with crooked doctors who were overprescribing Suboxone.
MARTIN: What's the company saying about these charges?
MANN: Well, they released a detailed rebuttal last night to these charges, saying the Justice Department is wrong on the science and on the facts. They say they've been an important and responsible player helping respond to the opioid crisis. Indivior promised they will - and this is their quote. They will ""contest this case vigorously. We look forward to the full facts coming out in court,"" they say.
MARTIN: Several states are already suing big drug companies for their role in the opioid epidemic. Why is the momentum catching right now?
MANN: Yeah, so this is just a huge health crisis. The Centers for Disease Control say more than 200,000 Americans have died from prescription opioid overdoses that began after these companies like Indivior began aggressively marketing these drugs - more than a hundred Americans still dying every day. And so what we're seeing is state attorneys general and now federal agencies beginning to demand that drug makers and distributors pay for some of the damage they've caused. Just last month, Purdue Pharma settled with the state of Oklahoma for $270 million. That company has started talking openly about filing for bankruptcy. And federal prosecutors say if Indivior is found guilty in this case, the company should forfeit $3 billion. And the promise, Rachel, is that a lot of that money will go to help with drug treatment for, you know, things like rehab programs and law enforcement.
MARTIN: Brian Mann with North Country Public Radio.
Thanks so much, Brian. We appreciate it.
MANN: Thank you.

Colorado's 'Red Flag' Gun Measure Raises Concerns,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711714596/colorados-red-flag-gun-measure-raises-concerns?station=KXJZ_FM,"Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is expected to sign the bill this week, allowing guns to be temporarily taken from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Colorado's red flag gun measure is raising red flags of its own. The law is designed to allow family members or law enforcement to petition courts to temporarily take guns away from people deemed a threat to themselves or others. More than a dozen other states already have so-called red flag gun laws on the books. State lawmakers have passed the bill in Colorado, and the governor there says he will sign it. But some gun rights groups and law enforcement say they just won't follow the law. Here's Bente Birkeland of Colorado Public Radio.
BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: Even though the gun bill hasn't been signed, it's already leading to potential recall efforts and legal challenges, and roughly half of the state's counties oppose it. Steve Reams is the Weld County Sheriff in northern Colorado. He says the law won't make anyone safer.
STEVE REAMS: Just taking someone's firearms away and leaving them in place doesn't solve the problem, in my mind. It could actually make it worse in some scenarios. And we're kicking the can down the road to deal with the mental health issue.
BIRKELAND: A big sticking point for critics is that the burden of proof would be on gun owners to get their firearms back by showing that they're no longer a risk. Reams says he's willing to go to jail rather than follow a court's order to seize someone's guns.
REAMS: In my oath of office, it reads that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the state of Colorado. Obviously, that creates a concern if a law is adopted that I believe is in conflict with either the state constitution or the United States Constitution.
JARED POLIS: The job of a sheriff is to enforce the law, not make the law. I mean, if they want to make the law, they should run for a different office.
BIRKELAND: That's Democratic Governor Jared Polis. He estimates the red flag law would be used about 50 times a year.
POLIS: It would be a great concern if this was used more broadly. It should be a very, very high bar to even temporarily remove that right because it's a constitutional right, which I strongly support.
BIRKELAND: Colorado is home to two of the country's most infamous mass shootings - the one at Columbine High School 20 years ago this month and another at an Aurora movie theater in 2012. The following year, when Democrats passed stricter gun laws, two state lawmakers were recalled.
MEG FROELICH: We are a Western state with a libertarian streak. We are a strong outdoors state with hunting and fishing.
BIRKELAND: That's Democratic Representative Meg Froehlich.
FROELICH: So I think all of those make for a more nuanced discussion on this issue.
BIRKELAND: She's among several Democrats potentially facing a recall election for supporting the red flag gun bill. Froelich thinks it will reduce gun violence and save lives. She says a recall campaign from Republicans would be a waste of taxpayer money.
FROELICH: Why not call for an exciting agenda of what you want to do and what solutions you're offering?
BIRKELAND: Tom Sullivan is a Democratic representative who sponsored the bill. He got involved in politics after his son, Alex, was killed in the Aurora shooting when a gunman opened fire on moviegoers. Sullivan says, after six years without any new gun control laws in Colorado, this is a much needed win.
TOM SULLIVAN: When the final vote was taken, I just had that moment where, you know, you could close your eyes, take a deep breath, appreciate what has happened. But then you open your eyes and that's not the end of, you know, the pain and the sorrow - and it's just the next day of it.
BIRKELAND: Sullivan plans to frame the signed bill and hang it on his office wall. He says it'll go next to the poster honoring his son and other Aurora shooting victims.

New Mexico May Become Temporary Storage Site For Nuclear ...,www.npr.org,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/709600915/new-mexico-is-divided-over-the-perfect-site-to-store-nation-s-nuclear-waste,"A 1,000-acre patch of southeast New Mexico desert may offer a temporary solution to the nation's longstanding nuclear waste problem.

Nathan Rott/NPR
Thirty-five miles out of Carlsbad, in the pancake-flat desert of southeast New Mexico, there's a patch of scrub-covered dirt that may offer a fix — albeit temporarily — to one of the nation's most vexing and expensive environmental problems: What to do with our nuclear waste?
Despite more than 50 years of searching and billions of dollars spent, the federal government still hasn't been able to identify a permanent repository for nuclear material. No state seems to want it.
So instead, dozens of states are stuck with it. More than 80,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, a still-radioactive byproduct of nuclear power generation, is spread across the country at power plants and sites in 35 states.
The issue has dogged politicians for decades. Energy Secretary Rick Perry recently described the situation as a ""logjam."" But some hope that this remote, rural corner of New Mexico may present a breakthrough.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering a proposal by Holtec International, a private U.S.-based company, to build a massive consolidated interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel on that patch of desert. It could eventually hold up to 100,000 metric tons of the material, storing it until a permanent repository is found.

The bid has support from a group of local officials, drawn by the promise of tax revenues, high-paying jobs and a stable source of income.
The same appears to be true in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers are anxious to find a solution and have indicated an openness to change laws, making it easier for private companies to manage nuclear fuel.
But familiar challenges persist.
A broad coalition of local and national groups opposes the plan, as does the state's new governor. They're worried about transporting the nuclear waste and the environmental impacts of storing it.
""Why should we be the ones to take this negative project on and put up with the consequences?"" says Rose Gardner, a florist who lives 35 miles from the proposed site. ""We didn't get any of the nuclear generated electricity. We're not even involved.""
Rose Gardner, a vocal opponent of Holtec's proposal, doesn't see why her small, rural corner of New Mexico should take on the nation's nuclear waste.

An expensive and expansive problem
The question of what to do with spent nuclear fuel has plagued the U.S. since before the nation's first commercial nuclear power plant was even running .
In 1982 Congress got involved, passing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act , which called for the development of repositories for the nation's high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel.
Five years later, it narrowed those efforts, focusing on a single area 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas: Yucca Mountain.
The federal government has spent billions of dollars assessing the viability of a deep underground storage facility there. For decades, Yucca looked like the destination for nuclear waste.

But efforts to move that project forward were stifled by local opposition. Stuck at an impasse, and under pressure from then-Senate Majority Leader and Nevadan Harry Reid, the Obama administration scrapped funding for the site in 2009 .
The Trump administration has called for funding to revive the Yucca Mountain project, but local resistance remains and Nevada lawmakers have dug in their heels.
In the meantime, spent nuclear fuel continues to build up at scores of power plants around the country, at facilities that weren't designed to store it.
The problem with this is two-fold.
For one, it's expensive. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act said that the Department of Energy would find a permanent home for utilities' nuclear waste by 1998. It didn't. So now, the Department of Energy pays utility companies more than $2 million a day to store that nuclear waste on-site. That's taxpayer money.
The other problem is public safety.
More than 1 in 3 Americans lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant , according to Columbia University. Many of those plants are now storing spent nuclear fuel on coastlines or near rivers, areas that are more prone to flooding and natural disasters.

""There's no question, from a safety perspective, from a risk perspective, from an economic perspective, consolidated interim storage makes a lot of sense,"" says John Heaton, a former New Mexico state legislator who's part of a group trying to bring the facility to the state. ""We're in a seismically stable, dry place. It's more or less a perfect site.""
Don't put this in an oil field. That's a bad idea. Certainly not the biggest oil field the United States has. Tommy Taylor, director of oil and gas development, Fasken Oil and Ranch
A ""consent-based"" approach
In 2010, fresh off its decision to end funding for Yucca Mountain, the Obama administration commissioned a blue ribbon panel to look at America's nuclear waste problem.
One of its top recommendations was to authorize and establish consolidated interim storage facilities. But to avoid another-Yucca like impasse, it also recommended using a new ""consent-based approach"" when finding a location.
""We believe this type of approach can provide the flexibility and sustain the public trust and confidence needed to see controversial facilities through to completion,"" the report said ."

""The impact is just unbelievable,"" Culpepper says. ""We've invested over $1.2 billion, just in the cotton industry, for control of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth since we first discovered it.""
So biotech companies rolled out a new answer: new genetically engineered varieties of soybeans and cotton that can tolerate two other herbicides, called dicamba and 2,4-D . Farmers can plant these crops and then spray those chemicals, often in addition to glyphosate, to kill their weeds.
There's a lot riding on these new products, for farmers and for pesticide companies. Dicamba-tolerant crops, in particular, have provoked controversy . But now, even before they've been fully launched, there's evidence that this weed-killing tactic may be starting to fail.
The evidence is sitting in a greenhouse at Kansas State University, carefully tended by Chandrima Shyam , a graduate student there.

Dan Charles Dan Charles Chandrima Shyam, a graduate student at Kansas State, is hoping to learn how these Palmer amaranth plants survive 2,4-D and other herbicides.
Dan Charles ""These are plants that were sprayed with 2,4-D. And these are the resistant plants,"" she says. ""You can see that the resistant plants are pretty vigorous.""
I see trays and trays of green, flourishing pigweeds. They are the offspring of weeds that another Kansas State scientist, Dallas Peterson , noticed last summer in a field where he conducts research. They seemed to survive every chemical he threw at them.
""We were just not able to control or kill those weeds following those herbicide applications,"" he says.
He called in a colleague who specializes in research on herbicide resistance, Mithila Jugulam , who in turn enlisted Shyam's help.
""So we went to the field. We dug out the whole plants, brought them to the greenhouse and kept them in isolation,"" Shyam says.
They grew 10 Palmer amaranth plants until they produced seeds, then replanted those seeds to produce new generations of plants in order to study them. They found that these pigweeds can survive sprays of 2,4-D. Some plants also appear to be immune to dicamba, although that still needs to be confirmed. The plants probably are resistant to glyphosate as well.
Basically, they're a farmer's nightmare. And if they showed up in one field, they're probably in other fields, too.
Culpepper, at the University of Georgia, says he's not surprised. Nobody should be surprised anymore by the superpowers of pigweed, he says. ""I'm telling you, as a weed scientist, it's just an absolutely fascinating plant,"" he says. ""You have to respect it, and the first thing to respect it is, [know that] this plant will outsmart me if I do the same thing over and over again.""
Culpepper tells farmers that they still can control this superweed, but they need to use a bunch of different tools. That means deploying multiple chemicals, alternating the crops that they plant, and planting extra ""cover crops"" in the off season to cover the soil and make it harder for weeds to emerge.
Matt Coley, a farmer in Vienna, Ga., says most growers learned a lot from their experience losing Roundup as a cure-all for weeds. ""As long as we continue to follow the recommendations not to rely just on one chemistry, I think we'll continue to be able to manage pigweed,"" he says.
But dicamba and 2,4-D are among the herbicides he uses on his cotton crop, and he admits it's a little unsettling to hear about Palmer amaranth plants that these chemicals won't kill. He's hoping for new weapons in his arsenal. ""The industry, the manufacturers — for them to be in business, they've got to have farmers,"" he says. ""Hopefully they're utilizing their research and development to continue to provide us with products that will help us control our pests in our crops.""
The arsenal is running out, though. And that's what worries Culpepper the most. ""We haven't had a new way to kill a weed with a herbicide since 1984,"" he says.
Meanwhile, weeds like Palmer amaranth and ryegrass have been defeating one chemical after another. ""This is a monumental challenge we're facing. Is dicamba- and 2,4-D-resistant pigweed surprising? No,"" he says. ""[But] the overall issue with resistance is flat-out overwhelming."""
Efforts Continue In Sudan To Oust The Country's President : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712116712/efforts-continue-in-sudan-to-oust-the-countrys-president,"President of Sudan Omar Al-Bashir was overthrown in a military coup Thursday after over 30 years in office. The coup follows months of violent demonstrations and calls for him to step down.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Military leaders in Sudan say they have overthrown the country's long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir. He's led the country for 30 years. This coup follows months of violent street protests with demonstrators calling for Bashir's resignation. Halima Gikandi is covering this story. She's based in Nairobi and joins me on the line.
Halima, how are you? Thanks for joining us.
HALIMA GIKANDI, BYLINE: Thank you so much for having me.
GREENE: So you have been reporting that - I mean, people have been on the streets in Khartoum and in Sudan just waiting for some sort of news. It appears that news has finally come. Just tell us about the scene and how this news was delivered.
GIKANDI: Sure. So most of the people in this region have been awake since about 6 a.m. - 5 a.m. Sudan time. We didn't know who was going to speak. But we woke up to an announcement for the state news agency that the military was going to give an important announcement. So some of my sources on the ground went sledding to the scene of the protest, waiting eagerly. Some people were cheering but not really knowing what they were cheering for and what was going to happen. So there's been a lot of anticipation for this moment.
GREENE: And what does this moment mean? This is a leader who's been in power for three decades.
GIKANDI: So the moment's a bit bittersweet for people. On one hand, the biggest demand for demonstrators was for Omar al-Bashir to step down. So on the safe side, it seems as if the demands of the protesters have been met. Some people - a lot of the people out in the protesters are young kids between the age of 15 and 30. Now, Omar al-Bashir has been ruling for nearly 30 years, so almost all of their lives. So it's a big accomplishment on that front, but the actual news that's been delivering is less comforting for protesters because it seems like their second demand, which was to have a transitional government into more of a democracy, has not been met. So it's a bit bittersweet for the protesters out on the ground.
GREENE: So there's a lot of uncertainty here. I mean, the military and their allegiance in recent days - it sounds like has been unclear. And I suppose whenever a military takes over a country, I mean, it's tense when you think about where this might go.
GIKANDI: It's incredibly unclear for everyone. In fact, I was speaking with some activists on the ground of Khartoum since the morning. And they were saying they - what they hope will not happen is that the military will take over. And it's been a complicated situation because in - the situation in Sudan is that there are just various armed military forces that work. On one hand, you have the army, which in the past few days has been shown seeming to protect protesters. On the other hand of that, you have the National Intelligence Agency, which has been known to have done human rights violations. So what does it mean now for demonstrators to be seeing that the military is taking over and will be installing a two-year transitional government consisting of all of those various intelligence agencies?
GREENE: And so just to be clear, have we heard anything from Bashir? Is it absolutely clear that he is truly giving up power here?
GIKANDI: So we have not heard from Omar al-Bashir yet. There have been a number of rumors circulating online, but we have not heard from him. What we have heard of - what we have heard from is the minister of defense, Ibn Awad Mohamed Auf (ph), who - he's, essentially, the No. 2 in Sudan. He was appointed in February to be also - to serve as the vice president. And he said quite clearly that al-Bashir is in custody right now. But some people are concerned that that means - that that the government - that the army is essentially protecting him from facing the ICC.
GREENE: Reporter Halima Gikandi in Nairobi, speaking to us about what appears to be a coup in Sudan - but, obviously, much to follow here.
Halima, thank you so much. We really appreciate it.
GIKANDI: Of course; thank you.

When I first heard the ethereal folk songs of Daniel Norgren in 2016, he was performing on a stage at the Pickathon music festival made from limbs and bark — it was the perfect spot to fall in love with his music and yearning voice. His set was both intense and calming.
On his album Wooh Dang , the lazy and woodsy ways of Daniel Norgren and his band are casually captured to analog tape. The songs were all written by Norgren in the woods surrounding his home in Western Sweden, and for this recording, they gathered in an old 19th-century farmhouse, adding a friendly informal spirit to the music.
You'd be forgiven if, upon hearing Wooh Dang , you mistook the Sweden-born and-based Norgren for an American roots singer-songwriter — he was raised on this music, it's in his bones. There's a down-home feel to the record's boogie-woogie tunes, and lyrics with references to John Wayne movies, trains and travel. These are pretty cliche themes by this point and handled far more profoundly by the likes of Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams and Bob Dylan. But there's comfort and value in having a record that you can put on and feel as if you're hanging out on a well-worn couch, to use another cliche.
Daniel Norgren and his band are welcoming on Wooh Dang with a careful touch of ambiance and mystery in the playing, and that's the beauty you'll find buried deep inside these songs.

Angélique Kidjo now has a pair of albums that are essentially covers of other artists, but interpreted with an African sensibility so majestic as to render the originals almost as source material.
On 2018's Remain In Light, Kidjo made the implicit African influences of Talking Heads' original vision explicit . Kidjo didn't channel New Wave, or even rock and roll, as a starting point; instead, she used West African polyrhythms to reinterpret the band's take on then-modern life in America. It was one of my favorite albums of last year.
Courtesy of the artist Somehow Kidjo had the time to record a second tribute album, this time dedicated to an individual artist.
Celia refers to Celia Cruz , perhaps the most well-known vocalist to come from Cuba during any era. The ten tracks span several decades of Cruz's career, from before she left Cuba in 1960 to her groundbreaking recordings for the celebrated Fania Records label in New York in the 1970s, to ""La Vida Es Un Carnaval,"" the 1998 song that became her late career hit and anthem. Kidjo's reinterpretations rearrange the molecules of songs that many of us know by heart. The results are glorious.
The tongue twister ""Cucala"" becomes a rhythmic pattern for both guitar and hand drums as Kidjo sings the Spanish-language lyric that is an ode to joy of dancing. It's a brilliant take on a song that I honestly thought couldn't get any better.
Mountain Stage Listen: Angélique Kidjo In Concert Music Interviews Angélique Kidjo Connects Talking Heads With Her African Roots Cruz never shied away from the island's African culture, especially on songs like""Yemaya"" and ""Elegua."" These two tracks on Celia strip away the classic, horn-driven guaracha feel of La Sonora Matancera's 1950s-era orchestrations and become deeply emotional prayers to the two Afro-Cuban deities.
""Quimbara,"" one of Cruz's most well-known anthems, serves as Celia 's mission statement. The original was based on guaguancó , which was a bold move at the the time. Why? Mambo and cha-cha-cha were the ruling Latin dance rhythms of the day, and here was an Afro-Cuban folkloric beat. On Celia, Angélique Kidjo changes the rhythm from a solid 4/4 to a languid, yet powerful 6/8. Afrobeat-style guitar approximates the West African koraand punctuates it all with a funky, horn driven, stop-time statement of its massive chorus.
What puts the song over the top is the call-and-response improvisation of the title. It's done at twice the speed of the rhythm underneath (what musicians call double time) and it never clashes. Kidjo has so expertly tied the original guaguanco to her 6/8 that it serves as a point of cultural pride that Africa could claim Celia Cruz as one of their own. And that is the point of every track of this album.
Celia Cruz's music and her entire being was a reminder of the presence of Africa in Cuba. Angélique Kidjo's Celia musically closes that circle with reverence and more than a little love."
"WWII Spy Virginia Hall, The Subject Of Sonia Purnell's 'A Woman Of No Importance,' Was Anything But",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/711773072/virginia-hall-the-subject-of-a-woman-of-no-importance-was-anything-but,"Independent Booksellers
It sounds like propaganda meant to misdirect WWII Germans: a lone foreigner running riot in occupied France, everywhere at once, unrecognizable despite a trademark gait, able to bewitch information out of anyone, single-handedly stirring up resistance — and then vanishing.
The German secret police couldn't even be sure what country she was from. It would be easy to believe the Limping Lady wasn't real.
But she was.
Virginia Hall was one of the earliest Special Operations Executive agents Britain sent into occupied France to stir up resistance against the Nazi/Vichy regime, where she laid critical groundwork for an organized Resistance in southern France — and later led a cell herself. She isn't totally unknown; there have been other biographies, as well as a CIA training hall named in her honor and even a Drunk History sketch. But Sonia Purnell's A Woman of No Importance is a gripping take, tracing Hall's life in the context of hurdles she faced from allies — as much as from enemies.
She was an unlikely choice for SOE field work; she was a woman, she was American, and she had a disability (a hunting accident left her with a wooden leg she called Cuthbert) that made her easy to identify. But the speedy Nazi takeover of Europe was more alarming than the usual prejudices, and in 1940 she was in France with only the barest brief — build a Resistance, no matter what.
It was a hasty affair; the rush to get undertrained and unsupported operatives into the field led to fatal mistakes, and Hall was often aghast at the ways good-old-boy office politics seemed so often to triumph over on-the-ground realities. But amid the SOE chaos, there's also the overarching sense of righteousness that accompanies World War II stories — fighting Nazis is one of the most clearly demarcated moral lines in history — and even a little gallows humor. (Hall's first field name, ""Germaine Lecontre,"" may be one of the less subtle spy monikers ever bestowed.)
The story is clearly Hall's, and her achievements beggar belief, from escaping France through the Pyrenees (with Cuthbert intact) to the sixth sense that repeatedly kept her from capture. But Purnell smooths a staggering cast and timeline into a brisk narrative. And though Hall's impact is astonishing, the book makes clear how many people a Resistance requires. Lyon madam Germaine Guérin was harboring Jewish refugees and Allies before Virginia Hall ever got there, and stands out in the telling. But the nameless young lady in 1942 who got off a train and asked for black coffee and three aspirins at a cafe also saved lives — it was a signal to the locals the Gestapo was on to them.
Stakes are rarely an issue in a book about WWII; its rhythms are a shorthand, and we've come to expect hairy near-misses, unlikely escapes, and devastating double agents. Still, Purnell finds fresh dread in the growing efficacy of surveillance, the Vichy regime's tactics, and propaganda campaigns where ""the same false messages were pressed home again and again until they were almost universally believed, even when flying in the face of incontrovertible facts.""
And though the international stakes shrink sharply, the air of menace follows Hall after the war into the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and, eventually, the CIA. The primary enemy here was the mundane tyranny of sexism that stymied her career (a man in the department referred to her as a ""gung-ho lady left over from OSS days overseas"" only a few years after the war), and Purnell tracks the infuriating infighting between pro- and anti-Hall factions with the same seriousness as the French campaigns; there's more than one kind of war.
Though that hostility explains much about Hall's patchwork assignments in American intelligence, it also feels as if more personal insights are missing. (Perhaps literally: Purnell notes ""[w]hole batches of papers at the National Archives and Records Administration...have apparently been mislaid"".) Hall's war motivations were clear; she felt the horror of Nazi and Vichy cruelty and was determined to help. Purnell's picture of a postwar world is a fractured, ethically muddy arena of conflicting operations, and we're left without much sense of what Hall thought of those assignments — some of which pitted her against factions she'd worked with during the war.
But maybe this only feels like a loss because Hall is such a vivid presence elsewhere. Though the minutiae of her missions are gripping, Hall shines through in every dispatch with human complexity; popular and lonely, patient and short-tempered, depressed and determined. A very smooth read about a rocky life, A Woman of No Importance is a compelling biography of a masterful spy, and a reminder of what can be done with a few brave people — and a little resistance.

From
Three fires broke out recently at petrochemical plants. Residents say it may be the cost of having this kind of industrial economy, but the air quality and danger has some re-thinking the trade off.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The city of Houston has seen three fires at petrochemical facilities in less than a month. The last fire killed a worker there. All sent giant black plumes of smoke into the sky. Florian Martin of Houston Public Media looks into the string of accidents and whether anything is being done to prevent them in the future.
FLORIAN MARTIN, BYLINE: It started on March 16 with a chemical fire just east of Houston.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SYAN RHODES: And that breaking news coming to us from Baytown, where crews are monitoring a fire at the Exxon Mobil refinery.
JONATHAN MARTINEZ: Video from...
MARTIN: That's local TV station KPRC. The blaze was put out only a few hours later. The very next day, just across the Houston Ship Channel, a fire broke out at a chemical storage facility at ITC, Intercontinental Terminals Company. That fire spread to several tanks and burned for three days. It reignited two days later and chemicals spilled into the Houston Ship Channel, shutting down the busy waterway for several days. And after things finally seemed under control with that fire...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
EDDIE ROBINSON: Emergency crews are responding to a chemical plant fire out in east Harris County off old Highway 90 in Crosby.
MARTIN: Houston Public Media reported an explosion at KMCO, 25 miles northeast of downtown Houston - killed one worker and injured two others. Jim Blackburn says, unfortunately, this is part of life in the Houston area. He's an environmental engineering professor at Rice University.
JIM BLACKBURN: We have had these three occurrences. They occurred, you know, frankly, at a time period that - it's probably much more frequent than would be the normal case. But, you know, we have a lot of chemicals that are being handled. All of these chemical processes are dangerous. Inherent in that is the potential for explosion.
MARTIN: Talk to residents near the refineries and you hear similar tones. Barb Wooster lives in Baytown, near the site of the Exxon Mobil fire.
BARB WOOSTER: It's something we accept. It's part of the economy - the local economy. We understand that if our families and the people that we know and care about want jobs - need jobs to support their families or take care of their responsibilities, there's some inherent risk in being in this environment where industry is so prevalent.
MARTIN: But even though Wooster has lived here all her life, the recent incidents are making her second-guess her decision to raise a family in the Houston area. Authorities say air readings showed no harmful levels of toxins throughout the incidents except for in the immediate vicinity of the sites. But for clean air advocates, this doesn't mean all is good. Corey Williams is with the group Air Alliance Houston. He says it could have been much worse if the weather hadn't played along.
COREY WILLIAMS: I don't think it's worth gambling the public's health on favorable weather conditions.
MARTIN: He hopes the attention the string of incidents received will lead to more enforcement by the state of safety violations in the industry, which has historically been lax in Texas. Jim Blackburn does too. He says even in Houston, many people who don't live near the petrochemical complexes that line the Ship Channel often forget about them.
BLACKBURN: Something like that big, black plume of smoke across the Houston skyline, I think, is a way of communicating these risk - these dangers to people that oftentimes feel that they're exempt from it. And I think that's important.
MARTIN: The state certainly took notice. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton swiftly filed suit against both ITC and KMCO. But many are skeptical. Blackburn says with the national attention and the state legislature in session, part of the decision was likely image control. Meanwhile, the three companies are all vowing to be better in the future. The fire marshal is still investigating the sources of all three fires, so none are giving specifics on what they'll do differently. And residents, like Kenneth Brown, say they'll just have to hope that the recent events weren't an indication of these kinds of accidents happening more often in the future.
KENNETH BROWN: Well, I mean, the plans were there when I moved here. And they're going to probably be here when I'm gone.

British Police Arrest WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange In London,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712145317/british-police-arrest-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-in-london,"David Greene talks to WikiLeaks editor Kristinn Hrafnsson about Assange's arrest — ending the long tenure of the anti-secrecy activist in Ecuador's Embassy. NPR's Philip Ewing weighs in on the topic.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been arrested in London this morning. The Metropolitan Police say they took him into custody after he was evicted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has lived since 2012. Assange took refuge in that embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden and says he believes the Swedish authorities intended to extradite him to the United States. We begin our coverage with WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson, who is on the line from Iceland.
Thanks for taking the time for us.
KRISTINN HRAFNSSON: Well, thank you. I'm actually the editor of WikiLeaks. And I am in London at the moment.
GREENE: OK. You're the editor. I apologize for that. Can you tell me what your understanding is of why Julian Assange was arrested now?
HRAFNSSON: Well, this is outrageous, of course. This morning, the Ecuadorian president, Lenin Moreno, instructed his ambassador in London to revoke the political asylum that he had granted, or the country had granted, to Julian Assange and called in the Metropolitan Police, allowed them into the premise of the embassy, where Julian Assange was arrested and brought into custody.
This, of course, is a gross violation of international treaties and an outrageous behavior in all respects. A country simply shouldn't revoke the status of that kind when it has been granted in the first place.
GREENE: I just want to ask you, I mean, there's - there are suggestions from WikiLeaks that the United States government, maybe the CIA, was involved in all this. Do you have evidence of that, because the British government is saying that they are just arresting him because he violated, you know, the conditions of his release?
HRAFNSSON: Well, of course, there's evidence of this - I mean, a sealed indictment in place that was revealed by mistake in November last year in the United States and an extradition request to the United Kingdom that would be published, of course, and handed over when he was in the hands of the U.K. police.
And what Julian was dealing with in the use of the authorities in the U.K. is a minor offense, relatively, in terms of things. It's a breach of bail condition that usually is finished with a small fine of some nature.
But we know the existence of the indictment that was issued under seal of a court in Virginia. And now we expect it to be unsealed and an extradition request to be handed to the U.K. authorities. That is what we were claiming all the time, and now with this unfolding just as we had predicted.
GREENE: Well, I just want to ask you, I mean, the Justice Department has filed criminal charges against Assange related to the publication of classified documents. I mean, there are many in the U.S. government who have said that Julian Assange put, you know, people serving in the U.S. military at risk, among other things. Can you just explain to Americans why he should not face a day in court in the United States?
HRAFNSSON: Because that sets a precedent. Even if the authorities in your country claim that something has been put at risk, that does not constitute a violation of the right of public citizen journalists to publish information that is relevant and should be in the public domain.
What Julian Assange and WikiLeaks did was basically the same thing as The New York Times did. They published in coordination with WikiLeaks most of the documents that we believe are now being used as the pretext to haul him into court. This is something - it's a violation against - it's an indictment of journalism. That's it.
GREENE: Speaking to WikiLeaks editor Kristinn Hrafnsson, who is based in Iceland and joins us from London this morning.
Thank you very much for your time.
HRAFNSSON: Thank you.
GREENE: I want to bring in NPR national security editor Phil Ewing, who has been listening into this. And, Phil, what is your understanding about the timing of this and why British authorities have arrested Assange in London today?
PHIL EWING, BYLINE: That's a great question, David. I don't know, as we're talking right now, what made the difference today for British authorities, for the Ecuadorian government and the Metropolitan Police. But as we heard a moment ago in your conversation, there were indications that there is a sealed indictment against Assange in the Eastern District of Virginia in the United States. We don't know the basis for that indictment, what charges prosecutors may try to prefer against him.
But he's no fan of the U.S. government. And the feeling is mutual, meaning that there are many potential causes they could select. And so far from the Justice Department, that case appears to remain sealed. There's no indication that any change is taking place there. But now that Assange is out of the embassy and in British custody, that could change in very short order.
GREENE: I mean, are we now going to see, do you think, an extradition to the United States, which really sets up just an enormous moment, does it not? I mean, set the context for this. I just heard the editor of WikiLeaks essentially saying that this is an indictment of journalism. But there are U.S. officials who say that leaking documents like this is against the law for a reason. I mean, this could really be a moment, if this comes to pass.
EWING: It would be a huge moment. That's exactly right. And Assange's supporters and the supporters of WikiLeaks have said all along that he is a reporter no different from any other and what he does is journalism, which is protected in the United States by the First Amendment and in many other countries by their press freedom laws.
The U.S. government and the opponents or critics of WikiLeaks have always said there is an important difference between reporting and dealing with sources and taking material that, in some cases, has allegedly been stolen, including by a foreign government, and putting it out there to try to achieve a political effect in the target country.
That's what prosecutors say took place in the 2016 presidential election when the Russian government - its spy agency, the GRU - used cyberattacks to steal emails and other data from targets in the United States, gave them to Assange, according to the special counsel's office - that of Robert Mueller - the Justice Department - special counsel. And then he released them to try and bring about devastating effect inside the election.
GREENE: Yeah, but we can't forget, I mean, all the ties - Assange, WikiLeaks - I mean, suggested in the whole Mueller investigation, which involves President Trump, of course. Has President Trump weighed in, or have there been signals from the Trump administration as to how they would handle this if he's actually extradited?
EWING: We're still waiting to learn how the U.S. government is going to respond to this. But you're right. One case that's been made is against the political consultant Roger Stone. Prosecutors say that he was a conduit between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks. And one question that could come out in his trial is whether he did anything more than just talk between those two sides. And...
GREENE: All right. NPR's Phil Ewing. Phil, we got to stop there. I'm so sorry. Thanks so much.

A Texas Rancher Describes The Border As A 'Transitional Land',www.npr.org,"Hugh Fitzsimmons, Texas rancher",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/711907914/the-borderlands-not-the-u-s-not-mexico-a-transitional-land,"Enlarge this image Rancher Hugh Fitzsimmons stands next to a pile of debris migrants left behind once they crossed into the United States.

Veronica G. Cardenas/Texas Public Radio Hugh Fitzsimmons is a rancher and writer. He raises bison at the Shape Ranch in the southwestern part of Dimmit County, about 10 miles away from the Mexican border, north of Laredo, Texas. He considers his ranch a world apart from the two nations divided by the Rio Grande.
""[It is] another country — that's what this borderland is all about. It is not the United States, and it is not Mexico. It is a transitional land,"" he said.
Fitzsimmons grew up on the ranch. He said one thing you should never do is come to someone's home after dark.
Several years ago, someone did exactly that. It was a cold and rainy night.
That's what I want to see a candidate talk about. Let the good people in, keep the bad people out. How complicated is that?
Hugh Fitzsimmons, Texas rancher
""I had a shotgun with me, and I leveled the shotgun at him when I opened the door, asked him what he wanted, and he said 'just water' was all he wanted,"" he said. ""I looked him in the eye and I thought to myself, 'This man is not going to bring me any harm.' ""
Fitzsimmons lowered his shotgun. He remembers that at that moment, the man fell to the ground and began crying.
""It became starkly apparent to me at that time that we don't take the time to really put ourselves in each other's shoes,"" he said.
Texas Public Radio YouTube It's a bright sunny Tuesday morning, and Fitzsimmons is ready for a drive. He had heard from one of his employees that migrants left behind some of their belongings in a thicket.
After a few minutes of driving past rows of olive trees, he arrived at the spot, stepped from the truck and walked towards the debris. Fitzsimmons walked slowly and steadily, keeping an eye out for any rattlesnakes, and towards a pile of discarded backpacks, clothes, toiletries and other items left behind by migrants.
When asked if he gets nervous walking alone on his thousands of acres of ranch land, he joked, ""I do, but my Colt-45 does not.""
""Once they make it across [the border] and they jettison all of this, then they will try to get picked up on the county road,"" he explained.
This isn't the first time Fitzsimmons has come across piles of discarded items left behind by migrants on his property. He said he's even seen syringes among the debris.

Fitzsimmons reviewed the pile, then walked back to his truck and drove home.
Fitzsimmons said he's not a fan of the idea of having a border wall. He wants the government to implement a guest worker program for migrants. He considers that to be a real solution to the immigration issue.
""That's what I want to see a candidate talk about,"" he said. ""Let the good people in, keep the bad people out. How complicated is that?"""
"Attorney General Barr Is Asking Reasonable Questions, Sen. Lankford Says",www.npr.org,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712151908/attorney-general-barr-is-asking-reasonable-questions-sen-lankford-says,"Rachel Martin talks to GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma about William Barr examining the origins of the Russia probe, and the impact of acting leadership roles. NPR's Mara Liasson weighs in.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
One investigation ends and another begins - maybe. Attorney General William Barr says he wants to examine whether the government was right to spy on members of President Trump's campaign. In Barr's words to Congress, quote, ""spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" end quote. Let's ask Senator James Lankford. He's a Republican from Oklahoma, and he joins us this morning.
Thanks so much for being with us, Senator.
JAMES LANKFORD: You bet. Glad to be with you this morning.
MARTIN: President Trump has said - ever since the Mueller report was wrapped up - that he believes it was an illegal investigation from the beginning. He called it an attempted coup. Do you agree with him?
LANKFORD: Well, I think that's what William Barr is going to ask questions to be able to determine - not if it's an attempted coup, but to be able to find out if there was anything inappropriate in the, as he describes, the upper echelons of the FBI - of how the investigation began. This is not a challenge to the FBI. This is a challenge to how they begin investigations.
And that's a reasonable question to ask. When we go through the process and be able to determine at the end of it, there was no what the president calls collusion - what is actually a conspiracy with a foreign government. It's a reasonable question to ask, how did it begin - and to be able to get those facts because we want to make sure it goes correctly for every future investigation.
MARTIN: The attorney general said yesterday that the justification he's giving for opening a new investigation is that the Trump campaign was spied on. We do know that the campaign foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, did have his phones tapped because the Department of Justice had concerns about his ties to Russia.
Are you telling me you believe that to be a legitimate basis to start an entirely new investigation?
LANKFORD: It'll be interesting to ask the question depending on who you ask, whether it's a legitimate basis to be able to look at and say they were campaign individuals that had their phones tapped, and we don't know what other information is out there at this point to be able to open that.
It is the same issue to say that there was this document - this dossier that has now been discredited - that at the time, the FBI had no information to support it. Only this allegation of this dossier - beginning that - a whole investigation began around that.
So the question is not were - was the president spied on? It's, how do investigations begin? And what is the appropriate way for an investigation begin on a presidential campaign? As we know very clearly, it's a pertinent question since we have 16 to 20 different Democrats that are now announcing for president.
At this point, we would not want President Trump to use his FBI to then be able to reach into those 16 to 20 presidential candidates now against him and to be able to use that information in the power of the FBI. So it's a fair question to be able to ask regardless of who's running for office.
MARTIN: I want to shift a bit and ask about the upheaval at the Department of Homeland Security. You actually chair the panel that oversees federal management of all government agencies. Three of the president's Cabinet members now serve in an acting capacity.
So there's the vacancy at Homeland Security, there's an acting leader there - also at the Pentagon, the Department of the Interior, also the top roles at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection - these are also vacant. Does that concern you that these people haven't been Senate confirmed?
LANKFORD: That is correct, and yes, it is a concern for me. Interior will be resolved today with a confirmed individual to be able lead Interior. The DHS now open and DOD open are especially concerning. And in DHS in particular, a lot of the other individuals, whether it be ICE or whether it be Secret Service and others, they're open as well and acting. All those need to be resolved as quickly as possible.
It appears that the White House was hesitating on filling some of the other roles at DHS until they made a determination on Secretary Nielsen. Obviously, they've made that determination. They'll have a new person at the top which will have the ability to be able to hire additional people in those other roles. But that takes even longer.
DHS, Department of Defense, attorney general, the - state - these were all folks that were placed in the earliest days of every administration because they're critical roles to be able to have Senate confirmed individuals rather than acting individuals. And I hope the White House will move expeditiously through that process.
MARTIN: The president says he made the changes at DHS though in order to move in a, quote, ""tougher direction."" What does that look like? And if a tougher direction means nominating someone to lead DHS who would take a tougher line on immigration, that person's going to have a hard time getting through a confirmation hearing.
LANKFORD: Well, the difficulty is for any secretary of DHS right now to be able to have any kind of stance because of the law that we're facing right now. President Obama's leadership from the Customs and Border Patrol was with us last week. We had individuals from President Trump's Border Patrol and some of the career folks with us
this week to be able to ask them questions. They say consistently, whether it was President Obama's time or whether it was in President's Trump time, in the Border Patrol, nothing changes until you deal with a change in law. Right now, the laws defer to any individual that's an adult that comes with a child. They get immediate entry into the country if they can just say, I have credible fear. They are coached in what to say...
MARTIN: Do you think that you should change?
LANKFORD: Well, that absolutely needs to change because this doesn't get better. We had a rule in 2014 - President Obama said, we're at a humanitarian crisis for those individuals coming through and families. We are twice that number now this year, and we're only halfway through the year.
We are absolutely being pushed back with a humanitarian rush at the border at this point. And until we know how to be able to manage this - this is a difficult issue for us as a country, to be able to resolve for any leader until we can actually change the law.
MARTIN: Do you believe the United States has a moral obligation to address the situation at the border and the root causes, for that matter, of the mass migration?
LANKFORD: So the past three years, we've spent about 600 to $650 million in Central America helping with humanitarian assistance, creating jobs and economic opportunity, working on government corruption, dealing with their court system, helping with drug interdiction. It's been a pretty strong stand...
MARTIN: But now President Trump wants to rescind that aid.
LANKFORD: No, I understand. He wants to rescind that aid because now we have a mass migration coming from one specific country - from Honduras especially. And he's pushing back on Honduras to say, we need your help to be able to help engage in this area. No president, regardless of where they are - they can choose to either not enforce the law or you'll have large numbers of individuals as families coming over.
That is a crisis dealing with children. And this is an issue that previous Secretary Nielsen had dealt with - the Central American governments - and was very clear that the leadership of the Central American governments say, we want our children back.
MARTIN: James Lankford is a Republican senator from Oklahoma. Thank you so much for your time, Senator.
LANKFORD: Glad to be with you this morning.
MARTIN: Let's turn now to NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, who was listening into that conversation. Mara, what did you hear in there that struck you?
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: What I heard that struck me is the senator saying the law is the problem, the law makes it too easy for people to claim credible fear and get asylum. So if the law is going to be changed, I don't see any movement at all between the White House and Congress to talk about legislation that could fix the problem.
In the past, the president has either been unwilling or unable to make a big deal with Congress, even before Democrats took over the House. When he would try to talk about some kind of immigration bill with Democrats, nothing came of it.
So it sounds like until they can figure out some kind of a compromise to do the things that the White House and Republicans want - in other words, make it harder to claim asylum and do some of the things that the Democrats want - maybe some kind of legalization for the so-called DREAMers, young people brought here as children illegally - I don't see what the solution is.
MARTIN: NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson.
Thanks, Mara.

'Her Smell' Is A Brilliant And Blistering Portrait Of A Musician Falling Apart,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711832339/her-smell-is-a-brilliant-and-blistering-portrait-of-a-musician-falling-apart?station=KXJZ_FM,"Critic Justin Chang says he couldn't tear his eyes away from Elisabeth Moss, who gives a spectacular performance as an out-of-control punk musician struggling with substance abuse.
TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. The actress Elisabeth Moss and the writer-director Alex Ross Perry previously collaborated on the independent dramas ""Listen Up Philip"" and ""Queen Of Earth."" Their new movie, ""Her Smell,"" stars Moss as an out-of-control punk rock musician. Dan Stevens, Virginia Madsen and Cara Delevingne play characters who bear witness to her self-destructive behavior. Film critic Justin Chang has this review.
JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: Between her superb performances on ""Mad Men,"" ""Top Of The Lake"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" Elisabeth Moss has been one of the best actors working in television for quite some time. Her excellent film work hasn't garnered as much attention, though, hopefully, that's about to change. She did steal a few scenes recently in Jordan Peele's hit horror picture, ""Us,"" and she gives her most arresting performance yet in her new movie, ""Her Smell,"" written and directed by her regular collaborator, Alex Ross Perry.
This is a brilliant but blistering film, and it might be too emotionally draining an experience to draw the audience it deserves. The nose-wrinkling title may not help, either. But you should see it for Moss' spectacular psychological meltdown of a performance as Becky Something, the lead singer and guitarist of an all-female punk rock band called Something She. Early on, we see a flashback to the group's '90s heyday, when Becky and her bandmates - well played by Agyness Deyn and Gayle Rankin - first landed on the cover of Spin magazine. But most of the movie unfolds much later, after fame, wealth and substance abuse have taken their toll, and Something She is now playing in smaller clubs rather than sold-out arenas. The story is divided into five acts, and while some of them are set months or even years apart, each one plays out unflinchingly in real time.
The first three acts are like the proverbial slow-motion train wreck, as Becky flails around backstage at grungy concert venues or in a recording studio verbally incinerating everyone in her midst. She lashes out at her bandmates, her manager and even her mother, who seems to be forever apologizing for having brought this monster into the world. She rips into her ex-boyfriend, played by Dan Stevens, with whom she has a daughter, and you can't help but fear for the poor child's safety whenever her mom picks her up and gives her a maniacal squeeze.
Everyone takes Becky's abuse with varying degrees of tolerance, exasperation and justified anger. About halfway through the movie, her bandmates have had enough and walk out of the studio where they've been struggling to record a new album. Three up-and-coming rockers arrive to record in the same studio. And Becky, always ready to turn her defeat into victory, draws these star-struck young women into her orbit.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""HER SMELL"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) We don't need to be here. I know we can give you your space. Like, this must not be super easy.
ELISABETH MOSS: (As Becky Something) Wrong. I am the heart and soul of this band. Well, hello, I named it after myself. I found those girlies, and they were not the first and they will not be the last. I put Something She together from the ashes of failed junk bands wanting to have something in my own name like God spewing mankind. That's ancient history and so are those ungrateful wenches who suckled at the teat of success that I placed upon their mouth. But before we embark on this journey, promise me one thing. Show me honesty, and I will do the same because that is the pillar of my music. So enough with this jibber-jabber, and let's rock. (Singing) And that sums it up in one big lump.
CHANG: ""Her Smell"" sounds like an endurance test but as raw and abrasive as Perry's warts-and-all filmmaking can be, I found it utterly mesmerizing in its sound and fury. And I couldn't tear my eyes away from Moss, who gives us an astonishing portrait of celebrity gone ferociously to seed. Her hair has been dyed peroxide blonde as if to evoke Courtney Love, and her tongue often darts in and out of her mouth when she talks, suggesting a snake addressing its prey. Moss makes Lady Gaga in ""A Star Is Born"" look like even more of a Cinderella saint among pop divas. And she eclipses Natalie Portman in ""Vox Lux"" for sheer backstage histrionics. Unlike ""Vox Lux,"" ""Her Smell"" doesn't present a lofty thesis about the dark roots of celebrity flameout. Becky is too thorny and complicated to be reduced to a symbol or a symptom of some deeper social malaise.
What's remarkable about Moss' performance, apart from her convincing display of Becky's musical talent, is that it's beautifully modulated, even at its most extreme. Becky grins and cackles like a demon one minute, then drops scarily silent the next. Even at her most unhinged, she's startlingly lucid and hyper eloquent. That might be the product of Perry's show-offy (ph) impulses as a writer, but Moss is so good, she sells them as the character's own.
In its final two acts, ""Her Smell"" leaps ahead to find Becky hushed and humbled at last after a few years of rehab, signaling the arrival of a significant transformation. The harshness and dissonance of Perry's filmmaking clears away, and the movie strikes a clean, beautiful chord, a moment of reckoning that feels honest, heartbreaking and completely earned. We see Becky Something with sudden clarity for the good friend she once was, the loving mother she might have been and the gifted musician she still is. ""Her Smell"" might not have a great title, but it gives redemption movies a good name.
GROSS: Justin Chang is a film critic for the LA Times. He reviewed ""Her Smell,"" starring Elisabeth Moss. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, my guest will be Henry Winkler. He won an Emmy for his portrayal of a self-important acting teacher in the HBO dark comedy series ""Barry,"" which is now in its second season. Winkler is known around the world for his role as the Fonz in the series ""Happy Days."" I hope you'll join us.

Assange Is Arrested After Being Evicted From Ecuadorean Embassy : NPR,www.npr.org,Rachel Martin,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712160152/assange-is-arrested-after-being-evicted-from-ecuadorean-embassy,"WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange was taken into custody in London by the police. He had been living at the embassy since 2012. Assange was under Ecuadorian protection for roughly 7 years.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange has been arrested in London this morning. The Metropolitan Police said they took him into custody after he was evicted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. That's where Assange has lived since 2012. He took refuge in that embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden and says he believes the Swedish authorities had intended to extradite him to the United States. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is with us now from London.
Ofeibea, this was quite the scene. Television cameras were present when he was removed from the Ecuadorian Embassy. What can you tell us?
OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Absolutely. I mean, it's so unusual that this sort of case should happen. Now, the British Metropolitan Police are keen to stress that they were invited in by the Ecuadorian Embassy to remove Julian Assange, and they effectively revoked his political asylum. As you know, in 2012, he was in court here in Britain. And he was given bail. He effectively skipped bail by bolting into the Ecuadorian Embassy here in Knightsbridge, a very tony part of London.
At the time, Julian Assange was in very good odor with the Ecuadorian leader of the time, but now he is not. And it looks as if the Ecuadorians feel that he has overstayed his welcome. He has leaked things about the current Ecuadorian president - time to go. That's why they say they called in the British police.
MARTIN: And even though the police were invited into the Ecuadorian Embassy, clearly, this happened with their green light. Julian Assange himself did not go voluntarily.
QUIST-ARCTON: No, Julian Assange, with a long, snowy beard, was escorted out. He didn't look as if he was resisting, but he was being held by very many police officers right into the van. And then he shouted something, which I didn't catch, on his way out. Now, I have to say that WikiLeaks is saying Ecuador has illegally terminated Assange's political asylum in violation of international law when they say he was arrested by the police inside the embassy at about 10 o'clock local time this morning.
MARTIN: I want to bring in another voice to the conversation - NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas. Ryan, this has been years in the making. Can you take us back? When was the first time the name Julian Assange came into the public consciousness?
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Well, WikiLeaks first started to pop up around 2008, but it really kind of entered the consciousness of Americans around 2010. And that's when WikiLeaks published a trove of U.S. diplomatic and military documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They published a video that the U.S. military was very angry about at the time that showed, essentially, a U.S. helicopter opening fire in Iraq on a building where there were men who appeared to be, perhaps, insurgents. But it turns out that a couple of them were, in fact, Iraqi journalists.
WikiLeaks really caused a stir with this release of documents. At the time, that really kind of catapulted the leader of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, into the public consciousness. And it really was the beginning of this kind of thorn in the side that WikiLeaks became for the U.S. government. And...
MARTIN: We should just note that this is what led to Chelsea Manning being indicted, right?
LUCAS: That's right. Chelsea Manning was one of the individuals who provided those documents - the military documents to WikiLeaks - leaked them to WikiLeaks. Manning actually pleaded guilty to some of the charges, received 35 years in prison over her role in that. President Obama commuted that sentence in the final days of his administration. But Manning has actually been in court recently over what appears to be a grand jury investigation of Julian Assange.
MARTIN: So, Ofeibea, he has been under the protection of the Ecuadorian Embassy for all these years. What has he been doing there?
QUIST-ARCTON: The Ecuadorians will tell you he's been talking far too much. That was in breach of his asylum provisions, which is why, eventually, he has been pushed out. But, Rachel, let me just say that there are several strands, of course, to the Julian Assange story because, of course, there's the U.S. - is he going to be extradited to there or not? Britain has said it will not extradite anyone to a country where they might face the death penalty, if they're not adequately assured, you know? And, of course...
MARTIN: Right.
QUIST-ARCTON: That's the case in the U.S., but don't forget Sweden. He was in the courts here because Sweden wanted him to be extradited on alleged rape and molestation charges, which were eventually dropped but may be revoked. So Julian Assange is wanted by very many people. He's hugely unpopular. The Ecuadorians have become hostile to him, although the former leader was sympathetic to him. You know, it's a sort of sunny, chilly day here in London. Julian Assange must be sweating buckets...
MARTIN: Right.
QUIST-ARCTON: ...Because, suddenly, he's now in the hands of the British police.
MARTIN: And it sounds like he doesn't have a lot of allies. I mean, Ryan, can you just give us the broad picture of the legal proceedings against Julian Assange here in the United States?
LUCAS: Well, for a long time, the Obama administration looked at possible charges against Julian Assange, but this is a tricky issue because WikiLeaks functions, in many ways - like its supporters will certainly say - like a media organization. It gets government secrets. It releases them to the public so that it can expose wrongdoing or malfeasance by the government. It says that it plays a critical role in doing these things. And this is something that Assange's lawyer in the United States, Barry Pollack, said today. He said that, you know, U.K. courts will need to resolve what appears to be an unprecedented effort by the United States seeking to extradite - and he says here - a foreign journalist to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information. This has been the line from WikiLeaks all along.
But it came out in November in a - in what appeared to be a mistake by U.S. federal prosecutors in Virginia - that Assange appears to be the subject of a sealed indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia. It's not exactly clear what charges may be brought against Assange. But, certainly, that is hanging over him. A spokesman for the Justice Department, Marc Raimondi, said today, we are aware of the reports that Julian Assange was taken into custody by United Kingdom authorities. And he just referred us to British authorities for comment regarding the arrest.
MARTIN: So do either of you - I mean, do we have any sense of, literally, what happens in the next hours or days?
QUIST-ARCTON: Certainly, you hear in Britain the authorities say they want Julian Assange to go through the British legal system because, of course, he skipped bail. You know, to many, he's a truth-seeker and a hero. To others, he's a menace, so question mark about what happens eventually and whether he'll end up in the U.S. or not.
MARTIN: All right. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton in London, NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas in Washington covering the London police, their arrest of co-founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange. Thanks to you both. We appreciate it.
LUCAS: Thank you.
QUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure - thank you.

Updated at noon ET
A military council has taken control of Sudan and arrested its longtime president, Omar al-Bashir, the country's military said Thursday. The move comes after opposition protesters recently gained new momentum in demanding al-Bashir leave office.
Sudan's defense minister, Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf, said the ""regime"" had been removed and its head arrested, as he announced the coup in a televised statement.
The minister said a transitional military council will rule the country for two years before any democratic elections will take place.
Sudan awoke early to word from the state news agency that the military would be making an announcement — news that sent thousands of people flooding to the site where protesters have been calling for al-Bashir's ouster for months.
There has been so much anticipation for this moment, NPR's Halima Gikandi reports , that ""some people were cheering but not really knowing what they were cheering for, and what was going to happen."" In one sign of change, activists said many of their colleagues had been released from state prisons. 14 Are Reported Killed In Sudan As Protesters Call For End To President's Rule
For protesters, the moment is bittersweet. Their primary demand has been for al-Bashir to step down. But their second demand was for a transitional government to move the country toward a democracy — and on Thursday, there were no indications of that happening.
The woman who has become an icon of the protests, Alaa Salah, tweeted that the military's announcement was unacceptable: ""The people do not want a transitional military council. Change will not happen with Bashir's entire regime hoodwinking Sudanese civilians through a military coup. We want a civilian council to head the transition."" The people do not want a transitional military council. Change will not happen with Bashir’s entire regime hoodwinking Sudanese civilians through a military coup. We want a civilian council to head the transition. #Sudan — Alaa Salah (@iAlaaSalah) April 11, 2019
It's unclear what will happen next, but many Sudanese fear a military takeover. And with a number of military forces and government agencies now free to assert themselves, the political picture seems more complicated than ever.
""On one hand, you have the army, which in the past few days has been seeming to protect protesters,"" Gikandi explains. ""And on the other hand, you have the national intelligence agency, which has been known to have done human rights violations. So what does it mean now for demonstrators to be seeing that the military is taking over, and installing a two-year transitional government, consisting of all of those various intelligence agencies?""
The opposition protests began in December over the price of bread, after the government ended subsidies. But the demonstrations soon spread to political concerns, and protesters demanded al-Bashir's ouster. Since Saturday, tens of thousands have maintained a protest vigil near the military headquarters in Sudan's capital, Khartoum.
The country's armed forces have been deployed around the capital's main roads and bridges, the BBC reports , and the city's main airport is closed.
The Sudanese Professionals Association, the civil society group that has led protests since December, had called on residents to mobilize on Thursday for a sit-in. The group tweeted that the military leadership must ""hand over power to the people.""
Sudan's current crisis ""cannot be addressed through another military coup,"" the group said . The SPA called for protests to continue until power is handed over to a civil transitional government.
""We will not accept Bashir's aides as part of the new situation,"" protester Mohamed Adam told Reuters. ""Those people have killed protesters.""
Media reports say the current swell of protesters is largely peaceful. The SPA said it advocated a peaceful ""approach to revolution and change.""
Sudanese security forces killed at least 14 people on Tuesday, NPR previously reported. But according to the BBC, the army stepped in to protect protesters from at least two attacks by forces loyal to al-Bashir.
His ouster comes just a week after Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned , following weeks of mass protests against his 20-year rule. Since 2011, a number of the Arab world's longest-serving leaders have lost power: Tunisia's Ben Ali, Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, Yemen's Ali Abdullah Saleh, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, and now Bouteflika and al-Bashir. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika Resigns Early Under Pressure
Now all eyes are on the Sudanese military, which has a long history of coups in the country.
Sudan gained independence from the U.K. and Egypt in 1956. Just two years later, chief of staff Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Abboud took power in a bloodless coup.
Riots and strikes in 1964 led to the military giving up control.
But Col. Gaafar Muhammad Nimeiri led a second military coup in 1969, according to the U.S. State Department's history . Nimeiri became prime minister, and the military banned political parties and dissolved parliament. He survived multiple coup attempts before succumbing to another military coup in 1985.
Gen. Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab led the military overthrow of Nimeiri in that coup. This time the military handed over power to a civilian government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi after elections in 1986. Protesters Across Sudan Continue To Call For President's Ouster
Al-Mahdi only lasted three years in power afterward. Al-Bashir, with the support of military officers and an Islamist political party, took power as leader of a junta in his own coup on June 30, 1989.
Al-Bashir had been in power almost 30 years. The International Criminal Court in the Hague issued warrants for al-Bashir's arrest in 2009 and 2010 for genocide and crimes against humanity in Sudan's Darfur region.
But those arrest warrants have not been carried out, with al-Bashir traveling to South Africa in 2015 and Chad in 2010 and returning home. Facebook"

Whitley Infiltrates The KKK : NPR",www.npr.org,Michael Schaub,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/711816519/in-freedoms-detective-a-flawed-but-remarkable-hiram-whitley-infiltrates-the-kkk,"Freedom's Detective The Secret Service, the Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America's First War on Terror
by Charles Lane
Hardcover, 348 Freedom's Detective Subtitle The Secret Service, the Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America's First War on Terror Author Charles Lane A mention of the Secret Service today might conjure up images of unsmiling men and women wearing sunglasses and dark suits, surrounding the president, perhaps discreetly touching their earpieces once in a while.
Or if you're a history buff, your thoughts might turn to 19th-century lawmen hot on the trail of counterfeiters. (Investigating financial crimes is still part of the agency's purview.)
But for a period of time toward the latter years of Reconstruction, the Secret Service took on another kind of mission: infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan, the white supremacist hate group that was founded in the months following the end of the Civil War. The operation that sought to end the Klan's terror campaigns were spearheaded by a man named Hiram C. Whitley, the subject of a fascinating new book, Freedom's Detective, by Washington Post editorial writer and former editor of the New Republic Charles Lane.
Whitley was perhaps the biggest thorn in the side of the early Klan, which likely came as a surprise to those who knew him in his early years. Born in 1832 in Maine, he started his career as a saloon owner with questionable business ethics; after being caught up in a scandal, he left New England for Lawrence, Kansas, in 1857. It was there that he was arrested for kidnapping after ambushing a convoy of white abolitionists and free black men, women and children on their way north, hoping to escape the ""slave hunters"" who had taken to terrorizing African Americans in the town.
After being kicked out of Kansas, the ""now-admitted betrayer and kidnapper of abolitionist whites and freedom-bound blacks"" found himself in Louisiana, where he managed to find work as a spy for the Union army. To be sure, it was a sea change for Whitley, as Lane readily admits:
""Whitley's amoral attitude toward the great issues of slavery and equality, so evident in his slave-hunting in Kansas ... seemed to be evolving. The cruelty inflicted on enslaved people in Louisiana was so ugly that it could shock even his conscience, and, in one case, spur him to action.""
Whitley reinvented himself as a law enforcement expert, and it turned out he was good at it, thanks in no small part to his instinctive understanding of psychology — as Lane writes, ""[H]e had developed a thoroughly jaded view of human nature, and how it could be manipulated to his advantage, honestly if possible — but through deception if necessary, and convenient."" He eventually earned a spot as one of the Secret Service's first directors, tracking down counterfeiters using a mix of ""deception, or force, [and] his own undeniable charm.""
Whitley's talents came in handy when the government decided it needed a group of lawmen to infiltrate a new terrorist organization that had sprung up in the South. ""The Ku Klux Klan began as a club for half a dozen bored Confederate Army veterans in tiny Pulaski, Tennessee,"" Lane writes. ""As the Republican plan for Reconstruction took hold, however, Klan 'dens' mutated into white supremacist vigilante groups targeting African Americans, Freedmen's Bureau officials, and white Republicans."" Whitley led a dazzlingly complex mission to penetrate the secret society, which resulted in an impressive number of white supremacists jailed for murder and conspiracy. (Sadly, but predictably, many of them didn't stay in prison for long.)
Lane's account of Whitley's infiltration of the Klan is endlessly gripping, and he recounts it with an impressive narrative tension. He also does an excellent job placing the operation in historical context, chronicling the racism and resentment that built up in the South following the end of the Civil War. It can be difficult, though necessary, to read his descriptions of the Klan's reign of terror, but Lane is careful not to sensationalize the inhuman violence that was the group's stock-in-trade.
He's also careful not to lionize Whitley, who was, to say the least, a flawed person. ""He could be a con artist, and a bully,"" Lane writes, ""and those aspects of his character had gotten him into one tight spot after another, then helped get him out."" They would also bring about his downfall — Whitley's time in government was ended by a scandal so unnecessary and harebrained, it almost defies belief.
The best history books are often the most unexpected ones, stories of relatively obscure people who changed society in some way, big or small. Whitley certainly isn't a household name, and never was, but his vision of the Secret Service as a national investigative force dedicated to rooting out a variety of crimes helped make the agency what it is today. Lane proves himself to be an excellent researcher and writer, and Freedom's Detective is a captivating account of a flawed but remarkable man."

Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment. Amy Sisk / StateImpact Pennsylvania Beatrice Dias with Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab is working with partners in Louisville, Kentucky to build a base of users for Smell MyCity.
Some Allegheny County residents use a smartphone app to report foul smells in their communities, and a new version of that app is now available to the rest of the country.
For three years, people in the Pittsburgh area have documented their experiences with odors with just a few taps of a finger via Smell PGH. A screen shot of Smell PGH on April 4 shows numerous reports of foul odors in the community.
The app also allows users to view a map showing where others have made reports.
“We wanted to build a sense of community,” said Beatrice Dias, project director at Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab, which built the app in collaboration with local groups concerned about air quality. “You’re not alone in your experiences with pollution; all your neighbors are experiencing the same thing. That validation and that power of a community voice was important.”
Since 2016, the app has sent more than 20,000 reports to the Allegheny County Health Department, which analyzes them to identify trends.
Now, the lab is rolling out a new version of the app called Smell MyCity for people across the country, with support from the green cleaning products company Seventh Generation.
Anyone in the United States can use the app, but CMU is customizing some features for certain cities. The developers are working first with partners in Louisville, Ky. to build a base of users.
Data from the app is available for anyone to download , and some groups already plan to use it.
Ted Smith, deputy director of the Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute at the University of Louisville’s medical school said university researchers will compare health data such as hospital admissions to smell reports to identify potential correlations.
“I really do hope that helps residents see that there’s somebody that actually does care about the thing they’re afraid of,” he said. “They’re afraid, potentially, that there’s a toxic emission that could be bad for their health.”
Odors in Louisville tend to come from the area’s rubber industry, coal power plants and a slaughterhouse, he said.
Like in Allegheny County, residents of Louisville can already go online to report bad odors to a local agency responsible for regulating air pollution, but they cannot see the breadth of reports across the community or easily find out what action, if any, officials take in response.
The community is cognizant of pollution problems. Smith said more than 1,000 people took part in a recent study where they carried GPS-enabled inhalers to use during asthma attacks.
“It was a tremendous project that showed us that air pollution was the single biggest predictor of asthma exacerbations,” Smith said.
Before CMU launched the Smell MyCity app, Smith’s high school son used code available online from Smell PGH to build a similar version for Louisville. He later did an internship with the CREATE Lab to help develop the national version.
Dias said the lab is also working with partners in Portland, Ore. and will likely promote the app there next. Tags"
"As baby boomers retire, power companies look to build the next generation of workers",stateimpact.npr.org,Amy Sisk,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2019/04/10/as-baby-boomers-retire-power-companies-look-to-build-the-next-generation-of-workers/,"
Louis Charlier of Beaver Area High School is participating in the first student bootcamp hosted by Duquesne Light and the Community College of Allegheny County. Amy Sisk / StateImpact Pennsylvania April 10, 2019 | 02:36 PM As baby boomers retire, power companies look to build the next generation of workers Amy Sisk Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.
At a Duquesne Light facility in Pittsburgh, 10 high school students hunched over sheets of paper, pens in hand, as they sketched their dream homes.
“I’m just drawing an A-frame house with a garage on the side, a nice front porch,” said Louis Charlier of Beaver Area High School on a recent Thursday.
The students had to draw their homes from three separate angles: straight on, from the side and a bird’s-eye view. This was a lesson on blueprints, something they will become familiar with if they pursue careers with the electric power company.
The teens arranged their schedules to take this class for a few hours each afternoon for several weeks as part of Duquesne Light’s new student bootcamp.
“They take classes around mathematics, reading comprehension, and we’re also doing soft-skill classes on interview skills, resume-writing, as well as an OSHA 10 class and a CPR class,” said Selenna Gregg, manager of talent acquisition for Duquesne Light.
The bootcamp is a new effort by Duquesne Light, which serves Allegheny and Beaver counties, and the Community College of Allegheny County to prepare students for the Construction and Skilled Trade Selection System exam. Passing the test is the first step in applying for a skilled trade job at the company.
The camp could help shape the next generation of workers tasked with keeping the lights on. New workers for electric power companies and other utilities like natural gas and water are in demand across Pennsylvania and the rest of the country.
“The baby boomers are starting to retire,” said Gladys Brown, chairman of Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commission.
The PUC estimates 28 percent of the state’s utility workforce will retire in the next five years.
With them goes institutional knowledge that needs to be passed along to new workers, Brown said.
“You need those people to provide for that bridge, that transition to train them,” she said.
While the situation is a challenge for utilities, she said it’s not dire. The PUC keeps close tabs on utilities’ performance to ensure that outages don’t become too frequent and that response times are reasonable.
“We want to make sure you have the appropriate skilled, trained personnel on-hand to deal with providing that reliable service,” Brown said.
Gregg said Duquesne Light has experienced the same retirement trend as the rest of the industry. Its training programs have helped to replace those workers.
Each year, as many as 24 people go through the 10-month electrical distribution technology program at CCAC, which prepares them for careers at Duquesne Light. They could work in the power supplier’s operation center or have a job that takes them into the field installing and repairing lines and other equipment associated with the company’s electricity systems. Duquesne Light is assisting with drivers education training for bootcamp participants who do not know how to drive. If the students pursue careers with the power utility, they may need to drive bucket trucks, like this one pictured at the utility’s Preble Service Center in July 2018.
Duquesne Light plans to host another bootcamp this summer for high school students, who could go on to the CCAC program when they graduate. The power company is also holding a similar bootcamp for high school teachers.
“If teachers don’t know about the positions or some of the technical things that are out there for their students, they’re not able to talk to their students and share those experiences,” said Debbie Killmeyer, dean of workforce at CCAC.
It was a teacher at Charlier’s school who heard about the bootcamp from a Duquesne Light employee, and suggested he apply.
Charlier said he does not want to go to a traditional college.
“I’d rather just go straight into the workforce, do a trade or something along those lines,” he said.
On Day 2 of the camp, something Charlier heard from one of the company’s executives caught his attention.
“He told us that this job opportunity would be like having a $3-million lottery ticket,” he said.
That’s how much the students could make over the course of their careers if they work for Duquesne Light. Gregg said the starting salary for crafts-related jobs at the company is $65-$85,000, plus overtime.
“There’s plenty of jobs out there that pay really well and you don’t need a 4-year-degree for, and these jobs are needed,” Charlier said.
Power companies from Duquesne Light to First Energy to PECO are active in recruiting new workers, running programs and internships to give prospective employees hands-on experience.
The PUC is working on this issue too, having launched a utility careers campaign to promote the industry to young people, military veterans and others by talking up the positions at job fairs and other events. Brown said the PUC has involved a number of state agencies, schools and utility companies in the effort.
“I was realizing the magnitude of the retirement of our workers in-house, and I said let’s reach out to our utilities because I’m assuming they’re dealing with some of the same things,” she said.
For people considering utility careers, the next step after the Construction and Skilled Trade exam could make it or break it: pole school.
“A lot of people come in and they don’t realize if they’re scared of heights or if they’re able to climb to the top of a pole and then be able to work with their hands,” Gregg said.
Charlier’s not too worried. He’s looking forward to the challenge.
“I did well on all the practice exams, so I feel like I’m going to pass that test,” he said. “I feel like I can climb a pole.” Explainers"

Lisa Olson spoke about how difficult it has been for her family to cope with the lingering effects of the trauma.
Wilfredo Lee/AP Families of Parkland school shooting victims are filing at least 22 lawsuits against Broward County's school board, sheriff's office and more, alleging they failed to prevent the attack that left 17 people dead and another 17 injured.
Attorneys representing families of those who were killed or wounded at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, 2018, argue several organizations and individuals were responsible for the massacre. In addition to the school district and sheriff's office, other targets in the lawsuits, announced Wednesday, are Henderson Behavioral Health, which provided mental health services to confessed shooter Nikolas Cruz; former Stoneman Douglas security guard Andrew Medina, who was the first to see Cruz on campus but did not call a ""code red"" lockdown; and former Broward Sheriff's Office Deputy Scot Peterson, the school resource officer who hid during the shooting rather than entering the school building to confront the shooter.
Read the documents at WLRN: Families Of Parkland Shooting Victims' Lawsuits Allege Negligence
The attorneys said the families have been working over the 14 months since the shooting to reach a settlement — a fund that would provide millions in compensation for each family. But the lawyers say the school board has been lobbying against legislation at the state Capitol, where lawmakers are now holding their annual session.
A spokeswoman for the school board refuted the assertion that the district has lobbied against the legislation creating a compensation fund for families.
Parkland School Shooting, One Year Later 'We Live With It Every Day': Parkland Community Marks 1 Year Since Massacre National Suicides In Parkland Leave Community In Shock Chief Public Information Officer Kathy Koch said in a statement the district hired a firm that helped to write the legislation and has been lobbying in favor of it. She said the district consulted families when conceptualizing the fund. The school board voted to include the legislation on its official list of priorities for the 2019 legislative session.
As for the lawsuits, both the school board and the sheriff's office responded that they do not comment on litigation.
Joseph DiRuzzo, an attorney who represents Peterson, said he is confident that the lawsuits ""lack merit,"" and he plans to fight them ""vigorously."" The attorney representing Medina declined to comment.
One of the plaintiffs is Mitchell Dworet, who said he is in a ""very unique position"" because one of his sons was killed and the other was injured.
Mental Health Dealing With Trauma After A Mass Shooting — Over The Long Term ""My son is Nicholas Dworet. He was killed in the third room,"" Dworet said. ""My other son is Alexander Dworet. He was in the first room. He was injured, he saw children killed and he lost his brother. This is a life sentence for me. It's every day.
This is not normal. This is not right. There were failures. I want to be in court. I want to see who, what, where, how, why.
Mitchell Dworet
""I want accountability. I'm not going away. I'm in for the long haul,"" Dworet said. ""This is not normal. This is not right. There were failures. I want to be in court. I want to see who, what, where, how, why.""
Lisa Olson — whose son, William, was shot and survived — also spoke Wednesday about how difficult it has been for her family to cope with the lingering effects of the trauma.
""My son didn't go to school today. He couldn't, and we have many days like that now,"" Olson said.
""It's a daily struggle,"" she said. Referring to the survivors, she said: ""They are not the people they were before Feb. 14.""
Another plaintiff is Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter, Alyssa, was killed. Alhadeff was elected to the Broward School Board last November.
When asked about Alhadeff's potential conflict of interest — she is apparently participating in lawsuits against the school board on which she sits — her attorney, Bob Kelley, said: ""She obviously cannot be involved in any kind of discussion about a settlement or resolution of this case.""
Under Florida law, the legislature must approve any local government settlements that exceed $300,000. The process of passing these bills often takes years, and many are never approved. State Sen. Lauren Book, a Broward County Democrat, filed three bills this session that would create compensation funds for families of Parkland shooting victims.
The attorneys representing the families said these bills could be used to ensure approval of the settlement during this legislative session, which ends May 3, if the parties reach an agreement in time.
Kelley said it's not too late to reach a settlement and pass a bill this session, if the school board and other parties are willing to negotiate.
""There's still three weeks left in the legislative session, and everybody knows that almost everything happens at the very last minute, on the very last night, in the very last hour of the legislative session,"" Kelley said. ""So they still have an opportunity to do the right thing by these families ... and all these lawsuits could be dismissed.""
Without a settlement, the lawyers predict the lawsuits could take years to resolve, cost millions of dollars and require survivors of the shooting to provide depositions.
Kelley argued it's more financially responsible for local governments to settle.
""Why would they go out and spend millions of dollars on attorneys' fees to defend cases that they know they're going to lose? And that the verdicts that the juries are going to return are going to be far and above anything that these people would take to settle these things?
""They do have a fiduciary duty, and they're not fulfilling it,"" he said.
The attorneys didn't specify how much money the families are seeking in compensation."

A group called Market March Movement is working to end street harassment in shopping districts across the country.
FrÃ©dÃ©ric Soltan/via Getty Images Reuben Medlyne likes going to the local market in the Yaba district of Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, to shop for clothes — especially the secondhand items that are a real bargain.
But there's a risk involved.
""Whenever I visit Yaba Market, the traders start touching and harassing me immediately [after] I alight from a bus or a bike. I can't help but reply 'no touch me again,' "" says Medlyne, who's a student at the University of Lagos.
It's a common occurrence. In a poll of 105 women from February 2019, The Guardian Nigeria found that three quarters of those surveyed said they had experienced harassment at Nigerian markets.
The traders say that's just the way they drum up business. ""We are hustlers, so sometimes we need to touch,"" says Victor Robinson, who sells ladies' trousers at Yaba.
Goats and Soda Why Do Men Harass Women? New Study Sheds Light On Motivations Another trader, Emmanuel Ugorji, says women bring on the harassment. ""There are women that dress indecently, prompting the touching,"" he says. ""So it's a sign they want men to touch them.""
But now there's pushback. Last October, Damilola Marcus started the Market March Movement to bring an end to sexual harassment at Yaba and other markets across the country.
Marcus, an architect who runs a design studio in Lagos, was herself fed up with the catcalling and touching at the market.
In December, Marcus staged a protest called ""Market March"" at Yaba Market. Women walked around the market wearing yellow T-shirts and signs inscribed with messages like ""stop touching us."" The event trended on social media throughout the day.
""I always knew it happens and it was a major problem and it would not be okay if everyone sits back and [does] not do anything about it. I believe in the power of protest and the belief that citizens have the right to protest,"" she says.
As the women protested, chanting ""stop touching us,"" some furious male traders threw stones and sachets of water at them.
""We must touch,"" the men chanted in response.
According to Lagos state criminal law, sexual harassment is a felony, subject to three years imprisonment. But Marcus laments the lack of implementation by the police.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:
WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange was arrested in London this morning. The Metropolitan Police said they took him into custody after he was evicted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has lived since 2012. And the U.S. Justice Department has just announced charges against him. And that's we're going - where we're going to begin our coverage. We have NPR's justice correspondent Ryan Lucas with us. Hi, Ryan.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi, there.
GREENE: What exactly is the U.S. government charging Assange with?
LUCAS: Well, first off, this indictment literally was just unsealed minutes ago. So I'm still in the process of digesting it. But what Assange has been charged with - this is a grand jury indictment. And basically it boils down to that he is charged with helping Chelsea Manning, who at the time worked - was with the U.S. Army. He was an intelligence - she was an intelligence analyst with the U.S. Army, and that - the indictment alleges that Assange helped Manning crack a password to get classified information out of a U.S. government database. So the actual charge is conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. And this relates to, again, getting - helping Chelsea Manning break into a government database.
GREENE: OK. So this is the U.S. government - I mean, again, I know you're just reading through this - but essentially saying that this goes beyond WikiLeaks just dispensing information that it receives. These allegations are that WikiLeaks was actually involved in cracking into U.S. government documents.
LUCAS: Right. This does not appear to pertain to or relate to actually publishing information. This is about WikiLeaks taking an active role in attempting to get such information from the U.S. government and taking an active role in essentially stealing it, is what they're saying.
GREENE: Obviously, I mean, we're just gathering dots right now, not connecting them. But the timing of all of this, we have the Ecuadorian government now evicting Julian Assange from the embassy. We have British authorities arresting him. Now we have the U.S. government coming out with these charges. What - do we know whether this was all coordinated? Is there any way to try and understand the timing of all this at this point?
LUCAS: Well, it would certainly look as though the timing of Assange's arrest and the unsealing of the indictment are certainly related. What was all going on behind the scenes, we don't know. We're not privy to that at this point in time. But we certainly know that for a long time, the U.S. government has been looking at possible charges against Assange. We know that it was tricky because of concerns about freedom of the press. There are certainly supporters of WikiLeaks who argue that the organization is essentially functioning as a media organization does. It's getting information about alleged government wrongdoing and putting a spotlight on that, making it public.
But the U.S. government for some time has also made clear that it has its own issues with Assange, with WikiLeaks. Mike Pompeo, when he was CIA director, actually called WikiLeaks a non-state hostile intelligence agency. And there have been a number of releases that Wikileaks have done over the years that have angered the U.S. government, starting with Chelsea Manning's release back in 2010 all the way up into 2016 and the role that the U.S. intelligence agencies - well, the role that WikiLeaks played in releasing hacked emails during the 2016 campaign, Democratic emails. And special counsel Robert Mueller has said, in one of his indictments, essentially that WikiLeaks worked with the Russian government on that.
GREENE: Yeah, just a reminder that, I mean, Julian Assange is related in many ways to so much of the news we've seen in the United States. That's NPR's Ryan Lucas. Ryan, thanks so much. We really appreciate it.
LUCAS: My pleasure.
GREENE: All right, I want to bring in another voice here. It is Julian Assange's colleague, Glenn Greenwald. He's on the line. He's a longtime backer and proponent of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. Glenn, thanks for taking the time this morning.
GLENN GREENWALD: Sure. I'm not sure why you introduced me as a colleague of Julian Assange since I'm not actually that. I've reported on him as a journalist. But I'm happy to be with you.
GREENE: Oh, well, tell - I would love if you could actually, just so people understand, characterize your relationship with him and with WikiLeaks.
GREENWALD: Sure. I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has reported on WikiLeaks over the years, just like NPR has. And beyond that, I don't have any relationship with WikiLeaks or Julian Assange. And I'm not sure why you're trying to imply otherwise.
GREENE: Have you been in contact with him today or leading up to this?
GREENWALD: No.
GREENE: And what do you think of the charges against him?
GREENWALD: Well, I agree with the Obama Justice Department, the Washington Post editorial of 2011, the Guardian editorial from yesterday and the consensus of press freedom groups around the world, which is that prosecuting Julian Assange in connection with publishing secret documents that showed U.S. war crimes is one of the gravest threats to press freedom possibly imaginable.
And the indictment that the DOJ issued says, among other things, that Assange, for example, encouraged Manning to get more documents than she had originally provided, which is something journalists - I don't know if you work with sources or not in your reporting, but I do. This is something journalists do every day. They say, thanks for getting me this. Is there any way you can get more of that? So to criminalize that, encouraging sources to get more classified documents, is to criminalize journalism. And I would hope no journalist would stand behind the Trump administration as it tries to do that.
GREENE: So you believe even if the charges that we just heard about from the U.S. government - even if they are true, that Julian Assange was involved in actually cracking into the U.S. government and helping Manning, that would not go beyond the definition of journalism.
GREENWALD: Well, it depends what they were able to prove. The Obama Justice Department tried for years to find evidence that Assange did more than work with Manning in the capacity that journalists typically work with sources and concluded there was no evidence to be able to do that. They impaneled the grand jury in 2010 and spent years looking. And so there was no evidence for that.
Obviously, if Julian Assange actually hacked into a government database, that's just standard criminal hacking. But the indictment doesn't say that. The indictment says that Julian worked with Chelsea Manning and encouraged her in order to get these documents, which again, that's something journalists do all the time. We'll have to see what the evidence says. Obviously hacking is a crime, and just because you're a journalist doesn't mean you get to do that. But encouraging a source or working with a source to get documents is pure investigative journalism.
GREENE: And if we set the larger debate about - about press freedom and how dangerous, as you say, this could be for press freedom - and, you know, a lot of disagreement out there over those issues. I just - could we look at what happened specifically with Julian Assange in terms of the law? I mean, the British say he broke the law by skipping bail. You have Swedish prosecutors who say that their case is not necessarily closed on allegations of sexual assault. And you have the Ecuadorian government saying he no longer deserved asylum. So is there anything that is outside the bound of legal processes taking place today, bringing him into custody?
GREENWALD: Well, the - Ecuador had provided Julian Assange with asylum because they were concerned that his arrest would be used as a pretext to ship him to the U.S. to be prosecuted in connection with the publication of documents and said that that would be a persecution of him for his political liberties. And that's true - as true today as it was seven years ago.
What changed is that the president of Ecuador for six years, who said to the U.S. and the U.K., we're not going to be bullied by you, was term-limited out of office. The new president is much more submissive. The Trump administration - administration has spent a year and a half trying to bully and coerce and pressure the Ecuadorian government to withdraw its asylum. So yeah, I think threatening a foreign government to withdraw legally recognized asylum is a pretty severe violation of international law.
GREENE: Do you have evidence of that? I mean, do you have actual reporting that the Trump administration has exerted that kind of pressure?
GREENWALD: There's tons of reporting about that. If you go to Google and type, Trump administration pressures Ecuador over Assange, you'll find every major media outlet in the world. I don't know how you missed it. Probably NPR has reported it too, saying exactly that.
GREENE: Journalist Glenn Greenwald, thanks so much. We appreciate your time this morning.
GREENWALD: Sure, good to be with you.
GREENE: I want to turn now to NPR's media correspondent, David Folkenflik, who's on the line. And David, I mean, the definition of journalism and whether this arrest is a case of press freedom being at great risk or whether the U.S. government has a legitimate right to go after someone who they accuse of cracking into secret government documents, this is quite a moment and could be quite a moment, as we follow this case, if he is indeed extradited to the United States.
DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Yeah, I think that you're seeing right now questions about how to define, how to think about Julian Assange. And, you know, I did a piece - call it nearly nine years ago - in which we said, is he a journalist, or is he a whistleblower? And those - that's still a valid question. We can get into that in a second. You know, the government is laying on the question of whether in some ways he's been an actor for, you know, foreign powers. And that's the Russians.
So if you think back to, you know, the Chelsea Manning leaks and leaks like that, he was really against, early on, the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He accused American troops of war crimes. He released certain kinds of files to the public and didn't get the kind of pop he wanted, in some ways, because they were unmediated. And that is they weren't vetted and vouched for by outside groups. So he worked, in certain instance, in the Manning case, with The New York Times, EL PAIS in Spain, The Guardian in - in the U.K. And I believe it was Der Spiegel in Germany...
GREENE: Right.
FOLKENFLIK: ...To get credibility for that. And one of the frustrations he had was that there was fact-checking. And they checked with various government agencies to see if there would be actual harm done to, say, troops if certain things were published and posted. He really bristled at that. So again, was he a whistleblower? Was he a journalist? He called himself editor-in-chief. And yet, there is a journalistic function being served by the Chelsea Manning leaks, as then-President Obama himself grudgingly acknowledged.
GREENE: So where do you see this case going from here? What will you be following from - from the stuff that you cover?
FOLKENFLIK: Well, I think in some ways Glenn Greenwald is absolutely right in saying it depends what authorities in Britain and, particularly, the U.S. can prove. If he is shown to have actively been involved in hacking of documents and he was sort of an anarchistic hacker queuing up in Australia, then that's against the law. If he was trying to get information from a source, that's a much more problematic place for prosecutors to go. And authorities know that.
GREENE: NPR's David Folkenflik, one of the voices this morning as we cover the arrest of Julian Assange in London this morning. He's now facing charges in the United States. David, thanks a lot.
FOLKENFLIK: You bet.

The president addressed an audience at the International Union of Operating Engineers International Training and Education Center in Texas.

President Trump stood in front of an audience of operating engineers in Crosby, Texas, on Wednesday and promised to make it easier for them to lay pipe.
""Nobody in the world can do what you folks do,"" Trump said to applause from the assembled crowd. ""And we're going to make it easier for you.""
After speaking at the International Union of Operating Engineers International Training and Education Center, Trump signed two executive orders aiming to make it easier for companies to build oil and gas pipeline projects — and harder for states to block them.
""Republican lawmakers and energy groups have long accused blue states of blocking pipeline projects using a section of the Clean Water Act,"" NPR's Nathan Rott reports for our Newscast unit. ""One of Trump's executive orders will aim to weaken that power. Whether that actually happens will remain to be seen. Executive orders only do so much — and lawsuits are sure to follow.""
Trump's pipeline orders mark his latest effort to push for infrastructure projects his administration says will ""unleash American energy."" 'Our History Is The Future' Puts Standing Rock In Broader Native American Story
In early 2017, less than a month into Trump's presidency, his administration reversed an Obama administration decision to deny a key permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline and instead approved its construction. Just last month, Trump issued a second presidential permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline after an earlier permit was overturned by a U.S. district judge. His latest permit is also being challenged in court.
One of Trump's new orders calls for the EPA to review a section of the Clean Water Act that requires applicants seeking federal permits for energy infrastructure projects that might pollute protected waters to get certification from the states where any potential contamination could happen.
Federal guidance and regulations regarding that requirement — which gives states a direct role in building projects — are described in the executive action as ""outdated"" and responsible for ""confusion and uncertainty"" that slows down infrastructure projects.
The order also seeks to make it easier to transport natural gas when a pipeline can't be used.
The action stipulates an update to a Department of Transportation safety regulation on facilities that store natural gas in its liquid state so that it can be carried long distances when pipeline transport isn't possible. The change would allow transport of the liquefied natural gas in approved railroad tank cars.
Trump's order also instructs the secretary of labor to investigate whether there are ""discernible trends"" in how certain managers of ERISA -protected investment-based retirement funds invest in the energy sector.
The second order gives the president the exclusive responsibility to ""issue, deny, or amend"" permits for infrastructure projects that cross international boundaries of the United States.
""The president — not the bureaucracy — will have sole authority to make the final decision when we get caught up in problems,"" Trump said.
Trump said he's ending a ""war on American energy."" But critics say the orders are an overstep of federal authority.
""Trump's developing an addiction to executive orders that rubber-stamp these climate-killing projects,"" Brett Hartl, the government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, told The Associated Press.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called Trump's first order a ""gross overreach of federal authority"" that undermines the state's ability to ""protect our water quality and our environment.""
""States must have a role in the process for siting energy infrastructure like pipelines,"" Cuomo said in a statement .
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued a joint statement with state Attorney General Bob Ferguson: ""We intend to challenge any attempt by the administration to illegally constrain Washington's authority to protect our state's natural resources.""
Inslee is making climate change a top issue in his run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.
But people who support the president's move say states' interference in oil and gas pipeline projects hurts consumers.
""When states say 'no' to the development of natural gas pipelines, they force utilities to curb safe and affordable service and refuse access to new customers including new businesses,"" said Karen Harbert, the president and CEO of the American Gas Association, in a statement .
Trump stopped in Crosby for the signing on his way to meet with supporters and fundraisers in Houston.
While he had the Crosby audience's attention, Trump took the opportunity to thank part of his base.
""I know you well, and I also know who most of you voted for,"" the president said. ""And I appreciate it."""

Updated at 12:26 p.m. ET
The U.S. government has denied entry to Palestinian activist Omar Barghouti, co-founder of the BDS movement, which urges boycott, divestment and sanctions to pressure Israel on security and settlement policies in the West Bank.
Barghouti was at Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel on Wednesday when airline staff informed him that he wouldn't be flying despite holding valid travel documents, according to the Arab American Institute, a Washington-based advocacy group that arranged the trip. He was told that U.S. immigration officials had ordered the U.S. consul in Tel Aviv to deny him permission to enter the United States.
""Barghouti was not provided an explanation for his denial of entry beyond 'immigration matter,' "" the Arab American Institute said in a statement. The group said Barghouti typically faces travel hurdles from Israel — not the United States. He has a master's degree from Columbia University and spent a decade in the U.S. in the 1980s.
A State Department official told NPR, ""Visa records are confidential under U.S. law; therefore, we cannot discuss the details of individual visa cases.""
Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs, which handles Israel's fight against the BDS movement, said it had no connection to the matter. And Israel's Interior Ministry said it had no knowledge of the U.S. action.
Barghouti had scheduled a speaking tour that included stops at Harvard and New York University, meetings with Washington policymakers and an appearance at a bookstore in Philadelphia owned by professor Marc Lamont Hill, whose CNN pundit contract was terminated last November over controversial remarks he made in support of Palestinian rights. At the end of the trip, Barghouti planned to attend the wedding of his daughter, who lives in the United States.
BDS supporters see Barghouti's movement, which draws inspiration from a similar campaign against apartheid-era South Africa, as a nonviolent way to protest Israel's military occupation of the West Bank, construction of settlements which most of the world views as illegal, and other human rights concerns. The approach has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, with dozens of student, academic and labor groups announcing support for BDS, and artists such as Lorde and Lauryn Hill canceling shows in Israel.
Those moves worry Israel, which considers BDS a cover for a more nefarious campaign to delegitimize or even destroy the country. BDS critics on Twitter had blasted Barghouti's speaking tour as giving a platform to anti-Semitism. In the United States, more than two dozen states have adopted laws to punish companies that boycott Israel. This week, according to a report in The Hill, House Republicans are launching a discharge petition to force a vote on Senate legislation ""that would allow state and city governments to penalize entities that seek to boycott, divest from or sanction Israel.""
Arab American Institute President James Zogby said in the statement that denying Barghouti entry deprives Americans of an important voice in the debate over BDS.
""It is disturbing that policymakers and the American people will not have the opportunity to hear from Omar directly about his views,"" Zogby said.
Barghouti, who lives in Israel with permanent residency status, previously has faced obstacles to traveling. In 2016, Israeli authorities refused to renew his travel documents, citing evidence that Barghouti spent most of his time in the West Bank, Israeli outlets reported. Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri was quoted as saying Barghouti is ""using his resident status to travel all over the world in order to operate against Israel in the most serious manner.""
In that instance, Barghouti told the newspaper Haaretz that the impediments to his travel were ""clearly political"" and potentially ""a first step toward revoking my permanent residency."" He has also reportedly faced travel denial because of an Israeli investigation in connection with alleged tax evasion. The ban was temporarily lifted in 2017 and Barghouti traveled to Yale University to receive the Gandhi Peace Award from a Connecticut activist group. Yale issued a statement stressing that it was unaffiliated with the award but honors requests from the community to ""invite speakers and groups to campus in accordance with our mission of fostering the free exchange of ideas.""
In February, the watchdog group Amnesty International demanded that Israel ""end the arbitrary travel ban on human rights defender Omar Barghouti."" Israel later issued Barghouti a travel document. He holds a U.S. visa that is valid through January 2021.
Barghouti is among a growing list of international figures barred entry to the U.S. by the Trump administration. Earlier this month, U.S. authorities revoked the visa of the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, reportedly over her attempts to investigate alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.
Last month, dozens of women — primarily from African and Middle Eastern nations that fall under the administration's travel ban — were denied visas to attend a United Nations women's conference. In accordance with a 70-year-old treaty, the United States, as host nation, is obliged to admit visitors to the U.N. headquarters in New York.
In some cases, there is a clear political or security backstory to the denial of entry. In others, the reasons are opaque. In 2017, an Afghan all-girls team of students that was invited to a robot-building contest was denied entry. U.S. authorities eventually issued visas for the girls after a backlash from human rights groups.

Police have arrested the son of a Louisiana sheriff's deputy as a suspect in connection with three historically black churches that were torched in recent days.
Officials identified the suspect as Holden Matthews, a 21-year-old white male from St. Landry Parish, a small community about an hour west of Baton Rouge.
""I don't know what this young man's motive was. I don't know what was in his heart,"" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a news conference Thursday morning. ""But I can say it cannot be justified or rationalized. These were evil acts.""
Matthews was charged with state crimes on three counts of simple arson of a religious building, said Louisiana State Fire Marshal H. ""Butch"" Browning. Each charge has a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.
St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz told reporters that the suspect's father, Deputy Roy Matthews, ""was shocked and hurt, as any father would be.""
The deputy knew nothing about his son's alleged activities, Guidroz said. ""And when I had to call him in and we sat him down and told him what we wanted him here for, he broke down.""
But the elder Matthews did help authorities with his son's arrest late Wednesday, about 12 hours after investigators concluded Holden Matthews had been involved in the fires, the sheriff said.
National 'There Is Clearly Something Happening': Fires Destroy 3 Black Churches In Louisiana Holden Matthews complied with officers' requests during the arrest, authorities said, adding that he has no previous history of violence or arrest.
The sheriff did not say whether Matthews confessed to the arson allegations or denied them.
Guidroz said hours of manpower, drones and old-fashioned detective work led them to Matthews. And both physical evidence from the crime scenes and ""technological evidence"" confirmed him as a suspect, Browning told reporters.
Authorities are still vetting several motives, but an imminent threat to public safety prompted law enforcement officials to quickly secure warrants to bring Matthews into custody.
The suspect was linked to ""black metal,"" Browning said, referring to the music genre that has previously been associated with church arson attacks in Norway and elsewhere.
A social media account that appeared to be Matthews' showed images of the young man playing the electric guitar and taking selfies. The profile said that he was the lead singer and songwriter for a band called Vodka Vultures.

Gerald Herbert/AP Gerald Herbert/AP Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives work on Wednesday near the ruins of Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church, one of three black churches that recently burned down in Louisiana.
Gerald Herbert/AP The three black churches were burned down within a span of 10 days in St. Landry Parish. The first fire tore through St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre on March 26. The second burned at the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2, and the third broke out at Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 4.
No one was reported injured in the fires, which started when the buildings were empty.
All the churches were built in rural areas decades ago and had served generations of predominantly black families through weddings, funerals and religious services.
The time and proximity of the flames led people to wonder whether the fires were linked. Pastors prayed that the arsons were not racist acts , part of a violent legacy for black churches in the South, which have been attacked since the civil rights movement.
Heidi Beirich , who oversees the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project and its hate map , tells NPR that the deep South still feels deep scars from its past. ""The history of slavery and Jim Crow and segregation has meant race relations are more fraught than in other parts of the country.""
Places of worship, and the black church as an entity, have often become the targets of hate, Beirich says.
New Orleans FBI Special Agent in Charge Eric Rommal said his team has been working with local law enforcement agencies to determine whether the incidents were motivated by bias.
Community members have vowed to rebuild the incinerated structures and come together, saying their faith will not waver.
Florence Milburn, a member of the Greater Union Baptist Church, told NPR that she immediately went to her church after receiving news of the fire.
""My husband and I drove over there along with our other family members, and along with our church family, we were on-site and we watched our church burn to the ground,"" she said.
When U.S. Attorney David Joseph announced Wednesday that a suspect had been identified and taken into state custody, he called the fires ""despicable acts.""
Authorities said the three fires are not connected to a fourth fire that occurred on March 31 at the Vivian United Pentecostal Church, a mainly white church near Shreveport."

Janet Morgan/Courtesy of the artist You know when a song belongs to J. Robbins. There's a jagged quality, with guitar riffs that seem to have been sharpened on stone, all grounded in oblique hummability. Robbins has been in D.C. rock bands like Jawbox, Burning Airlines, Channels and Office of Future Plans for more than three decades now, each with a different take on his signature style. But Robbins had never really been interested in a solo project until he started playing shows on his own, rearranging older Jawbox tunes and releasing new songs on Bandcamp .
Un-Becoming , the first album released under Robbins' own name, features familiar faces from previous bands: Peter Moffett on drums, Brooks Harlan on bass and Gordon Withers on cello and guitar. With ""Soldier On,"" which is quite the song title for any lifer in music, there's a straightforward thrust not really heard on projects Robbins has released before. The tune almost sounds like Jawbox gone power-pop: The mile-wide chords and thickly distorted bass check off a few of his boxes, but the clean-cut song structure gets you in and out in less than three minutes.
YouTube Un-Becoming comes out May 31 via Dischord . Jawbox embarks on a short reunion tour this summer .

Justice Department Charges Wikileaks' Assange With Computer Hacking Conspiracy,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712216859/justice-department-charges-wikileaks-assange-with-computer-hacking-conspiracy,"Justice Department Charges WikiLeaks' Assange With Computer Hacking Conspiracy Justice Department Charges WikiLeaks' Assange With Computer Hacking Conspiracy Embed Embed
WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange was arrested in London after being evicted by Ecuador's embassy, where he has sought refuge since 2012.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Let's update you on the story that has been unfolding all morning. WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange was arrested in London this morning. He's now facing charges in the United States. He had been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012. And we spoke earlier with WikiLeaks editor Kristinn Hrafnsson, who told us that British authorities should respect Assange's asylum there.
KRISTINN HRAFNSSON: It is a gross violation of international treaties and an outrageous behavior in all respects. A country simply shouldn't revoke the status of that kind when it has been granted in the first place.
GREENE: Now, the Ecuadorian government said they had cause to revoke Assange's asylum. British authorities said they were arresting him because he violated his bail and was due in court and did not show up. But this story is much more complicated because this morning, the U.S. Justice Department has charged Assange with conspiracy to hack its computers. And let's talk through those charges with NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas.
Good morning, Ryan.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning.
GREENE: So what exactly is the U.S. government accusing Assange of? - because this has been a long time in the making, right?
LUCAS: It has indeed been a long time in the making. But the charge in the indictment against Assange - there is one count that is conspiracy to commit computer intrusion that, basically, boils down to a computer-hacking conspiracy. What the indictment says is that Assange entered into an agreement with Chelsea Manning - who was a U.S. Army intelligence analyst at the time - to help Manning crack a password stored on a Defense Department computer system that was connected to a government network that's used for classified documents, classified communications.
This agreement was allegedly entered into back in March of 2010. And what the indictment says is that cracking that password would have allowed Manning to, basically, log in with someone else's name. That would have made identifying Manning's role in what ended up being a massive leak of classified information more difficult. The indictment says that Manning provided part of a password to Assange. Assange later asked Manning for more information on the password, saying he'd been trying to crack it but hadn't been able to so far. The indictment does not say, however, that Assange ever managed to crack the password. We just don't know at this point.
GREENE: OK. I want to - I mean, there are different ways to look at WikiLeaks and Assange, which is really going to be central to wherever this story goes. I just want to play a little bit of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defining what WikiLeaks is in his mind.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: It's time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is - a non-state, hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.
GREENE: So, Ryan, it sounds like that is what the U.S. government is charging them with - not just being a journalism media organization, as WikiLeaks has said, but suggesting or accusing Assange and WikiLeaks of actually being proactive in encouraging someone or making it easier for them to hack into the U.S. system.
LUCAS: Well, Pompeo was actually director of the CIA when he made those comments. I was at that speech in Washington when he made it, and we were all kind of flabbergasted by how strongly he came out against WikiLeaks. It's been known for quite some time, as you mentioned, that the national security establishment here in the U.S. is no fan of WikiLeaks.
What Pompeo also said in that speech, though, is that he accused WikiLeaks of encouraging followers to find jobs at the CIA in order to dig up intelligence. And also, one complaint that we frequently hear from U.S. officials is that WikiLeaks overwhelmingly focuses on the United States. It talks about shining a light on wrongdoing from governments across the world but that it doesn't report on, say, Russia. It doesn't report on China. And Pompeo himself actually accused WikiLeaks of being, essentially, in cahoots with dictators.
GREENE: Well, let's listen to the other side of this argument. As we've been covering this all morning, we spoke with the journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has closely followed this and is an Assange ally who said this arrest is really a danger to press freedom.
GLENN GREENWALD: Well, I agree with the Obama Justice Department, The Washington Post editorial of 2011, The Guardian editorial from yesterday and the consensus of press freedom groups around the world, which is that prosecuting Julian Assange in connection with publishing secret documents that showed U.S. war crimes is one of the greatest threats to press freedom possibly imaginable.
GREENE: So is that going to be an argument here? - that WikiLeaks deserves protection from the First Amendment in the United States.
LUCAS: Well, this is certainly something that WikiLeaks supporters have used to try to protect the organization for a long time, saying it operates largely as a media organization does. It's shining a light on wrongdoing of governments. And it deserves the same sort of protections that a regular media organization does. But that has been, you know, part of the discussion internally within the U.S. Justice Department about trying to figure out how, and if it's possible, to bring charges against WikiLeaks, against Julian Assange, without making some sort of negative precedent.
GREENE: All right, a lot to cover here. We've been following this story all morning. We'll be covering it throughout the day. And you heard some of our interviews there with the editor of WikiLeaks and also with the journalist Glenn Greenwald. You can find those full interviews at our website npr.org. Speaking here with Ryan Lucas, who covers the Justice Department for NPR.
Ryan, thanks so much.
