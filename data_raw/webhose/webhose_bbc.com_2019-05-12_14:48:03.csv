Indonesia election: China's complicated role in the country's future - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Karishma Vaswani Asia Business Correspondent,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47905090," Image caption 192 million Indonesians are due to vote on 17 April Whoever wins Indonesia's upcoming election will have to navigate a tricky relationship with China.
Beijing is a crucial player in the country's economic growth but increasingly unpopular with voters.
Indonesia's economy is South East Asia's largest. It has a population of 250 million and an average annual growth rate of about 5%.
By 2050 it is expected to be the fourth largest economy in the world, after China, India and the United States, according to PwC .
But analysts routinely say that Indonesia isn't punching its weight, because it's been plagued by decades of under-investment in infrastructure, as well as suffering from corruption and red tape.
So, for the 193 million going to the polls next week to choose their next president, economic growth is a key election issue.
But that economic growth isn't going to happen without significant investment in Indonesian infrastructure, which is impeding trade and hindering the country's potential.
A short guide to Indonesia's battle for votes From street coffee vendor to politician Indonesia country profile Enter China.
Beijing has been keen to develop infrastructure projects in Indonesia, and add it to the growing list of countries that it is investing in for its Belt and Road Initiative.
""Traditionally the biggest sources of international investment in Indonesia have been Japan and Korea,"" says Tom Lembong, the head of Indonesia's investment co-ordinating board.
""I do have to note that over the last five years China has gone from being the number 13 largest international investor in Indonesia to today to arguably number one.""
 Image caption Infrastructure development is crucial for Indonesia's economic future Although there is no official Belt and Road project underway in the country yet, China has beaten Japan to some high profile infrastructure projects in Indonesia.
But at least one of these projects has been plagued by controversy.
The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway is a $5.9bn project being built by a Chinese consortium and some Indonesian partners. Reportedly, at least 75% of the project is being funded by China Development Bank.
Once completed, it will be one of South East Asia's first high-speed rail projects, connecting Jakarta to one of Indonesia's top three cities, Bandung.
But it's faced delays because of land acquisition problems, and critics have asked what the point of building a new railway to Bandung is, given there are cheaper options currently available, including travel by bus or existing train services.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption President Joko Widodo has been accused by critics of being too soft on China Chinese investment has become a contentious issue in this election, as the incumbent Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has been courting Beijing to invest in infrastructure in the country. This is partly because no one else has the financial might to match China's, and partly because Indonesia is such a cumbersome place to invest that most foreign investors can't be bothered.
But Mr Lembong says foreign investors are attracted to Indonesia, and are willing to deal with some of the difficulties. He also said that in order for Chinese investment to reach its full potential in Indonesia it must be managed properly.
""I think most countries that I'm aware of wish to work closely with China to continue to fine tune and evolve investment to make it less and less controversial over time,"" he says, comparing Chinese investment with Japanese investment around the world in the 80s and 90s.
""Today Japanese investment around the world has become well accepted and completely uncontroversial. Believe it or not I actually think we are headed to some kind of situation where we will work things out.""
But Chinese investment has also become the bogeyman Mr Jokowi's rival Prabowo Subianto has used to undermine him. Mr Prabowo has accused Mr Jokowi of being too soft on China, and allowing millions of Chinese workers in to work on Chinese-funded projects. Mr Prabowo has said if he becomes president, he will review all of Beijing's projects in the country.
 That's a sentiment that is widely shared by many Indonesians, who are increasingly wary of Beijing's influence. There has long been a deep-seated resentment of Chinese Indonesians that has at times boiled over into violence, partly driven by an economic jealousy of Chinese Indonesians who many perceive to be wealthier than ethnic Malay Indonesians.
While many of the big Indonesian business families are Chinese Indonesians, the reality is the vast majority of this community are middle class Indonesians, struggling to make ends meet just like everybody else.
This anti-Chinese sentiment has also been exacerbated by what many Indonesians see as encroaching economic and political hegemony by Beijing.
In a recent report by the Pew Research Center, the share of Indonesians who hold favourable views of China has declined over time. In 2018, 53% held favourable views of China, compared with 66% in 2014 the last Indonesian election.
Still, it is highly likely whoever wins the election will need to depend on China to achieve economic growth rates that can sustain Indonesia's growing population.
The reality is that Indonesia's future success depends on navigating its relationship with Beijing, whatever its candidates may tell their voters."

Indonesia 2019 elections: How many Chinese workers are there? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Rebecca Henschke Bbc Reality Check,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47881858," President Joko Widodo has welcomed investment from China to help fund an ambitious infrastructure agenda Indonesia is going to the polls on 17 April for presidential and nationwide elections.
The presidential campaign has been mainly fought over jobs and the economy against a backdrop of rising nationalism.
President Joko Widodo, who is seeking re-election, has embarked on an ambitious infrastructure push. To do it he has welcomed Chinese investment and accepted loans and partnerships with foreign companies.
His rival, former military general Prabowo Subianto, has accused the president of selling out the country to foreigners, and opposition lawmakers are claiming Indonesia is facing an influx of Chinese workers.
A long and occasionally violent history of anti-Chinese sentiment means these are contentious issues, especially in an election year.
Social media is king in Indonesia and in the lead-up to the vote it has been awash with rumours over rising numbers of Chinese workers in the country.
But what does the data show? We've taken a look into the figures behind China's growing role in Indonesia.
Indonesia 2019 elections: All you need to know Indonesia country profile Online rumours In January this year a video showing thousands of workers protesting at an industrial park in Morowali on the island of Sulawesi was widely shared on social media.
The video claimed that these were Indonesian workers demonstrating against Chinese migrants who were earning higher salaries and taking local jobs.
However, the manpower minister dismissed the claims, posting on Twitter that the protest in the video was about wages and not Chinese workers, and the police arrested a suspect accused of spreading false information.
Other widely shared social media posts have shown images of Chinese tourists at airports with alarming captions claiming them to be illegal workers flooding into the country.
And last month, a steel manufacturer in Java was forced to clarify how many Chinese nationals they employed after a video claiming to show foreign workers leaving the factory when viral.
What is Prabowo saying? On the campaign trail Mr Prabowo hasn't directly referred to Chinese workers but has taken aim at the president's changes to foreign worker regulations, which aim to speed up the process of foreign worker applications to Indonesia.
He has said ""we are not anti-foreigner but we need to take care of our own people, if we open our door to foreign workers, then what is left for us?""
Image copyright Getty Images Mr Prabowo has also suggested that Indonesia could learn from other countries.
""The United States wants to make a wall to keep them out. In Australia people who try to enter are sent to remote islands,"" he said during a speech ahead of the campaign.
What does the data show? China is Indonesia's third largest source of foreign direct investment behind Singapore and Japan, according to the Indonesian government agency overseeing investment.
These figures show Chinese firms have invested almost $10bn (£7.6bn) in Indonesia since 2014.
Some of these big Chinese-backed projects have run into serious difficulties.
A $6bn project to build high-speed train between Jakarta and the nearest city, Bandung, has been plagued by delays.
In North Sumatra, environmentalists are fighting in the courts to stop a $1.6bn hydroelectric dam supported by the Bank of China that they say threatens to wipe out a critically endangered species of orangutan.
While on the island of Borneo, a Chinese state-owned company is set to build hydropower plants worth almost $18bn.
Indonesia hopes to attract $60bn in investment from China, but it is unlikely to get that much, says Fung Siu, an Asia specialist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
These Chinese-backed projects often seek to employ Chinese labour as a way to cut costs and increase efficiency.
Where are Indonesia's foreign workers from? Number of permits issued to foreign workers
Source: Ministry of Manpower
The most accurate way of measuring the number of registered foreign workers in Indonesia is to look at the number of permits issued.
China receives the most foreign worker permits and the numbers are rising - doubling since 2013.
But the total of just over 30,000 issued in 2018 is substantially less than the millions claimed by some.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani says the current administration has allocated more funds for infrastructure projects than previous governments. The World Bank estimates that overall, foreign workers made up a fraction, just 0.06%, of Indonesia's workforce in 2016, significantly less than Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.
However, there may well be many more Chinese workers in Indonesia than the official tally of work permits suggests, although it's difficult to know how many.
The Confederation of Indonesian Workers' Union (KSPI) claims low-skilled Chinese workers are coming in on tourist visas in their hundreds of thousands.
The government also says Indonesian workers benefit from the training they receive from the highly skilled Chinese labour, who eventually return home leaving the local teams to take over.
So, while the available data shows foreign workers from China and elsewhere make up a fraction of the total workforce in Indonesia, the issue remains a divisive and emotional one, easily stirred up during elections.

More GP appointments available due to success of pilot scheme - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47909618,"Image copyright Getty Images An NHS scheme that has enabled GP practices to free up more time for doctors to see their patients is to be extended following a successful pilot.
NHS England said the Time For Care scheme, tried out at certain sites since 2016, should be in place in three-quarters of GP practices by 2022.
The scheme encourages practices to try innovations to cut bureaucracy.
In 2018, 205,157 clinical hours - equivalent to GPs having 1.2 million more appointment slots - were freed up.
NHS England said that represents close to £40m in time saved, as the average cost of an appointment is £30.
The scheme also saved 330,096 administration hours in the past year.
Missed GP appointments 'cost NHS £216m' Differences in GP access across England 'shocking' The GP substitute will see you now Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England's medical director for primary care and a south-east London GP, said the programme has had ""significant benefits for patients and GPs alike, freeing up doctors' time and NHS resources to ensure people get the care they need as quickly as possible.
""GP services will continue to be at the heart of our health service, and it makes sense to invest for another three years in a programme that is delivering so much for patients while helping us to be more efficient."""

Thames Water outlines 'nationalisation refund' if Labour enacts policy - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47918253," Thames Water has told investors they will be able to demand their money back if a future Labour government renationalises the utility.
In a highly unusual move, the company outlined Labour's policy in stock market documents.
The filing said ""future intervention"" by the government could affect the company's ability to meet obligations.
Labour argues that taking water into public ownership would end ""rip-off"" prices and excessive dividends.
How could Labour's plans for greater public ownership work? Labour: We'll make firms give staff shares The shape of water: should the industry be renationalised? In a document to the Irish Stock Exchange, Thames Water highlighted Labour's policy of renationalising the UK water industry, along with others such as gas, electricity and the railways.
The company, which supplies customers across London and the Thames Valley, referenced a speech by the shadow chancellor John McDonnell from the autumn.
Bonds 'compensation' Business correspondent Rob Young said: ""It's unusual for individual companies to be so explicit in public about the potential impact of one political party's policy.""
""The prospectus from Thames Water says investors will be able to demand their money back quickly, if a majority of the firm is taken over by the state.""
Mr McDonnell told Labour's party conference in September the water industry would be the first to be renationalised.
Under Labour's plans, ownership of the existing water and sewerage companies would be transferred to new Regional Water Authorities.
Existing shareholders would be compensated with bonds, Labour sources told the BBC at the time.
Water was one of the last of Margaret Thatcher's major privatisations, with 10 large regional authorities - of which Thames Water was the largest - sold off in 1989.
The Conservatives have said Labour's nationalisation plans would result in ""a collapse in business investment and a crash in the value of the pound""."

Catherine Shaw, 23, from Witney, Oxfordshire, was reported missing after she left Hotel Mayachik near Lake Atitlan on 5 March.
Her body was found between four and six days after her death, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences of Guatemala told local media.
She was found on Monday near the top of the Indian Nose hiking trail.
The Lucie Blackman Trust , which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, said on Tuesday that ""foul play was probably not involved"".
The preliminary report, released by the institute, said she was found naked, face-down and with visible blows to her body.
Miguel Angel Samayoa, the doctor who performed the examination, told AP there were no visible gunshot or stab wounds.
Further tests are still being carried out to find out more about the circumstances in which she died. Image caption Ms Shaw's body was found on a mountain near Lake Atitlan in Guatemala
On Tuesday the chief executive of the Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping Ms Shaw's family, said speculation that she was raped and murdered was ""incredibly unhelpful, distressing and unnecessary"".

He added: ""She was very much a nature lover and adored sunrises, so it seems quite conceivable that she went up the mountain to greet the sunrise, shedding clothing as she went.""

The sit-in started hours after 24 people were killed and dozens injured in a bomb blast at a vegetable market in the south-western city.
Many victims were from the Hazara community, who are mainly Shia Muslims.
The community has been frequently targeted by extremists from Pakistan's Sunni Muslim majority.
Both the Pakistani Taliban and the Sunni militant group Islamic State (IS) said they had carried out the attack.
Quetta, a city in Baluchistan province that is home to more than half a million Shia Hazara, has witnessed the majority of IS attacks in Pakistan.

Parents - largely of the Muslim faith - are campaigning against the lessons at Anderton Park School, arguing it goes against their religious beliefs.
Campaign leaflets were handed out outside the school on Thursday. Image copyright PA Image caption The leaflet distributed outside the school reads: ""We do not believe in homosexuality""
No Outsiders, a programme devised by Andrew Moffat at nearby Parkfield Community School, uses a range of storybooks which show a number of diverse families, including those with same-sex parents.

The leaflet distributed outside Anderton Park states: ""It teaches children 'it is OK to be gay... you can be gay and Muslim'.""
It goes on to describe the lessons as the ""promotion of homosexuality"" and proclaims in bold: ""We do not believe in homosexuality.""
One Anderton parent who wished to remain anonymous said the leaflet ""doesn't represent the majority of Muslim parents"".
""We don't want our children to be taught about same sex couples but we don't endorse this inflammatory language that is unhelpful and offensive,"" he said.

""What is taught, and how, is ultimately a decision for the school,"" he said.
Khakan Qureshi, an LGBT rights campaigner and gay Muslim, said he was ""appalled"" by the leaflets.
""These protests and the misinformation shared has now gone beyond the initial concern of age appropriate to blatant homophobia,"" he said, and called on the city council to take action.

Swiss organ donor's story: 'Why I'm giving my friend a kidney' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Imogen Foulkes Bbc News,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47887534,"Image caption Sibylle decided to help because there was no hope of a family donor and Switzerland has one of the lowest rates of donation in Europe Sibylle is in her 50s. She is a psychologist, she is married, and she has two sons who are both at university.
She leads an active life with lots of responsibilities and has now embarked on a journey that for many people would be unthinkable.
Next week she will donate a kidney to an old school friend.
She lives in Switzerland, which enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world and one of the most comprehensive health services.
But when it comes to organ donation, about 100 people die each year, waiting for an organ transplant under Switzerland's system that requires explicit consent from people while they are alive.
Why Swiss rate of donation is so low Last year there were 158 post-mortem organ donors, but more than 1,400 people remained on the waiting list. They face, at best, years of ill health, unable to work, before finally getting a transplant.
A key reason for the shortage is that half of all relatives of those who have died simply do not know what their loved ones' wishes were, says the national organ donation foundation, Swisstransplant.
""Because of that, during conversations with families, requests for organ donation are rejected in 60% of cases,"" Franziska Beyeler of Swisstransplant told the BBC.
Image copyright Swisstransplant Image caption Switzerland's national donor organisation has launched an online register to encourage people to give their consent online A campaign is under way to change the law, so that people would have to actively opt out of organ donation, rather than opt in.
But a referendum on changing the law is years away, and that is why people like Sibylle are choosing more radical solutions.
Why Sibylle decided to help Sibylle and her friend have known each other since high school, and bonded over the six-week residential ""housekeeping course"", which all Swiss schoolgirls once had to go on.
""They sent a washing machine specialist to talk to us and someone who explained the best way to decorate a living room,"" Sibylle remembers.
She always knew her friend had kidney disease, a condition that would likely deteriorate as she got older.
Image caption Sybille only realised her friend's condition while out hiking with her But she never knew how serious it was until, a couple of years ago when they were out hiking, her friend confided that her doctor had said it was time to go on the transplant waiting list.
With no siblings, children, nieces or nephews, she had no chance of a family donor.
Sibylle spent that night awake and, the next morning, told her friend she would be prepared to donate a kidney.
First she had to find out if her kidney was suitable for her friend. Batteries of tests followed: ""I had to give at least 25 different blood samples,"" she says.
Scans and screenings took months. Then she found out she was a match and had to tell her family.
The reaction was not entirely positive.
Her mother-in-law reminded her of her responsibilities to her children. Her husband and sons have accepted her decision but worry about the possible consequences for her future health.
How Switzerland compares with rest of Europe Switzerland has one of the lowest rates of organ donation in Europe, with just 18 deceased organ donors per million people Spain has Europe's highest rate of donation with 47 per million. Switzerland has 60% of family refusals to consent for organ donation of a deceased relative France has a 25% rate of refusal (source Swisstransplant) Unlike Switzerland, most European countries now have a system of ""presumed consent"" for organ donation from deceased donors.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Max, his parents and Keira's parents tell the story that gave England's new donor legislation its name Presumed consent operates in Wales and will come into effect in England in 2020. Scotland is considering reforms to its laws, and in Northern Ireland a voluntary ""opt-in"" system exists.
UK's Max and Keira's organ consent law passed Marked increase in kidney transplants in Scotland Ten years since Scotland's first living kidney donation to a stranger Medical experts say co-ordination and infrastructure around organ donation and transplantation are also a key factor in donor rates.
Last year, Swisstransplant set up an online donor register in the hope of encouraging more potential donors, and providing doctors and families with the chance to check whether a deceased person would have wanted to be a donor.
Donor decisions Sibylle's story remains relatively rare but, because of the organ shortage, Swiss doctors are seeing more cases of non-family living donors.
A colleague of hers is also about to donate a kidney, to a man she worked with, whose ill health forced him into early retirement.
It is a very delicate decision-making process, and one that doctors approach cautiously.
Image copyright Swisstransplant The donor's explicit and continued consent is essential.

Inter-caste marriage: On the run for love in India - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47823588,"The couples on the run for love in India 14 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption Ravindra and Shilpaba married against all odds Most Indian families still prefer marriages arranged within their religion and caste. Marriages outside these rigid boundaries have often led to violent consequences, including ""honour"" killings. But some young Indians are still willing to defy their families and communities for love, reports the BBC's Divya Arya.
Ravindra Parmar knew that pursuing a relationship with an upper-caste woman would be dangerous.
He is a Dalit (formerly known as ""untouchable""), a caste that sits at the lowest rung of India's social ladder. The woman he fell in love with, Shilpaba Upendrasinh Vala, is a Rajput - a Hindu warrior caste near the apex of the system.
The yawning gap between his position and hers is something rarely bridged in Indian society.
""We are not even allowed to walk past their area and I had dared to marry into their family,"" he says. Listen to the radio version of this story here
""Those who marry inter-caste are seen as aliens. The perception is that they are terrorists who revolt in society.""
Ravindra and Shilpaba were born and brought up in two villages separated by more than 100km (62 miles) in the western state of Gujarat.
They met on Facebook and would spend hours taking digs at each other.
But all that friendly banter had a deep impact on Shilpaba.
""I was like any other village girl limited to home and college, but he broadened my horizon, made me realise that my life has more meaning,"" she says.
Social media has opened a space that did not exist a few decades ago. Rigid caste and religious divides meant that the possibility of meeting, interacting and striking friendships in public places was neither possible nor encouraged.
The caste system is hereditary, and the practice of marrying within the caste ensures that the hierarchy is perpetuated. Caste divisions have deep roots in history and Dalit men who have married women from upper castes have been killed.
Marriages across caste or religion in India are uncommon. According to the India Human Development Survey, only about 5% of Indian marriages are inter-caste.
The onus of upholding tradition, culture and ""purity"" falls on the woman and if she marries outside traditional boundaries, she is seen as besmirching the honour of the community and her family. Image caption Shilpaba had to flee from her village to marry Ravindra
The anger and backlash can lead to violent attacks and killings.
Shilpaba had to flee from her village to marry Ravindra. But the threat of violence has continued to hang over them: they have moved between houses and cities a dozen times in the past three years. Ravindra is a trained engineer but had to leave his job and has had to do daily-wage labour wherever they have lived to make ends meet.

Shilpaba says the stress became unbearable. They started blaming each other for their situation and she even contemplated taking her own life.
""Ravindra convinced me out of it, as that was no solution,"" she says. ""Now we are both studying law with a vision to take up human rights cases and make our parents proud through our work.
""Maybe then they will see that we didn't take this decision to just have fun and they will accept us."" 'Shocking' level of prejudice
The latest data available from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that 77 murder cases in 2016 were reported with ""honour killing"" as the motive.
Such violence is highly under-reported and these numbers do not accurately reflect social attitudes that may be growing more conservative.
A 2016 survey, Social Attitudes Research for India (Sari), conducted across Delhi, Mumbai, and the states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan found the majority of respondents opposed to inter-caste and inter-religious marriages.
In fact they were in favour of a law banning such marriages.
""It is quite shocking that despite rising levels of literacy and education, prejudicial beliefs do not reduce. In fact, they are worryingly high,"" says Professor Amit Thorat of Jawaharlal Nehru University, who worked on the Sari survey.
""Religious and traditional values around hierarchies, around the notion of purity and pollution seem to be more sacrosanct and valuable than human rights, the right to live or the right to marry by choice."" Feeling unsafe
Bibi Ayisha and Aditya Verma were 17 years old when they fell in love. They too found each other on Facebook. That they were born into different religions - she is Muslim, he is Hindu - did not matter to them. But their families fiercely opposed the relationship. Image caption Ayisha and Aditya met on Facebook
Aditya was born and grew up in Delhi. After finishing school, he enrolled in a college in the southern Indian city of Bangalore only because Ayisha lived there. But that sign of his dedication couldn't win her parents over: he was still a Hindu.
Madly in love, and after waiting for two years, Ayisha ran away with Aditya. They moved to Delhi but, like Ravindra and Shilpaba, they still did not feel safe.
""We were so scared that for five months we stayed in a room. Neither of us was working at that time. I thought if I stepped out, I would be killed, because I was Muslim and he was Hindu,"" says Ayisha.
In February 2018, 23-year old Ankit Saxena was murdered in broad daylight in the capital Delhi for having a relationship with a Muslim woman.
The woman's parents and two others were arrested and the trial is ongoing.
Ayisha says that after that incident, the fear of a possible honour killing started feeling very real.
""Even if we went out briefly, I was constantly looking around and if I saw anyone with a beard, I thought that they were members of my family coming to kill me."" Spreading awareness
Her fears have been set against the backdrop of an India where religious polarisation is increasing. A Hindu nationalist government has been in power since 2014 and is accused of normalising anti-Muslim sentiment.
""I think the present environment is such that rather than bringing people and religions together, it is trying to fan the fires of division,"" says Prof Thorat. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Social media has made it easier for inter-caste and inter-faith couples to be together
He is quick to point to the violent partition of India to underscore that such beliefs have existed for more than half a century, but believes that efforts to bridge divides are lacking.
Ayisha's parents like Aditya but are not ready to accept him into their family unless he converts to Islam. Aditya's parents are equally unwilling for the marriage unless Ayisha adopts Hinduism.
Both of them are opposed to adopting the other's religion - and losing their own.
""When we fell in love, I knew she was a Muslim and she knew I was Hindu. We don't want that any of us should lose our identity,"" Aditya says.
India passed a law in 1872 that enables legal registration of a marriage between a man and woman of different religions or caste without any conversion. Caste hatred in India - what it looks like
Aditya found out about the Special Marriage Act through Asif Iqbal and Ranu Kulshreshtha, a couple who married inter-faith back in 2000.
Soon after their marriage - in the aftermath of the anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002 - they witnessed targeting of couples like themselves and a lack of any support mechanisms.
They set up an organisation called Dhanak, which spreads legal awareness and provides counselling as well as safe houses to couples who want to marry inter-faith or inter-caste.
But awareness about the Special Marriage Act is very low. It also has a rule that requires a notice about the intended marriage to be displayed at a public place for a month, giving opportunity to anyone to place an objection. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Marriages across caste or religion in India are uncommon
""This provision is often misused by fanatic Hindu groups like Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, and Muslim organisations like Nizam-e-Mustafa, who would approach the families and pressure them to stop their daughters as daughters are easy targets,"" explains Asif Iqbal.
According to him, the local police also do not encourage such marriages and instead play an active role in stopping them, especially in smaller towns.
Rekha Sharma, chairperson of the government's advisory body, the National Commission for Women, agrees.
""The government needs to do more in sensitising the police and legal officers about this, as the law helps in stopping conversion yet still enabling inter-faith marriage,"" she says.
But she adds that lasting change cannot come only by enforcing laws, but by changing social mindsets.
Acceptance is key for the survival of such couples as they deal with severe social and economic isolation. 'Trust and love'
The Dhanak network has helped Ayisha feel safe. She has now met many couples like her and Aditya, and it gives her immense hope.
""If you trust your partner and love them very much, then nothing else should matter. You should not waste time worrying about family and society. They will come around eventually,"" she says.
After their marriage, Ravindra and Shilpaba decided to change their surname to Bharatiya, which means Indian.
They decided to drop their original surname since it revealed their respective castes.
Ravindra is an idealist - he believes that more inter-caste marriages will lead to a future in India where caste divisions will cease to be an issue. Related Topics"

The US president tweeted ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET"" alongside a video showing footage of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks spliced with a speech by Representative Ilhan Omar.
""Some people did something,"" she is seen saying, in between footage of planes hitting the Twin Towers and people fleeing the buildings.
Republicans have accused her of downplaying the attacks, but Democrats have largely rallied to her defence, saying she had been Quote: d out of context and some accusing Mr Trump of inciting violence against her and Muslims. Here is how the row developed.
Who is Congresswoman Omar? Ms Omar won a Minnesota seat in the House of Representatives last November, becoming one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to the US Congress.
Her family originally came to the US as refugees from Somalia and she is the first congresswoman to wear the hijab.

Who is US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar? 'I'm a Muslim who voted for Donald Trump' She has been accused of anti-Semitism over comments she made about Israel and pro-Israel lobbyists. After being rebuked last month, including by Democrats, she apologised and said she was ""listening and learning"".
The congresswoman has also raised the alarm about anti-Muslim rhetoric surrounding her , in response to a Republican poster that showed her alongside the Twin Towers.
Image Copyright @pushkinforhouse @pushkinforhouse Report Image Copyright @pushkinforhouse @pushkinforhouse Report Just last week, police arrested a 55-year-old man in New York state for allegedly calling her office with a graphic death threat in which he reportedly labelled her a ""terrorist"".
What did she say? The ""some people did something"" Quote: was from a speech Ms Omar gave to a civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), on 23 March.
In the 20-minute speech she discussed issues affecting the community like Islamophobia and the recent mosque attack in New Zealand.
The comments in Mr Trump's video were taken from a point she made about the treatment of US Muslims in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks:
""Here's the truth. For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. Cair was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""
After the Washington Post fact-checked the statement to clarify Cair was actually founded in 1994 , a spokesman for Ms Omar told the paper that she misspoke and meant to say the organisation's size had doubled after the attacks.
How did the row develop? Her speech began getting attention on 9 April, when a clip was shared by Texas Republican Representative Dan Crenshaw , who described her phrasing as ""unbelievable"".
Conservative media outlets, including Fox News, then started discussing it in-depth.
Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, described the congresswoman as ""anti-American"".

Then, on Friday, President Trump posted the video of Ms Omar. It is currently pinned to the top of his account and has been shared tens of thousands of times.
What was the response? Many social media users responded by using #IStandWithIlhan - which trended worldwide on Twitter on Friday.
CNN showed the clip in discussions, but then presenter Chris Cuomo apologised for airing it. MSNBC host Joy Reid also refused to show it.
A number of high-ranking Democrats, including many in the running for the 2020 presidential nomination , have come out to criticise Mr Trump and defend Ms Omar.

I would love to come to Ireland but my daddy doesn't have very much money"".
The words are on a crumbling, pink letter from 1960, written by an 11-year-old Australian girl, to Irish actor Jimmy O'Dea.
O'Dea was fresh from his role as King Brian, King of the Leprechauns, in Disney's 1959 film Darby O'Gill and the Little People.
It is a tale about a wily Irishman and his battle of wits with leprechauns, in a film many believe portrays a romanticised view of Ireland.
Sixty years on, the search is on for the letter's author, Patricia Hickson, from Sydney, New South Wales, who, as a child, wanted to go to Ireland.
Image copyright @ConorDoyleDUB Image copyright @ConorDoyleDUB Brían Patrick Doyle from Malahide in Dublin recently discovered its existence and found out that film producer Walt Disney, himself, had seen it.
O'Dea, who was from Dublin and died in 1965, had been godfather to Brían's father, Conor. The latter is an Irish theatre historian and inherited a huge collection of O'Dea memorabilia.
""My dad has had the letter for donkey's years, but I've only found out about it,"" Brían told BBC News NI.

Disney read it and sent a note back to him.
""We still don't know if Jimmy [O'Dea] ever replied to Patricia,"" Brían added. ""But, I couldn't believe it when I saw the letter - I asked if dad had ever tried to find her.""
Image copyright @ConorDoyleDUB ""We wonder does she even remember writing it and did she ever hear back from Jimmy?
""Does she know that her letter is still around and that it made it to the desk of Walt Disney? We would love to fill her in.

Donald Glover and Rihanna 's short film was made during a hush-hush shoot in Cuba and premiered at Coachella.
For those who weren't at the Californian music festival, it was then released on Amazon Prime.
The movie stars Donald Glover as Deni Maroon - a musician who wants to put on a festival for the people of Guava.
Rihanna plays his long-term girlfriend, Kofi.

The film begins with a colourful animation and the pair's creative genius has stunned many fans.
One of the only negatives is viewers were left wanting more as the film is just under an hour long.

But some were left disappointed that - despite the rumours - Rihanna didn't sing.
Others were stunned at the parallels between Guava Island's storyline and the recent real-life death of rapper, Nipsey Hussle.

He said Mr Farage, who launched the rival Brexit Party on Friday, wanted to ""discredit"" UKIP by claiming Mr Batten was condoning violence by working with the ex-English Defence League leader.
He said UKIP had always been, and would remain, a ""non-racist"" organisation.
While not a member, Mr Robinson was a ""useful source of research"", he said.
Mr Farage quit UKIP earlier this year in protest at the direction of the Eurosceptic party, saying it had become obsessed under Mr Batten's leadership with the threat Islam posed to UK society.
Launching his new party on Friday, Mr Farage said the UKIP leader's decision to appoint Mr Robinson as an adviser on grooming gangs and prison conditions tarnished his former party and associated it with ""extremism, violence, criminal records and thuggery"".

""He knows that this is a smear. This is a device he is using to try and discredit UKIP and enhance the chances of his own new party... What he is saying is a complete smear.""
Image copyright Reuters Image caption The UKIP leader said the party was attracting new members from all political backgrounds Mr Farage, he suggested, had employed a former member of the National Front when he was leader on the basis he was no longer associated in any way with the fascist organisation.
""I have lots of people who advise me, some of which are not members of UKIP,"" Mr Batten added.
""Tommy Robinson is not far-right... and does not have far-right views. He is someone who can give some information and research which is useful to me.
""We have always been a democratic, non-racist party. That has always been in our constitution and that is exactly the way we are going to keep it.
""It is very odd in this day and age when you get called far-right, when what you have spent the last 25 years trying to do is to return government to our own democratically elected Parliament.""
Mr Batten also defended Carl Benjamin, a possible UKIP candidate in next month's European elections, who posted a message on Twitter in 2016 to Labour MP Jess Phillips which said: ""I wouldn't even rape you.""
Asked why he had not been thrown out of the party, Mr Batten described Mr Benjamin as a ""classical liberal"" and said he thought the message had been ""satirical"" in nature.
""I don't know the exact context of that and I certainly don't condone any remarks like that, but he is not a bad person as he is trying to be portrayed,"" he said.
""He is a proponent of free speech. The context that he said it was satire against the people he was saying it about. He was not actually making a literal statement.""
Ms Phillips, who has spoken out on behalf of rape and domestic violence victims in Parliament, said it was right for the UKIP leader to have been challenged on the issue, and she was considering getting an ""army of feminists"" to campaign in the area that Mr Benjamin was standing.

Baby boom for North Atlantic right whales off US coast - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47927297,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Only about 450 North Atlantic right whales are thought to remain One of the world's most endangered whale species is experiencing a mini baby boom off the US state of Massachusetts.
Researchers at the Center for Coastal Studies have announced they have seen three North Atlantic right whale mother and calf pairs in Cape Cod bay.
The whales give birth off Georgia and Florida in the winter before moving up the US east coast in the spring.
Only about 450 of the species are believed to remain.
Scientists reportedly did not spot any right whale newborns in 2018 , so researchers were elated to report the sighting of two pairs of right whales in Cape Cod bay this week.
Another pair had been sighted earlier.
Image Copyright @CCSPtown @CCSPtown Report Image Copyright @CCSPtown @CCSPtown Report The Scientist magazine reports that seven calves have been spotted off Florida so far this year.
North Atlantic right whales were hunted virtually to extinction by the early 1890s , and have been listed as endangered since 1970.
The mammals tend to stay near to coasts and have a high blubber content, making them a valuable target for whalers.
Ninth whale carcass found in Canada gulf Ancient bones reveal forgotten history of whales It remains illegal to come within 500 yards (457 metres) of a North Atlantic right whale without a Federal Research Permit.
There are three species of right whale around the world. The Southern right whale can be found throughout the southern hemisphere, and several thousand are thought to remain.
But the North Pacific right whale is even rarer than its North Atlantic relative. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports there are likely fewer than 200 left ."
"Mira Markovic, Slobodan Milosevic's wife, dies at 76 - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47926716,"Image copyright Getty Images Mira Markovic, the widow of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, has died in Russia at the age of 76.
Her death was confirmed to the BBC by a close family friend, Milutin Mrkonjic.
Known as the ""Lady Macbeth of the Balkans"", Ms Markovic was a significant political figure during the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
She was one of her husband's most trusted and influential advisers before he was arrested in 2001 but fled to Russia two years later.
Mr Milosevic died in 2006 while being held at the UN war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands. He had been charged with genocide and other war crimes for his key role in the 1990s wars that tore the Balkans apart.
Mira Markovic: Power behind Milosevic They were married for four decades and were almost inseparable until Milosevic's extradition.
While Ms Markovic owed her political influence to being his closest confidante, she also had her own political party, the neo-communist Yugoslav United Left (JUL).
Prior to meeting her husband, Ms Markovic had a tormented childhood. Her mother was a Partisan fighter who was captured by the Nazis in 1942.
Under torture, she apparently gave away secrets. One account suggests that after her release, her own father - Ms Markovic's grandfather - ordered the execution of his daughter for treachery.
In 2003, Ms Markovic fled Serbia, where she was charged with abuse of power and was suspected of cigarette smuggling and political assassination.
Brought together by tragic family histories By Aleksandra Niksic, BBC News Serbian Editor
Markovic and Milosevic met as childhood sweethearts in Milosevic's hometown Pozarevac and married in 1965. Those who knew them often said the couple was brought together sharing tragic family histories - Milosevic's parents both committed suicide, while Markovic's mother was estranged from her husband due to political differences during the World War II.
They had two children - daughter Marija and son Marko, who has lived in Russia with Markovic. Daughter Marija Milosevic was estranged from the family after her father's death in 2006 and has been living in neighbouring Montenegro.
Serbian opposition parties called her ""Red Witch"" due to her political stance. She fled for Russia after Serbian justice began investigating a corruption case, as well as murders of journalists and political opponents.
Milosevic's brother Borislav, once ambassador to Moscow, reportedly organised the move, as well as asylum for her and her son Marko."
Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher 'expected to step down' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47928766,"Image caption Sergio Bucher joined Debenhams from Amazon Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher is expected to step down following the struggling department store chain's recent takeover by its lenders.
""Having stayed on and got the refinancing in place, Sergio thinks now would be the right moment to move on,"" a source close to him told the BBC.
""The upcoming restructuring can then be led by someone offering a fresh start,"" the source added.
The retailer was taken over less than a week ago after entering administration.
The group of lenders that now owns Debenhams - including banks such as Barclays and US hedge funds such as Silver Point and Golden Tree - have provided the retailer with £200m in funding.
The group said it had ""extensive turnaround experience, which we will deploy to support the management's turnaround plan"".
It also said it intended to ""work closely with management and the board to position Debenhams for a long-term successful future"".
""We are pleased that now under new ownership, the business can look forward with confidence,"" they added.
Debenhams: Three things that went wrong Unlikely stars bucking the High Street slump Mr Bucher had already been voted off the retailer's board after major shareholders, Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, and Landmark Group, voted against Mr Bucher's re-election in January.
Sports Direct founder Mr Ashley - who held a near 30% stake in Debenhams - made several offers to take it over .
However, his final offer of £200m was rejected because it was conditional on him becoming chief executive.
'National scandal' Mr Ashley subsequently described the Debenhams takeover as a ""national scandal"" and called for the administration process to be reversed.
Debenhams is the biggest department store chain in the UK with 166 stores. It employs about 25,000 people.
Its stores will continue to trade as normal during the initial restructuring process, before closures begin next year.
As well as the planned closures, it has also been renegotiating rents with landlords to tackle its funding problems.
It has not released a list of which shops may be shut.
Debenhams is one of a string of well-known names suffering in a tough High Street environment.
Last year, Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin all went bust and disappeared altogether.
Other household names - Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look - were forced into restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of stores.
Music chain HMV recently fell into administration before being bought.
The increasing popularity of online shopping, higher business rates, rising labour costs and the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote - which has increased the cost of imported goods - have been blamed for contributing to retailers' woes."
"Gatwick drone attack possible inside job, say police - BBC News",www.bbc.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47919680," Image caption The travel plans of about 140,000 people were disrupted as a result of the drone attack The drone attack that caused chaos at Gatwick before Christmas was carried out by someone with knowledge of the airport's operational procedures, the airport has said.
A Gatwick chief told BBC Panorama the drone's pilot ""seemed to be able to see what was happening on the runway"".
Sussex Police told the programme the possibility an ""insider"" was involved was a ""credible line"" of inquiry.
About 140,000 passengers were caught up in the disruption.
The runway at the UK's second busiest airport was closed for 33 hours between 19 and 21 December last year - causing about 1,000 flights to be cancelled or delayed.
How can a drone cause so much chaos? Anti-drone equipment for airports Gatwick runway reopens after drone chaos In his first interview since the incident, Gatwick's chief operating officer, Chris Woodroofe, told Panorama: ""It was clear that the drone operators had a link into what was going on at the airport.""
Image caption Chris Woodroofe led Gatwick's response to the attack Mr Woodroofe, who was the executive overseeing the airport's response to the attack - the ""gold commander"" - also said that whoever was piloting the drone could either see what was happening on the runway, or was following the airport's actions by eavesdropping on radio or internet communications.
And whoever was responsible for the attack had ""specifically selected"" a drone which could not be seen by the DJI Aeroscope drone detection system that the airport was testing at the time, he added.
'No overreaction' Despite a huge operation drawing resources from five other forces and a £50,000 reward, there is still no trace of the culprit.
Sussex Police says its investigation is ongoing and expected to take ""some months to complete"".
The first sighting of the drone was at 21:03 GMT on 19 December but it was not until 05:57 GMT on 21 December that flights resumed with an aircraft landing.
Gatwick says it repeatedly tried to reopen the runway but on each occasion the drone reappeared.
Airport protocol mandates that the runway be closed if a drone is present.
 Image caption The military deployed equipment at the airport after the drone sightings Mr Woodroofe denied claims the airport overreacted, describing the situation it faced as an unprecedented, ""malicious"" and ""criminal"" incident.
""There is absolutely nothing that I would do differently when I look back at the incident, because ultimately, my number one priority has to be to maintain the safety of our passengers, and that's what we did.
""It was terrible that 140,000 people's journeys were disrupted - but everyone was safe.""
Mr Woodroofe also dismissed the suggestion that the number of sightings had been exaggerated - and a theory, circulating online, that there had been no drone at all.
These claims have been fuelled by the fact that there are no verified pictures of the drone, and very few eyewitnesses have spoken publicly.
Police told the BBC they had recorded 130 separate credible drone sightings by a total of 115 people, all but six of whom were professionals, including police officers, security personnel, air traffic control staff and pilots.
 Image caption Gatwick's runway was shut for 33 hours Image caption About 1,000 flights were cancelled or delayed Image caption The runway reopened on the morning of 21 December Mr Woodroofe said that many of the drone sightings were by people he knew personally and trusted - ""members of my team, people I have worked with for a decade, people who have worked for thirty years on the airfield, who fully understand the implications of reporting a drone sighting"".
""They knew they'd seen a drone. I know they saw a drone. We appropriately closed the airport.""
Panorama has been told witnesses reported seeing an extremely fast-moving, large drone with bright lights.
At least one person noted the characteristic cross shape while others described it as ""industrial or commercial"" and ""not something you could pop into Argos for"", an airport spokesperson said.
Threat remains Other international airports have installed counter-drone technology and Gatwick has confirmed that, in the days after the attack, it spent £5m on similar equipment.
Asked whether Gatwick should have done more to protect the airport from drones before the incident, Mr Woodroofe said the government had not approved any equipment for drone detection at that stage.
""The equipment I have on site today is painted sand yellow because it comes straight from the military environment,"" he added.
Panorama has learned that Gatwick bought two sets of the AUDS (Anti-UAV Defence System) anti-drone system made by a consortium of three British companies.
AUDS was one of two systems the military deployed at the airport on the evening of 20 December.
Image caption The AUDS anti-drone system at work Image caption Gatwick has purchased new equipment since the disruption Mr Woodroofe said he was confident that the airport was now much better protected.
""We would know the drone was arriving on site and we'd know where that drone had come from, where it was going to, and we'd have a much better chance of catching the perpetrator.""
Every day, he said, the airport sends up a drone to test the detection equipment, and ""it finds that drone"".
But he added: ""What this incident has demonstrated is that a drone operator with malicious intent can cause serious disruption to airport operations.
""And it's clear that disruption could be carried over into other industries and other environments.""
Panorama, The Gatwick Drone Attack, will be shown on BBC One at 20:30 BST on Monday 15 April and on BBC iPlayer It will also be shown on BBC World News at a later date"

BBC - Travel - Living in a country that thinks green,www.bbc.com,Lindsey Galloway,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190414-living-in-a-country-that-thinks-green,"The latest climate reports look grim: recent research published in Science journal indicates that oceans are warming 40% faster than previously thought, while the UN panel of climate-change scientists released a landmark report in October 2018 warning that rising temperatures may cause major flooding, droughts, food shortages and wildfires by 2040 unless drastic action is taken.
While the global community still has a long way to go in addressing the reported climate changes, certain countries have emerged as making positive global contributions to the planet, according to the Good Country Index , which aims to measure the impact a single country has on the wider world, such as its ecological footprint relative to the size of the economy and the percentage of renewable energy used.
“In our age of advanced globalisation and massive interdependence, everything sooner or later, has an impact on the whole system,” said Simon Anholt, an independent policy advisor who founded the index. “I wanted to create the first index that measured the external impact of each country on the whole of humanity, the whole planet, outside its own borders.”

Norway
Planet & Climate Index ranking: 1
Topping the list for contribution to the planet and climate is Norway, which has led the world in a number of environmental initiatives, including the highest electric car adoption in the world and a governmental pledge to be climate neutral by 2030. But the relationship with the natural world here goes well beyond policy. Norwegians embrace the concept of friluftsliv , which translates to ‘open-air life’ and conveys the importance of spending time outdoors to be healthy and happy.
“It’s a really deeply rooted part of our culture, and something that’s almost like a religion for a lot of people,” said Norwegian Axel Bentsen, founder and CEO of Urban Sharing , the company behind the popular bike sharing programme Oslo City Bike . “We spend time outdoors in all weather, and our babies even take naps outdoors . Our capital, Oslo, is unique in that you can actually take public transit right out into the forest, so it’s a popular thing to do before or after work.”
Oslo was named the 2019 European Green Capital by the European Commission for restoring its waterways, making investments in cycling and public transportation and for its innovative approach to climate budgeting (making carbon dioxide emissions a trackable metric just like financial funding). The city has also worked to become car-free in its centre. “Over the past year, it’s been great to see the city remove parking spaces to allow for more pedestrian and bike-friendly areas, while the biking infrastructure has also been improved with more bike lanes,” Bentsen said.

Though 99% of Norway’s domestic energy is sustainably sourced through hydropower from its coastline, fjords and waterfalls, Norway is still a major oil extractor and exporter, which has become a controversial political issue .
“Is the continued extraction and export of oil and gas worth it because it generates the huge sums of money being spent on environmental infrastructure that wouldn’t otherwise be available?” asked David Nikel, a British expat who has lived in Norway since 2011 and blogs at Life In Norway . “Many think [the money spent on environmental infrastructure] will inspire other cities and other countries, and eventually lead to a greener world. Others think it’s a double standard. It comes down to which side of the equation you fall on.”
Portugal
Planet & Climate Index ranking: 3
Coming in third for its contributions to the planet, Portugal was an early leader in investing in a full network of charging stations for electric cars ( which was free until just recently ), and has incentivised citizens to install solar power and renewable energy with lower rates and the opportunity to sell energy back to the grid.
“Most of my neighbours either have solar panels or a water pump. In my house, my parents installed this pump that turns rainwater into clean water [that] we use mainly to water our plants, wash clothes and give water to our pets,” said Mariana Magalhães, originally from Portugal who now lives in the UK and is a communications manager at branding agency Forty8Creates . She also noted it was shocking to see so few electric car chargers in London, compared to how many there were even in her small rural town.
Recycling and composting is a normal way of life here, with specialised bins in every neighbourhood, including one for batteries. Education has played a big role in making everyday green efforts a reality. “In high school, we had a lot of classes on environmental education and we frequently had classes in a local park to build into us the love for the environment,” Magalhães said.

Portugal has long been an agrarian society that has made use of its abundant natural resources. “On the border between Portugal and Spain in the north, you can see the mountains filled with wind renewable energy machinery. You can also see [hydroelectric dams] on the lakes to collect energy from the water,” Magalhães said.
“We have natural conditions that favour the use of renewable energies,” added Joana Mendes, manager of Molinum bed and breakfast in southern Portugal. “Since they are cheaper, we gradually changed towards them.”
In the hilly capital of Lisbon, bicycle adoption isn’t as strong as in other European capitals, but other sustainable modes of transportation are starting to take off. “Electric scooter rentals were introduced in Lisbon, and they have become a huge hit,” said American Wendy Werneth, who has lived in Portugal for two years and blogs at The Nomadic Vegan . “Lisboetas have really embraced the electric scooter as an eco-friendly way to get around town.”
Uruguay
Planet & Climate Index ranking: 15
Ranked highest of the South American countries in the Planet & Climate index (coming in 15th) and consistently named one of the most ethical destinations for its social and environmental policies, Uruguay has become a global leader for renewable energy – as much out of necessity as respect for the planet.
Top 10 green countries, according to the Good Country’s Planet & Climate Index:
1. Norway
2. Switzerland
3. Portugal
4. Slovenia
5. Cyprus
6. Finland
7. Sweden
8. Germany
9. Croatia
10. Slovakia
See the full list here
“Uruguay has no oil reserves and was spending a lot of money importing the commodity. So, we began to replace oil-based fuels with clean energy, which has been achieved in less than a decade,” said Uruguayan-American Lola Méndez, who blogs at Miss Filatelista . Today, around 95% of electricity is from renewable sources, mostly from hydroelectric power, but also supplemented with solar, wind and biofuels. “In 2012, Uruguay was only operating at a level of about 40% renewable energy, so this is a drastic change in a very short time frame,” Méndez added. The commitment paid off, as the small country received global attention during the 2015 Paris Agreement for making the dramatic shift, all without government subsidies.

Beyond the economic incentives, residents have forged a strong connection to the land over centuries. “Uruguayans have always loved and respected Tierra Madre,” Méndez said. “From the indigenous Charrúa tribespeople to the gauchos who raise the country’s millions of cows and sheep, living off the land is always how Uruguayans have prospered.”
Public transportation (mostly powered by electricity) can be found in most major cities, and the Carrasco International Airport in the capital of Montevideo is also close to being fully sustainable with a solar photovoltaic (PV) installation, the first airport in Latin America with a PV power plant.
Kenya
Planet & Climate Index ranking: 26
With increasingly extreme weather patterns and more frequent droughts, Kenya has already experienced the initial effects of climate change. In reaction, the government is working to protect its heavily agricultural economy, launching a Climate Change Action Plan and committing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.
Another effort that has helped Kenya reach number 26 on the Planet & Climate index is its recent plastic bag ban to protect the county’s waterways and local environment. The ban has become one of the strictest in the world , carrying threat of jail time and heavy fines if residents (or even tourists) are even seen carrying one.

It doesn’t always take governmental intervention to protect the environment, however. “Local communities here have traditional environmental protection systems in place, and those traditional systems work too,” said American Faye Cuevas, who is based in Nairobi and is senior vice president at IFWA (International Fund for Animal Welfare). “The Maasai Loita Forest is an example – it is one of the few remaining indigenously managed forests in Kenya and it is pristine, largely because of the local rules and traditional systems in place to protect it.”
Family and the environment can’t be separated for the Maasai, an indigenous ethnic community in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. “When you hear Maasai people greet each other, the greetings happen in a series of exchanges. First, they discuss the environment – rainfall, grass health, water. Then, they discuss cattle. And, finally they inquire of each other’s family,” explained Kenyan John Kamanga, a Maasai elder and director of SORALO Conservancy in Kenya’s South Rift Valley. “The same set of traditional principles are used to manage all life – lack of a healthy environment means no cows, which means no kids, which means loss of traditional culture and an ancient way of life.”
New Zealand
Planet & Climate Index ranking: 39
Ranked 39th in the Planet & Climate index – making it a leader in the Asia-Pacific region – New Zealand takes the protection of its natural resources very seriously, particularly because its agriculture- and tourism-based economy depends on it.

“Our country is known worldwide as ‘Clean Green New Zealand’ and we attach our identity to that,” said Brendan Lee, originally from New Zealand who blogs at Bren on the Road . “Kiwis are very proud when visitors tell us our nature is beautiful, our country is beautiful.”
Due primarily to the methane emissions from its large cattle and sheep farming industry, as well as its growing energy industry, New Zealand is among the top carbon emitters per capita. But the country has created a cross-party coalition of parliamentary leaders to create Net Zero in New Zealand , a plan to map the policies needed to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.
Though New Zealand is two thirds the size of California, it has around 10% of the US state’s population, which has given it the freedom to worry less about day-to-day environmental issues, like air pollution or landfill overflow, compared to other big urban centres. But that’s been changing in recent years as well. “It's very rare in New Zealand to see landfills overflowing with plastic, streams clogged up with plastic bottles and plastic bags, so it's been somewhat an ‘out-of-sight-out-of-mind’ issue,” said Lee. But that’s been changing in recent years as well.
“Plastic bags are now banned from supermarkets – you don't see plastic straws and it's trendy to have a good-looking reusable drinking bottle,” explained Brit Jess Tonking, who now lives in Queenstown and works at sustainable active-wear brand Sundried . “I consider the environment far more now since living in NZ. I recycle everything here, I've reduced the animal products I buy, and I would like to think I live a more sustainable lifestyle.”

Sudan crisis: Military council arrests former government members - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47929137,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Demonstrators in Khartoum have vowed to continue their sit-in until a civilian government is in place Sudan's transitional military council has arrested members of the former government and promised not to disperse protesters.
A spokesman also urged the opposition to pick the next prime minister and vowed to implement their choice.
Months of protests in Sudan led to the ousting and arrest of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir on Thursday.
Demonstrators have vowed to stay on the streets until there is an immediate move to civilian rule.
A sit-in is continuing outside the defence ministry in the capital Khartoum.
What did the military council say? In a press conference on Sunday, spokesman Maj Gen Shams Ad-din Shanto said the military council was ""ready to implement"" whatever civilian government the opposition parties agreed.
""We won't appoint a PM. They'll choose one,"" he said, referring to opposition and protest groups.
Sudan unrest: The key questions How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? He also said the army would not remove protesters from their sit-in by force, but called on protesters ""to let normal life resume"" and stop unauthorised roadblocks.
""Taking up arms will not be tolerated,"" he added.
The military council also announced a raft of decisions, including:
New heads of the army and the police A new head of the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) Committees to fight corruption, and to investigate the former ruling party The lifting of all media restrictions and censorship The release of police and security officers detained for supporting protesters A review of diplomatic missions, and the dismissal of Sudan's ambassadors to the US and to the UN in Geneva Image copyright Reuters Image caption After months of protests, long-serving leader Omar al-Bashir was ousted and detained by the military What's been happening in Sudan? Protests against a rise in the cost of living began in December but soon developed into a wider call for the removal of Mr Bashir and his government.
On Thursday the military removed and detained the veteran leader after nearly 30 years in power.
The coup leader, Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf, announced the military would oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections and imposed a three-month state of emergency.
Sudan military coup topples Bashir Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here But demonstrators vowed to stay in the streets regardless, demanding an immediate switch to civilian government.
Mr Ibn Auf himself stood down the next day, as did the feared security chief Gen Salah Gosh.
Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan was then named as head of the transitional military council, to become Sudan's third leader in as many days.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan became head of the transitional military council after the coup leader stepped aside In a televised address on Saturday, Gen Burhan vowed to ""uproot the regime"", pledging to respect human rights, end a night curfew, release political prisoners immediately, dissolve all provincial governments, try those who had killed demonstrators and tackle corruption.
But the Sudan Professionals Association (SPA), which has been spearheading the demonstrations, said the council's response ""did not achieve any of the demands of the people"" and urged protests to continue.
Among its demands are the restructuring of state security, the arrest of ""corrupt leaders"" and the dissolution of militias that operated under former President Bashir.
The whereabouts of Sudan's former leader is currently unknown, but the coup leaders said he was in a secure place.
Mr Bashir has been indicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur by the International Criminal Court.
But the military council has said it will not extradite him, although he could well be put on trial in Sudan.
Mr Bashir's National Congress Party on Saturday called his overthrow unconstitutional, and demanded that the military council release the party's imprisoned members.
Maj-Gen Shanto said that the former ruling party would have no part in the civilian transitional government but could field candidates in the next elections.

Heavy rains have wreaked havoc in northern Chile causing rivers to overflow and forcing residents from their flooded homes.
Extreme rainfall in the Andes claimed several lives and destroyed homes and roads.
In the Atacama Desert, normally one of the driest places on Earth, a 60m (196ft) waterfall that had run dry for 10 years has been reactivated.
As the rains start to die down, families are taking stock of the damage to homes. 09 Feb 2019"
Chile escape: Ex-guerrilla Patricio Ortiz Montenegro returns to Santiago,www.bbc.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47098833,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright EPA Image caption Patricio Ortiz Montenegro (c) was mobbed by journalists and supporters on his arrival in Santiago A Chilean former left-wing militant, renowned for a daring prison escape in 1996, has returned to his country after 23 years in exile.
Patricio Ortiz Montenegro fought against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and in 1991 was jailed for 10 years for killing a policeman.
But with three other prisoners he escaped from a high-security prison in a basket suspended from a helicopter.
A warrant for his arrest was annulled late last year.
A group of about 50 supporters, friends and relatives greeted Ortiz when he arrived at Santiago International Airport on a flight from Switzerland. Some of them carried the red flags of the Patriotic Front of Manuel Rodriguez (FPMR), of which he was a member. Chile still split over Pinochet legacy
""I am very excited, very excited, I really wasn't expecting this welcome,"" he told reporters.
""I return to my country. I return with dignity. I return after 23 years to re-unite with all my comrades. I am part of the resistance in this country,"" he added.
Ortiz is expected to stay in Chile for about three weeks before returning to Switzerland, where he has lived for more than 20 years as a political refugee.
He was sent to prison for killing a police officer during violent clashes in Santiago.
But he and three others escaped in spectacular style when a helicopter hovered over the prison and lowered a basket into which they all jumped.
Chile has previously urged Switzerland to send Ortiz back to serve out the rest of his sentence. However, in December the Chilean Supreme Court accepted an appeal by his lawyers that invalidated his arrest warrant.
Last year, Chile pressed France to extradite another of the escapees , Ricardo Palma Salamanca, who was arrested in Paris after 22 years on the run.
An estimated 3,200 people were murdered and 28,000 tortured by agents of the state during General Pinochet's dictatorship, which ended in 1990. More than 1,000 people are still listed as missing. Related Topics"
TSB pledges to refund fraud victims - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47928773," TSB has become the first UK bank to pledge to refund customers who fall victim to any type of fraud.
The ""fraud refund guarantee"" will cover cases where customers are tricked into authorising payments to fraudsters, as well as unauthorised transactions.
The move comes as the bank tries to rebuild its image after an IT meltdown last April left 1.9 million customers unable to access their own money.
Banks have been under pressure to help tackle the rise in sophisticated fraud.
Richard Meddings, acting chief executive of TSB, told Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that the move was ""about giving peace of mind to our customers and doing the right thing"".
He said: ""It's a major societal blight. Innocent customers are being tricked.""
He added that the bank was investing in education for customers and staff about fraud, but also had a message for crooks: ""If you come for one of my customers, we will hunt you down.""
Currently, victims who are tricked into transferring money directly from their account to a fraudster are less likely to be reimbursed, because they approved the payments.
Some £354m was lost last year through this type of scam, known as a ""push"" or ""authorised"" payment fraud, according to banking trade body UK Finance.
Financial firms returned just £83m of this to customers.
Examples of authorised payment fraud include fraudsters posing as builders, solicitors, or other contractors who have carried out work for the victim. They submit a fake invoice containing the fraudster's bank details and it is often not easy to spot that they are not the legitimate payee.
TSB suffers £105m loss after computer chaos Scam victims more likely to be reimbursed Investment scam targets Instagram users ""The vast majority of fraud claims across UK banking are from innocent victims of fraud who have been targeted by criminals and organised gangs.
""However, all too often these customers must fight to be refunded and are not treated as victims of crime,"" said TSB executive chairman Richard Meddings.
'Step change' TSB said its guarantee - which applies to losses from 14 April - marked a ""step change"" in the industry, where currently customers were only refunded for fraud losses in limited circumstances.
Under the guarantee, customers will need to contact the bank to report fraud and it will still investigate the fraud claim, including what happened and how, so it can inform customers and ensure they are protected from future fraud.
The bank, which has 5.2 million customers, warned it would not reimburse customers who tried to abuse the guarantee by committing fraud on their own account or by repeatedly ignoring safety advice.
Last month, banks and building societies agreed to do more to protect customers, introducing a new voluntary code which comes into effect on 28 May.
But consumer watchdog Which? said banks needed to do more.
""Other High Street banks are leaving their customers unprotected. All banks must now follow TSB's lead and ensure that their own customers are not left paying for the cost of this crime,"" said Jenny Ross, Which? money editor."

Here's your briefing on some of the most important and interesting stories happening in the week ahead. 1) Pulitzer time
On Tuesday, the winners of the 2019 Pulitzer Prizes in journalism, fiction and music will be named.
It's the most prestigious prize in journalism, and often acts as a reminder of the most important issues the world has faced over the previous year.
Last year for example, the winners included pieces about the #MeToo movement, sexual abuse by men in authority, white nationalist violence, refugees in Myanmar and the Philippines war on drugs.
If any of this year's winners are for investigations into the US president, he may well react as he did in late March, when he called for the winners to be stripped of their prizes .
2) An ' urgent ' programme airs Image copyright Getty Images
On Thursday, what's being described as an ""urgent"" documentary on climate change, fronted by Sir David Attenborough, will be broadcast in the UK.
The hour-long film on BBC One will look at some of the significant effects of climate change that are already being felt, but will also apparently take an ""unflinching"" look at what may happen in the future.
But it will also offer advice on what individuals and governments can do to prevent further damage, with Sir David reflecting on the changes he himself has witnessed over the decades.
""Sir David Attenborough might as well be narrating a horror film,"" one review says . 3) Indonesia's epic election
What's happening?
Indonesia's presidential, parliamentary and regional elections take place on Wednesday.
There's a lot to be decided in one day and whoever comes out on top will lead the world's largest Muslim country until 2024.
Logistically, the elections will be quite a feat. Take in some of these numbers: almost 245,000 candidates across the country 800,000 polling stations close to 192 million registered voters only six hours to vote about 80 million millenial voters - almost the equivalent of Germany's population
In the presidential race, it's between the incumbent, Joko Widodo, who rose from humble beginnings to run on a pro-poor platform in 2014, and Prabowo Subianto, a former military general he defeated last time around.

They said onboard recorders suggested that the blaze had spread rapidly through the plane.
The findings contradict Egypt's earlier statements that explosives had been found on victims' remains, suggesting the aircraft had been bombed.
Sixty-six passengers and crew died when the flight from Paris to Cairo came down over the eastern Mediterranean. EgyptAir flight MS804: What we know
France's civil aviation accident bureau, known as BEA, said in a press release on Friday that ""the most likely hypothesis is that a fire broke out in the cockpit while the aeroplane was flying at its cruise altitude and that the fire spread rapidly resulting in the loss of control of the aeroplane"".
The agency said that the crew could be heard discussing a fire on the cockpit voice recorder and that systems on board had detected smoke inside the aircraft.
Egyptian officials previously said that the crash - which came seven months after a Russian plane was brought down by a bomb over the Sinai peninsula - was likely to have been a terrorist incident.
The BEA has said it is awaiting Egypt's final report into the crash to understand the differences in their conclusions.
Thirty Egyptians, 15 French nationals and one Briton were among the dead. Related Topics"

What happened?
A row erupted over a letter from retired Indian military officers urging President Ram Nath Kovind to ensure that political parties do not use the armed forces to ""further their political agendas"".
The letter, which is signed by eight former service chiefs and more than 100 veterans, is addressed to the president. It was sent to various Indian publications on Thursday night - the first day of voting in the Indian election.
""We appeal to to you to ensure that the secular and a-political character of the Armed Forces is preserved,"" the letter said.
It referred to the ""unusual and completely unacceptable practice of political leaders taking credit for military operations like cross-border air strikes, and even going so far as to claim the Armed Forces to be 'Modiji ka sena' [Modi's army]"". Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Mod has made national security a key plank in his election campaign
But on Friday the president's office denied that it received such a letter - and some some of the veterans, including former service chiefs, distanced themselves from it, saying they had not signed it.
""I don't agree with whatever has been written in that letter. We have been misquoted,"" retired air marshal NC Suri told ANI news agency that he didn't sign the letter .
""I wrote that armed forces are apolitical and support the politically elected government. And no, my consent has not been taken for any such letter,"" he said.
But other signatories appeared to stand by the letter. Kapil Kak, a retired air vice-marshal, told The Hindu newspaper that he agrees with everything in the letter, adding that ""the letter was sent by email and endorsement was also given over email"".
Why does this matter?
It's an interesting development, especially since the letter appeared on the first day of voting in an election that is largely being seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
It also specifically refers to Mr Modi and the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which have drawn flak for including India's recent strikes in Pakistani territory in their election campaign.
At a rally earlier in the week, Mr Modi asked first-time voters to vote for ""those who carried out the air strike"". Local media reported that India's election body had asked its officials to investigate the remarks.
And Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and a close ally of Mr Modi, landed in trouble for calling the Indian army ""Modi's army"".
Some analysts believe that Mr Modi and his party may get a boost ahead of voting because of the narrative they have adopted over the attack. How do you vote in the election?

Two men died amid clashes at polling booths in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh while one person died in Indian-administered Kashmir as protests broke out in Kupwara district after polling, according to local media. As it happened: First day of voting
Long queues dominated the first phase of polling, as voters turned up in high numbers across 18 states and two union territories.
The election commission said that turnout on Thursday was more or less on par with polling during the first phase the 2014 polls.
The hilly north-eastern state of Tripura recorded the highest voter turnout at 81.8% while the eastern state of Bihar saw the lowest at 50%.

Hundreds of voters began to queue up outside polling centres early Thursday morning for the first of seven days of voting over six weeks. Their concerns ranged from jobs and unemployment to India's role in the world and national security.
The states and union territories that went to the polls were: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar islands and Lakshadweep.
Polling in some states, such as Andhra Pradesh and Nagaland, concluded in one day. But other states, such as Uttar Pradesh, will hold polls in several phases. On Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi filed his nomination
What happened?
India's main opposition party president Rahul Gandhi has filed his nomination in his family stronghold Amethi, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
He travelled to the district office in a 3km procession where he was cheered by thousands of party supporters.
He has been the MP of the constituency for 15 years and is campaigning for a fourth term.
Why does this matter?
Rahul Gandhi's performance in Amethi - a seat he has already won three times - will be closely watched.
In 2014, he won by a majority of a little over 100,000 votes - which was seen as being too close given that the constituency is seen as a family stronghold. He is up against his same rival from then - BJP MP Smriti Irani who led a spirited campaign against him.
Ms Irani has wasted no time attacking Mr Gandhi.
His decision to also contest from Wayanad in the southern state of Kerala has been called an ""insult"" by Ms Irani. Some of his critics have said that the second nomination showed that he was afraid that he would lose in Amethi, although the party says it is actually to allow the party to build a base in the south.
Be that as it may, losing Amethi is just not an option for Mr Gandhi. There is way too much at his stake - most of all his reputation and credibility as a leader.
His supporters are confident though. One of them told the BBC's Geeta Pandey who is at the rally, that this time Mr Gandhi would win by 500,000 votes and no-one would vote for Ms Irani. NaMo TV tests limits of Election Commission
What is happening?
NaMo TV - a television channel dedicated to streaming speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi - has continued doing so despite a 48 hour ""blackout"" that news organisations are expected to adhere to before voting. This means that no speeches by politicians, advertisements or other content that could ""sway voters"" can be broadcast during this period.
But with voting due to begin in less than 24 hours, the channel is broadcasting speeches by Mr Modi non-stop.
Why does it matter?
Firstly, this looks to be a direct violation of the Election Commission's guidelines, although the government has said that NaMo TV is a ""platform service"" offered by cable operators as a ""special service"". Some cable operators had initially listed it as a ""Hindi news channel"" but this was quickly withdrawn.
As a ""special platform service"", the government says the channel does not require license or permission to broadcast content.
Yet as the Indian Express newspaper points out, the decision to continue broadcasting Mr Modi's speeches may contravene a section in the guidelines that prohibits display of ""any election matter by means of cinematography, television or other similar apparatus"" in the 48-hour period before polling concludes in an area.
""The legal and definitional confusion about NaMo TV has arisen only because no one so far has exploited this loophole in existing broadcast regulation on such a massive scale,"" writes MK Venu in the Wire website .
The channel has, in fact, been mired in controversy since it quietly launched on all India's major satellite service providers 10 days ago.
Despite it being unveiled on Twitter on the official account of Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mr Modi himself told a local news station that ""I am told some people have launched a channel though I have not had time to see it myself"".
There is no information on who owns the channel or even from where they are sourcing their content. On Tuesday... Rahul Gandhi faced an unusual battle
What happened?
India's main opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, is up against candidates who have the same name as him - well, almost.
He will be running against a 30-year-old local politician named Raghul Gandhi in Wayanad in the southern state of Kerala.
But there is a third candidate named Rahul Gandhi who has also thrown his hat in to the ring.
Why does this matter?
Rival parties are known to put up candidates with similar or same names to confuse voters, says BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi, adding that this happens frequently in other constituencies as well.
But Raghul Gandhi told the BBC that he was not in the race because his name was uncannily similar to that of his rival. Both filed their nomination papers on 4 April.
""He is a national leader and I am a small state-level leader. I am a serious candidate,"" he said.
The BBC was unable to contact the third candidate.
Wayanad is considered a Congress party stronghold - so it may not be unusual to find people named after party leaders. Raghul Gandhi's father was a member of the party and his sister is named Indira, after the former prime minister.
Does Raghul Gandhi think he will win? ""I expect to get my money back. For that, I should get one third of the votes of the winning candidate. That will be victory for me,"" he said. Former finance minister: 'India can afford minimum income scheme'
What is happening?
In an interview with BBC Tamil, India's former finance minister P Chidambaram has defended his opposition Congress party's pledge to create ""the world's largest minimum income scheme"".
The scheme, which is called Nyay (Justice), guarantees a basic income of 72,000 rupees ($1,035; £791) yearly to 50 million of India's poorest families. At an estimated cost of $52bn, it's Congress' biggest offering to voters so far.
""We now have the capacity to implement a scheme of this nature,"" Mr Chidambaram said, adding that it was possible given India's GDP, its projected growth over the next five years and the total expenditure by central and state governments.

""We could not have done this 20 years ago. We could not have done it even 10 years ago. But today we believe India has the capacity to directly address the issue of poverty among the bottom 20% of Indian people,"" he said.
Why is this important?
Since the Congress party released details about the scheme last month in its manifesto, opponents have questioned how the party plans to fund such a mammoth scheme.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley slammed the party over its pledge, calling it a ""bluff announcement"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption P Chidambaram says India is now in a position to tackle poverty
""A party with such a terrible track record of poverty alleviation has no right to make lofty assurances,"" Mr Jaitley told reporters on 24 March.
At a rally in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, PM Narendra Modi also attacked the scheme - referring to it as a a ""big scam"".
Others in the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have said that India's poor are already receiving more support under existing schemes.
But given the scale of the Congress' scheme, it is likely to capture the imagination of voters - and the BJP could see that as a threat. India votes 2019 "

Fukushima: Japan begins removal of nuclear fuel from damaged reactor - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47933031,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tepco officials showed images of remote-controlled equipment lifting the fuel rods The operator of Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant has begun removing nuclear fuel from a building housing one of the reactors that melted down after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
Remotely controlled equipment is lifting fuel rods from a storage pool near reactor number three.
The delicate work at the contaminated site is expected to take two years.
The next phase of the huge clean-up at reactor three will be to remove molten nuclear fuel that remains deep inside.
A spokeswoman for the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said the operation to remove the fuel had been delayed by earthquake debris inside the building as well as other technical issues.
Reactor buildings at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant were damaged by hydrogen explosions caused by the earthquake and tsunami. Three reactors melted down.

Radioactive gases could be released if the cylinders break or are exposed to air.

The removal of molten nuclear fuel from inside the reactor number three building is not expected to begin until 2021 and is considered to be the most difficult part of the clean-up.
Country profile Tepco says it plans to start removing fuel from the buildings housing reactors one and two, which also melted down, in 2023. In 2014 engineers removed fuel rods from near reactor four, which was offline at the time of the tsunami and, although damaged, did not suffer a meltdown.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Fuel will be lifted from the crippled reactor and taken away for storage elsewhere The latest stage of the massive clean-up comes weeks after an evacuation order for one of two towns near the plant was lifted , allowing residents back for the first time since the disaster.
About 50 people were allowed to return to areas of Okuma, west of the Daiichi plant, after radiation levels were deemed safe.
However, correspondents say radiation remains a major concern for residents and the vast majority of the town's original inhabitants are unlikely to go back.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Fuel from the storage pool at reactor four at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant was removed in 2014 The disaster at the nuclear power plant, about 62km (39 miles) south-east of the city of Fukushima, forced more than 470,000 people to be evacuated.
Though no-one died as a direct result of the nuclear meltdown, Tepco has paid out compensation to some of those affected.
More than 40 patients had to be evacuated from a hospital in the area and later died, while other deaths have been linked to the trauma suffered by those who lost their homes and loved ones.
In 2017, three former Tepco executives went on trial charged with professional negligence linked to the hospital evacuation.
Nearly 18,500 people were killed or went missing after the 2011 earthquake triggered a massive tsunami."
Under-18s face 'like' and 'streaks' bans on social media - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47933521,"Australia targets tech firms with 'abhorrent material' laws
The Internet Association UK - which represents Facebook, Snap and other tech firms - has already raised concerns.
""Any new guidelines must be technically possible to implement in practice, and not stifle innovation and opportunities for smaller platforms,"" said its executive director Daniel Dyball.
""We must be careful when designing regulation to ensure any technical challenges, particularly around age verification, are understood and taken into consideration."" Bad nudges
Restrictions on Facebook's like button - which registers a user's interest in another user or advertiser's post - and Snapchat streaks - which count the number of consecutive days two members have messaged each other - are not the only nudge behaviours being targeted.
The ICO also says that apps should not: show boxes where the Yes button is much bigger than that for No use language that presents a data-sharing option in a much more positive light than the alternative make it much more cumbersome to select the high-privacy option by, for example, requiring more clicks to turn it on Image copyright ICO Image caption The ICO says nudge techniques like those above encourage children to make poor privacy decisions
These, it said, exploit ""human susceptibility to reward-seeking behaviours in order to keep users online"".
However, the regulator said it was appropriate in some cases to use nudges that encourage children to opt for privacy-enhancing settings, or to take a break after using an online service for some time.
The ICO's rules follow a proposal from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) for the creation of an independent tech watchdog that would write its own ""code of practice"" for online companies.
The suggestions have already been welcomed by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).
""Social networks have continually failed to prioritise child safety in their design, which has resulted in tragic consequences,"" commented the charity's Andy Burrows.
""This design code from the ICO is a really significant package of measures, but it must go hand in hand with the government following through on its commitment to enshrine in law a new duty of care on social networks and an independent regulator with powers to investigate and fine.""
But the code has drawn criticism from the Adam Smith Institute think tank.
""The ICO is an unelected quango introducing draconian limitations on the internet with the threat of massive fines,"" said its head of research Matthew Lesh.
""It is ridiculous to infantilise people and treat everyone as children."" Analysis: Image copyright PA Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent
This new proposed code arrives a week after the sweeping new regulatory powers outlined in the government's Online Harms White Paper and with much less of a fanfare.
But whereas the all-powerful regulator is unlikely to be in place for many months or even years, the Information Commissioner's Office expects to get its Children's Code of Practice into law this summer.
That means that Facebook and Instagram - among others - will need to think rapidly about whether their platforms risk breaking the new rules.
The ICO made clear this morning that its problem with ""likes"" and ""streaks"" is not the features themselves but how they are used to collect data and target children with advertising.
So, if the platforms want to hold on to what they regard as useful elements of the social media experience, they'll have to show they work differently for children than for adults.
The other key demand from the data watchdog is to make the default privacy settings for platforms suitable for everyone including children.
That will mean adults having to opt in to the kind of data collection which is a key part of the business model of social media firms - so this code could pose a real threat to their bottom line."
Sudan crisis: Protest leaders demand end of 'deep state' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47933742,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sudan protesters keep up pressure in Khartoum Organisers of mass protests in Sudan have told the BBC they want the full dismantling of the ""deep state"" left behind by ousted leader Omar al-Bashir.
A spokesman said leaders of the past regime should be put on trial.
Mr Bashir was toppled by the army last week after 30 years in power and a military council has pledged elections in two-years time.
But protesters remain camped outside army HQ in the capital, Khartoum, demanding a civilian administration.
Sudan unrest: The key questions How Sudan's strongmen stayed in power Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa? Reports on Monday said there had been efforts to disperse the sit-in but protesters joined hands and troops stepped back from a confrontation.
The crowd chanted ""Freedom"" and ""Revolution"", and appealed to soldiers to protect them, witnesses said.
The Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA) which has spearheaded the protests, urged supporters to foil any attempt to disperse the sit-in.
""We hope that everyone will head immediately to the areas of the sit-in to protect your revolution and your accomplishments,"" it said in a statement.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Troops have so far avoided a direct clash with protesters in Khartoum On Sunday the transitional military council sought to appease protest leaders, telling them that key figures from the former government had been arrested. It is not clear who those officials are.
A military spokesman also promised not to disperse protesters and said the council was ""ready to implement"" whatever civilian government the opposition parties agreed.
In another development, 13 people were reportedly killed in an armed attack on protesters in the troubled region of South Darfur over the weekend.
""Gunmen"" attacked the anti-government protest at a camp for displaced people about 17km (10 miles) east of the regional capital, Nyala, according to the privately owned Darfur 24 news website.
Mr Bashir has been indicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur by the International Criminal Court. He denies any wrongdoing.
What are protesters demanding? Amjad Farid, an SPA spokesman, told the BBC that they ""completely rejected"" the military council currently leading Sudan.
He said demands included the ""full dissolution of the deep state"" and the dismantling of state intelligence agencies.
Opposition politician Mubarak al Fadil told the BBC that the role of the military should decrease over time.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Protesters show no signs of quitting their sit-in outside the army complex Meanwhile, protesters in Khartoum remained in defiant mood.
""We are here to remove the entire system, a system that does not give service equally to the people,"" Mohammed Jakur told AFP news agency. ""A system that leave[s] people under poverty. A system that does not allow Sudan, as a rich country with human and natural resources, to act as any other country in the world.""
A fragile trust Analysis by Alastair Leithead, BBC Africa correspondent
Huge change has come to Sudan in just a few days, but the street protesters want more - to ensure the risks they have taken will shape the future of the country.
At this point trust is hard-won and easily lost. If those still demonstrating outside the military headquarters are forcibly dispersed, that trust will be shattered, as the transitional military council has promised this will not happen.
Many concessions have already been made - the arrest of former government figures, new heads of the army, police and the security service, and a promise the opposition can choose a new prime minister.
The question is where the line is drawn - between where the demonstrators are satisfied their demands will be met, and the point when the military leaders feel they cannot give any more.
What has the military said? In a news conference on Sunday, spokesman Maj Gen Shams Ad-din Shanto said the military council was ""ready to implement"" whatever civilian government the opposition parties agreed.
""We won't appoint a PM. They'll choose one,"" he said.
He also said the army would not remove protesters from their sit-in by force, but called on the crowds ""to let normal life resume"" and stop unauthorised roadblocks.
""Taking up arms will not be tolerated,"" he added.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Protesters demand a civilian-led administration The military council also announced a raft of decisions, including:
New heads of the army and the police A new head of the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) Committees to fight corruption, and to investigate the former ruling party The lifting of all media restrictions and censorship The release of police and security officers detained for supporting protesters A review of diplomatic missions, and the dismissal of Sudan's ambassadors to the US and to the UN in Geneva What is the SPA? It was formed in 2016 and includes an array of professional groups including doctors, lawyers, journalists, university professors and engineers.
The pro-opposition umbrella group says it was established to counter Sudan's mainstream trade unions which stood accused of being pro-government.
In 2018, with inflation rising and the value of the national currency falling, the SPA was at the forefront of campaigning for a national minimum wage.

But its profile was raised on 1 January when it published a Declaration of Freedom and Change , calling for ""the immediate unconditional departure of Bashir and his regime"". It has since listed more than 20 civil society groups and opposition parties that have signed up to the declaration.
Although it has taken on a more political role, it has no organisational structure and holds no records of the number of its members, SPA spokesman Mohamed Youssef al-Mustafa told AFP news agency in January. Its website lists no leaders, only a number of spokespeople.
In recent months the group has used a Facebook page to publish a weekly schedule of planned protests ranging from sit-ins to marches.
What's the background to the protests? Demonstrations began in December over a steep rise in the cost of living but soon developed into a wider call for the removal of Mr Bashir and his government.
Then last Thursday the military removed and detained the veteran leader after nearly 30 years in power.
Coup leader Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf announced the military would oversee a two-year transitional period followed by elections and imposed a three-month state of emergency.
Sudan military coup topples Bashir Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here But demonstrators vowed to stay on the streets unless there was an immediate switch to civilian government.
Mr Ibn Auf himself stood down the next day and was subsequently sent into retirement.
Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan was then named as head of the transitional military council, to become Sudan's third leader in as many days.

Mr Bashir's whereabouts are unknown, but military leaders said he was in a secure place.
The military council has said it will not extradite Mr Bashir to face accusations in the International Criminal Court, although he could well be put on trial in Sudan."
Jack Ma defends the 'blessing' of a 12-hour working day - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47934513," Image caption Jack Ma is stepping down as Alibaba's executive chairman The Chinese billionaire and co-founder of the online shopping giant Alibaba has continued to argue for a 9am to 9pm working day, and a six-day week.
Jack Ma's backing for the so-called ""996 system"" is being hotly debated in the Chinese media.
Last week, Mr Ma wrote that without the system, China's economy was ""very likely to lose vitality and impetus"".
His stance was backed by fellow tech entrepreneur Richard Liu, the boss of ecommerce giant JD.com.
On Friday, Mr Ma called the opportunity to work 996 hours a ""blessing"".
Jack Ma to step down Five things about Jack Ma Mr Liu said years of rapid economic growth in China had boosted the number of ""slackers"".
The country has enjoyed economic growth averaging 10% for more than 25 years - from the late 1970s to the mid 2000s - but in subsequent years that has slowed to nearer 6%.
The entrepreneurs' comments come amid reports this week that JD.com is cutting jobs.
Mr Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, recently wrote about his attitude to work, saying he used to set his alarm to wake him up every two hours to make sure he could offer his customers a full, 24-hour, service.
Quote: : ""JD in the last four, five years has not made any eliminations, so the number of staff has expanded rapidly, the number of people giving orders has grown and grown, while the those who are working have fallen.
""Instead, the number of slackers has rapidly grown! If this carries on, JD will have no hope! And the company will only be heartlessly kicked out of the market! Slackers are not my brothers!""
Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba, sometimes called China's eBay, in 1999 and has seen it become one of the world's biggest internet companies.
The company's market value is now approximately $490bn (£374bn), and Mr Ma's personal wealth is estimated at around $40bn.
Last year, he announced that he would step down as executive chairman in the near future.

Pro-life legal action on University of Aberdeen abortion stance - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-47934192,"Image copyright University of Aberdeen An anti-abortion group has launched legal action against the University of Aberdeen and its student association for alleged ""unlawful discrimination"".
Aberdeen Life Ethics Society (Ales) claims a students' association policy of ""deplatforming pro-life student societies"" violates equality and human rights laws.
Papers have been lodged at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.
A University of Aberdeen spokesperson said it was an ""inclusive community"".
Ales believes it is being unfairly denied a presence on campus.
It said the legal action followed ""repeated efforts to resolve this problem through internal bureaucratic channels"".
'Restitution and vindication' The group said a pro-life position ""may be an unpopular minority opinion"" on the campus, but that it was fully protected by law.
Ales confirmed in a statement: ""The Aberdeen Life Ethics Society filed suit in Aberdeen Sheriff Court against both the Aberdeen University Students' Association (Ausa) and the University of Aberdeen, alleging unlawful discrimination against the society and the violation of rights protected by UK law.
""The lawsuit asks the court to declare that Ausa's policy of deplatforming pro-life student societies is incompatible with existing Equality and Human Rights law.
""Furthermore, it asks the court to recommend that Ales be affiliated to the students' association, complete with the benefits and privileges that other societies enjoy.""
'Recognises different beliefs' It added: ""All good faith avenues for resolution have been exhausted and Ales is now forced to turn to the legal system for restitution and vindication.""
Ausa said in a statement:: ""At this stage we cannot comment on the legal actions taken by the Aberdeen Life Ethics Society.
""However following a complaint raised by the Ales, Ausa's Board of Trustees reviewed the matter and after deliberations, Ales were invited to re-apply for affiliation as an Ausa society, with the reassurance that the application would be treated in the same way as any other.
""However to date no application has been received.""
A University of Aberdeen spokesperson said: ""The University is an inclusive community and recognises different beliefs, values and cultures.
""Student societies and clubs sit with the Aberdeen University Students' Association."""
EU approves new trade talks with US - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Andrew Walker Bbc World Service Economics Correspondent,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47935831," France does not want farm tariffs to be included in trade talks European Union countries have approved plans for trade talks with the United States.
President Donald Trump and the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed last year that they wanted to reduce trade barriers.
The decision by EU ministers gives the Commission authorisation to conduct formal talks.
But there is already a disagreement over whether farm goods should be covered by the talks.
If the talks do get going, it would not be the first attempt by the two sides to make a bilateral trade agreement.
Under President Barack Obama, the US and the EU had a programme of negotiations known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP.
US proposes tariffs on EU cheese and wine It was very controversial, especially in Europe. Among the many criticisms from campaigners was the view that it would have given too much scope for international businesses to challenge the decisions of elected governments.
In any event, TTIP was abandoned.
The proposals now coming out of Brussels are much less wide-ranging than TTIP was.
Breaking barriers EU ministers have given the Commission - which conducts trade talks on the group's behalf - a mandate to negotiate on two tracks.
One is to seek the elimination of tariffs (taxes on imports) on industrial goods on a ""reciprocal basis"".
The second is intended to reduce regulatory barriers to trade, specifically in an area known as conformity assessment. That is the procedure by which regulators ensure that goods comply with, for example, safety rules before they are made available for sale.
The idea is to develop arrangements that would enable an agency in the EU (or the US) to certify that a product complies with all the relevant rules in the US (or the EU).
Getting goods assessed by an agency in a firm's home country can be cheaper and less difficult. The Commission says this is especially an issue for smaller businesses.
Analysis by the Commission said that eliminating tariffs could boost EU exports to the US by 7% and slightly more for goods shipped in the opposite direction.
French opposition The EU's decision was not unanimous. France voted against and Belgium abstained.
French officials in particular are reported to be opposed to trade negotiations with the US because of the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on tackling climate change.
France has, however, been outvoted. But the negotiating guidelines given to the Commission do respect French concerns in that they do not allow for talks on cutting tariffs on agricultural goods.
This could be a major obstacle to negotiations , because the US does want farm goods included.
Germany was particularly keen to make progress with the talks.
President Trump is considering new tariffs on car imports. The US is an important market for German carmakers and getting the talks going could reduce the risk that the US might act.
The bilateral tension was increased further last week, when the US announced a list of European goods for extra tariffs in retaliation for subsidies to the aircraft maker Airbus. The US has won a World Trade Organization dispute in which it claimed the subsidies were prohibited under WTO rules.
The US is waiting for a WTO arbitrator to rule on how much retaliation it can apply. The EU has also won a case against the US over aviation subsidies to Boeing."
Article 13: UK helps push through new EU copyright rules - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47933530," Image caption The new law makes tech firms responsible for the copyright of the content their users edit and upload A revamp of the EU's copyright rules has passed its final hurdle and will now come into law.
The rules include a section known as Article 13.
It says that if users upload infringing content to a service, the tech firm involved must either make a ""best effort"" to get permission from the rights holders or quickly remove it.
The UK was among 19 nations that supported the law in its European Council vote .
But Poland was one of those that objected on the grounds that it could pave the way to internet censorship.
EU sources say that five other countries also opposed the rules - Italy, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - while Belgium, Estonia and Slovenia abstained.
Google had led lobbying efforts against the law's introduction.
EU backs controversial copyright law What is Article 13? 'Disastrous' copyright bill vote approved At one point it had featured pop-up notices on its YouTube video-streaming service warning that the effort could have ""unintended consequences"", including the blocking of some of its clips to EU-based members.
In particular, there was concern that memes featuring clips from TV shows and films could no longer be shared. However, tweaks to the law subsequently made an exception for content used for the ""purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"".
Even so, there is still a concern that smaller sites will struggle to track down and pay copyright holders or to develop content filters that automatically block suspect material.
Another controversial rule - which says that search engines and social media providers will have to pay news publishers to feature snippets of their content - also remains.
Wikipedia blacked out four of its European sites in protest last month . It said the rules would make information harder to find online and thus make it harder for its volunteers to source information.
But European media industry leaders have welcomed the effort.
""Publishers of all sizes, and other creators, will now have the right to set terms and conditions for others to reuse their content commercially, as is only fair and appropriate,"" commented Xavier Bouckaert, president of the European Magazine Media Association .
Helen Smith, executive chair of the Independent Music Companies Association, added: ""It was a long road and we would like to thank everyone who contributed to the discussion. As a result, we now have a balanced text that sets a precedent for the rest of the world to follow, by putting citizens and creators at the heart of the reform and introducing clear rules for online platforms.""
The EU's member states now have two years to adopt the rules into their national laws.

No police investigation into tourism boss expenses - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-47935291,"No police investigation into tourism boss expenses 15 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sir Gary Verity led Welcome to Yorkshire for 10 years before resigning in March Police will not carry out their own investigation into expenses claims made by the former chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire.
Sir Gary Verity paid back £40,000 before resigning on health grounds last month.
West Yorkshire Police said it would await the findings of an independent investigation commissioned by the tourism company.
Lib Dem peer Lord Scriven said he was ""astounded"" by the force's decision.
Last month the former leader of Sheffield City Council wrote to the chief constable of West Yorkshire, asking for the force to investigate expenses claims made by Sir Gary .
A force spokesman said that following a meeting with Welcome to Yorkshire representatives it had agreed the full findings of an independent review will be shared with the force.
It added that if any evidence was identified of criminal offences it would be brought to their ""immediate attention"". Image copyright Local Democracy Reporting Service Image caption Lord Scriven had called for a police inquiry into Sir Gary Verity's expenses at Welcome to Yorkshire
Responding to the decision, Lord Scriven said the force had ""taken at face value the word of the very organisation who have overseen the poor governance and financial control that has led to at least £40,000 being claimed when it shouldn't have.
""I feel the force haven't carried out their duties in full and I will now consider referring this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.""
Earlier this month, Welcome to Yorkshire announced it would commission two independent investigations into Sir Gary's tenure at the company, which has received millions of pounds of public funding.
At the time of his resignation, it said Sir Gary resigned on health grounds but an investigation found he had ""made errors of judgement regarding his expenses"".
Responding to the claim he repaid £40,000 in expenses before quitting, a spokeswoman for Sir Gary said: ""Expenses were submitted in the ordinary course and signed off.

The dramatic hunt for the fish pirates exploiting our seas,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190213-the-dramatic-hunt-for-the-fish-pirates-exploiting-our-seas,"Crime The hunt for the fish pirates who exploit the sea For 10 years, a rogue fishing vessel and its crew plundered the world’s oceans, escaping repeated attempts of capture. Then a dramatic pursuit across the high seas finally netted the one that got away. By Richard Gray 18 February 2019
In the haze of an overcast April afternoon, the rust-stained hull of the Andrey Dolgov slapped its way through the ocean swell, oily water gushing from the ship’s waterlogged bilge as it made a desperate attempt to flee.
Pursued by a sleek, heavily armed naval patrol boat, the ungainly fishing vessel had little hope of escape. A drone and surveillance aircraft circled overhead while the Indonesian navy ship bore quickly down, closing a trap that had been months in the making. The crew of the Andrey Dolgov surrendered.
It seems hard to believe that this creaking, corroded vessel was one of the most wanted on the high seas. Yet it slipped through the authorities’ fingers on several occasions and managed to elude ships sent to chase it across the ocean.

The Andrey Dolgov, or STS-50 or Sea Breez 1 as it also sometimes called itself, had been plundering the oceans of their most valuable living resource – fish. It was part of an international organised criminal network that thrives between the blurred lines of maritime law and on the corruption of officials.
The operation to capture the vessel and its crew was the culmination of months of international cooperation between police and maritime authorities, painstaking detective work and satellite tracking worthy of a spy thriller.
“The captain and the crew were shocked to have been caught,” says Andreas Aditya Salim, part of the presidential taskforce in Indonesia that led the operation to snare the Andrey Dolgov. “They tried to say they did not go fishing as the refrigerator and other parts of the vessel were broken.” View image of An overhead view of the Andrey Dolgov (Credit: Sea Shepherd)
When Indonesian naval officers boarded the ship after ambushing it at the mouth of the Strait of Malacca, a major shipping lane between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, they found a huge stack of 600 finely meshed gill nets that could stretch up to 18 miles (around 29km) in length if deployed.
In a single trip the nets allowed those on board to haul up $6m (£4.56m) worth of fish, illegally taking it ashore where it was either sold on the black market or mixed with legal catches for sale. Ultimately the fish ends up on supermarket shelves, in restaurants and on people’s tables. (Watch the video below on the mission to catch the FV Viking)
“Approximately 20% of all global catch is illegal, unreported or unregulated,” explains Katie St John Glew, a marine biologist at the National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southampton. And the impacts are widespread, hurting the fish stocks themselves, the fishing industry and consumer trust. “If illegal fishing ultimately could result in stocks collapsing, this will then affect the livelihood of fishers across the globe.”
Over the 10 years or so it is thought to have been operating illegally, the Andrey Dolgov is estimated to have looted up to $50m (£38m) worth of fish from the oceans
Over the 10 years or so it is thought to have been operating illegally, the Andrey Dolgov is estimated to have looted up to $50m (£38m) worth of fish from the oceans. With that kind of money to be made, it is easy to see why it illegal fishing is a tempting enterprise for criminal organisations.
“These vessels operate in international waters outside the jurisdiction of nation states,” says Alistair McDonnell, part of the fisheries crime team at Interpol who helped coordinate the hunt for the Andrey Dolgov. “This is something that the criminals exploit.” View image of A patagonian toothfish (Credit: Christopher Jones/NOAA)
But the effect of this exploitation runs deeper than an opportunity for criminals to make money. It is often involves the corruption of public officials, fraud, money laundering and slavery – many of the crews on board these vessels are forced labour, imprisoned on a boat out at sea, often thousands of miles from home.
Then there is the environmental impact.
“Illegal fishing is one of the greatest threats to sustainable fisheries,” explains Matthew Camilleri, head of fisheries at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. “The fishing gear they use can also be very destructive to fragile ecosystems like coral reefs. This is why the international community is putting a lot of effort into combating it.”
The Andrey Dolgov did not begin its life as an illegal fishing vessel. Built in 1985, the 54m-long (178ft) vessel was constructed as a tuna longline fishing boat at the Kanasashi Zosen shipyards at the scenic port of Shimizu in Japan, in the shadow of the volcanic Mount Fuji. Sailing as the Shinsei Maru No 2, the 570-ton boat operated for years legally under the Japanese flag in the Pacific and Indian Oceans for the Japanese seafood company Maruha Nichiro Corporation.
The vessel then appears to have changed hands a number of times after 1995 before it ended up sailing under the Filipino flag as the Sun Tai 2 until about 2008 when it joined the Republic of Korea’s fishing fleet, changing hands at least four times in under a year to owners including a Mr Boo-In Park and the STD Fisheries Corporation.

At some point between 2008 and 2015, the vessel appears to have been refitted as an Antarctic toothfish boat, capable of operating in the wild Southern Ocean and storing fish for long periods on board. Toothfish are highly prized in restaurants around the world, sometimes referred to as ""white gold"" due to their value , but require specific licenses to fish.
While the boat is suspected of having been fishing illegally for at least 10 years, it first came to the attention of the authorities on the international stage in October 2016 when Chinese officials found it trying to offload toothfish that had been caught illegally. By now the boat was called the Andrey Dolgov and was flying the Cambodian flag, operated by a company registered in Belize. A year earlier it had been photographed off the coast of Punta Arena , on the southern tip of Chile’s Patagonian region, indicating it had been fishing in the Southern Ocean.
But before the Chinese authorities could take further action, the vessel and its crew fled across the Indian Ocean. This time, however, the vessel had been listed as IUU – illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. This meant when the crew tried to enter the port again in Mauritius it was denied entry.

By January 2017 the vessel had been renamed the Sea Breez 1 under a Togo flag. Togo later struck the vessel off the registry, but as it moved from port to port, and the vessel changed name again to AYDA. When it arrived at ports, the crew presented forged documents to obscure its identity and it claimed a to belong to at least eight different flag states including Togo, Nigeria and Bolivia.
They are essentially committing identity fraud by repeatedly falsifying their registry - Alistair McDonnell
“It’s a common tactic,” says McDonnell. “They are essentially committing identity fraud by repeatedly falsifying their registry. Only flag states have jurisdiction over vessels when they are more than 200 miles from a coast, but these vessels claim flags of states that have no fisheries legislation to cover it and are not subject to any international fisheries treaties.”
Illegal fishing vessels also regularly change the flags they fly, claiming nationalities of states that have denounced them.
“Coastal states may consider them a high-risk vessel, without the protection of a flag state, and therefore stateless,” says McDonnell.
Finally, in February 2018, the authorities caught up with the Andrey Dolgov again at a port in Madagascar when the captain of a vessel claiming to be the STS-50 provided a false International Marine Organisation number – which every vessel on the ocean above a certain size must have – and forged documents. Madagascar alerted the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which regulates fishing in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica.

Again, the boat and its crew fled, but this time they left a trail behind. The vessel had been fitted with an automatic transponder system, which is used to help prevent collisions between ships at sea. This automatic identification system, known as AIS, broadcasts a location signal that can be picked up by radio equipment and overhead satellites.
Simultaneously the vessel appeared to be off the coast of the Falklands, Fiji and Norway – thousands of miles apart
But there was a problem. When officials plugged the AIS identification number for the vessel into their system, they were presented with a spaghetti of tracks all over the world. Simultaneously the vessel appeared to be off the coast of the Falklands, Fiji and Norway – thousands of miles apart.
“They were obscuring their identity by spoofing their AIS,” explains Charles Kilgour, who at the time was senior fisheries analyst at OceanMind, a British non-profit organisation that analyses data from fishing vessels at sea. It was a technique that allowed the Andrey Dolgov to appear to be in almost 100 different locations at once.
The mission to catch Andrey Dolgov spanned the globe
But then its pursuers received another alert – the Andrey Dolgov had popped up just off the coast of Maputo, in Mozambique’s waters. An inspection team found fishing gear on board and forged registration documents. They officially “detained” the vessel, seizing its documents and the crew’s passports, but before they could investigate further, the Andrey Dolgov absconded, slipping through the fingers of the authorities again.
This time, however, Kilgour and his team had a positive identification of the exact time and location of the Andrey Dolgov. Using a passing satellite, they were able capture radar images of the fishing vessel while it was at anchorage off Maputo, helping them to clarify which of the AIS tracks they were seeing was the right one. View image of The Andrey Dolgov was photographed by a drone during the pursuit (Credit: Sea Shepherd)
“We use algorithms to identify potential vessels from the synthetic aperture radar images,” says Kilgour, who now works for Global Fishing Watch, a Google-backed project to monitor fishing vessels around the world, but was speaking about his work with OceanMind. “Any large metal vessel shows up quite clearly. Then we correlate that with the AIS data we have.”
The team at OceanMind also use infrared satellite imaging, which allows them to pick up lights from fishing vessels at night. With the additional information they now had, they were able to pinpoint which of the AIS tracks belonged to the Andrey Dolgov.
Meanwhile a vessel owned by marine conservation organisation Sea Shepherd, which had been taking part in a joint operation in Tanzania with other African fishing authorities, took up the pursuit. Under the command of the Tanzanian navy, it chased the Andrey Dolgov for several days towards the Seychelles, sending back images of it from a drone, further helping to confirm its identity.
“The fishing vessel left Mozambique’s waters to find refuge on the high seas,” says Peter Hammarstedt, director of campaigns at Sea Shepherd. “What was amazing was the Tanzanian authorities decided to leave their own waters to pursue it even though it hadn’t committed crime in Tanzania or entered its waters.”
Without the authority to board the vessel outside Tanzanian waters, however, they were eventually forced to give up the chase. View image of The F/V Viking is blown up (Credit: Getty Images)
Kilgour and his team gave Interpol updates about the fleeing fishing boat’s position every four hours, using its speed and direction to calculate where it might be heading.
For most states, there is a reluctance to give chase and seize rogue vessels like this. The jurisdictional quagmire makes it tricky, but then there is also the expense of such a seizure. The vessels – often badly maintained – can be a pollution risk, they often need to be repaired, the catch on board needs to be disposed of safely and the crew need to be repatriated. Pests can be a problem on board and you must also post 24-hour security.
“Even developed countries are reluctant to do this,” says Bradley Soule, chief fisheries analyst at OceanMind. “So, it is hardly surprising that developing nations would rather not.”
The Andrey Dolgov was heading towards one of the few nations that aggressively targets illegal fishing vessels
Fortunately, the Andrey Dolgov was heading towards one of the few nations that aggressively targets illegal fishing vessels. Indonesia, under the leadership of the country’s minister for maritime affairs and fisheries Susi Pudjiastuti, has seized and destroyed 488 illegal fishing vessels since 2014 . Among those was another Antarctic toothfish poacher, the F/V Viking, which was the last of a notorious group of fishing vessels known as the Bandit Six, operating illegally in the Southern Ocean, thousands of miles from Indonesia’s waters.
To make the point that illegal fishing would not be tolerated, no matter where it took place, Pudjiastuti had the F/V Viking spectacularly blown up on a sandbank off the shore of Pangandaran, West Java. With another notorious fish pirate heading into its waters, Pudjiastuti gave the Indonesian navy her endorsement to order an interception.
But as the vessel came into the busy Malacca straits, the satellite signal from its AIS transponder was lost among the mess of other signals in the area. Instead the Indonesian navy had to rely upon the calculations made using the information supplied by Kilgour and his team to estimate where the fishing boat might be. They dispatched the KRI Simeulue 2, a coastal patrol boat, to stop it.
“The last 72 hours saw sleepless nights for everyone involved,” says Interpol’s McDonnell.
As the Andrey Dolgov came into range, however, the Simeulue 2 and land based coastguard stations began picking up its AIS signal, allowing them to home in on the rogue vessel. Once they had visually confirmed the identity, the Simeulue 2 raced alongside around 60 miles from the southeast side of Weh Island, Sebang, ordering the captain of the fishing vessel to stop so he could be boarded.

Once aboard, the naval officers found the captain and five other officers to be Russian and Ukranian. The rest of the crew consisted 20 Indonesians who later claimed they had no idea the vessel was fishing illegally. They were treated by the authorities as if were victims of human trafficking and slavery after being duped into working on board.
The captain, a Russian citizen named as Aleksandr Matveev, was later sentenced to four months in prison and fined Rp200 million (£10,800) after being found guilty of illegal fishing. The other Russian and Ukranian offers were deported to their home countries.
“After the inspection, we discovered that F/V STS-50 violated Indonesian fisheries law,” says Pudjiastuti. “Illegal fishing is a public enemy and every state should provide assistance in terms of eliminating it.”
But the investigation has not stopped there. Specialised digital forensics teams have pored over the wealth of intelligence contained within the fishing vessel’s bridge, its on-board computer systems, navigational instruments and the captain’s mobile phone.
It is helping the international authorities piece together the wider criminal web that the vessel operated in. While the Andrey Dolgov was registered as belonging to Red Star Company Ltd , domiciled in Belize, the suspected owner is a Russian citizen who has an office in South Korea and has conducted several bank transactions in New York. The boat is thought to have links to Russian organised crime.
Interpol are now helping law enforcement agencies in a number of countries to track down the criminals who operated the Andrey Dolgov, counterfeited its documents, helped to launder its catches and the money it made. View image of The captured crew of the STS-50 (Credit: Getty Images)
“The work doesn’t stop with the capture of the vessel,” says McDonnell. “There are still quite a lot of questions to be answered. These organisations are tightknit, often run within families or as a “dark” business disguised with legitimate companies. We are looking at how the criminals set their business models up, how they turn the fish into money. Until recently they have been able to operate with almost complete impunity. That is changing now.”
OceanMind too are developing new technology to help track down other vessels that try to hide or obscure their identity more easily. They will combine this with the artificial intelligence it uses to help identify vessels and determine whether the boats have permission to be operating in the areas where they are.
Others too are developing ways of combating illegal fishing. Katie St John Glew at Southampton, for example, is developing ways to use the chemical isotopes in fish to trace in which part of the ocean fish were caught. These isotope tracers come from the food the fish were feeding on before they were caught, and so could be used to identify products that are on sale but were caught illegally.
As for the Andrey Dolgov itself, it could soon play a role in catching the criminals like those who operated it. Rather than blow it up, Pudjiastuti decided to have the boat converted so it can join the Indonesian fisheries enforcement fleet. It will serve as a symbol of the country’s war on illegal fishing and as a message to the fish pirates – they are running out of places to hide.

Ilhan Omar: Muslim lawmaker sees rise in death threats after Trump tweet - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47938268,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rival rallies for US President Donald Trump and congresswoman Ilhan Omar One of the first ever Muslim members of the US Congress has said that a tweet by President Donald Trump has led to an increase in threats against her life.
Minnesota's Ilhan Omar said the threats were sparked by ""violent rhetoric"", accusing Mr Trump of stoking right-wing extremism. ""It has to stop,"" she added.
It comes after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced a new ""security assessment to safeguard"" the lawmaker.
The tweet showed Ms Omar talking to a US-Muslim group about the 9/11 attacks.
On Monday Mr Trump stepped up his attacks against Ms Omar, calling her ""out of control"".
He also said Mrs Pelosi ""should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful US HATE statements Omar has made"" before defending her.
Image Copyright @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Report Image Copyright @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Report What's the background? Congresswoman Omar has become a lightning rod for criticism following her 2018 election.
Mr Trump tweeted on Friday ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET"" alongside a 43-second edited video showing footage of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, spliced with a speech by Ms Omar.
""Some people did something,"" she is seen saying, in between footage of planes hitting the World Trade Center, damage to the Pentagon and people fleeing buildings.
Democrats claimed the video does not provide context to Ms Omar's 20-minute speech to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) on 23 March.
She was discussing civil rights for Muslim Americans in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.
Cair, she said, was founded ""because they recognised that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties"".
Republican critics said that her comment ""some people did something"" was offensive to the nearly 3,000 Americans killed in the attacks.
The 9/11 row embroiling a US congresswoman How has Ms Omar responded? In a statement on Sunday, Ms Omar said: ""Since the president's tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life - many directly referring or replying to the president's video"".
She thanked security officials for ""their attention to these threats"" and accused Mr Trump of fuelling a rise in ""violent crimes and other acts of hate by right-wing extremists and white nationalists"".
She also expressed concern that Mr Trump's visit to her home state of Minnesota on Monday could lead to an increase in hate crimes and assaults.
""Violent rhetoric and all forms of hate speech have no place in our society, much less from our country's Commander in Chief.
""We are all Americans. This is endangering lives. It has to stop,"" she said.

The Republican strategy on Ilhan Omar Analysis by Jon Sopel, North America Editor, BBC News
Ilhan Omar is taking one helluva kicking. But this is brutality with a purpose for Republican strategists.
In his State of the Union address the president said he would save America from Socialism. As 'radical' 'progressive' Democrats become ever more vocal - whether on the environment, Israel, raising taxes, pushing socialised medicine - so the president sees this as a way of peeling away 'moderate' Democrats and independents. The political centre of gravity in the US is way to the right of what it is in Europe.
But the president has also got his shovel out and dug a deep hole, covered it with some brush and leaves, and is lying in wait for the Democratic Party leadership to fall into the trap he's set.
Are they going to ally themselves with the young Minnesota congresswoman, in which case he will hang those four words around their necks too, or will they abandon her - allowing the president to proclaim how divided the Democratic Party is? But the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi is a wily operator, and she doesn't blunder into much blindly - much though Donald Trump wants her to.
Read more analysis from Jon Sopel
What is reaction? On Sunday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump wishes ""no ill will and certainly not violence"" towards the first-term lawmaker.
Referring to her previous controversial comments, in which Ms Omar questioned US support for Israel, Ms Sanders added: ""It's absolutely abhorrent the comments that she continues to make and has made and they look the other way.""
Image Copyright @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Report Image Copyright @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Report The tweet, which had been posted to the top of Mr Trump's Twitter feed on Sunday, was removed after Mrs Pelosi made the request to the White House, but is still viewable on his feed.
""The President's words weigh a tonne, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger,"" she said in a statement while travelling in London.
Who is US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar? 'I'm a Muslim who voted for Donald Trump' ""President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video,"" she said, adding that security officials are reviewing Ms Omar's protection and ""will continue to monitor and address the threats she faces""."

Social media users were alerted to the hack by a stream of unusual activity, including anti-Muslim and anti-immigration rhetoric.
One post also claimed PM and party leader, Stefan Lofven, would resign.
It is unclear who was responsible for hijacking the account but the police have been informed. What happened?
Early on Monday morning social media users noticed a string of odd tweets sent from the Social Democratic Party's Twitter account.
More than 20 tweets on a range of topics were shared before the party regained control of the account.
The tweets were subsequently deleted from the account's timeline.
""We contacted the police immediately and are working with Twitter,"" a party spokesperson told the BBC.
""Attacks on political parties are attacks on free speech and democracy. We do everything we can to prevent these kind of intrusions."" What did the posts say?
The hijacked account made a number of false assertions and touched on far-right issues.
It also claimed the Swedish prime minister, party leader Stefan Lofven, would resign, that cannabis had been legalised and that Sweden's official currency had been replaced with Bitcoin.
The account shared a screenshot of a direct message it claimed to have sent to Social Security Minister Annika Strandhall. Image copyright Twitter Image caption ""You are fired,"" the message reads in Swedish
Interspersed with the claims was anti-Muslim and anti-immigration rhetoric.
""One like equals one dead Muslim,"" read one tweet sent from the account.
""Celebrate that we have reached a record number of rape victims with raising taxes and opening up the borders. Socialism for the win,"" another post read.

It's unclear who hijacked the account or why.
""I do not want to speculate on what or who is behind the attack,"" a spokesperson for the party told the BBC.
But the hack targeted a centre-left political party and used its platform to make threats against Muslims, criticise immigration and joke about firing a prominent feminist. It's entirely possible it's the product of trolling, but if so this is trolls reflecting far right views.
Since 2015, when more than 163,000 people submitted asylum applications at the height of Europe's migrant crisis, the Scandinavian country has become a regular fixture in international far-right discussions.
The nationalist Sweden Democrats have become a more pronounced electoral force, capitalising on widespread insecurity about immigration.

Venezuela crisis: Juan Guaid backed by Lima Group,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47126434,"Country profile
Mr Maduro was sworn in last month for a second term after disputed elections which many opposition leaders did not contest because they were in jail or boycotting them.
In response, Mr Guaidó, who is head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate. How united is Latin America in its response?
The group issued a 17-point declaration, following a meeting in the Canadian capital, Ottawa.
The document says the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru ""reiterate their recognition and support for Juan Guaidó"" as interim president of Venezuela. Dictator or defender of socialism?
The 11 group members also urged the world community ""to take measures to prevent the Maduro regime from conducting financial and trade transactions abroad, from having access to Venezuela's international assets and from doing business in oil, gold and other assets"".
However, three members of the Lima Group - Guyana, Mexico and St Lucia - did not back the declaration.
The Lima Group was set up in 2017 with the aim of helping to find a peaceful solution to the Venezuela crisis. Could there be war?
Asked on Spanish television if the crisis in Venezuela could lead to civil war, Mr Maduro said on Monday that ""no-one could answer that question with certainty"".
""Everything depends on the level of madness and aggressiveness of the northern empire [the US] and its Western allies.
""We ask that nobody intervenes in our internal affairs... and we prepare ourselves to defend our country."" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who is really in charge in Venezuela?
But in a speech on Monday, Mr Guaidó said: ""There is no possibility of a civil war in Venezuela, it is a Maduro invention.""
He also accused the Maduro government of trying to move up to $1.2bn (£900m) in public funds to Uruguay, but did not offer any evidence. Why does Venezuela matter?
At least 17 EU countries have officially recognised Mr Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela.
It follows the rejection of a deadline set by the UK, France, Germany, Spain and others for President Maduro to call new elections. Why Russia has so much to lose in Venezuela
Other EU nations, such as Greece and Ireland, have called for fresh elections but stopped short of recognising Mr Guaidó.
Mr Maduro retains powerful allies, most notably China and Russia, who has accused EU countries of interfering in Venezuela's affairs and attempting to ""legitimise usurped power"".
The Venezuelan president also retains the crucial support of the army. What is the background?
Mr Maduro, who took office in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez, has been condemned for alleged human rights abuses and for his handling of the economy.
There are severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food, and an inflation rate that last year saw prices doubling every 19 days on average.
Many people have been voting with their feet and leaving Venezuela.
According to United Nations figures, three million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 when the economic crisis started to bite. Related Topics"
The mental rigours of being US president - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Jude Sheerin Bbc News,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47671986,"Donald Trump is not the first president to be called unhinged. But many of his predecessors are said to have endured mental health conditions ranging from social anxiety to bipolar disorde r . S ome a re even thought to have been psychopathic.
In the summer of 1776, the American Revolutionary War was going so badly for the rebels that George Washington apparently attempted suicide by redcoat.
As his militiamen fled in panic at Kip's Bay, Manhattan, the 44-year-old supreme commander lapsed into a catatonic state, according to biographer Ron Chernow.
Washington just sat on horseback staring into space as dozens of British soldiers charged at him across a cornfield.
The future first US president's aides grabbed the reins of his mount and with some difficulty managed to spirit him to safety.
One of his generals, Nathanael Greene, later said the Virginian was ""so vexed at the infamous conduct of his troops that he sought death rather than life"".
Washington's suspected emotional breakdown illustrates how even the greatest of crisis leaders can snap under pressure.
Fast forward nearly two-and-a-half centuries, and the mental state of his political descendant is under somewhat less forgiving examination.
Presidential psychiatry has been all the rage ever since Donald Trump entered the White House.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trump isn't the first president to have his mental health questioned There's even a publishing subgenre devoted to putting the 45th president on the shrink's couch.
Such titles include The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President, Rocket Man: Nuclear Madness and the Mind of Donald Trump, A Clear and Present Danger: Narcissism in the Era of Donald Trump, and Twilight of American Sanity: A Psychiatrist Analyzes the Age of Trump.
But Mr Trump - who maintains he is ""a very stable genius"" - is by no means the first US leader to find himself written off as a lunatic.
John Adams, the second president, was described by arch-rival Jefferson as ""sometimes absolutely mad"".
The Philadelphia Aurora, a mouthpiece of Jefferson's party, assailed Adams as ""a man divested of his senses"".
Theodore Roosevelt, the contemporary Journal of Abnormal Psychology theorised, would ""go down in history as one of the most illustrious psychological examples of the distortion of conscious mental processes"".
While Roosevelt campaigned in 1912 to return to the presidency, prominent US historian Henry Adams said: ""His mind has gone to pieces… his neurosis may end in a nervous collapse, or acute mania.""
After Woodrow Wilson had a stroke, his critics claimed the White House had become an insane asylum, pointing out the bars installed on some first-floor windows of the executive mansion.
But as John Milton Cooper recounts in his Wilson biography, those bars had in fact been fitted during Teddy Roosevelt's presidency to keep his young sons from breaking windows with their baseballs.
And yet, according to a psychiatric analysis of the first 37 commanders-in-chief, Adams, Roosevelt and Wilson did have actual mental health issues.
The 2006 study estimated that 49% of presidents suffered from a malady of the mind at some stage in their life (a figure said by the researchers to be in line with national rates).
Twenty-seven per cent of them were found to be affected while in office.

One in four of them met the diagnostic criteria for depression, including Woodrow Wilson and James Madison, said the team from Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina.
They also concluded that Teddy Roosevelt and John Adams had bipolar disorder, while Thomas Jefferson and Ulysses Grant struggled with social anxiety.
Professor Jonathan Davidson, who led the study, said: ""The pressures of such a job can trigger issues in someone that have been latent.
""Being president is extremely stressful and nobody has unlimited capacity to take it forever and ever.""
Woodrow Wilson suffered his stroke in 1919 during a doomed fight to get the Treaty of Versailles passed.

First Lady Edith Wilson practically ran the White House, leaving opponents fulminating about ""government by petticoat"".
By the time Wilson left office, one reporter said, he was a timid and ""shattered remnant of the man"" he had once been.
Paralysis of bereavement Two other presidencies are thought to have been destroyed outright by clinical depression.
According to Prof Davidson, a major depressive disorder rendered both Calvin Coolidge and Franklin Pierce ineffectual as leaders after their sons died.
Pierce suffered a horrific tragedy just before his 1853 inauguration. The 14th president, his wife, Jane, and their son, Benjamin, were on a train when it derailed near Andover, Massachusetts.
The carriage was tossed down an embankment and Benny was nearly decapitated. He died instantly.
The 11-year-old had been the only surviving of three sons born to the Pierces.
The Democratic president wrote to Jefferson Davis, his secretary of war: ""How I shall be able to summon my manhood and gather up my energies for all the duties before me, it is hard for me to see.""
Prof Davidson says Pierce's inner torment led him to abdicate any real executive role as the nation drifted towards civil war.
He was the only president ever elected in his own right to suffer the indignity of being dumped by his party at the next election.
Pierce's sorrow, together with the stress of presiding over a country about to tear itself apart, is thought to have exacerbated his longstanding abuse of alcohol.
He died from ailments related to liver failure, according to biographer Michael F Holt.
Coolidge took office as an upbeat, hardworking and energetic leader.
Image copyright UniversalImagesGroup Image caption Pierce was devastated by his son's death But in the summer of 1924 his 16-year-old son, Calvin Jr, went to play on the White House tennis court, wearing trainers without socks.
The boy got a blister on his toe, which became infected, and he died of blood poisoning.
According to Amity Shales' biography, Coolidge blamed himself for the teenager's death.
He ordered gravestones for himself, his wife and surviving son, John, as well as Calvin Jr.
""Whenever I look out of the window,"" the president would say, ""I always see my boy playing tennis on that court there.""
His behaviour became increasingly erratic. He would explode with rage at guests, aides and family.
During one White House dinner, he became fixated on a portrait of President John Quincy Adams, remarking that his head looked too shiny.

(John Quincy Adams also suffered from depression and used to mope around the White House, playing billiards and irritating his British-born wife, according to a biography by Harlow Giles Unger.)
Coolidge all but withdrew from political life. Most concerning was his ignorance about economic alarm bells a year before the 1929 Wall Street Crash.
As legislation was considered to rein in rampant stock speculation, he told reporters: ""I don't know what it is or what its provisions are or what the discussion has been.""
In his autobiography, the 30th Quote: : ""When he [my son] went, the power and glory of the presidency went with him.
""I do not know why such a price was exacted for occupying the White House.""
Other presidents were able to bounce back from the personal Gethsemane of bereavement.
Theodore Roosevelt battled severe depression early in his political career after the death of his young wife and mother on Valentine's Day, 1884.
Image copyright MPI Image caption Teddy Roosevelt escaped to the Badlands of Dakota after the death of his first wife He rode off for a couple of years to the Badlands of Dakota territory, where he built a ranch, hunted buffalo, arrested thieves and knocked out a gunslinger in a saloon.
""Black care rarely sits behind a rider whose pace is fast enough,"" he said.
Abraham Lincoln was prone throughout his life to melancholy, according to biographer David Herbert Donald.
In 1841 in Springfield, Illinois, while serving as a state legislator, Abe broke off his engagement to Mary Todd (they eventually wed) and plunged into deep depression.
A friend put him on suicide watch, removing razors and knives from his room.
It was rumoured in the state capital that he had gone crazy.
Given his morose disposition, aides must have feared how he would cope during the American Civil War with the death of his 11-year-old son, Willie, probably from typhoid fever, at the White House in February 1862.
Later that year, after another humiliating defeat, this time at the Second Battle of Bull Run, Lincoln told his cabinet he felt almost ready to hang himself, according to Donald's book.
But despite his grief, the 16th president managed to hold himself together and the union, too.
It was only after Willie's death that Lincoln finally fired his vacillating military commander, George McLellan.
He replaced him with a depressive, shy, probable alcoholic who was squeamish at the sight of blood: Ulysses Grant would lead the Union Army to victory.
'Psychopathic' presidents Despite the enduring stigma of mental illness, some experts believe it may help certain leaders - up to a point.
A 2012 study by psychologists from Emory University in Georgia found several presidents exhibited psychopathic traits, including Bill Clinton.
The two determined to be most psychopathic were Lyndon Baines Johnson and Andrew Jackson, Mr Trump's hero.
Psychopathic attributes were identified by the Emory team as superficial charm, egocentricity, dishonesty, callousness, risk-taking, poor impulse control and fearlessness.
The research covered every president except the current one and Barack Obama.
Professor Scott Lilienfeld, who led the study, says: ""I suspect that in the long run these traits are going to catch up with people.
""So yes, they might allow people to rise to positions of leadership.
""I'm less confident they're going to result in better overall leadership, especially in the long term.""
LBJ, for example, had an ego the size of his home state of Texas.
Image copyright LBJ library photo by Yoichi Okamoto Image caption LBJ was famously domineering He brazenly stole his 1948 Senate election, then even more shamelessly joked about it, according to Robert Caro's multi-volume biography.
Johnson thought nothing of casually putting his hand up another woman's skirt while his wife, Lady Bird, was sitting right next to him.
He liked to humiliate underlings by summoning them to take dictation while he urinated in a washbasin or defecated in a toilet.
However, LBJ may have caused his own political Alamo with widely suspected lies to the American people about a fake naval skirmish in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964.
Johnson used the incident to dramatically escalate the US war in Vietnam.
But amid the hecatomb of the Tet Offensive four years later, LBJ announced he would not run for a second term.
Andrew Jackson - who signed the ethnic-cleansing Indian Removal Act - is remembered today more for his cruelty than for the enviable accomplishment of being the only president ever to fully pay off the national debt.
And Bill Clinton's reputation, of course, was left in tatters by his sexual impulsivity.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Was Bill Clinton psychopathic? Some presidents have handled the strains of the Oval Office less well than others.
Even as vice-president, Richard Nixon was taking prescription drugs for anxiety and depression, along with sleeping pills washed down by alcohol.
John A Farrell's biography details how the unstable Watergate leader drank excessively throughout his turbulent tenure.
White House tapes record him slurring his words amid the tinkle of ice cubes.
Henry Kissinger, his top diplomat, once said Nixon couldn't take a call from the British prime minister during a Middle East crisis because he was ""loaded"".
His psychotherapist, Dr Arnold Hutschnecker, was the only mental health professional ever known to have treated a president at the White House.
He said Nixon had ""a good portion of neurotic symptoms"".
And so, is Donald Trump mentally ill? Prof Davidson's armchair diagnosis is no. He cites debate among psychiatrists internationally as to whether narcissism - a trait so often attributed to the current president - is even a bona fide personality disorder.
But Nassir Ghaemi - author of A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental Illness - believes President Trump has ""classic manic symptoms"".
The professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston says: ""He doesn't sleep much at all. He has a very high physical energy level.
""He's very impulsive with spending, sexually impulsive, he can't concentrate.
""His traits were most beneficial for him during the presidential campaign, where he was extremely creative.
""He was able to pick up on things that normal, mentally healthy, stable persons, like Hillary Clinton, for instance, did not.""
The Trump presidency, we are so often told, has shattered historic norms.
But the strange and troubled lives of previous commanders-in-chief seem to raise the question, what is normal?

Statins 'don't work well for one in two people' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Michelle Roberts Health Editor,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47933345,"Image copyright Getty Images Cholesterol-lowering ""statin"" drugs taken by millions of Britons may not work well enough in about half of those prescribed them, research suggests.
UK investigators looked at 165,000 patients on statins and found that for one in two, the drugs had too little effect on bad cholesterol - one of the big risk factors for heart disease.
They are not sure why statins appear to help some more than others.
Patients should not stop taking the drugs without seeing their doctor.
One possible explanation is patients not taking their prescribed drugs or doctors giving them at too low doses, experts suggest.
Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year.
""Bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a major contributor - it can lead to furring and blockage of blood vessels.
Smoking and obesity Cutting down on saturated fat can help lower bad cholesterol, but some people will also need medication. Millions of people in the UK are given statins for this reason.
But statins can cause side effects and there is a debate about how many patients should be prescribed them.
Who should take statins? Are statins the best choice for me? Cholesterol-lowering pill new option for statin users The study, published in the journal Heart , included 165,411 patients who had been put on statins to cut their risk of developing heart disease by lowering their cholesterol to a healthy level.
Half of the patients - 84,609 in total - did not see their cholesterol go down by enough - the required 40% or more reduction specified by guidelines - even after being on the daily treatment for two years.
Experts say the study findings are somewhat limited because they cannot prove that patients who do not respond well to statins will necessarily fare worse as a consequence. Other factors - like smoking and obesity - also raise cardiovascular risk.
But the work does provide ""real life"" data and experience to draw on.
Researcher Dr Stephen Weng, from Nottingham University, said: ""Our research has shown that in almost half of patients prescribed statins, they are very effective and offer significant protection against cardiovascular disease.
""However, for the other half - whether it's due to your genetic make-up, having side effects, sticking to the treatment or other medications - we don't see that intended benefit.""
'Mixed messaging' In the study, a higher proportion of patients with a sub-optimal response to statins were prescribed lower potency doses, compared with those with an optimal response.
He said: ""We have to develop better ways to understand differences between patients and how we can tailor more effective treatment for those millions of patients who are simply blanket-prescribed statins.""
Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, advised: ""Statins are an important and proven treatment for lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of a potentially fatal heart attack or stroke.
""If you have been prescribed statins, you should continue to take them regularly, as prescribed. If you have any concerns you should discuss your medication with your GP. There are now other drugs available to help lower cholesterol levels, and it may be that another type of medication will be an effective addition or alternative for you.""
Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""When we prescribe medication, we have to rely on patients to make sure that they take it, both at the recommended dose and for the duration of time that we think will benefit them most.
""There is a substantial body of research showing that statins are safe and effective drugs for most people, and can reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, when prescribed appropriately - but controversy remains around their widespread use and their potential side-effects.
""There are complex reasons why patients choose not to take their prescribed medication, and mixed messaging around statins could be one of these.""

Spanish election: Socialists battle to stop right-wing surge - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47937031,"Image copyright AFP / Getty Images Image caption Leading players: Pedro Sánchez, Pablo Casado, Albert Rivera, Pablo Iglesias, Santiago Abascal Spain holds its third general election in four years on Sunday, in a battle between the established parties, Catalan and Basque nationalists, and a rising far right.
This time, however, the electoral game has changed.
Support for the previous winner, the conservative Popular Party (PP), has collapsed amid a corruption scandal. Its main opponent, the Socialist party, has climbed to the top of the polls after taking over the prime minister's job last year.
Podemos on the left and Ciudadanos (Citizens) on the right are seeing their support fall, amid a boom for the controversial far-right Vox party.
The last pre-election polls suggested that up to four in 10 voters had yet to make up their minds.
What are the possible outcomes? Opinion polls may not tell the full story, particularly with so many undecided voters. But potential outcomes for a government include:
Socialists, left-wing Podemos, plus small nationalist parties Centre-right PP, liberal Ciudadanos and far-right Vox Socialists and Ciudadanos But there is a problem with each of these combinations.
The Socialist and Podemos alliance of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez's existing government needed the Basque and Catalan nationalists to support it. In the national televised debates ahead of polling day, his alliance with Catalan nationalists was used as a key weapon against him - with his opponents claiming he was linked to ""enemies of Spain"" and wanted to ""liquidate"" the country.
 Vox was banned from taking part in the televised debate ahead of polling day The Catalan pro-independence parties were partly responsible for the government's collapse when they pulled their support in February; and the crisis over the failed Catalan independence bid has made the separatists hugely unpopular in much of Spain - making negotiations with them tricky.
Any Popular Party coalition with Ciudadanos would probably need the support of Vox.
As the campaign came to a close, PP leader Pablo Casado appeared to open the door to a coalition with Vox. If between them they had enough seats, why would they want to block a coalition, he said, aware that many former PP voters planned to switch to Vox.
But Ciudadanos voters are largely opposed to entering government with Vox. Vox was prevented from taking part in the debates by the country's electoral commission .
Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain PM sets snap election for April Spain country profile Ciudadanos has also publicly said it will not form a coalition with the Socialists, and leader Albert Rivera has bitterly criticised the Socialist leader over Catalonia. During the election debates, Mr Sánchez said he had no plans to join with a party that had placed a ""cordon sanitaire"" around the Socialists.
What are the issues? The Catalan crisis and the rise of Vox have changed the debate in Spanish politics.
""This is not an election about the economy - a different situation from what we have seen in more than 20 years,"" says Juan Rodríguez Teruel, professor of political science at the University of Valencia.
Despite widespread concerns about unemployment - which remains high in Spain compared with its European neighbours - it barely featured during the campaign and was raised during the debates only briefly.

Go back
""The campaign is going to remain around identity issues, and particularly around the Catalan issue... it seems that the economy is not, any more, the completely fundamental issue,"" says Prof Teruel.
Before the election, Mr Sánchez had been negotiating with Catalan parties to support his budget. But those talks broke down amid a public backlash over the meeting, partly stoked by Vox's fervent opposition to any concessions on independence.
 As campaigning came to an end Pedro Sánchez accused his opponents of embracing the far right Despite his political problems, support for the Socialists has risen during their time in government - at the expense of coalition partner Podemos.
Meanwhile, support for its tradition rival, the PP, plummeted in the wake of the corruption scandal that brought down previous leader Mariano Rajoy - leaving plenty of votes to fight for among a fragmented right.
Why is Vox doing well? The nationalist party has set itself up in firm opposition to the separatists, despite Spain's dark history with the far right under dictator Francisco Franco.
""The rise of Vox is clearly an earthquake in Spanish politics,"" says Bonnie N Field, professor of political science at Bentley University - while warning against ""exaggerating"" the party's success.
Opinion polls suggest it has around 11% support, while its leader Santiago Abascal has the lowest opinion rating of any party leader.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Vox's leader Santiago Abascal is the least popular leader - but polls well among his own voters Nonetheless, she says ""Spain has gone from what political scientists Sonia Alonso and Cristóbal Rovira called 'no country for the populist radical right' to one where the far right could support – or less likely, join – a right-wing government"".
Such an arrangement is precisely what happened in the regional government of Andalusia - where the PP, Ciudadanos, and Vox formed a right-wing regional government earlier this year for the first time in 36 years.
Spanish far right strikes landmark deal Rise of nationalists vowing to 'make Spain great again' Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Activists say rage over Spain's 'wolf pack' case has ignited a feminist revolution ""If the right is in reach of a majority after the general elections, something similar may occur,"" Prof Field says.
For Prof Manuel Arias Maldonado of the university of Malaga, Vox's success is partly down to its awareness of history, and ""adopting a low profile"".
""It should be noted that they do not display openly any Francoist imagery,"" he said. ""They are not making gross mistakes.""
""The big question [about the elections] is how strong will Vox be. There is the feeling that they could surpass expectations, despite the polls.
""But the main reason why Vox exists is Catalonia: it is a reaction to the unilateral secession attempt... that is where their strength comes from.""
Could the right really win? A three-party coalition of the right is not out of the question.
But Prof Teruel warns that the surge for Vox is coming at the expense of other right-leaning parties - the PP or Ciudadanos. And for the first time since the 1970s, the right is ""very fragmented"" - something that could benefit opponents on the left.
""The main reason now to vote for the left-wing electorate is to avoid the potential coalition among right-wing parties,"" Prof Teruel says.
Ciudadanos, meanwhile, could feasibly support a coalition with the Socialists, despite publicly dismissing the idea.
""I'm not sure they could keep this position if the numbers give the potential of a coalition,"" Prof Teruel says.
""The pressure on Ciudadanos will be very, very high.""
Spain's El País newspaper, publishing its final analysis of all the polls before the vote, concluded that the chances of a three-party right-leaning government was about 10%; far lower than any combination involving the Socialists."
'How I made fathers in Senegal carry babies on their backs' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47922717,"'How I made fathers in Senegal carry babies on their backs' 16 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Marta Moreiras Image caption Birama, a civil engineer, and his baby Ndeye
Marta Moreiras and the subjects of her portraits - fathers carrying babies on their backs - were surprised by the attention they attracted as she took their photographs on the streets of Senegal's capital Dakar.
""People were clapping - sometimes it was a bit hard to take the picture because we were having such a large audience,"" the Spanish photographer told the BBC.
""All the women were like: 'Hey, give me five, I'm going to call my husband - we don't see this every day.""
And that is exactly why Moreiras started her project, which has been shortlisted for the portraiture category of this year's Sony World Photography Awards Professional competition.
The idea came to her when she was looking through her photo archive, which for Senegal goes back to 2008. Image copyright Marta Moreiras Image caption Kumba and her baby Binta - from Marta Moreiras's archive
""I realised that I had tonnes of pictures of mummies with babies on their back, but I just wondered why I didn't have any of men.""
When she began phoning up some of her male Senegalese friends who had babies, most said that they would carry children on their backs if they were at home - but never outside.
""There's a big division here between public spaces and private spaces… and it's very important what others think of you,"" says Moreiras. Image copyright Marta Moreiras Image caption Demba, a financial consultant, with his baby Ely
Yet her research and interviews revealed that men do play a significant child-caring role, not least because Dakar is expensive and couples often both have to work.
""That will force them to start dividing tasks.
""And when I asked the men if they actually participated in the education of their children and if they helped at home they were like: 'Well, yes I'm forced to, my wife, she works as well - she can't just take on all the different tasks.'
""But whenever you see a picture of a baby you never see a dad with them or playing with them or taking them to school or washing them,"" she said. Image copyright Marta Moreiras Image caption Cheikh, a freelance videographer, and his baby Zoe
This is how she first coaxed her interviewees into having their portraits taken.

When they agreed to that, she'd say she would like the baby to be on their backs instead of in their arms - this too they happily agreed to, hesitation only setting in when she asked them to move outside to give the portrait ""a more interesting setting"".
""We don't do that, we don't take children to the street on our backs,"" was the general response - but Moreiras's persistence paid off.

""He has a public image, and everyone recognises him. It's important in this project that some recognisable people are included to be role models and open the debate to realise there is nothing wrong with it,"" the photographer said.
There were some public figures who turned her down when she approached them as they were concerned about public attitudes.
For Moreiras, who has eight of her portraits from the series in the World Photography Awards, it will be a ""never-ending project"".

Przemyslaw Golimowski, 30, was attacked at his flat in St Mary's Street, Bedford, on 28 September in a ""mission of revenge"" for a previous assault.
Three men were found guilty of murder, while two other men were convicted of manslaughter.
The five defendants will be sentenced by Judge Richard Foster at Luton Crown Court on Tuesday.
During the trial, Mr Golimowski's girlfriend Anna Swierczynska told the jury she was woken at about 02:00 BST by ""voices"" in the flat's kitchen, so woke her boyfriend.
It was told he got up to see what was going on and found a gang wearing hoodies.
""They just attacked him with knives. I saw blood dripping off him,"" said Ms Swierczynska.
She ran out to the corridor to seek help. An ambulance crew arrived but Mr Golimowski was pronounced dead at the scene. Image copyright South Beds News Agency Image caption Mr Golimowski was stabbed at a flat in St Mary's Street, Bedford on 28 September

The weird world of a Kim Jong-un impersonator,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-45679260,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright David Cox Image caption Howard and Minyong Kim Jong-un has had his fair share of headlines in 2018, be it for threatening nuclear Armageddon, jousting verbally with Donald Trump, or signing peace agreements. But every time he makes the news, two very unlikely beneficiaries prepare for their phones to start ringing, writes David Cox.
Howard X, a political satirist living in Hong Kong, and Seoul-based Minyong Kim - who goes by the professional name of Dragon Kim - are the only members of what they call the Kim Jong-un Impersonators Union.
For the past six years, the duo have each been cashing in on their uncanny resemblance to the North Korean leader - earning up to £10,000 a day, they say, for jobs ranging from starring in video games, opening shopping malls, and entertaining guests at billionaires' birthday parties.
""Whenever Kim Jong-un does something like firing off a missile or calling Trump a 'dotard', then my phone goes with a job,"" Howard says. ""It's always last minute, sometimes just 24 hours notice. And it can be absolutely anything."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Howard X as Kim Jong-un
Minyong is in negotiations with Kentucky Fried Chicken about shooting a new commercial, while Howard was recently hired to appear at an event in Macau together with Trump and Putin impersonators. ""They had a cake shaped as a big missile and the three of us had to crack it open,"" he says.
When Kim Jong-un first came to power in December 2011, Minyong was still doing military service in South Korea.
""It was really stressful,"" he remembers. ""Every time Kim Jong-un would do or say something, my seniors and juniors would come to me and say, 'It's all because of you, you look like him.'""
Having finished military service, though, he decided to try and embrace his resemblance to the North Korean leader. For Halloween, he persuaded an embarrassed local barber to give him Kim Jong-un's trademark haircut, bought a cheap black suit and headed out into Seoul's trendy Hongdae district.
He soon found himself mobbed.
""I literally had thousands of people taking photos of me and the next day I ended up all over TV,"" he says. ""Within a month I had companies requesting to shoot commercials with me."" Image copyright Minyong Kim
Howard tells a similar tale of overnight fame, which began when he posted photos of himself as Kim on Facebook, one April Fool's Day. The pictures went viral and kickstarted his career, but he then faced a struggle to get the haircut right.
""It was initially tricky as it's extremely hard to find a picture of the back of his head. But I did my research, printed out a load of photos, took them to a local guy and after a bit of experimenting, he perfected the look. He's now my regular stylist,"" he says.
""But he's had to adjust his usual way of cutting in order for me to look this ridiculous - apparently it goes against every single rule for a good haircut.""
Looks aside, the two impersonators have very different approaches to the job. Minyong - who dreamed of being an actor as a teenager before pursuing an economics degree - is a master of accents who has perfected Kim Jong-un's precise dialect and vocal mannerisms to create as realistic a portrayal as possible.
Howard, who grew up in Australia and speaks no Korean, is unashamedly provocative. His antics have ranged from asking shocked Singaporeans, ""Who's the better-looking dictator, me or your prime minister?"" while opening a chilli crab restaurant, to starring in a music video produced by Russian rave band Little Big, where he falls in love with, and goes to bed with, a nuclear bomb.
""As an actor impersonating a bad guy, you can do stuff which, for example, an Obama impersonator could never get away with,"" Howard says. ""So there's no bottom for me. I can say the most outrageous, politically incorrect thing, and it would be funny because it's coming from the character of Kim Jong-un."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Howard X at the 2018 Winter Olympics
At this year's Winter Olympics he infuriated the North Korean delegation by appearing at different venues in front of their cheerleaders, waving the national flag. He was ultimately manhandled out of the ice hockey stadium.
""I had no idea what they were saying at the time, but a translator later told me, they were shouting, 'How dare you do this,'"" Howard remembers. ""Dictatorships don't have a sense of humour.""
It isn't only the North Koreans who don't see the funny side. Minyong has faced criticism from South Korean charity workers trying to help North Korean refugees who have fled their country. ""They're worried that by us doing this, people might develop a more positive image of Kim Jong-un,"" he says. ""They say that would be really humiliating for people who have escaped North Korea and suffered under his government.""
Impersonating a dictator does come with its risks. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The real Kim Jong-un in September 2017
During one trip to New York, Minyong was nearly assaulted by a member of the public who tried to punch him, believing he was actually the North Korean leader. It was only his friends, dressed as Kim Jong-un's bodyguards, who stepped in and restrained the assailant.
In addition, Minyong says his growing profile across Asia has brought him to the attention of North Korean intelligence services.
""One day, I found that my personal email account had been hacked,"" he recalls. ""And my password is pretty complicated, and I'd never changed it. I checked the IP address for where it was last logged on, and it was somewhere in China. I reported it to the national intelligence agency and they said it was North Korean spies.""
Minyong says he briefly considered quitting altogether at the request of his family and friends.
In 2014, South Korean TV reported that North Korea had warned that anyone impersonating Kim Jong-un would be punished. But Minyong found he couldn't turn his back on the money and media attention. So instead, he tries to fly beneath the radar by avoiding saying anything overly political. Image copyright Minyong Kim
""I figured out that if I'm doing this, and objecting to Kim Jong-un's policies and saying bad stuff about him, I may possibly get killed or kidnapped,"" he says.
Howard, on the other hand, is pretty bullish about any potential threats. The North Koreans can't do anything to him, he insists.
""The blowback would be too much for them. I'm actually kind of disappointed that Minyong's been hacked and not me, because I've done far more than him, in terms of being insulting to the leader.""
Howard is actually more concerned about the fact that Minyong has often been willing to work for far cheaper rates, driving down his own potential earnings. Minyong also sometimes dresses up as Kim Jong-un for nights out in Seoul even when he's not being paid.
""When I go downtown I usually dress up as Kim Jong-un, because I'm so popular that I don't even need to bring my wallet,"" Minyong says. ""Bar owners always give me free food and drinks, people buy me food and drinks, and I get free entry and queue jump to all the famous clubs.""
Howard, however, isn't amused. ""I refuse to do that kind of thing because it kind of cheapens the impersonation when you're working for free,"" he says. ""I want dollars.""

Howard has an unlikely ally in the shape of Minyong's long-term girlfriend. She detests her boyfriend's career as a Kim Jong-un impersonator, and has begun to limit his public appearances.
""I'd dress up as Kim Jong-un every day but my girlfriend hates the hairstyle,"" Minyong admits.
""She complains every time I get a new haircut. She also hates it because when I go to bars and clubs, girls want to take photos with me, and sometimes try to hug and kiss me. We began dating before all this, and she tells me that if she knew I was going into this line of work, she never would have gone out with me. So I'm trying to minimise it and just accept things which pay really well, in order to keep her happy.""
But the stream of highly paid jobs shows no sign of drying up.
""I told the Trump impersonator, you'd better make good money now because you've only got four, maybe eight years if you're lucky,"" Howard says. ""But these dictators, it's a job for life. Unless he dies of high cholesterol or diabetes, I reckon I've got a good 30 years."" You may also like: Image copyright Calvin Sun

Pittsburgh shooting: White House denies Trump rhetoric to blame,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46025867,"The mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue is being called the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history. What did the White House say?
""The president is not responsible for these acts,"" Mrs Sanders said repeatedly during Monday's news conference when a reporter put it to her that Mr Trump's rhetoric could have played a part in the Pittsburgh attack, or a recent mail bomb scare.
""I think it's irresponsible to blame the president and members of his administration for those heinous acts.""
The press secretary's voice cracked with emotion as she spoke of how the president ""adores"" Jewish Americans.
The suspect was not a Trump supporter - he accused the president in online posts of doing nothing to stop an ""infestation"" by Jews.
Mr Trump has condemned the shooting, saying there ought to be no tolerance for anti-Semitism. What have Jewish community members said?
A Jewish social justice organisation accused the president in an open letter of giving succour to white nationalists.
""President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism,"" Bend the Arc said in the letter, which now has more than 43,000 signatures.
It noted the president has frequently criticised immigrants and Muslims.
However, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who leads a congregation at the Tree of Life synagogue, said the president was always welcome.
""I'm a citizen, and he's my president, he's certainly welcome,"" Mr Myers said on ABC's Meet the Press.
The alleged gunman was ranting against Jews even as he was treated by Jewish medical staff at the hospital for wounds he received in a gun battle with police.
Jeffery Cohen, president of Allegheny General Hospital, told WTAE-TV: ""He's taken into my hospital and he's shouting 'I want to kill all the Jews!'
""And the first three people who are taking care of him are Jewish. Ain't that a kick in the pants?""
Just before the attack, the alleged gunman railed on social media against a Jewish refugee relief organisation.
The suspect accused the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) of bringing violent ""invaders"" into the country.
Mark Hetfield, head of HIAS, said on Monday: ""President Trump didn't mention that.
""Hateful words always lead to hateful acts. And that's exactly what happened here. Words matter. And they especially matter when they come from the president of the United States."" Shackled to a wheelchair

He spoke little, giving his name, acknowledging the charges against him and stating he could not afford a lawyer.

US attacks UK plan for digital services tax on tech giants,www.bbc.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46050724,"US attacks UK plan for digital services tax on tech giants By Natalie Sherman Business reporter, New York 31 October 2018 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel The US has hit back against a UK plan to impose a new tax on sales by technology giants.
US political leaders and business groups say the proposal would violate tax agreements by targeting US firms.
They warned the tax could spark US retaliation and hurt prospects for a US-UK trade deal.
In a statement on Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas, called the measure ""troubling"".
""If the United Kingdom or other countries proceed, that will prompt a review of our US tax and regulatory approach to determine what actions are appropriate to ensure a level playing field in global markets,"" said Mr Brady, who helped shepherd US tax cuts through Congress last year.
His statement echoed comments last week by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , who voiced ""strong concern"" about different countries' efforts to develop digital sales tax.
A slew of business groups - including the US Chamber of Commerce and the US Council for International Business - have also come out against the UK plan.
If enacted, the tax measure could ""complicate the United Kingdom's push for deeper US-UK trade relations"", said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Kevin Brady shepherded the US tax cut through Congress last year
The UK plan, announced as part of the Budget, would place a 2% tax on sales by large social media platforms, internet marketplaces and search engines from April 2020.
In response to Mr Brady's comments, a UK Treasury spokesman said: ""As the chancellor said, this tax is a proportionate and targeted interim response that reflects the changing global economy, and how digital businesses derive value from users - it's not targeted at any country and seeks to ensure the tax system is fair.""
It comes as wider efforts to capture more tax from multinational tech giants - which are now typically taxed based on their physical presence in a country - gain steam.
The European Commission in March introduced a proposal for a 3% tax on revenues of internet companies with global revenues above €750m (£660m) a year.
While some EU member states are opposed , a vote could come before the end of the year. Separately, Spain introduced a digital service measure in its budget that mimics the EU's.
Elsewhere, Colombia, Australia and India are among several countries debating new tax measures that target the digital giants, according to the Internet Association , a US trade association with members that include Amazon, Microsoft and Uber.
The 36-member OECD has also been discussing the issue, with a report on reforms due in 2020.
The slew of measures, after years of discussion, explains the alarm in the US, said Lilian Faulhaber, a law professor at Washington's Georgetown University.
""There's a sense in the United States that this digital services tax is becoming more of a real possibility,"" she said. 'Pure cash grab'
Under President Donald Trump, the US has been supportive of OECD efforts to update the corporate tax system for the global era, said Itai Grinberg, another law professor at Georgetown University.
But many in the US - not just the internet giants - have concerns about proposals, like the UK's, that tax turnover, he added.
""It's a kind of tax that everyone abandoned half a century ago because it's thought of as very economically inefficient and functions basically like a tariff,"" he said.
He said such taxes do little to make the international tax system more fair: ""It's just a pure cash grab"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK's chancellor: Searching online for revenues
In announcing the UK tax, UK Chancellor Philip Hammond said progress in global arenas to update tax laws had been ""painfully slow"".
But the move has irked some in the US.
Josh Kallmer, executive vice president of policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, said the tech industry recognises the need for tax laws to change, but opposes revenue taxes and wants to see the OECD process play out.
""The responses that the UK and EU are poised to take are not helpful,"" he said. ""This is a genuinely global challenge.... Countries have got to coordinate and develop shared principles.""
Professor Grinberg said the UK's decision to go it alone gives license to other countries to follow suit, undermining efforts to reach an international solution.
The move is particularly risky for the UK, he added, because the logic for taxing tech firms could be extended other industries important to the UK, especially financial services and pharmaceuticals.
""I think it will go badly for the UK,"" he said. Corbyn: Tech firm tax could fund journalism
The US has a range of options should it want to retaliate, in addition to simply making the issue a focus in US-UK trade talks, he added.
The US could complain to the WTO. Under US law, the president could also act to raise taxes on UK firms as a retaliatory measure.
Professor Faulhaber described the responses being floated as ""nuclear options"".
""I don't know how likely they are but I do think they're pretty dramatic,"" she said. ""They... suggest that at least some people in the US see these proposals as fairly dramatic."" Related Topics"

Sleep myths 'damaging your health' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47937405,"Sleep myths 'damaging your health' By James Gallagher Health and science correspondent, BBC News 16 April 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Widely held myths about sleep are damaging our health and our mood, as well as shortening our lives, say researchers.
A team at New York University trawled the internet to find the most common claims about a good night's kip.
Then, in a study published in the journal Sleep Health, they matched the claims to the best scientific evidence.
They hope that dispelling sleep myths will improve people's physical and mental health and well-being.
So, how many are you guilty of? Myth 1 - You can cope on less than five hours' sleep
This is the myth that just won't go away.
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously had a brief four hours a night. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made similar claims , and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success.
Yet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health.
""We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences,"" said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins.
These included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy.
Instead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night.
Thatcher: Can people get by on four hours' sleep? Myth 2 - Alcohol before bed boosts your sleep
The relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it's a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer. Image copyright Getty Images
""It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night,"" said Dr Robbins.
It particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning.
So yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost.
Alcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too. Myth 3 - Watching TV in bed helps you relax
Have you ever thought ""I need to wind down before bed, I'm going to watch some TV""?
Well, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep.
Dr Robbins argues: ""Often if we're watching the television it's the nightly news… it's something that's going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we're trying to power down and relax.""
And as for Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing.
The other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin.
Will the light from your phone kill you? Myth 4 - If you're struggling to sleep, stay in bed
You've spent so long trying to nod off you've managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand ( that's about 28 million ).
So what should you do next? The answer is not to keep trying.
""We start to associate our bed with insomnia,"" said Dr Robbins.
""It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than that… make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that's mindless.""
Her tip - go fold some socks. Myth 5 - Hitting the snooze button
Who isn't guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference?
But the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up. Image copyright Getty Images
Dr Robbins said: ""Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze.
""Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep.""
Instead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible. Myth 6 - Snoring is always harmless
Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea.
This causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing.
People with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke.
One of the warning signs is loud snoring.
Dr Robbins concludes: ""Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity.""

Speaking on the eve of her visit, she said there would be ""no chance whatsoever"" of a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK if there were any weakening of the Good Friday Agreement.
Ms Pelosi is expected to meet Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar on Tuesday evening.
It is understood Brexit will be one of the main topics of discussion.
She will be accompanied by a delegation of Democrat and Republican congressmen and women.
The delegation is expected to visit Northern Ireland later this week.
The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman What is the Good Friday Agreement? Speaking at the London School of Economics on Monday evening, Mrs Pelosi said the 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a model that could not be ""bargained away in another agreement"".
""First of all it is very hard to pass a trade bill in the Congress of the United States, so it's no given any way,"" she told her audience.
""But if there were any weakening of the Good Friday accords, there would be no chance whatsoever, a non-starter for a US-UK trade agreement.
""The Good Friday accords ended 700 years of conflict.
""This is not a treaty only, it's an ideal, it's a value, it's something that's a model to the world, something that we all take pride in.
""It was a model and other people have used it as a model and we don't want that model to be something that can be bargained away in another agreement.""
The ability for the UK to strike separate trade deals with countries around the world was one of the main arguments put forward for leaving the EU during the 2016 referendum campaign.
'Enduring commitment' In a separate statement, ahead of her visit to the Republic of Ireland, Mrs Pelosi said her aim was to learn more about the future of the UK and Ireland amid Brexit.
Mrs Pelosi said she wanted ""to express America's enduring commitment to a peaceful and prosperous future for all who live there"".
She added that the UK and Ireland ""each have a deep and special bond with the United States"".
 Who is Nancy Pelosi? After arriving in Ireland she met Tánaiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney and will meet Mr Varadkar on Tuesday evening.
On Wednesday she will meet Irish government and opposition politicians before addressing both houses of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament).

Galliford Try shares drop on profit warning - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47946075,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cost estimates for the Queensferry Road crossing were raised recently Shares in construction firm Galliford Try fell 20% at the start of trading after the firm issued a profit warning.
The company, whose activities include housebuilding and road bypasses, said profits will be £30-40m lower than the expected £156m, as it plans to shrink the size of its construction business.
It said the biggest chunk related to the Queensferry Crossing, which recently raised final cost estimates.
It says it plans to concentrate on areas where it has a successful record.
The group was hit last year after one of its partners on the Aberdeen bypass, outsourcing giant Carillion, collapsed, leaving it with extra costs of £38m.
It has continued work on that much-delayed and over-budget road scheme with its other partner, Balfour Beatty.
Galliford said that cost was not being revised.
It said its review would assess both the progress and contract positions throughout the rest of Galliford's construction business.
But it added that the majority of its construction businesses ""continued to perform well"".
The firm recently promoted its former finance director, Graham Prothero, to chief executive.
The company said it would have its verdict ready in the next few weeks and would ""share the detail of the review"", along with a further update on group trading, in its scheduled statement on 21 May."
Plastic toys: Is it time we cut back?,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47868871,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Bettina Maidment Piles of plastic toys take up space in many family homes in the UK.
If you're a parent, then you'll know how tricky it can be to avoid buying them, whether it's diggers, dolls houses or building bricks.
The UK's toy industry is massive - last year consumers spent £370m on them.
But environmentalists say this is contributing to the amount of plastic ending up in landfill and oceans. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Plastic toys can end up in landfill and in the ocean
A poll by the British Heart Foundation found that more than a quarter of parents admit to throwing away toys that are in perfect working order.
It spoke to more than 2,000 people and found children have an average of four toys they've never played with. 'My daughter loves plastic toys'
Lauren Tedaldi says her three-year-old daughter Mirella gets given loads of toys from friends and family.

""Try as we might to buy wooden toys, or things that are a bit more durable, or that are better for the environment, my little girl loves plastic toys.
""Like most kids, the brighter and the crazier - the better.
""We try to save the big toys for special occasions, but it's hard and it's easy to end up with lots and lots of toys.""
Lauren says she does try and take a bag of old toys to charity shops regularly and has a ""one-in, one-out policy"" when it comes to toys in the house. Image copyright Lauren Tedaldi Image caption Mirella's old toys get taken to the charity shop
""I know charity shops can recycle what they can't sell.
""I would never just throw toys away even if I was questioning if they were in good nick."" Can toys ever be environmentally friendly?
Whilst we don't know exactly how much of the plastic that ends up in landfill comes from toys, green campaigners say that consumers can help reduce the amount in circulation.
Friends of the Earth says there are ways to cut back on buying plastic toys - things like toy libraries, passing toys on, buying less, borrowing off friends and sharing more.
Greenpeace UK told the BBC it doesn't count plastic toys as 'single-use plastics' as they can be used time and time again. How easy is it to be more environmentally friendly?
""Toys are far from single use plastics, as we know from research that they stay within a household for approximately 10 years and tend to then be passed on to charities, friends and families,"" Natasha Crookes from the British Toy and Hobby Association says.
The organisation claims many toys will last between 15-20 years before they enter the waste stream.
Making toys out of recycled plastic might not be the answer either.
""Recycled plastics are rarely able to be used in the process of manufacturing toys due to the uncertainty of the chemical composition of recycled plastic,"" Natasha says.
""It could contain one of the thousands of chemicals restricted under toy safety legislation."" 'It's all about buying good quality toys'
Avoiding plastic altogether and buying toys out of sustainable materials could be the answer.
There are loads of new eco-style brands that offer toys made from sustainable wood and recycled materials.
But they can be expensive.
Mum-of-two Rachel Lochhead says she tries to stay away from plastic toys if she can help it and only buys ""good quality"" toy brands new so she knows they will last a long time. Image copyright Rachel Lochhead Image caption Rachel tries to buy good quality toys that will last

""Plastic is a practical material and cheap to manufacture so inevitably lots of things are made from it."" 'Buying second hand saves me loads of money'
Bettina Maidment tries to live a plastic-free life .
When it comes to toys though, she says she still buys plastic, but only second-hand. Image copyright Bettina Maidment Image caption Bettina Maidment says she never buys brand new toys for her two boys
""For the last two Christmases I've done a second-hand Christmas - I save quite a lot of money that way.
""My son got a bike for his birthday which we couldn't afford brand new, but second-hand it was like new and he loves it.""
It's not just online auction sites that have grown in popularity when it comes to reselling toys, parents often post ads on social media groups offering up toys for free or a small price. How safe is it to buy second-hand toys?
There have been some concerns about the health risks of buying second-hand toys.
Last year a study found some toys tested didn't meet the most up-to-date safety guidelines.
Mark Gardiner, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: ""Any goods that are bought second-hand are not going to have the same safety assurances.
""Parents should weigh up these risks, especially when giving their children toys that are very old and could have also mechanically deteriorated over time."" What are the toy companies doing about plastic?
Whilst consumers are taking steps to reuse or recycle toys, green campaigners say it's up to manufacturers and retailers to act.

Lego's leaves, bushes and trees are now actually green - they're made with plastic sourced from sugarcane.
It's part of the Danish company's pledge to use sustainable materials in its products and packaging by 2030.
Toy company MGA Entertainment, which is behind L.O.L Surprise!, is trying to cut back on the waste produced from packaging its dolls.
Consumers are invited to box the waste up, request and print a label from the website, before sending it off to TerraCycle for recycling. How easy is it to recycle plastic toys?
Rather than chucking out an old plastic train set if it's damaged, it's worth checking with your local recycling centre if they'll take it.
Plastic toys and games can't be collected as part of your household recycling scheme, according to the Recycle Now campaign group.
""If your toys and games are beyond repair, it may still be possible to recycle some of the parts if you dismantle them - and this includes batteries and battery packs from remote controls which should be removed and recycled."" Related Topics "
Barry Humphries: Top comedy prize renamed after transgender row - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-47943745," The ""Barry Award"" had been named in honour of Barry Humphries One of the world's top comedy festivals will no longer use comedian Barry Humphries' name for its chief prize, after he was accused of transphobia.
The Melbourne International Comedy Festival said its prestigious Barry Award for best show would be renamed.
Humphries, best known for his character Dame Edna Everage, has repeatedly drawn anger for his comments on transgender people - and later defended himself.
His remarks had ""definitely played a part"" in the change, the festival said.
Humphries, 85, has not responded to the festival's decision.
Last year, he drew criticism for describing being transgender as ""a fashion"".
In another controversy, he claimed to have been speaking in character when he referred to gender-reassignment surgery as ""self-mutilation"" in a 2016 interview with The Telegraph. He also described Caitlyn Jenner as a ""publicity-seeking rat-bag"".
He has previously said his comments were misinterpreted, but they have been criticised by other high-profile comedians - including former Barry Award winner Hannah Gadsby.
 Barry Humphries claimed he was in character as Dame Edna in a 2016 interview Humphries co-founded the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 1987, and it is now one of the world's premier comedy events. Its top prize has been named in his honour since 2000.
On Tuesday, festival director Susan Provan said in a statement: ""It is time for the award for most outstanding show to be in our name to celebrate the city that inspired the growth of our festival and its outstanding artists.""
She told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Humphries' recent comments were ""not helpful"" and had helped instigate the decision.
Gadsby criticised Humphries when she accepted the award in 2017 for her show Nanette, now a worldwide success on Netflix.
Nanette: Netflix special 'made me feel seen' ""I don't agree with a lot of the things Barry Humphries has said recently,"" she said at the time.
""It is not something I will walk past. With full respect, I would like to accept this award just for me.""
Previous winners of the award include Ross Noble, The Mighty Boosh, Demetri Martin and Nina Conti."
EU votes on 'high-level' protection for whistleblowers - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47936682," Image caption The legislation would mark the first time whistleblowers have been given EU-wide protection Whistleblowers across the European Union have won greater protection under landmark legislation aimed at encouraging reports of wrongdoing.
The new law, approved by the European Parliament on Tuesday, shields whistleblowers from retaliation.
It also creates ""safe channels"" to allow them to report breaches of EU law.
It is the first time whistleblowers have been given EU-wide protection.
The rules have previously been in the hands of member states, resulting in a range of vastly different approaches.
The law was approved by 591 votes, with 29 votes against and 33 abstentions.
What does the law say? The new legislation gives whistleblowers who report breaches of EU law a ""high level of protection"".
It establishes ""safe channels"" for reporting the information, both within an organisation and to public authorities.
If no appropriate action is taken or in cases where reporting to the authorities would not work, whistleblowers are permitted to make a public disclosure – including by speaking to the media.
The law protects whistleblowers against dismissal, demotion and other forms of punishment.
National authorities are required to train officials in how to deal with whistleblowers under the legislation.
You may also be interested in: Your guide to four years of finance leaks Lobby group admits unlawful whistleblower dismissal Barclays fined for whistleblowing breach Why was it introduced? The legislation says whistleblowers play a ""key role"" in preventing breaches of EU law and protecting society.
But, it argues, ""potential whistleblowers are often discouraged from reporting their concerns or suspicions for fear of retaliation.""
""We should protect whistleblowers from being punished, sacked, demoted or sued in court for doing the right thing for society,"" European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said.
""This will help tackle fraud, corruption, corporate tax avoidance and damage to people's health and the environment.""
Transparency International has said the ""pathbreaking legislation"" will also give employers ""greater legal certainty around their rights and obligations""."

Construction of the Notre-Dame in Paris's Île de la Cité began under the reign of Louis VII in 1163.
The first stone of the gothic building was laid in the presence of Pope Alexander III.
But construction wasn't completed until 1345. Historic highlights
Since its completion, the building has been the scene of numerous historic events.
In 1431, England's Henry VI was crowned king of France inside the cathedral.
It was also the scene of Napoleon Bonaparte's coronation as emperor in 1804.
Joan of Arc was beatified in the cathedral and world leaders attended memorial services for former French presidents Charles de Gaulle and François Mitterrand there. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Joan of Arc was beatified in Notre-Dame cathedral Has it suffered previous damage?
The building was damaged during the French Revolution in the 1790s, when mobs and revolutionaries looted the interior and declared the building a ""Temple of Reason"".
During this time, statues of biblical figures there were beheaded.
Historian Robert Tombs told the BBC that during the Paris Commune revolution in 1871 some ""radical anti-clericals"" tried to set the building on fire but were stopped by local people.
""As there would have been no effective firefighting had the building caught fire, we might expect it to have been damaged even worse than now,"" he said.
The cathedral also survived the two world wars largely unscathed and famously rang its tenor bell to mark the end of Nazi occupation in 1944. A place in literature
Victor Hugo's 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame cemented the cathedral's place in popular culture.
The book, which has since been turned into a Disney film, highlighted the poor condition the cathedral was in. This helped to prompt major restoration works in the mid-19th Century.
Mr Tombs said the novel ""made the cathedral itself a character, and made it internationally famous"". Musical contributions
Notre-Dame's school of composers has played a notable role in the birth of modern Western music.
During the 12th and 13th centuries, they are credited with leading the development of polyphonic, or multi-part, compositions. Related Topics "

Holden Matthews, 21, the son of a local sheriff deputy, learned of the new charges during a court appearance on Monday when he pleaded not guilty.
During the hearing, the judge denied his bond request due to a ""substantial amount of evidence"" against him.
Officials had not previously cited race as a possible motive.
Louisiana Fire Marshal Butch Browning said on Monday the suspect - who has no previous criminal record - should not be released because he presents ""an immediate risk to public safety"".
""In my mind, I felt another fire was imminent,"" Mr Browning said, describing the evidence investigators have found against Mr Matthews.
Cop's son arrested over black church fires All three fires were started with gasoline and occurred around Opelousas, about 60 miles (100km) west of the state capital of Baton Rouge.
Among evidence presented during the pre-trial appearance, in which Mr Matthews was displayed on video feed from jail, Mr Browning testified that the suspect documented his alleged crimes through videos and photos on his phone.
After he was arrested, prosecutors found pictures of the flames that appeared to have been taken before firefighters arrived to extinguish them.
They also found news reports on his phone in which he had superimposed himself on those reports in order to claim responsibility while talking to a friend online.
""He actually superimposed himself on those news reports, claiming responsibility for these fires,"" Mr Browning said.
Location data from his mobile phone and surveillance footage of his vehicle also tied him to each of the crime scenes.

His arrest came over two weeks after the first fire broke out at the St Mary Baptist Church, followed by the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, which were each more than 100 years old.
During the search for a suspect, Governor John Bel Edwards said the attacks in the southern state were a reminder ""of a very dark past of intimidation and fear"".
A grisly film of Norway's black metal murders has caused outrage During Monday's hearing, in which the suspect never spoke and entered his not guilty plea through a lawyer, investigators mentioned the suspect's connection to black metal music.

An investigation has begun into the fire that swept through the medieval cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, destroying its roof and spire.
Much of the roof was covered in scaffolding as part of a big renovation programme, which is being investigated as a possible cause of the blaze. How the fire unfolded
The fire began at about 18:43 local time on Monday (15 April). Pictures show flames shooting up around the spire, shortly after the doors were shut to visitors for the day.
The blaze spread rapidly along the wooden roof as onlookers gathered on the ground below.
Firefighters worked through the night to bring the blaze under control. At one point it was feared the whole building would be lost as flames were spotted in one of the main bell towers.
The fire was finally declared out at about 10:00 on Tuesday morning. Image copyright AFP/Getty What has been damaged?
Some 400 firefighters and 30 fire engines were deployed, but they were unable to save the spire, replaced in the 19th Century during a previous refurbishment and made of oak covered with lead. The spire collapsed just before 20:00.
The roof was made up of a ""forest"" of wooden latticework, much of which dated back to the 13th Century.
Underneath the roof, the vaulted stone ceiling appears to have survived mostly intact and this will have protected the inside of the building from the worst ravages of the fire. But it is still unclear how much of the interior will have suffered water damage.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said most artworks and religious relics were removed from the cathedral as firefighters worked to control the flames.
Sixteen bronze statues, including the 12 apostles, were removed from around the spire only four days ago, prior to the latest renovation work.
The Archbishop of Paris says all three of the cathedral's famed rose windows have been saved, but other, smaller windows, closer to the seat of the fire, have been badly damaged. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The spire collapsed at 19:49 Rebuilding
President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild the cathedral and already money has been pledged from within France. Offers of help have also poured in from around the globe.
A previous restoration in the early 1800s followed the publication of Victor Hugo's novel, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", which revived interest in the ancient cathedral.

Imagine the difficulty of governing a nation like this - from West to East it spans the distance between London and Baghdad, with three different time zones and hundreds of different ethnic groups and languages.

This election, while on the face of it a re-run of the 2014 face-off between Mr Widodo and his rival Prabowo Subianto, is also a test of whether that vision of Indonesia is still robust.
A potpourri of faiths For the first time in a poll voters will not just elect a president, but also 245,000 legislative representatives vying for more than 20,000 seats - so it is going to be about much more than a personality and competence contest between these two men.
The founding fathers of this country acknowledged the many competing visions of Indonesia when they began the difficult task of governing after declaring independence from the Dutch in 1945, and attempted to unify these islands into one country.
With more Muslims here than anywhere else, Indonesia could have - after independence - chosen the path of an Islamic nation, and there was pressure for this.
In the end, the country opted for what is called Pancasila - the five principles - and the philosophy of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika - unity in diversity.
These have promoted and protected tolerance in Indonesia - where the right to practice five other faiths besides Islam is enshrined in the constitution.
This potpourri of faiths was bound into everyday lives. It was in the multitude of different religious deities - Hindu, Christian, Islam - in our family prayer room, and the different faiths my father's brothers chose to adopt - one Catholic, another Muslim, while the rest remained broadly Hindu.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many religions are practised in Muslim-majority Indonesia Islam in Indonesia has always been different from the Islam practised in Saudi Arabia, or South Asia, having been brought from the 11th century onwards by Muslim traders who wished to establish a trade in the rich array of spices found in the islands.
Before that, many parts of maritime South East Asia had been influenced by different traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Both religions left enduring legacies that shaped the culture of Muslims in Indonesia, while Bali remains majority Hindu to this day.
Underlying even these ancient faiths, were much older local ritual traditions that can be described as ""animist"", long woven into the tapestry of many Indonesian lives - if perhaps fading today.
Christianity, brought by Dutch colonisers, has also left its mark on Indonesia.
For the most part, the country has allowed these faiths to co-exist comfortably.
Part of that tolerance was brought about by force - under former President Suharto's three-decade-long authoritarian rule, political Islam was a threat that was quashed.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ex-president Suharto ruled the country with an iron fist When he stepped down in 1998, communal violence raised fears that the country would be Balkanised - split up into dozens of smaller countries - but that didn't happen.
Instead Indonesia forged a relatively smooth transition from dictatorship to its adopted moniker: a moderate Muslim nation and thriving democracy.
Rising intolerance In recent years this reputation has come under threat because of what experts have identified as rising intolerance amongst hardline Muslim groups, and this is evident in the use of identity politics by both presidential candidates.
""A bitter form of religion-based identity politics seems to be embedded in the system,"" writes Benjamin Bland of the Lowy Institute.
""Indonesia appears to be settling into a more divisive pattern of identity politics that risks stoking further intolerance and distracting from the debate about political, legal, and economic reforms.""
All you need to know about Indonesia's election Analysts say the turning point was the ousting of former Jakarta governor and Chinese Indonesian politician Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - known as Ahok - from power, under pressure from hardline Muslim groups.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ahok was charged with blasphemy and spent 20 months in jail Protests erupted on the streets of Jakarta, calling for him to step down and be charged with blasphemy, after he was accused of insulting Islam in a video widely circulated on social media. Mr Basuki, an ally of President Jokowi, said his comments were taken out of context.
He was eventually charged and convicted of blasphemy in 2017 and spent 20 months in prison.
Mr Widodo remained silent in the face of those protests and Ahok's subsequent imprisonment, partly because, analysts say, he was worried about being seen as anti-Muslim if he spoke out.
""The Ahok case was an example of politicians instrumentalising religion and identity on a much bigger scale,"" adds Mr Bland. ""[Mr Widodo's] political opponents, including Mr Prabowo and Mr Sandiaga, saw the anti-Ahok movement as an opportunity to weaken the president ahead of the 2019 election.""
Mr Widodo has been under pressure to beef up his religious credentials ever since he came to power in 2014.
His platform of inclusion and his common man politicking helped him to victory then, but Indonesia has changed in the last five years - and much like the rest of South East Asia it has become more socially conservative.
So in an effort to look ""Muslim"" enough, Mr Widodo has teamed up with 76-year-old cleric Ma'ruf Amin as his running mate, an uneasy pairing making for a very odd political couple.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Widodo and his running mate Ma'ruf Amin (R), a prominent Islamic cleric The opposition has also weaponised Islam and exploited the support of radical Muslim groups to win votes.
At the rallies of Mr Prabowo and Mr Sandiaga you can see the banners of conservative Islamic groups and Mr Prabowo has routinely whipped up emotions by arguing Muslims are being trodden on by the current government.
""This country is sick,"" he shouted at a recent rally in Jakarta.
""Muslim clerics and ulemas are being chased out of the country... The innocent who have expressed their opinions are being jailed in a country where freedom of expression is guaranteed by law.""
But the Prabowo-Sandi team is quick to reject accusations of pandering to Islamists.
""Come on man, look at me,"" Mr Sandiaga tells me on the campaign trail in a suburb of Jakarta, dressed in his trademark baseball cap and jeans.

Come on. We believe Muslim voters want what everyone wants - a strong economy, good jobs and a strong Indonesia.""
From street coffee vendor to politician 'Unity in diversity' But while religious considerations have played a disproportionate role in this election, there are other pressures on Indonesia's pluralism.
Indonesia's tribal and far-flung communities will also be voting, and their priorities are altogether different.

In Papua for instance, Indonesia's easternmost province, voters will be using the noken system, where tribal leaders will have the final say on who their tribe chooses as a candidate.
It's a system set up by the Indonesian election commission to reach the remotest communities - but one that might also be vulnerable to bribery and manipulation.

President Joko Widodo has tried to reach out to these other Indonesias by building infrastructure and development projects. That's gone some way to appease voters, but analysts say those demands will multiply after these polls, as Indonesians expect more from their leaders.
""Indonesian democracy is very much a work in progress,"" says Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences.
""We have been praised as the poster child of democracy... there's been a lot of complacency.""
But Ms Anwar is also an optimist. She believes Indonesian values of pluralism are here to stay - if they are protected.
""To be a real Indonesian you have to believe in unity in diversity,"" she says. ""That while Islam is the majority - we also have sizeable minorities.""
As Indonesia matures, it will have to protect its delicate pluralism from the challenges of its hard-won democracy, where the majority voice will always be the most strident.
You could say that in this vote, a thousand Indonesias are at stake."

Volkswagen chief executive Herbert Diess has told the BBC he is ""not aware"" of reports about detention camps holding thousands of Muslims in parts of China, a country where VW has been operating and producing cars for more than 30 years.
Rights groups have accused China of forcibly detaining and sometimes abusing Uighur Muslims in dozens of camps in Xinjiang province. Beijing denies this, saying people willingly attend special ""vocational schools"" which combat ""terrorism and religious extremism"".
VW employs hundreds of people at its Xinjiang production plant. Mr Diess spoke to the BBC's Shanghai correspondent, Robin Brant. 16 Apr 2019 "
