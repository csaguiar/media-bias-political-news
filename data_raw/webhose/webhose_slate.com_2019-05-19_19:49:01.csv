Venezuela: Opposition leader says armed forces are joining him.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/venezuela-guaido-maduro-coup.html,"Why So Many Black and Female Voters Seem to Be Buying What Biden Is Selling It’s all or nothing for Juan Guaidó now. Venezuela has been in an agonizing stalemate since January, when the opposition leader and president of the national assembly declared himself interim president of the country and was quickly recognized as such by the United States and the majority of governments in the region. President Nicolás Maduro, who remains in control of the country’s government and armed forces, has refused to budge. Meanwhile, crippling international sanctions have worsened the already dire economic conditions in what was once one of Latin America’s richest nations, now plagued by food and medicine shortages, widespread blackouts, and an ever-worsening refugee crisis. On Tuesday morning, Guaidó threw down a gauntlet by releasing a video from an air force base near the capital, Caracas, surrounded by armed military forces. Guaidó said that the “main military units of the Armed Forces” were backing what he called the final phase of “Operation Liberty.” He also appeared with imprisoned opposition leader Leopoldo López, who said he’d been freed by military guards loyal to Guaidó. Gunfire between pro-Guaidó and pro-Maduro troops was reported at the air base following Guaidó’s announcement. #OperacionLibertad was quickly backed on Twitter by U.S. officials including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, and Sen. Marco Rubio. Regional governments including Colombia and Brazil also voiced their support. Guaidó has been calling for the armed forces to back him from the beginning, but Tuesday’s actions are a significant escalation, the apparent beginning of an attempted military coup, though not everyone wants to call it that. Rubio, describing Guaidó as the internationally recognized legitimate president, has called CNN’s reporting “grotesque” and “shameful” for describing Tuesday’s events as an “armed coup.” He protests a bit too much: Calling something a coup is not a value judgment. Brutal dictators can be overthrown by their own militaries—just look at recent events in Sudan—and there are plenty of examples of militaries acting in coordination with peaceful protesters and even working to restore democracy . The bigger reason to be hesitant about calling Tuesday’s events a coup is that it’s not clear an overthrow is actually happening. The fighting at the air base fizzled out quickly, and while there have been demonstrations and violent clashes between protesters and security forces throughout Caracas, Reuters reports that “several hours after Guaidó’s announcement there was no sign of any other military activity and there were no immediate reports of casualties.” Maduro has tweeted that regional defense commanders have “expressed their total loyalty,” and until we see otherwise, the assumption should be that the bulk of the military is still backing the government. Still, if a small but significant part of the armed forces has defected to Maduro, it could raise the stakes of the standoff significantly: While the Maduro government has arrested hundreds of opponents in recent weeks, it hasn’t touched Guaidó himself, recognizing the risks of detaining the man whom many world governments recognize as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Bolton has promised a “significant response” if Guaidó is touched. Tuesday’s actions will raise pressure on the regime to take action to finally stop Guaidó, and raise pressure on his international backers to take action—peaceful or otherwise—on his behalf. Today may not be the final battle for control of Venezuela, but the odds just went up significantly that Guaidó will end up dead, in jail, or sitting in the presidential palace.

"Despite William Barr’s objections, it’s normal for Congress’ staff to question witnesses.",slate.com,W. Neil Eggleston,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-testimony-house-judiciary-committee-iran-contra-history.html,"Trump Just Gave Democrats Another Reason to Launch an Impeachment Inquiry As William Barr and the House Judiciary Committee have continued to spar over whether or not—and on what terms—the attorney general might appear in front of the committee later this week, I have been reminded of the congressional hearings that took place in the summer of 1987 regarding the Iran-Contra affair. At the time, I was deputy chief counsel of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions With Iran. Rep. Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, was the chairman of the House committee, and John Nields was chief counsel. Sen. Daniel Inouye was chairman of the parallel Senate committee, and Arthur Liman was chief counsel. The hearings performed both an oversight and a public education function as the country was struggling to understand what had happened within the administration regarding the secret sale of U.S. military missiles to Iran and the diversion of the proceeds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Although separate committees, the panels held the hearings jointly. Both senators and members of Congress attended the hearings and asked questions of the witnesses. It was essentially a joint investigation. In the summer of 1987, it was also riveting television. In the current case, the House Judiciary Committee has reported that Barr is threatening not to show up to scheduled testimony about the Mueller report on Thursday because the committee proposes to allow staff attorneys to question the attorney general. This allowance is in line with historical precedent, as I know well from my time working on the Iran-Contra hearings as a staff member who questioned top administration officials on behalf of the committee. Indeed, during the Iran-Contra hearings more than 30 years ago, I do not recall any administration witnesses refusing to testify at the hearing, except for Lt. Col. Oliver North and Adm. John Poindexter, who would not testify without immunity. The committees granted them immunity; they were later indicted and convicted at trial; and their convictions were overturned on appeal because of the immunity grant. I do not recall any limitations on the questions we were entitled to ask any witnesses, including administration witness, except that classified matters were addressed in closed testimony. Similarly, I do not recall the administration witnesses refusing to answer any questions. I do not recall any real or sustained objection to the decision to have committee lawyers conduct the questioning. Of particular relevance to the current dispute between the attorney general and the House Judiciary Committee, witnesses who testified at the hearings were first questioned on television and in open hearings not just by the members of Congress but by lawyers on the committees’ staff. As I recall, the House and Senate committees divided the witnesses over which committees’ staff would be the first questioner. If the Senate lawyer was the first questioner, the House lawyer would take a turn at the conclusion of the Senate lawyer’s questioning. Only then did the senators and members of the House begin their questioning. There was no serious outside challenge of whether committee lawyers would conduct the questioning or members of Congress would perform that role: Both did. This practice applied to all witnesses, including the Cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials who testified. Caspar Weinberger, who was secretary of defense, was later indicted for his testimony; he was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. Attorney General Edwin Meese also testified at the hearings without limitation. The committees believed that the oversight and public education functions of the hearings would be better met by initial uninterrupted questioning by committee counsel. The committees also believed that it was entirely under its discretion to determine the best method of conducting the hearings. Again, I do not recall any real or sustained objection to the decision to have committee lawyers conduct the questioning. The committee lawyers did not take the place of the members of the two committees, each of whom also had the opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses. Rather, the staff lawyer questioning permitted the foundation to be laid so that the member questions were more effective and more focused on the policy issues that the committee was exploring. The process the committees chose worked. The role of a committee lawyer questioner at the Iran-Contra hearings was not my only exposure to the practice of having counsel conduct questioning in congressional hearings. In the 1990s, I was an associate counsel in President Bill Clinton’s White House counsel’s office. I was called to testify before the Senate Whitewater Committee, an examination that also took place in an open hearing and on television. The initial questioning was done by Michael Chertoff, who was lead counsel to the committee. At the time, Republicans controlled the Senate, and Sen. Al D’Amato was the chairman. A number of Clinton administration witness were called to testify before that committee and, to my memory, were all questioned first by committee counsel. I don’t remember any objection from the Clinton White House to that process. What I vividly remember is that it was significantly more fun being the questioner than the witness.

"Warriors, Rockets complain too much.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/warriors-rockets-complain-too-much.html,"The Spurs Forgot How Fouling, Time, and Points Work On Sunday, the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets took part in what was ostensibly an NBA playoff game—the first of their Western Conference semifinals series—in Oakland, California. More than a matchup of professional basketball clubs, though, the Warriors’ 104–100 victory was a prelude to a postgame gripe session that looks set to continue into Tuesday night’s Game 2 and beyond. The bitching and moaning started on the court, crescendoing after this crucial play, in which the Rockets felt James Harden got fouled by the Warriors’ Draymond Green: CP3 got ejected after this wild Rockets final possession 😮 pic.twitter.com/qXqGJ9Yqjo — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) April 28, 2019 Defenders are prohibited from moving into the “ landing area ” of a player taking a shot. The NBA’s VP of refereeing would later admit that, earlier in the game, the Warriors’ Klay Thompson should’ve been whistled for undercutting Harden’s ability to land. But on this play, it looked like Harden kicked his feet forward unnaturally in an effort to draw contact; ESPN’s Scott Van Pelt has compiled video evidence demonstrating that Harden tends to make this kicking motion when there’s a defender in front of him but not when he’s wide open and shooting normally. While the NBA’s rule book doesn’t set precise dimensions for what constitutes a landing area, the league said in a postgame statement that referees had been correct not to call a foul given that Harden had only drawn contact by extending his legs. As you can see, Harden’s teammate Chris Paul was so upset by the sequence beginning with Harden’s shot that he got ejected and has since been fined $35,000 for “ recklessly making contact with a game official .” After the game, Harden—who shoots far more free throws than anyone in the league—complained that he wasn’t being given a “ fair chance ” by referees. And then it emerged that the Rockets had been so mad about the officiating in their Western Conference Finals loss to the Warriors last year that they’d prepared an entire report about it , one that argued that refereeing bias—rather than the 27 straight 3-point attempts they missed during Game 7—was responsible for their defeat. Which is all very tedious, coming from a team whose offensive strategy is largely predicated on exploiting the gray area between drawing fouls and flopping . Live by the sword, die by the sword, Daryl Morey! Does this mean we should all root for the Warriors instead ? Hardly! Golden State is also insistent, and has been for years , that NBA referees are biased against them . The paranoia manifests itself not just in comments to the press but in near-constant in-game complaining: This season Green and teammate Kevin Durant tied for the league lead in technical fouls with 16, while now-injured Warrior DeMarcus Cousins got 7 despite only playing in 30 games. (Efficient!) Last season, Green and Durant were second and third on the same list, and they’ve already gotten three techs each in this year’s playoffs. Durant has also recently complained that the media isn’t fair to him , while Green was suspended by the Warriors earlier in the season after reportedly calling Durant a “bitch” in a locker-room tirade . It’s truly a tangled web of techs and suspensions that the Warriors weave—an atmosphere of bickering made all the more bizarre by the fact that they are a team of All-Stars who win almost all their games. The hedonic treadmill is real. So, we have two of the league’s most popular and heavily promoted teams, each believing in a theory of persecution that’s supported by neither common sense nor statistical evidence , each more than willing to complain to anyone at any time about this and other subjects. The once-lovable favorites are drowning in a bitter marinade of whining and infighting, while the underdogs have snatched unlikability from the jaws of, uh, rootableness. Also, the teams’ game Tuesday night will be refereed by an official who was voted worst in the league in an anonymous poll of NBA players, and who both Harden and Paul have criticized publicly as recently as February. I’ll be pulling for the asteroid!"
Wonder What Wellness Branding Looks Like in Your Mouth? Kendall Jenner’s “Moon Oral Care” Is Here.,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/kendall-jenners-moon-oral-care-is-wellness-culture-in-your-mouth.html,"A “Nice” Guy Suddenly Said Awful Things to Me During Sex. Is This Normal? The Kardashian-Jenner empire is once again expanding. And for the first time, Kendall Jenner—previously the only sister without her own beauty brand—is getting involved in the industry conquests. In an Instagram post last Wednesday , the model and now entrepreneur announced she was excited to help launch Moon Oral Care (with the company’s founder, Shaun Neff). It is, rather obviously, a dental care line that is founded on the noble belief that “taking care of your teeth shouldn’t just do something — it should make you feel something.” What exactly that something is isn’t entirely clear. Perhaps that wonderful, tingly feeling of disrupting your periodontitis in full view of all your followers? It was only a matter of time before Jenner launched a product of her own, but with lip kits , perfume , jeans , and whatever Poosh is already staked out by her sisters, it was up in the air as to what region of the body she’d claim as hers to beautify. And with notable branded gaffes like that poorly thought out Pepsi commercial and Fyre Fest in her past, it’s safe to say that whatever Jenner launched needed to be relatively non-controversial. Hello, teeth . Along with acting as the brand’s face, Jenner also has a stake in Moon Oral Care’s business. The line includes Instagram-bait dental innovations like matte black toothbrushes, activated charcoal whitening toothpaste in “lunar peppermint,” and a special Kendall Jenner tooth-whitening pen, all in sleek packaging that will look at home next to your Sunday Riley serums and Glossier Cloud Paint. The entire line, which only includes natural, vegan, and PETA-certified ingredients, is already available on Moon Oral Care’s website and will be in ULTA stores starting in May. Jenner’s dental care line didn’t strike me at first as being at home with the rest of her family’s business ventures. Sure, charcoal toothpaste had its Instagram moment , and you can’t really ride the New York City subway without seeing a Quip toothbrush ad , but thus far Kardashian-Jenner-branded ventures have largely stayed within the lucrative realm of traditional beauty products that outlast a single trend cycle. When I think of the things that influencers are most likely to try to keep selling me, floss—jet-black packaging notwithstanding—isn’t really at the top of the list. But the fact that a member of one of the most business-savvy families in America has decided to stake a claim not in the relatively obvious, safe realms of makeup or clothes, but in something beauty-adjacent but also kind of gross like dental care, signals just what a behemoth the $4.2 trillion wellness industry has become. Moon Oral Care is one of many product lines that fit into the subtle cultural shift toward expensive beauty care that is marketed as “natural.” Rather than covering up flaws or (supposedly) turning back the clock with mysterious anti-aging compounds, these products perfect or brighten or whiten and only with the “best ingredients.” This evolution is at the heart of no-makeup makeup and the ongoing rise of frou-frou skin care, as well as the turn away from framing weight loss as a quest to well, lose weight. Instead, we are in pursuit of feeling stronger or cleansing our bodies of toxins, hiding our mothers’ diet culture in the new language of luxurious empowerment, of freedom from chemicals in a world where pollutants are slowly killing us and our planet. Indeed, Moon Oral Care promises a “routine worthy of your countertop,” an all-natural treat to yourself that you deserve, leagues above the unworthy drugstore toothpaste. And like so much wellness, it lies at the intersection of murky science and chic packaging. As a recent Atlantic piece by Ferris Jabr detailed , the evidence behind most dental procedures and interventions is tenuous at best. Because of the way that dentistry evolved, isolated from other more rigorously researched bodies of medicine, many of the truisms we hear about how best to take care of our teeth are little more than maxims passed down through the ages, internalized as truth. “As a profession, dentistry has not yet applied the same level of self-scrutiny as medicine, or embraced as sweeping an emphasis on scientific evidence,” Jabr writes. And yet, like skincare, dental care is designed to protect and perfect one of the very first things that others see when they interact with you. The lack of evidence behind treatments and products, combined with the fact that having bad skin and teeth can have a negative effect not just on self-esteem but on how others perceive you , creates a bevy of vulnerable underinformed consumers. In other words, a perfect market to corner in a larger industry that is designed to make you feel bad about yourself while simultaneously producing a solution to your woes. Of course, none of that makes Moon Oral Care uniquely devious. By all means, it’s probably as effective as any other dental product on the market, and it’s certainly prettier. But Jenner’s business-savvy step into both dental care and the marketing of “natural” ingredients as automatically superior to their “chemical” cousins suggests to me that we are only just beginning our journey toward the wellness-ification of everything. At the very least, it means that, served alongside with Instagram ads for dermabrasion or cycling classes, I can soon expect to see smiling influencers with charcoal-stained teeth."
10 Questions Raised by the Sonic the Hedgehog Trailer,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/sonic-hedgehog-trailer-questions-teeth-robotnik.html,"What’s It Like to Almost Beat Jeopardy ’s Game-Changing Champion? There’s been plenty of confusion surrounding the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie ever since its announcement, and the movie’s new trailer leaves us in an even murkier cloud of supersonic dust. Here are several of our most pressing questions. Is Sonic … an alien? Some of us thought he was just a normal anthropomorphic sneaker-wearing hedgehog. Is he a hedgehog, an alien, or a hedgehog alien? Are we going to have to brush up on our Sonic canon? Why is this trailer scored to “Gangsta’s Paradise”? Whether Sonic is a hedgehog, an alien, or a hedgehog alien, Coolio’s meditation on the cycle of violence in poor American communities still seems like a confusing music choice, at best. What happened to James Marsden’s career? This is a long way from playing an X-Man. And Jim Carrey’s? Has he been spending too much time painting ? If Sonic is from another planet, why does he speak English like Jean-Ralphio ? Are his language-learning skills as speedy as his feet? And what’s with his body ratio? He looks more like a very small man in a royal-blue gorilla suit than our classic long-legged ball of barbs. Even Sonic creator Yuji Naka wasn’t convinced by initial images, taking to Twitter to call out the creature’s humanlike torso. And his bare hands? Naka also noted the lack of handwear . Is this an origin story about how Sonic got his gloves? And those pearly whites?! While hedgehogs, in real life, do have teeth (Earth hedgehogs, anyway), Sonic typically does not. The trailer’s shot of his full set of choppers is, frankly, terrifying. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Are Sonic’s fox and *Googles* echidna friends still on their own … planet? Are they waiting until the second trailer to see whether this movie can justify its existence? Maybe we’d stay away, too."
The confirmation class that protested Methodist LGBTQ politics reveals the huge split within the church.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/methodist-church-lgbtq-policy-middle-school-protest.html,"What Happens When You No Longer Want to Be the Man You Were Raised to Become? Something unusual happened one recent Sunday morning at First United Methodist Church in Omaha, Nebraska. It was the Sunday after Easter, and a group of eight middle school students had spent the past school year in confirmation class together, preparing to become formal members of their church. Their confirmation service was set to take place that day. But this year, the class made other plans: Together, the students wrote a statement rejecting their membership as an act of resistance. Two class members read it in front of the church. “While we love our congregation,” they said, as their parents and other members watched from the pews, “we believe the United Methodist policies on LGBTQ+ clergy and same-sex marriage are immoral.” A clip from the presentation went viral on Monday, as evidence that “this generation will save us all”: In case you needed a reason to believe that this generation will save us all, here it is. The entire confirmation class at First United Methodist Omaha decided not to join at this time in protest of the UMC’s anti lgbtq+ policies. 🌈❤️ pic.twitter.com/mDjwMTu9ZJ — Sheri Shuler (@SheriShuler) April 28, 2019 It was pretty clear from that snippet that the congregation didn’t recoil in outrage at the youth protest; a smattering of applause can be heard in the last few seconds. But the clip didn’t capture the completeness of the church’s support for the act of defiance. According to Kent Little, FUMC’s lead pastor, the class received a standing ovation. Then the church offered a blessing for each child, “affirming their decision and affirming their faith,” followed by a celebratory lasagna dinner. Little said that he has only had one or two young people in 27 years decide to opt out of church membership after going through the confirmation class. “To have them band together and say ‘No,’ that’s not a small thing,” he said. “We adults could learn something from that.” This is a strange, sad time in many United Methodist Church congregations across the United States. At a large church conference in February, delegates voted to strengthen the denomination’s opposition to gay clergy and to same-sex marriage. Unlike many mainline denominations, the United Methodist Church has never formally welcomed gay clergy or sanctioned same-sex marriages. But in practice, the denomination offered individual congregations wide latitude in recent years. The triumph of the “traditional plan”—the name given to the proposal to crack down on queer clergy and same-sex marriage ceremonies in the church—changes that, threatening violators with suspension and defrocking. Last week, a Methodist court upheld the substance of the changes , which go into effect in January 2020. This is a strange, sad time in many United Methodist Church congregations across the United States. The “traditional plan” raises the possibility that the country’s largest mainline Protestant denomination will fracture over an issue about which it had long tolerated a measure of disagreement. The American branch of the denomination is not clearly liberal or conservative: Elizabeth Warren, George W. Bush, and Jeff Sessions are all Methodists. The overwhelmingly white American church is also shrinking. The vote in February signified the gathering strength of the denomination outside the United States; the “traditional plan” was backed by a coalition from the Philippines, countries from Africa, and other countries where a socially conservative version of Methodism is growing. American evangelical Methodists supported the plan too. Like many progressive Methodist churches, Little’s congregation is now figuring out whether its future lies outside of the denomination. FUMC is a large church, and it has a history of activism going back to the 19 th century. Its leaders like to tell stories about the time the congregation apparently refused to pay a pro-slavery pastor the denomination assigned to it in 1858, and about its support of the Native American civil rights leader Standing Bear a few decades later. In 1997, the church’s senior pastor, Jimmy Creech, performed a “covenant service” for two women; in 1999, he did the same for two men, and was defrocked by the denomination . The next year, the church joined a network of “reconciling” Methodist churches that advocates for the full inclusion of LGBTQ people into the denomination. In that context, the 2019 FUMC confirmation class’s decision to protest its denomination’s rightward shift is not a rejection of its own church, but an affirmation of what it’s learned from it. The church has a youth group specifically for queer young people, and it is hosting its annual “Pride Prom” in a few weeks. In its statement, the class cites the church as the source of the students’ convictions: “There are many things we have grown up appreciating about FUMC Omaha,” they wrote. “We have always known that gay families were just like any other families, [and] we are surrounded by peers with all gender identities … We appreciate that we have never thought anything was strange about women pastors. We have fond memories of singing in the children’s choir and watching the kites on Easter morning.” Little said the class started working on this statement after the church conference in February. The students’ teacher, Tim Fickenscher, told Religion News Service that the idea started with two girls in the class, and he gave others in the class wide latitude to come to different conclusions. By the time Little met individually with each student, the customary conclusion to the confirmation class, all eight had decided they could not in good conscience join the church. The class says in the letter that it will delay confirmations until it sees how FUMC responds to the “traditional plan.” In early April, the church council voted to withhold the remainder of the 2019 payments it would usually make to the denomination while it decides how to move forward. It also voted to continue hosting same-sex weddings and encouraging the clergy to officiate, in defiance of the denomination. The next step is to hold a series of small group meetings to start determining which path the congregation as a whole prefers. It could stay in the denomination and continue the struggle; disaffiliate and join another denomination, like the United Church of Christ; or become an independent church. “Those of us who want change and full inclusion, can we create something new? And how long do we wait for that to happen?” Little asked. “For a lot of people, the UMC is our home. How do you walk away from that?”"
Trump’s “execute the baby” lie has a dangerously effective history.,slate.com,Rebecca Onion,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-execute-baby-propaganda-history.html,"Why So Many Black and Female Voters Seem to Be Buying What Biden Is Selling On Saturday, at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Donald Trump repeated his absurd claim that pro-choice women and doctors are “executing” newborns and therefore must be stopped by stricter laws. The most recent version of Trump’s ginned-up nightmare , which the president has taken to conjuring on the campaign trail this year, referenced a bill advanced by state Republicans that would make doctors liable if they withhold medical care from a fetus that had survived an abortion attempt. Because doctors would already provide that care in such an (extremely unlikely) event, the Democratic governor has promised to veto it. But Trump’s fantasy brooks no facts: “The baby is born,” he declared. “The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.” (Cue righteous boos from the audience.) How can the reality-based community, where it is understood that mother-doctor infanticide conspiracies are not real, even respond to a story like this? One response is: Tell the truth about the difficult circumstances around nonviable pregnancies. This time around, a former NICU nurse wrote a viral Twitter thread about what happens in a hospital after the birth of a baby too disabled to live. The last time Trump told this crazy story, in February, while discussing recent New York state legislation to expand abortion rights past the 24 th week in cases where the fetus isn’t viable or the mother’s life is threatened, OB-GYN and writer Jen Gunter described her own experience giving birth to a “son who was born to die” in a New York Times op-ed, titled “ I Didn’t Kill My Baby .” But none of these earnest and well-meant counternarratives are going to change the minds of people who already believe that women and doctors might actually do something like this. That’s because the story is much more than “bullshit,” a “lie,” or a “falsehood.” Trump’s abortion story is a piece of atrocity propaganda. It draws on a centuries-old trope—the cruel and capricious murder of infants—to confirm his supporters’ beliefs that the liberals and feminists living among them are, secretly, selfish monsters. And for those who’ve deployed it in the past, it has proved dangerously effective. This is why, out of all the terrifying crap that comes out of his mouth, I think it might be the scariest. Here’s the history Trump is tapping. The most durable murdered-babies lie ever is the blood libel. Anti-Semitic accusations of Jewish ritual murder of children have fueled pogroms since at least the 12 th century. (The Holocaust Encyclopedia finds mention of such charges against Jews as far back as the second century B.C.) Over the years, this idea that Jews kill children for their blood has found purchase in writings by people as integral to the “Western tradition” as Geoffrey Chaucer and Martin Luther. The Nazis made extensive use of the theme. In 1939, the cover of the anti-Semitic newspaper Der Stürmer featured a medieval depiction of a group of Jewish adults draining blood from a toddler while the bodies of five already-murdered children lie at their feet. Nor are such blood libels a relic of the past. As Talia Lavin has observed , the manifesto allegedly written by last weekend’s synagogue shooter contained a reference to Simon of Trent, a 2-year-old Christian boy who died in Italy in 1475 and whose death was used as pretext for a wave of anti-Semitic violence. Even as Jews have borne the brunt of the baby-killing myth, propagandists for other causes have used it to their advantage. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, in which Irish Catholics attacked Protestant settlers, depositions of witnesses to the events were published in London, shifting the tide of British opinion against the Irish . The witnesses often mentioned hearing of—but never seeing —Irish Catholics ripping open pregnant women, pulling out their babies, and beating them to death against rocks. In 1782, Benjamin Franklin, of all people, put together a counterfeit newspaper with an article supposedly describing atrocities committed by the Seneca Indians against colonial frontier families at the behest of the British government. (By telling this story, Franklin wanted to turn the British public against their government and give the new United States purchase at the peace negotiations that were ongoing at the time.) In this grisly fiction, a Seneca representative mailed a British agent a bunch of scalps of American frontier families, including scalps of boys and girls, as well as “29 little infant Scalps of various sizes; … a little black Knife in the middle to shew they were ript out of their Mothers’ Bellies.” Anti-German propaganda during World War I was full of violently murdered babies. After the war, Arthur Ponsonby, a liberal member of Parliament interested in exposing the way such propaganda helped shape the public’s will to fight, published a report called “ Falsehood in War-Time ”(1929), which included a chapter titled “The Belgian Baby Without Hands.” In it, Ponsonby collected the many times that this story—that German soldiers invading Belgium had cut off babies’ and children’s hands and arms, often leaving them alive to serve as warnings to the populace—appeared in French, British, American, and Italian newspapers. In France, Ponsonby found, newspapers even embellished the story by “depicting German soldiers eating the hands.” The story of the handless baby or child traveled even further than the other tales of babies impaled on bayonets or nailed to doors, despite the fact that it seemed physically improbable that any child could survive such mutilation. “Everybody wanted to believe the story,” Ponsonby writes, “and many went so far as to say they had seen the baby.” Despite the modicum of caution Americans and British people felt toward anti-German propaganda after the baroque excesses of the run-up to the First World War, 1940s Americans were much more comfortable consuming propaganda that demonized the Japanese. And so the baby killers migrated east. Historian John Dower notes that, in an American propaganda film made during World War II , actors playing Japanese soldiers tossed Chinese babies onto bayonets. The baby-killing fable still works to foment war. Most recently, in the run-up to the Gulf War, the American PR firm Hill & Knowlton, hired by the Kuwaiti government in exile, helped spread a dubiously sourced atrocity story about Iraqi soldiers ripping premature babies from incubators in a hospital so that they could carry off the machines, then leaving the infants on the floor to die. The story really went early-1990s viral when the daughter of Kuwait’s ambassador to the United States gave “testimony” about the incident, which she at first claimed to have witnessed (and later said she’d heard about from others), in front of a congressional committee. But here we have a president (who, always remember, probably doesn’t actually care whether anyone has an abortion) spreading baby-killing propaganda against his own people. In so doing, he’s contributing to what scholar Carol Mason calls “the apocalyptic narrative of pro-life politics. ” Mason surveys books, pamphlets, speeches, and ephemera produced by and for anti-abortion activists between the 1960s and 2000s, and shows how they depicted the abortion debate as an epic battleground between good and evil. Through these stories, Mason writes, pro-life Christians came to see themselves as “a chosen minority facing a satanic majority hell-bent on providing abortions.” Trump’s story, clumsy though it may sound to the uninitiated, fits right into this cosmology. In 1984, sociologist Kristin Luker observed , after interviewing activists on either side of the abortion debate, that large amounts of “surprise, outrage, and vindictiveness” occur within conversations on this issue because it calls people’s “world views” into question—those ideals that are so deep inside us that we don’t even know how to name them. “Denying that one’s opponents are decent, honorable people is one way of distancing oneself from the unsettling thought that there could be legitimate differences of opinion on one’s most cherished beliefs,” Luker wrote. For the anti-choice activists Luker interviewed, the possibility of choosing abortion strikes at the heart of their understanding of women’s purpose: to become mothers. That’s why the detail of the blanket in Trump’s story—“They wrap the baby beautifully”—sticks in the mind, as it’s meant to do. These baby-killing liberals, this story telegraphs to Trump’s base, are coldblooded and unnatural, offering care one minute and turning on their infants in the next. Possibly, the story says first, they aren’t even women. Possibly, it implies next, they aren’t even human."
Trump just gave Democrats another reason to launch an impeachment inquiry.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-democrats-impeachment-house-subpoena-deutsche-bank-lawsuit.html,"William Barr’s Testimony Implies That Robert Mueller Should Say Whether Trump Committed a Crime President Donald Trump keeps giving the House of Representatives excellent reasons to begin an official impeachment inquiry. The latest came on Monday when Trump and some members of his family filed a lawsuit to quash subpoenas asking Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to turn over financial records concerning the Trumps and their business. The president argues that House Democrats issued the subpoenas for illegitimate reasons unconnected to any formal business of Congress. This argument is quite weak under Supreme Court precedent , since Congress has broad constitutional authority to conduct investigations. But if Democrats are worried about making the case in court that their subpoenas are tethered to a legitimate congressional function, they have a simple solution at hand: Admit that these subpoenas may serve as a prelude to impeachment. No one seriously questions Congress’ power to issue subpoenas as part of its oversight duties. But Trump’s lawyers insist that these subpoenas, which have not yet been released to the public, go too far. They were, Monday’s lawsuit alleges, “issued to harass” the president, “to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances” to locate “material that might be used to cause him political damage.” Because “no grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one,” the suit claims, the federal courts must prohibit the banks from complying with the subpoenas. This analysis might be compelling from a partisan perspective. But from a legal standpoint, it is highly dubious. In 1975’s Eastland v. United States Servicemen’s Fund , the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause generally bars courts from interfering with congressional subpoenas. The court explained that as long as Congress is operating within the “sphere of legitimate legislative activity” or “with respect to other matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House,” the judiciary is flatly forbidden from impeding its subpoena power. Trump’s lawyers insist that Democrats’ subpoenas breach this sphere, writing that “investigations are legitimate only insofar as they promote some legitimate legislative purpose.” And because “there is no possible legislation at the end of this tunnel,” the subpoenas fall outside the House’s constitutional authority and must be quashed. This reading of Eastland is, at best, creative: The Supreme Court did not limit the “legitimate legislative sphere” to the deliberation of legislation alone. Instead, citing an earlier case , it asked whether the subpoenas were part of the “deliberative and communicative processes … with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.” Note that the court did not require Congress to justify its subpoenas by pointing to some proposed legislation that an investigation might further. Rather, the court explained that “the power to investigate is inherent in the power to make laws” and that the “issuance of subpoenas” has “long been held to be a legitimate use by Congress of its power to investigate.” In other words, Congress’ paramount constitutional duty is to “make laws.” To legislate, Congress must investigate; to investigate, Congress must issue subpoenas. And courts may not second-guess a congressional committee’s decision that an otherwise lawful subpoena may aid future legislation. Under constitutional text and Supreme Court precedent, then, Trump’s lawsuit should fail. The current Supreme Court, however, has not proved especially respectful of precedent. It also seems eager to shield this administration from scrutiny and aggrandize Trump’s powers . So, it certainly wouldn’t hurt if the House had a backup argument—one that relied not only on precedent linking investigations to legislation, but that explained how these subpoenas directly assist the House exercise “matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.” That’s where impeachment comes into play. There is a possibility—not huge, but not trivial—that conservative judges could interfere with these subpoenas by asserting that they are too detached from actual legislation to constitute “legitimate legislative” actions. But Congress does not only have the power to make laws; it also has the power to impeach the president. It shares that authority with no other body; the decision to impeach the president is the House’s alone. And as ThinkProgress’ Ian Millhiser has noted , the House’s power to investigate the president’s potential “high crimes and misdemeanors” is inherent in its authority to impeach him. Congress members need to inspect the president’s alleged crimes to determine whether impeachment is an appropriate remedy. Under constitutional text and Supreme Court precedent, then, Trump’s lawsuit should fail. If Trump’s lawsuit winds up before a court that appears hostile to the subpoenas, the House should be prepared to explain why its investigation is necessary to promote all of its legitimate congressional interests. Not just hypothetical legislation, but in other core constitutional powers. Congress already knows that Trump may have accepted payments from foreign governments in violation of the Constitution . It also knows that he obstructed justice in an effort to impede special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation—which, among other things, reportedly inspected Trump’s financial records. Congress thus has an excellent reason to subpoena bank records of Trump, his business, and his family, seeking proof of misconduct grave enough to trigger impeachment proceedings. Any court that hampered the House’s ability to obtain those materials by exercising its subpoena powers would act in clear contravention of the Constitution. Even in our increasingly Trump-friendly judiciary, it is difficult to imagine judges so blatantly interfering with the congressional process. Democrats should admit what everyone already knows: These subpoenas may undergird eventual articles of impeachment. There is nothing shameful about that, and no reason to keep it a secret. To the contrary, it’s a smart strategy to fend off Trump’s legal challenge and remind courts that the House is operating squarely within its constitutional prerogatives. Support our journalism

Here’s the perfect big economic policy idea for Pete Buttigieg.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/pete-buttigieg-economic-policy-warren-sanders-2020.html,"Here’s Why the Dothraki Attack in Game of Thrones Was So Devastating Pete Buttigieg sometimes gets criticized for not talking enough about public policy, which I think is a bit unfair. Early on, the precocious mayor of South Bend made it clear that his first priority as president would be a series of small d-democratic reforms that might also happen to help the big D-Democratic Party—from granting statehood to Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico to potentially overhauling the way Supreme Court appointments are made. The 37-year-old wants to make sure the U.S. doesn’t fall into permanent minority rule under the GOP, which is a big part of why the press started paying attention to him in the first place, especially millennial journalists at outlets like mine and others where we like to dwell on the precariousness of the entire U.S. political system (which is also why it’s a bit odd that some people on the left have caricatured him as a milquetoast moderate suit). What Buttigieg really hasn’t done is lay out a traditional domestic agenda focused on issues like economics or health care, the way Sens. Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren—whose entire campaign apparatus is essentially a mini think tank—have. Instead, he’s focused on telling his personal story, dropping literary references, and talking about national values, an Obama-esque strategy that’s yielded political dividends but probably can’t go on forever. I mean, even Beto O’Rourke, the LiveJournal candidate, just rolled out a 3,000-word climate change plan. At some point, Mayor Pete is going to need a big economic idea. One can’t campaign on a love of Ulysses and court reform alone. So I’d like to offer a suggestion. Buttigieg should back a job guarantee, but wrap the concept in a big gauzy, swath of patriotism by calling it a national service corps to win over moderates who’d ordinarily recoil at the idea. The jobs guarantee, you may recall, was the hot lefty policy idea around this time last year— an extremely simple and incredibly radical proposal in which the federal government would promise to directly provide a job to every American citizen who needs work. The notion has been floating around for a while, but after it gained traction in some thinkier corners of the internet, Democratic candidates including Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Sanders all backed some version. There are a number of, shall we say, unanswered questions about how a job guarantee would actually work. For one, nobody really has any clue what the government would hire all of these unemployed Americans to do; some advocates talk nebulously about “care work,” like looking after the elderly and children, a lot of which should probably be handled by professionals rather than a temporary workforce that waxes and wanes depending on the health of the economy. Others take inspiration from the Depression-era Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps, and imagine massive public works projects, as if this wouldn’t massively tick off America’s construction unions. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman from Silicon Valley, has offered up a modified job guarantee (he prefers to call it a “job opportunity bill”) that tries to deal with some of these issues. Modeled off a smallish program that ran during the Great Recession, it would pay private employers in the nonprofit, public, and private sectors to hire workers who have either been unemployed for 90 days or whose income leaves them under the poverty line. The jobs would last up to 18 months, with the possibility of a temporary extension, with the goal of getting people into real-world jobs where they could receive some training and a foothold in the labor market. It’s the closest thing to a workable model for something resembling a job guarantee. Now, what does any of this have to do with Buttigieg? Lately, the candidate has been talking about how he’d like to create a supersized national service program, in order to try and foster a new sense of national unity and purpose. “We really want to talk about the threat to social cohesion that helps characterize this presidency but also just this era,” he told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow earlier this month. “One thing we could do that would change that would be to make it, if not legally obligatory, but certainly a social norm that anybody after they’re 18 spends a year in national service.” Now, on the one hand, expanding opportunities for national service is typically a little hard to get excited about. It’s an old warhorse proposal politicians like to bring up when they want to get a glowing write-up from someone like David Brooks (who, by the way, seems very taken with Buttigieg). But here’s the thing: It’s also could be pretty wildly ambitious. There are around 8 million 18- and 19-year-old Americans right now. To put that in perspective, Americorps, our current stump of a (non-military) national service program, only has about 75,000 volunteers per year. If Buttigieg really wants to create a national service program that can provide every young adult with a gap year doing good in their community, he’ll have to do the sort of logistical thinking and planning necessary for a job guarantee. So why not go a little bigger? Why not mash together this hypothetical National Service Corps with a proposal like Khanna’s, by opening it up to the unemployed and underemployed who need job skills? You could even make private sector work an option for older applicants in need of a job or retraining? Politically, there are several advantages to this approach. For one, calling it a national service program instead of a job guarantee would probably disarm some of the opposition from moderates who are skeptical of socalism-tinged economic schemes. It would also give the government some leeway to scale the program over time, as more community organizations either sprouted up or expanded in order to start taking advantage of new workers. Now, am I writing all of this mostly because I’m a policy and economics geek who would be personally amused if an ex-McKinsey consultant managed to package a radical policy proposal with roots in the utopian left in a way that appealed to the mushy centrists of the New York Times opinion page? Sure, yes, absolutely. But I also think it’d be an interesting way for a candidate like Buttigieg to fuse his broad theme of restoring American institutions and national unity with a big play for economic justice. Just an idea. Support our journalism

Federal judge rules in favor of Democrats in emoluments lawsuit against Trump.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/federal-judge-rules-for-democrats-emoluments-lawsuit-case-against-trump-hotel.html,"Barr Rigged Trump’s Acquittal A federal judge, on Tuesday, ruled in favor of congressional Democrats, allowing their lawsuit that accuses President Trump of violating the emoluments clauses of the Constitution to proceed. More than 200 Democrats in Congress filed suit against Trump last year alleging his ongoing business interests that have continued into his presidency amounts to receiving payments from foreign governments, which is expressly prohibited by the Constitution. Trump has technically stepped down from the day-to-day running of the Trump Organization, but still has ultimate authority over its operation and profits from its success. That creates problems, Democrats (and others) allege, because the president is in a position to directly benefit from the actions of foreign governments who could stay in his hotels or engage with any of his other businesses as an effort to curry favor. There is a separate case currently working its way through the court system, brought by the attorneys general of D.C. and Maryland, that specifically deals with the potential emolument violations of Trump’s D.C. hotel. In that case, Justice Department lawyers have successfully blocked efforts to subpoena Trump’s financial records, but Tuesday’s ruling gives new hope to Democrats looking to ensure Trump’s opaque financial dealings aren’t above the law. Justice Department lawyers representing the president had asked the court to dismiss the suit on the basis that, the DOJ says, the clause is not intended to be an overall ban on private business transactions with foreign governments. Despite decades of arguing the exact opposite, far stricter interpretation of emoluments, the DOJ has changed its tune under the Trump administration and adopted a far more tailored interpretation of the clause such that it only bars a president from taking payment from a foreign government for an act he undertakes in his official capacity as president. That literal reading seems like a pretty naive understanding of how influence and corruption are carried out. Either way, Trump’s lawyers say that since his profits are from market-rate transactions they are not emoluments, or gifts, just, you know, deals. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan rejected the DOJ’s narrow interpretation of what constitutes an emolument as “unpersuasive and inconsistent.” Sullivan ruled in September that the Democrats had legal standing to pursue the case, but still needed to weigh in on the definition of an emolument in order to determine if Trump might be breaking the law. “The emoluments cases, which could eventually end up at the Supreme Court, appear to mark the first time that federal judges have interpreted these clauses and applied their restrictions to a sitting president,” the Washington Post reports . “Led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the Democrats filed their suit last year asking the court to force Trump to stop accepting payments they consider violations of the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause.” "
"Infrastructure Week, really? Democrats and Trump talk about a bill.",slate.com,Jim Newell,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/infrastructure-week-democrats-trump-meeting-really.html,"Trump Just Gave Democrats Another Reason to Launch an Impeachment Inquiry It is once again Infrastructure Week in Washington, and this time, it might be more than a joke. Congressional Democratic leaders visited the White House on Tuesday to sketch out the contours of a bill, and initial reactions suggested that the meeting went well, with all principals minding their manners. The two sides will aim for a $2 trillion package targeted at rebuilding “roads, highways, bridges, tunnels and railroads, modernizing our air travel system, and expanding broadband access for our great farmers and rural America,” per a White House statement. Democrats and the Trump administration agreed to meet again in a few weeks to discuss the more nettlesome question of financing. Is there any reason to believe that this infrastructure effort will end differently than any of the other times over the past decade that leaders have called for upgrading “our crumbling roads and bridges,” before forgetting about it? In fact, maybe. Some favorable incentives to pass such a bill are in place for the two most crucial figures in any major bipartisan legislation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump. But there are still vast policy disagreements separating the two sides, and whether they allow those disagreements to scuttle the entire effort is a political choice that all involved will have to make. Pelosi wants to show that her majority is capable of governing and to give her dozens of vulnerable House members—all of whom campaigned on passing an infrastructure bill—an accomplishment on which to run. Both she and those vulnerable members are particularly sensitive to the impression that they would only use their majority to investigate the president. This meeting, which Democrats requested just as they were getting a tsunami of questions about impeachment, was itself an effort to change the conversation. In Trump’s case, he, too, would like a big, bipartisan accomplishment that throws trillions of dollars toward American jobs while he’s running for reelection. No longer does he have to abide by former adviser Gary Cohn’s plan from early 2018 to leverage a more modest investment of $200 billion through the private sector. (Trump never liked that plan and was so bored upon its presentation that he drew doodles about Steve Bannon throughout the meeting about it.) Democrats control the House now, and they would prefer to spend on public investment rather than give private corporations some money to pocket. But, while the political will to spend trillions on infrastructure exists among both House Democrats and the White House, members of both parties are already drawing policy lines in the sand. On Monday, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter to the White House saying that the package must be paid for “with substantial, new and real revenue.” Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor later that day, offered a suggestion for a source of revenue: rolling back some of Republicans’ signature 2017 tax legislation. “By reversing only the most egregious giveaways in President Trump’s tax bill—those given to the wealthiest of the wealthiest—and raising the corporate tax rate a smidge,” Schumer said. “We could finance the entirety of a trillion dollar infrastructure bill.” (Now that they’re looking at a $2 trillion bill, two smidges might be in order.) And while the president has been receptive to increasing the gas tax to pay for an infrastructure package, Democratic leaders are not. “Unless President Trump considers undoing some of the 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy,” a source close to Schumer said, “Schumer won’t even consider a proposal from the president to raise the gas tax, of which the poor and working people would bear the brunt.” “Working people shouldn’t take another big financial hit in order to be able to get to work and take care of essentials,” Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Finance Committee who was also at Tuesday’s White House meeting, told reporters on Monday, “and particularly not when the big multinational companies, which are causing most of the wear and tear to the infrastructure, got all of these tax breaks.” I asked Wyden whether he had any reason to believe that the president would be open to undoing some of his biggest legislative accomplishment. “You would have to ask him,” he said. Or I wouldn’t, because such a bill would never reach the Oval Office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that rolling back the 2017 tax bill, at all, to pay for an infrastructure package would be a “nonstarter” in the Senate. “You would have to ask him,” Wyden said. Or I wouldn’t, because such a bill would never reach the Oval Office. “This tax bill is what’s generated this robust economy,” McConnell said at his weekly press conference. “The last thing we want to do is step on all of this growth by stepping back and repealing, in effect, what has generated all of this prosperity and low unemployment.” Republicans in Congress, along with some of the president’s advisers, would prefer to bring down the bill’s cost by loosening requisite environmental, permitting, and labor regulations. While Trump was meeting with Democrats, his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, made these points in an interview, saying that he’s told the president he “won’t see a single lane of traffic or road paved before the end of your second term” without regulatory changes.” Mulvaney was generally skeptical of a deal coming together. “Do I think there’s an interest in doing it? Yes,” he said. “Do I think there’s probably more interest, especially on the Democrats’ part, to make a show for trying to get a deal? Yeah.” Mick Mulvaney, a piece of work though he may be, may have it right here, even if it’s more of a two-way street than he lets on. As much as Pelosi may want to protect her front-line members facing reelection, she and Schumer must also recognize that cutting such a deal with Donald Trump would help his reelection chances and invite blowback from the Democratic base.And congressional Republicans, too, don’t want to give off the impression that everything runs smoothly when the Republican president works with a Democratic Congress. The safer route for either side would be to set up the meetings, walk through the motions, blame the other party’s rigidity as the talks fall apart, and then campaign blandly on infrastructure ahead of the election. And if neither party wins unified control of Congress and the White House in 2020? Repeat. Support our journalism

Mueller wrote letter to Attorney General Barr criticizing portrayal of Russia investigation findings.,slate.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/mueller-wrote-letter-to-attorney-general-barr-criticizing-portrayal-of-russia-investigation-findings.html,"Swarthmore Students Occupy Frat House After Documents Leak With Reference to “Rape Attic” Special counsel Robert Mueller wrote a curt letter to Attorney General Bill Barr complaining about Barr’s characterization of the special counsel’s findings to Congress, the Washington Post reports . Days after Barr wrote a four-page memo to Congress outlining what he said were the key findings of the Mueller report, Mueller responded in a letter dated March 27, telling Barr he found his portrayal of the recently completed report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the findings. Barr’s memo several days earlier was the first inkling the general public had received of the conclusions of the nearly two-year long special counsel investigation. Barr wrote that there was insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy by the Trump campaign in its dealings with Russians and that while Mueller’s team had not come to a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice, Barr had reviewed the evidence and found there wasn’t enough of it to support charging Trump with obstruction. In his response to Barr, Mueller, per the Washington Post’s reporting, seemed to take umbrage with Barr’s characterization of the obstruction findings. “The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” Mueller wrote. “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.” The Barr memo was worded and released in such a way that implied Mueller had given Trump a pass on obstruction, a point which was picked up in news coverage of Barr’s description. When the Mueller report itself became public this month however, it became clear that Mueller had compiled a substantial obstruction case, leaving it to Congress to decide whether to pursue it. Barr’s release of the report’s findings, however, went to great lengths to set a narrative that Trump was in the clear and give it time to congeal well before there was any information available to refute Trump’s barrage of self-exculpatory tweets. Mueller’s letter appears to hint at that frustration around what appears to have been an intentional attempt to muddy the water. DOJ officials told the Post they were surprised at the tone of the letter and Barr and Mueller spoke on the phone for 15 minutes the following day in what was described as a cordial conversation that included differences on how to proceed with the report’s release. “After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller’s letter, he called him to discuss it,” a Justice Department spokeswoman said Tuesday. “In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading. But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel’s obstruction analysis. They then discussed whether additional context from the report would be helpful and could be quickly released.” “However, the Attorney General ultimately determined that it would not be productive to release the report in piecemeal fashion,” the spokeswoman’s statement continues. “The Attorney General and the Special Counsel agreed to get the full report out with necessary redactions as expeditiously as possible.” Stay tuned, Barr is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning for questioning."
Why it was so important for PewDiePie to denounce “subscribe to PewDiePie.”,slate.com,Evan Urquhart,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/pewdiepie-subscribe-meme-new-zealand-video.html,"Trump’s “Tim Apple” Gaffe Is No Gaffe at All. It’s a Sensible Way to Remember Someone. You know the violence has gotten pretty bad when a YouTuber feels it necessary to denounce his own subscription drive. In a video on Sunday, YouTube megastar PewDiePie made the surprising request that “I think it’s time to end the ‘subscribe to PewDiePie’ movement, or meme.” It was a belated response to the slogan being used by a mass murderer in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15—and to the phrase more generally having been adopted by the white supremacists and trolls found in online warrens like 8chan, where the shooter was a poster—but it should come as a relief to anyone who knows a young person who is a PewDiePie fan. Here, finally, is a place to start a conversation about how, sometimes, an “ironic” joke or a meme can sour into a calling card for a movement that non-ironically wants huge numbers of people to die for their religion or their race. If only there were a clearer dividing line between racist scum whom we should shun forever and 13-year-olds who like lolz, this world would be an easier place to live in. But like me, you might have young relatives, children of friends, or friends of your children who grew up watching PewDiePie play video games and goof around. If you ask them, you’ll probably find that many of these youth don’t understand why everyone is so mad at poor PewDiePie. Then, if you let them, they’ll probably try to explain to you, earnestly, that all those instances of anti-Semitism on PewDiePie’s YouTube channel were misunderstood jokes. Unless you’re lucky, after they explain this they won’t want to hear anything more. How did we get here? A Swedish gamer and entertainer known for his edgy humor and Let’s Play –style gaming videos, PewDiePie became the holder of the most-subscribed channel on YouTube in 2013, and he held that position until an Indian music channel called T-Series threatened to surpass his subscriber count last year. Although PewDiePie himself is more or less apolitical, those anti-Semitic jokes, and the backlash they engendered, earned him support and sympathy within the alt-right/white supremacist movement. PewDiePie, in return, has occasionally followed or recommended the content of some people from these communities. In that context, his drive to have people “subscribe to PewDiePie” in order to keep him at the top spot (thereby resisting a non-European, nonwhite challenge to his dominance) seems to have resonated deeply with racist online trolls, including one who vandalized a WWII memorial and another who became the shooter at Christchurch. The nuances of how an apolitical but edgy-racism-tinged YouTuber has become a symbol for real racists he disavows is a hard thing to explain to his young fans. I’ve blundered into more than a few of these conversations, and the result is always a train wreck. Provocative online trolls, including members of the alt-right, have set a neat trap whereby anyone who criticizes racist, sexist, or anti-Semitic humor is a hysterical social justice warrior, which doesn’t leave a lot of room to help a young person understand the ways “just joking” is currently being used by deadly serious racists to deflect, to camouflage, and to recruit. These people, whom PewDiePie dismissed in his video as a few deadbeats in an otherwise positive fan community, aren’t stanning the guy with the history of “ironic” anti-Semitism by accident. When you chum the water, it should come as no surprise when this attracts a pack of sharks. But although this is all perfectly clear to any adult who’s been paying attention, a young person who lacks a frame of reference may have trouble taking it in. This is especially so when online racists are waging a propaganda campaign to ensure these kids stay angry and alienated by anything that sounds even vaguely like something an SJW might say. That’s why PewDiePie coming out against his own subscription slogan feels so huge. Not because PewDiePie’s hands are clean, but because his willingness to draw the line at being associated with mass murder means that there actually is a line. It’s not just joking when the guy who says “subscribe to PewDiePie” goes on to take 50 innocent lives. It’s no longer a funny game when this same murderer flashes the OK sign , thereby tricking gullible people into thinking that … the OK sign is something a white supremacist mass murderer might flash. Whatever their origins, these jokes are not just jokes, and these memes are more than just memes. Who is using them now, and why, matters much more than the motives of whoever originated them. With his video, PewDiePie has finally acceded to the truth: Even if you personally disagree with murdering people for their race or religion, it is still possible that through your action or inaction you could give comfort and shelter to people who do. If this happens, then however innocent you feel yourself to be, you have a responsibility to act. This is no small thing. It is foundational to understanding how racism and hatred function in our world to know that it requires relatively little from us to grow strong and thrive—some silence here, laughing at a tasteless joke there, and before you know it your YouTube channel is the recruiting ground for would-be genocideers. If PewDiePie has accepted this, however late, however gracelessly and partially, it gives the rest of us a place to start when talking with his young fans."

Conan: Andy Richter didn't enjoy Avengers: Endgame because he saw the wrong movie.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/andy-richter-avengers-endgame-romantic-comedy-homonym-conan-obrien.html,"The theatrical experience continues to decline. TBS After its box-office-record smashing weekend , everyone was talking about Avengers: Endgame , and the cast of Conan was no exception. On Tuesday, the late-night host discussed Marvel’s latest smash hit with his sidekick Andy Richter. Andy had a slightly different moviegoing experience than the rest of America: And that is why you never go to the movies at the Homonym on Wilshire. It was a cruel lesson for Richter, but it’s also an inspiring business model for the rest of us. If The Asylum has been able to lurch along since 1997 with a direct-to-video model based on homonyms and misunderstandings, there’s no reason consumers wouldn’t want to get ripped off the same way, but with popcorn. Why yes, this does seem like a good place to embed the trailer to Independents’ Day : I am a sucker for any joke in which two people believe they are taking about the same thing, but very much are not, and Richter’s moviegoing mishap is a good execution of that basic structure. But it’s still a sketch: both Richter and Conan are working from a script, slowly leaking out enough information to make the premise clear, and both men know that they’re making a joke. The best execution of this structure, now and probably forever, was Jon Hendren’s legendary discussion of Edward Snowden on HLN, in which he got host Yasmin Vossoughian to unwittingly help him pull off the same bit. Wait for it: It’s hilarious watching Hendren string Vossoughian along, but on rewatching, I realize his version of the joke is slightly hampered by the fact that he plays fast and loose with the details. There’s no waterbed or topiary in the movie, which is about a low-budget film director trying to make an epic about the North African campaign of the Roman Civil War.

"Introducing Man up, Slate’s podcast about manhood and masculinity in 2019.",slate.com,Aymann Ismail,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/man-up-podcast-masculinity-2019-aymann-ismail.html,"Comment Listen to the show in Apple Podcasts , another podcast player, or the player below. When they immigrated from Egypt, my parents brought a lot of ideas about what kind of men their sons should be. It was all around my blue-collar, immigrant corner of North Jersey: a wife from the tribe, dutiful kids, a man as the natural leader. As the youngest of four kids, three of them boys, I didn’t much question who I was meant to be. In fact, I took it for granted, shut down my doubts in my teen years, and took on an air of tough indifference. If I acted like that man, then I would be that man. It worked for a while. Fast forward about 15 years, and I’m married— kind of by accident . In two years with my wife, I’ve realized how little of our marriage my parents would recognize. My wife and I are open with each other about things I never thought I would talk about with anyone when I was younger, when I equated openness with failed masculinity. I didn’t plan it this way. At the same time, I didn’t fight it. I don’t know what changed to lead me to this place where I am not quite what I thought I’d be, and not entirely sure what I want to be, and yet here I am. And looking at what’s going on around me—in the relationships I see between other men and their families, men and other men, men and women, not only among friends and loved ones but in the news the past couple of years, and in our culture—it’s pretty obvious that the kind of man my hardheaded Muslim teenage self planned to become is not me. I want to know how and why that’s true, and I want to know what’s next for me and for guys who may be wondering the same about themselves. That’s the idea behind the new Slate podcast Man Up. In a previous series for Slate, “ Who’s Afraid of Aymann Ismail? ,” I traveled around the country to investigate stereotypes about American Muslims, whether that meant going to the office of a Islamophobic Texas legislator outside Dallas or excavating some of my family’s own skeletons . With Man Up, I’m doing a lot of the same: having tough, funny, enlightening conversations where I try to get beneath the notions we’ve taken for granted, and asking hard questions about the ideas we have about what a man should be. Every week, we’ll hear stories from men and women. They might be embarrassing or disturbing. The story might, as with our first episode live Wednesday, be about the urge to fight—to be aggressive and dominant—no matter the cost. It might be about growing up as the only girl in a group of male friends and what happens when your crew discovers sex. It might be about what happened when I yelled at my brother’s kids the way our dad once yelled at us (it wasn’t good). My goal is just to be as honest as possible, even when we don’t like what I hear, from others and from myself. As I start my own family, I’ve waited for some kind of eureka moment when I wake up with the complete sense of the man I ought to be, whatever that means. It hasn’t happened. So this is what I’m going to be investigating in these conversations, too: me. Every story I’ve heard so far has helped me figure out a little more about myself and form a more complicated picture of what being a man can mean. It turns out that if you are vulnerable, and ask for vulnerability, you might be surprised by what happens. And we want to invite you to do that with me. Tell me something you think about but can never quite find a way to talk about with other people. Send an email to , or better yet, leave me a voicemail at 805-626-8707. We’ll play some on the show and ask more questions. We’ll be back every week with more stories, I hope including yours. Support our journalism

iPhone reactions are ruining group texts and irritating friends.,slate.com,Shannon Palus,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/iphone-reactions-group-texts-chats-bad.html,"Rabbit Holes: If “Listening to Your Body” Is the Highest Virtue on Wellness Instagram, I’m a Saint Texting is how we now all communicate, which would be fine and pretty easy, except that the rules keep getting more complicated. A small, but terrible, complication was quietly introduced to texting in the fall of 2016, tucked into an update to iPhone operating systems: reactions. Right now, if you’ve got a friend who employs reactions you’re thinking, Oh God, those stupid things . For the blissfully uninitiated, there are six text reactions: thumbs up, thumbs down, double exclamation point, question mark, a heart, and “HA HA.” When you send someone a text on their iPhone, the recipient may choose to reply normally—you know, by texting back. Or the recipient may emit a reaction, a small blunt tool of confusion. Reactions are confusing and annoying. They’re quietly ruining group chats and therefore our society. Kill them! Like all facets of texting, these character expressions may seem simple to the untrained eye. Yet they’re less simple than entirely unformed, so meaning-free they require their own Rosetta stone to untangle —without the upside of actually enriching our language the way the vast and varied world of emojis can. The reaction confers no benefit, while making things more complicated. Is it curt to send a cartoon thumbs up to someone who has announced killing it at a work presentation? Is a question mark a sign of curiosity, or passive-aggressive confusion at a grammatical error? Is there anyone on the planet who would experience the warm camaraderie of laughter through “HA HA”? What? Slate Are these reactions supposed to be comments? Or some kind of telepathic intonation? From a design standpoint, it’s impossible to tell. While a text has a little tail on one side like a cartoon dialogue bubble, indicating that it is speech, reactions are trailed by a distinct small circle, giving the impression that the response it contains is being not said but thought . It is as though the heart, or thumbs up, is maybe supposed to be a first draft, or an idea, or a feeling, rather than a concrete statement. We simply do not need this additional layer of interpretability—or, really, mis-interpretability. Under very specific circumstances, reactions can be helpful in one-on-one interactions. Their primary utility is in indicating generously that you have seen a text, a more sophisticated and modern version of “kk,” or the dreaded “k.” I have a couple of dear friends who will often respond with a heart reaction. This is nice because we live in different cities, have busy schedules, and text heavy emotional things that cannot always be addressed immediately but call for some kind of acknowledgment. Also, I know for sure that these women are not passive-aggressive monsters. Utilized between us, the bubbles firmly convey “Got this, I’m available for a phone call soon, I bet you look amazing today.” Exercise caution using the reaction with anyone with whom you do not have this level of connection. And please— no matter how well you think things are going —exercise extreme caution with anyone you’ve been dating less than six months. When should you should avoid reactions, no matter what? Group interactions. This is not because reactions are objectively more confusing, meaning-wise, in larger text conversations. In fact, in larger group texts, all information flies so quickly that there often isn’t really time to wonder exactly what anyone is saying. Take things as literally as possible, and move on! A real cluster. Slate No, reactions ruin group texts because of crummy UI. When a member of a group text reacts to a message, the sender of the message receives a notification. (Fine, I guess, although I do not need a notification for HA HA. But why have this feature at all if at best it functions so similarly to a text?) But to the other people in the text, your reaction is an irritant. It is not clear, for example, who is doing the reacting. To see who reacted to, say, one friend’s text asking if anyone wants to meet up for drinks later, one has to—and I literally just figured this out—hold a finger down on the original text until a summary of the reactions and reactors pops up. Who has ever done this? Who has navigated a constantly shifting iOS interface expertly enough to get this relevant (?) information to pop up? The other thing—the biggest thing, really—is that reactions only work if you have an iPhone. If you do not, your friend’s reactions are delivered to you cumbersomely spelled out. If you are in a group text with even one Android user, everyone gets everything cumbersomely spelled out. Beware the story of the woman who was the lone iPhone user joining a group text full of Android-ees. When she reacted to a text, her new friends were getting not an ambiguous character in a thought bubble, but the words “laughed at” followed by the entirety of the reacted-to text message. As a befuddled group text mate recounted on Reddit : “ALL OF US WERE GETTING SECRETLY PISSED OFF AT HER!!” But even should Apple and Android someday combine forces to fix this UI, there’s just no upside to reactions. If you use them, please stop. Apple, please eliminate them! The archaeologists of the future already have enough to untangle with the blood-drop emoji ."
Join Us for an Event About the Future of Slaughter-Free Meat,slate.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/lab-grown-meat-slaughter-free-plant-based-alternatives-future-tense-event.html,"Burger King is already rolling out plant-based Impossible Whoppers at select locations and says it will debut them nationwide by the end of the year. Michael Thomas/Getty Images Americans have a love affair with meat. Many romanticize the sizzle of a steak, the iron-pink bleed of a medium-rare burger, and the imagined farm they came from. It’s a love that has come at a cost: An enormous industrialized livestock system rife with animal abuse uses up massive amounts of land and water. It may also be responsible for nearly one-sixth of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, tech-driven startups say they can offer a better way. New waves of investment have cell-cultured food companies in an edible space race to see who can get their so-called cell-based meat—animal tissue grown in bioreactors instead of live animals—on consumers’ plates first. Advances in molecular science have also fueled a new boom in plant-based meat offerings that look, smell, taste, and even grease and bleed like their fleshy counterparts. And these companies aren’t marketing to vegans and vegetarians. You can now get an Impossible Foods burger instead of a beef patty on your Burger King Whopper. Beyond Meat is stocked in the meat section of most U.S. grocery stores. But can these slaughter-free meat alternatives really become cheap and mainstream enough to replace your traditional chorizo or chicken nugget? Can these biotech creations overcome the uncanny “ick” valley from consumers stuck on ideas that meat should come from farms and not the lab? Join Future Tense, the New America Fellows Program, and New America NYC on May 8 at Interface NYC for drinks, plant-based meat alternative samples from Beyond Meat, and a conversation about the future foods that may dramatically transform the American way of eating.

Seasteading hits snags in Thailand.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/seasteading-thailand-chad-elwartowski-nadia-summergirl-thepdet.html,"With Smarter Living, the NYT Is Making an Old Bet on Service Journalism Every piece of land in the world (well, almost every piece ) is occupied by one country or another. Wherever you are, there’s a government looking to impose its laws on you. So what are you to do if none of the 193 or so national governments that have carved up the Earth’s landmass suit you? Take to the sea, obviously. That, more or less, is the thinking behind seasteading, a movement of people looking to create autonomous dwellings or cities at sea, outside the sovereignty of any nation-state. Seasteading has been in the news in recent days thanks to a couple—U.S. citizen Chad Elwartowski and his Thai partner, Supranee Thepdet, aka Nadia Summergirl—who have gone into hiding after being charged by the government of Thailand with violating national sovereignty by living in a small cabin mounted on a weighted spar, anchored 12 nautical miles off the shore of Phuket. The two are currently in hiding and the charge against them theoretically carries the death penalty, though Thai authorities, who have seized the property, say they may end up being charged with a lesser offense. The home was launched in February, funded by a group of entrepreneurs called Ocean Builders with assets gained from early investments in bitcoin. “I just want to get seasteading [to] happen for real. I want to make it happen here in Thailand,” Elwartowski told Reason in March, saying he saw his home as a proof of concept for more ambitious projects to come. If the project had been successful, the plan was to sell other units to create a sort of colony around Elwartowski and Summergirl’s seastead. A short documentary series on YouTube, The First Seasteaders , shows the raising of the 20-meter spar, during which Elwartowski proclaimed, “To all those out there who want to control people’s lives through force, here’s my big finger to you.” The seasteading concept has some historical antecedents , notably the Principality of Sealand, a long-standing micronation established on a disused British artillery platform in the North Sea by pirate-radio DJ Paddy Roy Bates in 1967. But the movement’s modern incarnation dates back to the founding of the Seasteading Institute in 2008 by Patri Friedman, a former Google employee and grandson of free market economist Milton Friedman. The institute received early financial backing from the libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel, though he’s since somewhat distanced himself from the project . “Nobody thinks two people on a floating home is a new country that’s going to threaten anyone’s sovereignty."" — Patri Friedman While the eventual goal of seasteading is still the creation of fully autonomous, politically sovereign communities, for the time being, the institute is looking to promote partnerships to build floating cities in cooperation with existing governments. The institute signed an agreement with the government of French Polynesia to build a lagoon in Tahiti in 2017, but the French Polynesian government has since declared that project void after public backslash. In an interview last week, I asked Friedman, who is still chairman of the board of the Seasteading Institute but says he is no longer involved in day-to-day operations, whether Elwartowski and Summergirl’s fate would be a setback for the movement, a discouragement for those who might want to try seasteading. “I think that it’s more likely to wise up potential seasteaders to make sure they dot their I’s and cross their T’s legally,” he told me. “What I’ve gathered from what Chad and Nadia wrote is that they did notify the Thai government in advance. So I think seasteaders need to make sure that they get things in writing, that they’re talking to the right parts of the government and don’t just assume good will.” Friedman drew a distinction between small-scale projects like this one and the “larger projects with nation-level partnerships” that have been the Seasteading Institute’s main focus. “Nobody thinks two people on a floating home is a new country that’s going to threaten anyone’s sovereignty,” he said. “It’s a honeymoon, not a country.” He said he believed other countries in the region could be more understanding and that Elwartowski and Summergirl might very well get another project up and running soon, on firmer legal footing this time. “It’s ridiculous that Thailand is saying that it’s treason to try out a new kind of floating home. It’s like threatening the death penalty for somebody not registering their car,” he added. It shouldn’t be surprising that Elwartowski and Summergirl were bitcoin investors. Friedman said he sees seasteading and cryptocurrency as simpatico movements for “people who believe in decentralization of things traditionally done by a monopoly government using new technology.” On the other hand, Friedman rejects the notion that seasteading is only for political libertarians. “That’s sort of the most visible group and the easiest branding with, say, Peter Thiel’s funding or my being Milton Friedman’s grandson,” he said. “But I don’t necessarily believe that libertarians or anyone else knows exactly how to make a great new government. The real problem is we don’t have ways to try out new laws and new systems of government at a small scale and scale up the ones that work. I think that I’ll probably like the more-libertarian ones best. But regardless of where I live, the more differentergovernments that are out there, the happier I will be.” When it’s not dismissed outright, seasteading is often ridiculed as a movement of Silicon Valley billionaires looking to avoid taxes or, in the longer term, escape ecological disaster. Friedman objects to that, saying, “There’s already a whole bunch of tax havens. We cannot compete with the Bahamas.” He says he believes that, in the long term, “most of the people who live [on seasteads] are going to be people from countries where the government doesn’t work very well. So even if those of us who have the resources to pursue it now are from that first-world demographic, I think that the people that it will help most are the people in the developing world.” While it would be a stretch to say that seasteading is gaining anything resembling mainstream acceptance, the general idea of sea-born construction is looking less far-fetched. The artificial islands China has been constructing to bolster its sovereignty claims in the South China Sea could be looked at as quasi-seasteads, though with more of a Tiananmen than a Burning Man political ethos behind them. Friedman also points to a speech from April by U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed in which she suggested that “floating cities can be part of our new arsenal of tools” for addressing the impact of sea level rise on coastal regions and small island states. Ironically, given this month’s events, she used Bangkok as an example of a city that is “sinking by around 2 centimeters every year … while sea levels in the Gulf of Thailand are rising.” Districts of floating houses have been looked at as a potential tool for climate change adaptation. As I discuss in my book, Invisible Countries , small island states facing the prospect of mass displacement due to climate change could resort to something resembling seasteading in order to maintain their political sovereignty, reinforcing “their territory to keep at least some physical structure above water and keep a small group of inhabitants behind, even if the bulk of the population has relocated.” This is not exactly the original intention behind seasteading. The idea was to allow people to escape the grasp of nation-states, rather than help existing nation-states perpetuate themselves in a warming world. But Friedman is unbothered by the shift. “If the economic driver for improving the seasteading technology is climate change mitigation, that’s great,” he said. “The more companies that are designing and building these things and the more mature the technology is, the easier that makes it for people that want to take to the sea for other reasons. Because it’s a very challenging environment, but, heck, it’s a lot less challenging than outer space.” "
Blood Heir’s YA author turns cancellation into a publicity boost.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/blood-heir-amelie-wen-zhao-controversy-publication.html,"Why Game of Thrones ’ Biggest Battle Was Such a Thrilling Disappointment First-time novelist Amélie Wen Zhao reportedly received a six-figure advance for her trilogy of young-adult novels, which she sold last year to a Penguin Random House imprint. Her story is set in a fictional empire with an enslaved underclass called Affinites; protagonist Princess Anastacya Mikhailov lives in hiding because of her similarity to the Affinites, and the plot unspools from there. Blood Heir , the first novel in the series, was scheduled to publish next month. That was before the novel came under a tidal wave of criticism from early readers who saw in the book an offensive likeness of American slavery and black oppression. In January, Zhao abruptly issued a statement apologizing for the “pain” her book had caused and asked her publisher to cancel its publication. Now, Zhao told the New York Times, she has changed her mind . Reeling from the criticism after pulling the book from publication, she took time to reread her manuscript several times and decided her critics were wrong. In March, she contacted her editor at Delacorte Press to tell her she wanted to proceed after all. Zhao and the publisher solicited new feedback from experts including a human-trafficking scholar, “academics from different multicultural backgrounds,” and multiple “ sensitivity readers ” who scan manuscripts for stereotypes. She made additions and revisions in response. “We ultimately think our YA readers are very smart,” her editor told the Times. “They can read what they want to read and use their critical thinking skills to work through it.” The tweaked version of Blood Heir will be published in November. So-called cancellation isn’t always permanent in the wider world. Blood Heir is not the only book to have run into the wood chipper of “YA Twitter,” the small but influential community of largely adult online readers who can make or break a book’s fortunes—or at least its online reputation—long before it is available to most readers. Laurie Forest’s much-hyped debut novel, The Black Witch , faced serious backlash in 2017 after one YA blogger called it “the most dangerous, offensive book I have ever read” in a nearly 9,000-word review that blasted the fantasy novel as “racist, ableist, [and] homophobic.” (The book was published on schedule.) Author Keira Drake postponed and revised her fantasy novel, The Continent , after early readers criticized it for trafficking in ugly stereotypes of Native Americans. In March, Kosoko Jackson pulled his first novel , a romantic thriller about a relationship between two teenage boys set in the Kosovo War, after a Goodreads reviewer called it out for representational offenses. Jackson issued a statement apologizing to “those who I hurt with my words.” (Like Zhao, he addressed his apology to “the book community.”) His next novel , about a gay teen who time-travels to the scene of the Stonewall riots, is scheduled to be published next year. In hindsight, Zhao’s handling of the episode is a master class in turning an online backlash into a boon. The move allowed her to make a public gesture toward taking her critics seriously, while also winning sympathy and support from the many people who view the YA community’s self-appointed representation police with distaste. Although the withdrawal looked like a defeat at the time, it also boosted Zhao’s profile significantly. The announcement of the book’s return was granted flattering coverage in the Times. And the novel itself will be published less than six months later than originally scheduled.

One of the early criticisms of Blood Heir was that it seemed to depict a black character named May being rescued from the slave trade, and then dying so the white protagonist can live. As one Twitter critic, YA novelist L.L. McKinney, put it at the time, the book was “pretty much about slavery and oppressions suffered by the Black community.” I haven’t read Blood Heir , which obviously has not yet been published. But Slate’s Aja Hoggatt read the first version in January and concluded that it’s not even clear that May is black. Zhao, who was raised in Beijing, said at the time that she intended to refer to indentured labor and human trafficking in Asia. In a new statement announcing the book’s comeback, Zhao goes further. “I researched extensively on the subject of modern-day human trafficking and indentured labor throughout the world and specifically from my heritage,” she writes. “It is my hope that Blood Heir will confront the silence surrounding this epidemic that continues to affect 45 million victims globally.” She emphasizes several times that she is writing from within her own culture, an important assurance for YA Twitter, which uses the term “own voices” to refer approvingly to a book written by an author whose marginalized identity (or identities) matches her protagonist. (Dip into this thread by one of Blood Heir’s early critics, in which she performs “50-page tests” on novels she is not sure she wants to read, rejecting many for violations like “Indian-inspired fantasy by a white woman” and “I don’t like reading about allocishet white boys, thank you.”) Zhao’s statement concludes that she is excited for readers “to have a chance to engage in further dialogue about these important social issues.” Time will tell how substantive Zhao’s revisions are and whether they will satisfy her critics. Does YA Twitter really want authors to change, or does it just want to tear down those who don’t kowtow to them? But reframing her fantasy novel as an invitation to “engage in dialogue” about a real-world issue is savvy, given the context. It’s easy to reject a “problematic” novel; according to the new rules of YA Twitter, that rejection can even be a moral act. It’s harder to reject an attempt to “confront the silence” around an indisputably horrific human tragedy. In emphasizing a social issue rather than a story, Zhao may have given her novel a second chance at life. It remains to be seen whether it will actually be good for her story. "
Barr Says Trump Was “Fully Cooperating” With Mueller Investigation When He Tried to Terminate the Mueller Investigation,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/barr-trump-full-cooperation-mueller.html,"America’s Attorney General Thinks Donald Trump Is Above the Law Here’s a fun short story of political absurdity. It begins with what Attorney General William Barr said in an April 18 press conference just before the public release of the full-but-redacted Robert Mueller special counsel report:
The White House fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. It was clear when the report was released that “fully cooperated” was an extreme stretch given that Trump had, for example, literally dictated an announcement he wanted then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions to make that would have terminated the portion of Mueller’s work involving contacts between Trump and Russia. Here’s how the report summarizes that incident (Corey Lewandowski was one of Trump’s 2016 campaign managers):
On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and dictated a message to be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the effect of limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference only. One month later, the President met again with Lewandowski and followed up on the request to have Sessions limit the scope of the Russia investigation. (The phrase “limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference” is euphemistic here—the explicit purpose of the Mueller inquiry as it was formally defined was to examine “links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” in order to “ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign.”) Given that Sessions had recused himself from the investigation because it involved inquiries into his own conduct, Trump’s request was inappropriate on multiple levels—and, whether or not it rose to the level of criminal obstruction, certainly did not constitute full cooperation. On Wednesday, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Barr about this, shall we say, tension during Barr’s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Barr’s answers were … well:
LEAHY: You think that’s fully cooperating, to instruct a former aide to tell the attorney general to unrecuse himself, shut down the investigation, and declare the president did nothing wrong?
BARR: I don’t think—well, obviously, since I didn’t find it was obstruction, I felt that the evidence could not support obstruction.
LEAHY: I’m asking you if that’s fully cooperating. I’m not asking you if that’s obstruction. Is that fully cooperating?
BARR: He fully cooperated.
LEAHY: By instructing a former aide to tell the attorney general to unrecuse himself and shut down the investigation and declare the president did nothing wrong, that’s fully cooperating?
BARR: Where is that in the report?
LEAHY: That is on Volume II, page five—on June 19, 2017, the president dictated a message to Lewandowski that Jeff Sessions should publicly announce he was not recusing himself from the Russia investigation, that it’s very unfair to the president as the president has done nothing wrong. Is that cooperating?
BARR: Firstly, asking Sessions to unrecuse himself, we do not think, is obstruction.
LEAHY: —And to declare that the president did nothing wrong. I’m not asking you if it’s obstruction. Is it cooperating?
BARR: I don’t know if that declares the president did nothing wrong. Although the president, in terms of collusion, did nothing wrong. Isn’t that correct?
LEAHY: Collusion is not a crime. It’s the obstructing. But is that fully cooperating, to say that?
BARR: Well, I don’t see any conflict between that and fully cooperating with the investigation. So there you go. He doesn’t see it."
Venezuela: Maduro survives attempted military uprising. What happens now?,slate.com,Joshua Keating,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/venezuela-maduro-guaido-best-shot.html,"America’s Attorney General Thinks Donald Trump Is Above the Law This clearly wasn’t how it was supposed to go. On Tuesday morning, the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognized as the interim president of the country by the United States and other countries, broadcast a video from a military base flanked by armed National Guard troops who had defected to the opposition. It appeared that the armed forces of Venezuela, or at least a significant portion of them, might finally have turned on embattled de facto President Nicolás Maduro. But as the day wore on, it became clear that Guaidó didn’t have the numbers. After an initial skirmish, there were no additional signs of military forces fighting on the opposition side. The army remained with Maduro. Demonstrations flared throughout Caracas, and more than 60 people were injured , including in one grotesque incident, captured on video , in which an armored vehicle plowed into a throng of protesters on a crowded overpass. At the end of the day, Maduro appeared on TV flanked by his senior military commanders. Guaidó, from an undisclosed location, called for more protests Wednesday—May Day—but it’s becoming clear that the opposition took its best shot on Tuesday and fell short. Was something else supposed to happen? U.S. officials seemed to suggest so. In a video message posted on Twitter, National Security Adviser John Bolton named several senior Venezuelan officials who had “all agreed that Maduro had to go.” Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that four of the men sitting with Maduro during his announcement had been involved in launching the uprising. It’s not clear quite how closely the Trump administration was involved with this overthrow attempt, but it seems like there was at least some expectation in Washington that these military brass would turn on Maduro when the time came. So what happens now? Guaidó and his supporters will continue to try to rally public support, but it’s unclear how many setbacks like this his movement can sustain. Leopoldo López, the former presidential candidate and opposition leader who had been imprisoned but then surprised supporters by appearing in public with his protégé Guaidó on Tuesday, has sought refuge at the Spanish Embassy . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that “ military action is possible ,” which sounds drastic but has more or less been the official U.S. position since the beginning. For now, it seems unlikely. The administration’s attention appears to be shifting to Venezuela’s foreign allies. Pompeo accused the Russian government of dissuading Maduro from leaving for Cuba on Tuesday. “He had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning, as we understand it, and the Russians indicated he should stay.” (This could be true—the Russians have denied it—but it seems odd given that Maduro doesn’t appear to have ever been in any serious danger.) President Donald Trump also threatened Cuba with a “ full and complete embargo ” unless it ceases its military support for Maduro’s government. This would seem a pretty trivial threat given that Cuba has been under a U.S. embargo since the early 1960s. Yes, there are ways to tighten the embargo and amp up the pressure, but it seems unlikely the Cubans will fold after half a century. It feels more like an acknowledgment that Washington is running out of means to impose pressure on Venezuela itself. Much of the Trump administration’s bluster in the past two days—including Bolton’s message, in English, “to all the patriotic citizens of Venezuela,” appears intended more for consumption by voters in Florida than by the generals in Caracas. Without the military turning against Maduro, it’s hard to see a path to victory for the opposition, even with heavy backing from the U.S. and other foreign powers. Unfortunately, given the grim shambles of a situation he’s created in Venezuela, Maduro now appears likely to hang on to power."
Trevor Noah isn't impressed by Trump's nickname for Joe Biden (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/trevor-noah-joe-biden-sleepy-nickname-daily-show.html,"Here’s Why the Dothraki Attack in Game of Thrones Was So Devastating Since launching his campaign last week, Joe Biden has already gained ground with a tidal wave of media attention and a major speech in Pittsburgh . But another sign of the former Vice President’s growing popularity, as The Daily Show host Trevor Noah noted, is that he’s been graced with that most vile of distinctions: the Trumpian nickname. “Sleepy Joe,” as Trump has been calling Biden—while also seeking him out for a fisticuffs —brings to mind a sluggish man losing his wits, and it doesn’t help that Biden’s first rally was filled with verbal stumbles, such as substituting “hudge fund” for “hedge fund.” Of course, flubs are inevitable for speechmakers, and nobody’s better at spinning them than Trump. “When he makes a mistake, he doesn’t let it trip him up. He just creates a new reality and plows right through,” Noah said. As for the jeering new nickname: Calling someone sleepy is a sort of “weird slam,” but it’s bound to make for some pretty hilarious attack ad ammo.

America’s attorney general thinks Donald Trump is above the law.,slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-donald-trump-media-defense-obstruction-of-justice.html,"Barr Has Left Congress No Choice: Mueller Must Testify Next When Attorney General Bill Barr gave a press conference in advance of his release of the Mueller report on April 18, the most shocking moment came when he claimed that the president’s attempts to curtail the Mueller investigation were justified because the investigation had annoyed him. “The president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,” Barr said. At the time, it was stunning how deliberately Barr seemed to be very specifically appropriating President Donald Trump’s extralegal talking point about blaming the press and the president’s enemies for the president’s conduct. As my colleague Mark Joseph Stern noted that day , this wasn’t a legal defense. It was nothing short of the claim that if the president feels harassed, it isn’t illegal to stop an investigation. As Stern put it:
Barr’s message here is simple: Trump is the real victim. The victim of the media and leaks. The victim of excess scrutiny and oversight. The victim of what Barr appears to believe was an overly intrusive investigation conducted by overzealous “federal agents and prosecutors.” All of Trump’s lying, his interference, his efforts to publicly discredit the probe, his public assault on Mueller—all of it is excusable, Barr implied, because the probe found “no collusion.” Indeed, Barr writes off Trump’s campaign against the investigation as a perfectly understandable effort to maintain his innocence. His acts were not obstructionary; they were noble. That defense was shocking not simply because it had nothing to do with the legal questions of conspiracy and obstruction before Mueller and Barr, but also because it seemed to have explicitly adopted and accepted the Trumpist worldview that holds any attempt at oversight or investigation deemed by the president to be unjustified harassment is illegitimate. This is, by the way, pretty much the same legal theory being invoked this week to reject the authority of congressional oversight and subpoenas . As Steve Vladek observed this past weekend, the defense that absolutely everything is a witch hunt and thus not legitimate is not a specific constitutional claim. It is, however, a recipe for a constitutional crisis. This now appears to be a central tenet of the legal strategy Trump and his surrogates are pushing forward, though. At his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning, Barr seems to have again blamed the existence of a witch hunt against Trump for virtually everything Trump later did to put a stop to it. The press was again cited as the reason he rushed out his initial, erroneous summary of the report, as was the public’s “high state of agitation.” Barr even claimed that it was the press coverage of the initial Mueller report summary that troubled Mueller, rather than Barr’s own letter downplaying the report’s findings. Barr testified that Mueller told him “the press reporting had been inaccurate.” And yet, in Mueller’s March 27 letter objecting to Barr’s characterization of the report (which just became public on Tuesday ) there is NOTHING to suggest that Mueller thought it was the press that got it wrong. Then, in response to questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein about why it was that Trump ordered former White House counsel Don McGahn to end the Mueller probe, Barr seems to have again taken the legal position that the president’s anger and frustration over press reports that he had instructed McGahn to fire Mueller somehow made this directive permissible. Barr seemed to be saying that Trump could not have committed obstruction by asking McGahn to fire Mueller, so long as he was attempting to forestall further negative press. As Barr put it:
If the president is being falsely accused, which the evidence now suggests that the accusations against him were false, and he knew they were false, and he felt that this investigation was unfair, propelled by his political opponents and was hampering his ability to govern, that is not a corrupt motive for replacing an independent counsel. This is an astonishing claim—that if the president feels that the investigation is unnecessary and is resulting in him being harassed or misrepresented in the media, then the president is justified in taking any action he sees fit to stop it without running afoul of the obstruction laws. It’s also a claim that was refuted in the Mueller report itself . It’s Nixonian in scope to imply that anything Trump wants to do in order to push back against the media and protect his reputation is legal and justified. Barr has not been having a good morning. Mueller’s now-public March 27 letter has revealed that the otherwise sphinx-like special counsel was frustrated by the way Barr initially characterized the report, putting the attorney general in a defensive position from which he has had trouble recovering. In addition to adopting and expanding the president’s war on the press and witch hunt defenses, Barr has now placed the Justice Department itself into the crosshair—implying that the DOJ itself and Mueller are bound to a view of the law that somehow takes into account the president’s antipathy and anger toward his perceived enemies as inherently exculpatory. We know that Donald Trump hates the media, and he hates being criticized, and he believes that his own suffering justifies all of his actions. We’ve known that for a long time. But for the attorney general to expressly adopt the view that the president can’t obstruct justice if he’s doing it because the press is annoying him is an appalling next step in the descent into establishing an imperial presidency, unchecked by either Congress or a free media. Every president believes the media gives him a raw deal. Barr just put the Justice Department’s imprimatur on the claim that such feelings put the president above the law. Support our journalism

Robert Mueller must testify to Congress next.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/mueller-must-testify-to-explain-william-barr-dispute.html,"Mueller Can’t Get Away With Silence Anymore Attorney General William Barr’s obfuscating, querulous, and disingenuous congressional testimony on Wednesday was the kind of performance we’ve come to expect from him. Barr criticized special counsel Robert Mueller for declining to issue a definitive conclusion on whether President Donald Trump committed obstruction. He waved away sections in Mueller’s report that clearly describe Trump’s obstructive acts . And he implied that Mueller’s letter to Barr , in which the special counsel questioned the attorney general’s summary of his report , meant something entirely different from what it actually says. As usual, Barr seemed to view his job on Wednesday as shaping a narrative that is maximally beneficial to both himself and the president. To do so, he once again threw Mueller under the bus. This strategy has been effective so far because of Mueller’s reticence to issue any public comment beyond his report. But if Barr’s testimony proved anything, it is that Congress must ask Mueller to testify—immediately. Early in his testimony, Barr declared that he was “surprised” when he learned that the special counsel was “not going to reach a decision on obstruction.” He claimed that he is “not really sure” why the special counsel did not reach a conclusion, and that Mueller “shouldn’t have investigated” potential obstructive acts if he felt he couldn’t render a prosecutorial decision. But contrary to Barr’s assertion, it is actually no mystery at all why Mueller did not declare if Trump committed obstruction. The special counsel laid out his reasoning in his final report . He explained that he accepted the Office of Legal Counsel’s “legal conclusion” that a sitting president cannot be indicted, which curtailed his ability to exercise traditional “prosecutorial discretion.” Moreover, he recognized that, “apart from” OLC’s view, a “federal criminal accusation” would both burden the president’s “capacity to govern” and “preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.” Put simply: Mueller thought it would be futile to accuse Trump of obstruction if he can’t be indicted, so the special counsel instead laid out the facts and left Congress to decide whether “constitutional processes”—that is, impeachment—are appropriate. Mueller could explain why he did not explicitly accuse Trump of unlawful obstruction, thereby refuting Barr’s dishonest narrative. Whatever Barr thinks of this reasoning, it is laid out clearly in Mueller’s report. Yet Barr purports to remain bewildered that the special counsel did not formally accuse Trump of obstruction and indeed uses that puzzlement to bolster his claims that Trump did not obstruct. “We don’t conduct criminal investigations to collect information and put it out to the public,” Barr said. “We do it to gain information.” Thus, in Barr’s telling, the attorney general simply had no choice but to announce “that the evidence developed during the special counsel’s investigation was not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.” No careful reader could reasonably interpret Mueller’s report as an invitation to the attorney general to make “a binary decision” (Barr’s words) about whether Trump obstructed justice. Mueller plainly left this matter to Congress—where Democrats have been hampered in their efforts to hold Trump accountable by Barr’s pseudo-exoneration. This muddle is one reason why the special counsel needs to testify: He, and he alone, could explain why he did not explicitly accuse Trump of unlawful obstruction, thereby refuting Barr’s dishonest narrative. Mueller’s testimony would also allow the public to better grasp how he and his team understood the evidence in the report. This clarification has become necessary, because after warping Mueller’s own words, Barr decided to act as Trump’s defense attorney to downplay one of the most damning episodes in the special counsel’s report: the series of encounters between Trump and then–White House counsel Don McGahn. Mueller explains that the president ordered McGahn to fire Mueller, citing the special counsel’s alleged conflicts of interest as pretext for his termination. In Mueller’s analysis, there was “substantial evidence” to establish that this incident constituted a criminal act of obstruction. In Barr’s telling, however, it was all one big misunderstanding. “There’s no question,” Barr said, “that whatever instruction was given [to] McGahn had to do with Mueller’s conflict of interest.” And Trump “later said that what he meant was that the conflict of interest should be raised with [Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein] but the decision should be left with Rosenstein.” The gist of Barr’s spin is that, yes, McGahn interpreted Trump’s words as an order, but who can know for sure? “There is a distinction,” Barr said, “between saying to someone, ‘Go fire him,’ … and saying, have him removed based on conflict.” Here’s what the Mueller report actually says: The president “called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed.” Trump allegedly told McGahn, “You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.” Mueller, he said, “can’t be the special counsel.” He “had to go.” And Trump added, “Call me back when you do it.” McGahn refused, and Trump later told him to lie about his demand that Mueller be terminated. Yet to Barr, none of this evidence is sufficient to “show corrupt intent beyond a reasonable doubt.” This conclusion relies on a questionable semantic distinction to absolve Trump and contradict Mueller’s findings. Which is why the special counsel deserves an opportunity to rebut Barr’s dubious interpretation of his report. Finally, there is the matter of the letter Mueller sent to Barr on March 27 after the attorney general released his hugely misleading summary of the special counsel’s report. (The existence of this letter only became public knowledge on Tuesday night.) Here is how Mueller characterized his concerns in the letter he wrote to Barr:
The summary letter … did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions. … There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure the full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations. And here is how Barr characterized a follow-up conversation about the letter:
I asked him if he was suggesting that the [summary] was inaccurate and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate, and that the press was reading too much into it. I asked him specifically what his concern was and he said that his concern focused on his explanation as to why he did not reach a conclusion on obstruction. And he wanted more put out on that issue. … But he was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report. There is an unavoidable conflict between Mueller’s letter and Barr’s testimony. Mueller stated that Barr’s summary “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of his report. Barr testified that Mueller’s only gripe was that “the press reporting had been inaccurate.” These claims cannot be squared. Someone is lying. Right now, Barr appears to assume that Congress, and the public, will only hear his side of the story—a reasonable assumption given Mueller’s public taciturnity throughout his investigation. But it is now obvious that a rift has opened between the two men, and that Mueller is frustrated with Barr’s handling of his report and has been for a while. The attorney general doesn’t seem to care. “It was my baby,” Barr said of the full report on Wednesday. “It was my decision how and when to make it public, not Bob Mueller’s.” That may be correct. But there is no reason why Mueller cannot go before Congress to set the record straight and no reason for the rest of us to trust Barr’s characterizations until he does. The attorney general has so distorted the public perception of Mueller’s report that the special counsel’s silence now threatens to undermine the impact of his findings. Barr has somehow managed to depict Mueller as simultaneously indecisive and overzealous—too quick to condemn Trump, yet dithering in his duty to render a judgment. Meanwhile, Barr has exploited Mueller’s silence to recast the special counsel’s dissatisfaction with the attorney general as irritation with the media. This fantastical narrative should not go unrebutted. And only Mueller has the knowledge and authority to tell Congress just how far Barr has wandered from the truth. Support our journalism

Why the Russians might use a beluga whale as a spy.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/beluga-whale-spy-marine-life-russia-navy-dolphins.html,"What Do We Do First if We Spot an Asteroid Hurtling Toward Earth? Last week, a beluga whale approached a fishing boat off the coast of Norway. The fishermen, surprised to encounter such a sociable whale, then noticed it was wearing a harness. Once they removed it, they noticed a label on the inside: “Equipment of St. Petersburg.” The Norwegians then contacted Russian researchers, who said their whales don’t wear harnesses. Plus, belugas are social animals that typically travel in small groups, so this lone whale seemed suspicious. Experts surmised the fishermen’s new smiley friend might actually be a Russian spy. In all fairness to the beluga, let’s be clear that it’s an alleged spy. There’s no conclusive evidence yet about where it’s from or what it was up to. After all, it does seem like the antithesis of sneaky to outfit your spy with a harness that’s directly traceable back to its origin. “If we were using this animal for spying do you really think we’d attach a mobile phone number with the message ‘please call this number’?” Russian Col. Viktor Baranets reportedly told a broadcaster. Plus, wouldn’t you think that the second most powerful military in the world would have more advanced technology than a friendly looking whale seeking nose pats and fish from strangers? On that point, at least, the answer is: not necessarily. Certainly, Russia’s military, as well as those of many other nations, has been developing water drones, or, as the U.S. Navy prefers to call them, “unmanned undersea vehicles.” (The word drone has “ a negative connotation ,” says the Navy .) These UUVs can do jobs deemed too dangerous or tedious for crewed watercraft, like mapping the seabed and coast, keeping tabs on harbors and ports, collecting items from the seabed, and counteracting mines. Russia is rumored to be working on nuclear torpedo drones , a terrifying prospect, and China has developed a fleet of drones to be used during sea battles. Spy whales predate all that, and while they may not be what comes to mind as “military technology,” they may be superior to fancy, expensive new machinery when it comes to surveillance and minesweeping. Since the 1960s , both the Russian and U.S. militaries have been training marine mammals to do their bidding. Despite news reports in 2012 that the U.S. was planning to phase out its marine animal program by 2017 in favor of UUVs, the U.S. Navy still maintains its fleet of bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions. Also in 2012, Ukraine rebooted its dolphin training program, which Russia inherited after it annexed Crimea in 2014. As recently as 2016, Russia was in the market for new recruits , offering $24,000 to any dealer who could provide them with five bottlenose dolphins. Though belugas are not as common as dolphins in military marine animal programs, it would be smart to have a few in your arsenal. They operate in colder temperatures and deeper depths , perfect for, say, the waters off the coast of Norway. Doug Cartlidge, former adviser to Russia on dolphin care, told Wired in 2007 that the Russians were training dolphins to attach mines to enemy ships and to prod enemies with a needle attached to a pressurized carbon dioxide tank, which would functionally kill whomever the dolphins touched. The U.S. Navy, on the other hand, claims its dolphins have never been used to kill. These days, marine animals appear to be trained for many of the same recon, fetch, and surveillance duties as UUVs would perform. A beluga’s unassuming adorableness makes it a capable spy simply because no one would suspect it. At this point, in the U.S. Navy, UUVs are frequently used for minesweeping, says Ed Budzyna, the Navy Marine Mammal Program’s spokesman. Dolphins are “not the first to be called” these days for that kind of job. But there are many good reasons to use marine animals over UUVs for tasks that both are capable of. First off, animals don’t need to be recharged. While many current UUVs have a battery life of about 24 hours, belugas “could operate nearly indefinitely,” says Bryan Clark, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a retired submariner. “You could take a sensor you might put on a UUV, like a sonar system, and the whale could swim out for days at a time.” Assuming the whale is trained to resurface periodically, its trainers could pull the data it collects, outfit it with a new sensor, and send it on another mission immediately. That could be what this beluga was doing. According to the BBC , marine biologist Audun Rikardsen said the harness had a GoPro camera holder attached to it. (It seems strange for the Russian military to be using GoPros for reconnaissance, but whoever outfitted the beluga in that harness appears to have wanted footage from its adventures.) There also may be missions that animals are still better at than UUVs. Sea lions are very good at hearing and seeing underwater. “The water can be cloudy or muddy, but it’s still no trouble for a sea lion,” says Budzyna, while “robotics would have a hard time with pier pilings and murky waters.” Depending on their mission, belugas could also be cheaper to train and manage than UUVs. The Navy says that its cost analyses have found that the MK 5 QuickFind Marine Mammal program, which uses sea lions, “is much less expensive to employ than either remotely operated vehicles or human divers for depths from 100–1000 feet.” Granted, it’s still not cheap. It costs money to transport animals for special missions, since they must travel with custom enclosures and a full veterinary staff. The Atlantic Wire reported in 2014 that the cost of the military’s mine-hunting dolphin program is about $ 14 million ; Hakai reported earlier this year that dolphin upkeep between 2012 and 2019 cost around $75 million , averaging out to just under $11 million a year. A “cheap” UUV is in the neighborhood of $50,000 , and after factoring in costs of maintenance and training staff to use it, it may actually be more cost effective to use military animals, says Clark. Also, look at that face. A beluga’s unassuming adorableness makes it a capable spy simply because no one would suspect it (unless it had a super-suspicious label on its harness, of course). The military has relied on this tactic before, using reconnaissance pigeons to drop off recording devices, take photos, or train to identify individual faces, like Osama bin Laden’s because people generally don’t think of animals as spies. On the CIA’s page about the history of pigeon surveillance, it acknowledges the advantage conferred by pigeons’ mundanity: “Being a common species, the pigeon concealed its role as an intelligence collection platform among the activities of thousands of other birds.” Belugas in the sea could also fly under the radar, so to speak, just as birds do in the sky. “If you’re the target, you might think, ‘It’s just a whale swimming around,’ and not be worried about what it’s doing,” says Clark. “You wouldn’t necessarily think it’s a surveillance system.” Another advantage of belugas spying in their home territory is that unlike UUVs or other water craft, belugas aren’t mechanical and may be less likely to pose a disturbance to other marine life. Meanwhile, the beluga at least seems to be having fun in Norway, fetching rings for locals . If it is indeed a spy, it certainly won’t be the last marine mammal to turn up in search of food or attention from humans, but let’s hope this one gets to retire to a nice marine sanctuary in peace.

Barr refuses to testify before House Judiciary Committee about Mueller report.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/barr-refuses-testify-nadler-house-judiciary-committee-mueller-report-contempt-obstruction.html,"Mueller Can’t Get Away With Silence Anymore After a day of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Bill Barr intends to skip a second day of scheduled testimony Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee. Barr is backing out of the hearing because of a plan by the Democrat-chaired committee to allow staff lawyers from both parties to question the attorney general. Both Barr and House Republicans objected to the proposed format, which, in addition to the usual five-minute rounds of questioning from representatives, would have included a 30-minute round for staff attorneys to follow up on the representatives’ questions.* The thinking went: specialized lawyers could do a better job than members of Congress pinning down some of the facts. The Republican thinking went: Yuck, that sounds a lot like a courtroom. The Department of Justice protested that having staff question the attorney general was “unprecedented and unnecessary.” As W. Neil Eggleston wrote in Slate this week, that is very much not the case. Barr’s refusal to appear injects a new source of acrimony between the Trump administration and the Democrat-led Congress that has been aggressive in using its new majority power to pick up on lines of investigation that were buried on the GOP’s watch. The White House has pushed back hard and filed suit to prevent current and former members of the administration from complying with subpoenas to appear under oath before Democrat-led committees. The standoff between House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Barr had been brewing over the last week. Nadler told CNN Sunday morning that if Barr refuses to show, “then we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena.” Adding to the standoff is the fact that the Judiciary Committee deadline for Barr to produce an unredacted version of the Mueller report to Congress was 10 a.m. Wednesday. That was likely to, ahem, come up in the House hearing the following day. There now is an increasing likelihood that Barr will not only refuse to testify but will not give members of congress full access to the unredacted Mueller report. That raises the possibility that Democrats could hold Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate. “Democrats have discussed holding Barr in contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena and threatening to skip the scheduled hearing, according to several lawmakers and officials familiar with the plan,” the Washington Post reports . “During a pair of closed-door meetings Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, the committee decided that it would probably make a push for a Barr contempt citation if he refuses to testify Thursday or ignores their subpoena for the full, unredacted report by Mueller.” “We are now seeing the attorney general engage in obstruction of a congressional subpoena,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the committee, said Wednesday “Congress has a number of tools at its disposal, obviously beginning with holding him in contempt.”
Correction, May 1, 2019: This post originally misstated that senators would question Barr. Representatives do the questioning during House hearings."
William Barr Senate hearing: Republicans discrediting the Mueller investigation ignore the 34 indictments.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/barr-hearing-mueller-investigation-indictments.html,"Mueller Can’t Get Away With Silence Anymore When Attorney General William Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to testify about special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, Republican Sen. Mike Hawley characterized it as an attempt to “overturn the results of a democratic election.” Sen. Lindsey Graham said, “When the Mueller report is put to bed, and it soon will be, this committee is going to look long and hard on how this all started.” And Sen. Mike Lee’s line of questioning suggested that he believes the foundations of the investigation were too flimsy and motivated by political bias. In their attempts to discredit the investigation, those characterizations essentially ignored what the special counsel has already accomplished: uncovering an assortment of crimes committed by dozens of people, including Trump campaign advisers. In case Republicans on the committee—or anyone else—need to be reminded, here’s a rundown of the indictments against 34 people and three companies achieved by the special counsel, many of which have led to guilty pleas: Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chair Manafort faced 25 counts from Mueller’s team related primarily to his lobbying efforts in Ukraine and financial wrongdoing. A jury in the Eastern District of Virginia found Manafort guilty of eight counts related to the financial crimes, and he additionally pled guilty to conspiracy against the U.S. and witness tampering in the District of Columbia. He was sentenced to a total of seven-and-a-half years of incarceration. Rick Gates, former Trump campaign aide Gates was one of campaign chair Paul Manafort’s closest associates and confidants, so their indictments were intimately linked. Gates pleaded guilty in February 2018 to felony counts of conspiracy against the U.S. and lying to federal authorities in connection with work he and Manafort completed for a pro-Russia faction in Ukraine. By agreeing to cooperate with the special counsel, Gates was able to avoid a host of other charges having to do with foreign financial dealings. Konstantin Kilimnik, former Russian military interpreter Mueller’s office indicted Kilimnik for conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice in June . Kilimnik worked with Manafort on lobbying efforts in Ukraine and, according to the indictment, attempted to sway two journalists who were potential witnesses. Kilimnik does not currently reside in the U.S., so he may never be prosecuted. Alex van der Zwann, lawyer Van der Zwaan, a Dutch national, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to charges of lying to federal agents about his interactions with Gates and Kilimnik. Van der Zwaan had been involved in Gates’ and Manafort’s lobbying efforts in Ukraine and later admitted to lying about that work and deleting related emails. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison. Michael Flynn, former White House national security adviser Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump was inaugurated, and lying to the feds about his lobbying efforts on behalf of Turkey. Roger Stone, former Trump campaign adviser Mueller’s office unveiled charges against Stone in January on seven counts of obstruction of justice, lying, and witness tampering. The investigation also found that Stone had been seeking out stolen emails from WikiLeaks that could damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The indictment alleged that Stone lied to Congress about his communications with the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks and his knowledge of the organization’s plans to release the hacked material.Stone is also accused of influencing one of his associates to use Fifth Amendment protections to avoid answering questions from the House Judiciary Committee. Stone’s trial is scheduled for November. George Papadopoulos, former foreign policy campaign adviser Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days of incarceration in September after pleading guilty to charges of lying to the FBI about his interactions with foreign nationals with ties to the Russian government. Papadopoulos had allegedly tried several times to set up meetings between Russian officials and Trump campaign staffers over the course of the election but was ultimately unsuccessful. Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to charges of lying to Congress about the canceled Trump Tower project in Moscow, particularly concerning the length of the endeavor and Trump’s knowledge of the business discussions. And as a result of an investigation that Mueller referred to the Southern District of New York, Cohen also pleaded guilty in August to eight counts of campaign finance violations related to hush money agreements with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Cohen was ultimately sentenced to three years of incarceration. 12 Russian GRU agents Mueller’s office charged members of the GRU, the Russian intelligence agency, in July on 11 counts related to the hacking of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic National Committee. 13 Russian nationals and three companies In February, 2018, a group of Russian nationals and three associated companies were charged for a sprawling election interference scheme that involved sowing discord and promoting distrust of American democracy on social media. The internet trolls assumed fake personas, spread disinformation, and attempted to boost Trump’s candidacy. It is unlikely that the any of these individuals will be extradited from Russia to face trial. Richard Pinedo, fake ID vendor Pinedo, a California man, was sentenced to six months in prison and six months of home detention in October for selling fake online identities that 13 Russian operatives would eventually use to set up PayPal accounts for their efforts to sow discord on social media during the 2016 election.

Google employees are protesting to remain the company’s watchdog,slate.com,April Glaser,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/google-employees-are-protesting-to-remain-the-companys-watchdog.html,"Facebook Just Hired the Co-Author of the Patriot Act and An Advocate Who Helped Fight It When Alphabet employees decided to stage protests in their offices this week, there was one big difference from the last time workers at the internet giant held a demonstration: They were now hesitant to use Google products for any planning. Just over a week earlier, two of their colleagues alleged that the company had retaliated after they’d organized a massive walkout back in November. So instead of using the most convenient online communication tools in the world, they opted for encrypted text apps to keep their plans out of the potential sight of their employer. In less than 24 hours, they planned a Wednesday “sit-in” in which more than 1,000 Googlers across 15 U.S. offices reminded the company that it still has to answer to its own workforce. Activism within Alphabet reached a dramatic peak last November when 20,000 employees across 50 offices worldwide walked out of work to protest how Google’s parent company deals with accusations of harassment and discrimination. But demonstrations within the company over how it does business, and with whom, have been going on for a couple years now. Last June, Alphabet decided to stop building artificial intelligence services for a Pentagon drone program after thousands of employees signed a petition demanding the company end the contract. And it was only last August that about 1,000 employees signed an internal petition calling on Google to scrap Project Dragonfly, its plan to build a censored search engine in China, which the company had to address. None of these impacts would have happened without employee organizing, and the current push within Alphabet to protect workers’ ability to dissent appears to be underlined by a realization that if anyone is going to meaningfully regulate one of the most powerful companies in the world, it’s going to be the talent that helps make it so powerful. Wednesday’s action comes a little over a week after two employees who were core organizers of the November walkout, Meredith Whittaker and Claire Stapleton, shared on an internal Google email list examples of alleged retaliation they had faced in the months that followed. The walkout, which was held to protest how the company had dealt with serious accusations of sexual assault and harassment and what many employees described as a culture of impunity for executives, led to immediate reforms inside Alphabet. Within days, the company agreed to end forced arbitration in cases involving accusations of sexual harassment or assault, a policy that prevented employees from taking their grievances to court. Workers continued to organize, and in February, Google eliminated its forced arbitration policy for employees entirely. But organizers still felt a sting. Stapleton, a 12-year veteran at Google, shared that she was informed she would be demoted and lose half of the people who report to her. “I was told to go on medical leave, even though I’m not sick,” Stapleton wrote in an email to an internal list describing the retaliation she experienced. It was only after she hired a lawyer that Google investigated and decided to walk back its decision to demote her. Whittaker, who leads Google’s Open Research Group and is the co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University, received notice that in order to stay at Google, she’d have to “abandon [her] work on AI ethics and the AI Now Institute,” according an email she sent internally. (Google disputes the employees’ allegations of retaliation.) Instead of leaving the office in unison on Wednesday, workers at Google used a variety of tactics. Some called in sick, a reference to Stapleton’s directive to take medical leave. Others set up an email auto-response to detail their grievances over how the company has treated the walkout organizers. In cities like New York, Pittsburgh, Cambridge, and Mountain View, California, workers gathered to read accounts shared by employees across the company alleging experiences of retaliation for speaking out against sexual harassment, bigoted comments from management, and discrimination in pay and promotions at Google. If employees are afraid to speak out when they’re mistreated, speaking out about the ethics of Google’s work will be even harder. Whistleblowing within technology companies is one of the few levers that can hold these conglomerates accountable. Users can complain, but companies don’t have to respond. Lawmakers could regulate and force corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon to be more transparent and responsible, but that’s probably not happening in the U.S. anytime soon. Tech companies, after all, work hard to stay unaccountable by spending big and hiring former government officials to get their way. Just last month, Facebook brought on the co-author of the Patriot Act as its general counsel. Last year, it was reported that Google outspent every other company in the country in its effort to lobby U.S. lawmakers, and in the first quarter of this year, Amazon outspent both Facebook and Google in its bid to influence Washington. Even when European regulators have cracked down on tech companies’ overreach, as they have over the past three years by issuing fines to Alphabet that add up to about $9 billion, it doesn’t amount to much more than a few speeding tickets for a company that had $137 billion in revenue in 2018 alone. Google and its peers are enormous enough that most of us depend on them to handle key functions of our daily life. In part it’s because their products are so useful. Google tells us where to go and how to get there. Facebook helps us maintain connections within our communities. We depend on software from tech companies to guide how we work, relax, and learn. Technology companies, like Google, deliver the information that we need to participate meaningfully in democracy. But these companies have also become so big that they face few checks on their behavior. That has put workers in an important position. Alphabet might not like that its employees are forcing it to be better. But as a user of Google products, I’m grateful. When it comes to keeping one of the most powerful corporations in the world in line, whistleblowers are often all we’ve got. And the scary part is that Google’s tech is so embedded in our lives—Gmail, Chrome, Search, Docs, Maps, Android—that when there’s something we don’t like about Google, there’s often nowhere else to go. Employee organizing has important changes so far. Hopefully, for the sake of everyone who depends on Google products, it will again."
Former CIA agent pleads guilty to spying for China.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/former-cia-agent-lee-pleads-guilty-spying-for-china.html,"Mueller Can’t Get Away With Silence Anymore A former Central Intelligence Agency officer pleaded guilty Wednesday to spying for China, the latest in a series of high-profile espionage cases involving American intelligence officers working for Chinese intelligence. Jerry Chun Shing Lee submitted his plea as part of an agreement with prosecutors, which will likely means prosecutors will seek a sentence of 17 to 27 years for the 54-year-old, rather than life. Lee worked for the CIA from 1994 until he resigned in 2007. A naturalized citizen who was born in Hong Kong, Lee returned to Hong Kong after leaving the CIA, where he started a business importing cigarettes with a former police officer who has ties to the Hong Kong intelligence world. Lee’s business partner connected him to Chinese intelligence operatives. After meeting with Chinese intelligence in mainland China, Lee made undisclosed cash deposits totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars into his Hong Kong bank account over the course of three years. It was around this time, in 2010, that “the C.I.A.’s informant network in China collapsed,” the New York Times notes . “Intelligence officials have been divided over how the network crumbled. While some believed that the Chinese had hacked the covert system the C.I.A. used to communicate with its foreign sources, others believed that Mr. Lee had given the Chinese at least some of the names.” Lee denied ever actually passing along information to the Chinese; the FBI uncovered two small notebooks that “contained true names and phone numbers of assets and covert CIA employees, as well as the addresses of CIA facilities” all related to China, according to the indictment ."

Billboard Music Awards: Watch Drake’s shoutout to Arya Stark.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/billboard-music-awards-bbmas-drake-arya-stark-game-thrones.html,"Apparently they’ve worked closely together since his stint on Degrassi High. Kevin Winter/Getty Images for dcp The Billboard Music Awards were held Wednesday night in Las Vegas, and for once, the Faceless Men of Braavos got their due. The famed order of assassins from Game of Thrones has been an important player in the music industry since 1910, when Billy Murray hired them to bake Blanche Ring into a pie as part of a complicated and bloody scheme to secure the wax cylinder rights for “ Come Josephine in my Flying Machine ,” but usually their machinations are kept behind-the-scenes. Tonight, however, on his way to a record-breaking 12 Billboard Music Award wins in a single night, Drake publicly acknowledged the people whose untraceable poisons and pointy daggers have made his success possible. Watch him give a shout out to Faceless Man alum Arya Stark for “putting in that work last week.” We’ll never know exactly what work Drake was referring to, but to win his Billboard Music Awards, he had to beat out Cardi B, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Imagine Dragons, Juice WRLD, Maroon 5, Post Malone, Travis Scott, and XXXTentacion. This would be a good time to look into any suspicious deaths from members of their production or publicity teams over the past year or so, with special attention paid to people who appear to have died accidentally after choking on their wine at a wedding. In the meantime, Drake’s public acknowledgement of Arya Stark will undoubtedly kick off yet another feud for the outspoken rapper, this time with Arya’s nemesis the Night King, who once again failed to take home even one Billboard Music Award. Industry observers expect him to respond by raising an unstoppable army of undead warriors to destroy all memory of humanity forever, or possibly by recording some sort of diss track.

"Tuca & Bertie, reviewed.",slate.com,Inkoo Kang,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/tuca-and-bertie-review-tiffany-haddish-ali-wong-lisa-hanawalt-netflix.html,"Adam Sandler Would Like You to Manage Your Expectations Before Seeing Italy The first sight that greets viewers of Tuca & Bertie , the new Netflix show by illustrator and BoJack Horseman production designer Lisa Hanawalt, is bouncing blue boobs protruding from the side of a building. Boobs definitely seems like the right word for them; these leaping, nippled mounds seem both matter-of-fact and ebullient, their carefree springiness amplifying a dancing edifice’s bodily bliss. On Tuca & Bertie , breasts hang off structures, mushroom caps replace heads, smitten characters’ bones flee their bodies when their crush talks to them, and, well, I’ll save the sex stuff for you to discover yourself. Our protagonists, voiced by Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong, have avian heads and human bodies, an Etsy-friendly aesthetic familiar to BoJack fans. But whereas BoJack ’s chimeras underscore the absurdity of Hollywood excess, on Tuca & Bertie , with its more intimate focus on friendships, relationships, daily female struggles, and, later in the season, unresolved trauma, the mix-and-match look unexpectedly speaks to the universality of the characters’ experiences. Anyone can see themselves in the plight of a bird that feels like it’s forgotten how to fly. Especially in its early episodes, Tuca & Bertie feels like the manic lovechild of BoJack and Broad City , another oft-surreal series about female besties caught up in an occasionally unhealthy codependence. At the series’ outset, Tuca (Haddish) has just moved out of the apartment the two of them shared for years to make room for Bertie’s (Wong) stability-craving boyfriend, Speckles (Steven Yeun). Gabby and brash, Tuca’s a toucan who lives off the generosity of a wealthy aunt (Jenifer Lewis). Sweater-swaddled Bertie’s a demure songbird, as well as a data processor at Condé Nest (among other things, Hanawalt is responsible for BoJack ’s pun-riddled background gags, a penchant she indulges here as well). It takes a few installments to adjust to the show’s frenetic pace and frequent digressions; initially, I took a mini-break at the two-thirds point of each episode. But around the fifth half-hour, Tuca & Bertie and I met in the middle, as the series slowed down to tackle darker subjects like sobriety and sexual harassment. Needless to say, this is a cartoon for grown-ups—not just because of the boobs, but because of the extraordinary sensitivity with which it deals with issues like office humiliations and existential anxieties and complicated relationships. (I knew we were watching adult-ass bird-women when Bertie’s croissants earned her a job offer with a celebrity chef, but she didn’t quit her job immediately to go pursue her dream, because not everybody gets to do that.) By deciding to live apart, 30-year-old Tuca and Bertie have entered a new phase of their lives. Tuca starts to fear that, as she gets older, her fuck-it-all ways are starting to be less “quirky” and more “sad.” Bertie worries that settling down with Speckles means settling for him and that her control-freak personality might drive away both her boyfriend and her best friend. This is wildly familiar territory, of course, but even the most stock situations are told in Hanawalt’s visual larks and heartfelt compassion for her characters. When a coarse co-worker gives Bertie a nasty comment, her fed-up left boob (voiced by Awkwafina, natch) jumps from her sweater to stalk off and go get a drink. And we’re back to the breasts. It’s safe to say Tuca & Bertie has a boob fixation—specifically, with reclaiming them for women. It’s hard not to think of Jessica Rabbit and all the countless other ways the female body has been distorted in animation for the straight male gaze as Hanawalt normalizes the presence of boobs and nipples—like when a pre-date trying-on-outfits montage displays, with not a hint of titillation, a female character’s bare chest—while celebrating their capacity for delight. Lived-in-ness is one of the hardest qualities to convey in cartoon form, which is why the bikini tan lines on Tuca and Bertie’s plant-lady neighbor (plant head, human body, medical-school education) is such a splendid detail. Hanawalt even takes back the three-boob gag from the likes of Total Recall and Mallrats . Along with the penultimate episode, which is as harrowing and heartbreaking as anything on BoJack —a stratospherically high bar—its free-the-nipple ethos feels uncommonly healing. It’s a smart use of Netflix’s streaming liberties and an ambitious mainstreaming of feminist art. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Haddish embodies an archetype we’ve seen her as several times now (as well as a character whose tragic history is not dissimilar to the actress’s early years), but Tuca & Bertie allows her to fill in those outlines in fascinating new ways. Wong’s comedic persona is of a wild child too (if a reformed one), which makes the dramatic shadings of her performance a revelation. As on BoJack , the supporting voice cast is full of marvelous surprises, which I won’t spoil further, but it’s arguably the hand-drawn-style animation, with bright, saturated colors, that’s the real star. The characters are so expressive they can convey conflicted horniness, and the city of Bird Town playfully defies all known laws of physics and common sense. In Hanawalt’s hands, you’ll feel wonderfully unbalanced, then tenderly comforted. "
Rabbit Holes: Why Exploring the Weird Limits of Google Maps Is the Best Way to Kill Time,slate.com,Allie Conti,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/google-maps-one-star-reviews-rabbit-holes.html,"Rabbit Holes: Why a 1950s Motivational Video Is the Best Form of Procrastination Rabbit Holes is a recurring series in which writers pay homage to the diversity and ingenuity of the ways we procrastinate now. To pitch your personal rabbit hole, email . Lakshmi Mudragada did not have a good time on Sea Cow Island. Sure, the potato-shaped land mass in the middle of the Indian Ocean doesn’t have any amenities, but the generic tropical beach picture on Google Maps looks nice enough. What went wrong? The one-star review on Google isn’t accompanied by text, so perhaps the story behind it will always be a mystery. But trying to untangle the mysteries behind various aspects of Google Maps is my preferred way to kill time. For example, how did Lakshmi get out to SCI in the first place? Or did they even really go there at all? When you try to get directions to the remote British territory from Brooklyn, for instance, it breaks the program. Rather than direct you to a regional airport in Madagascar or somewhere else “nearby,” it just zooms out so far that it shows a picture of Earth situated in the black expanse of outer space. I find this only slightly more intriguing than terrifying. Even though I spend all day on the internet, my world feels very small sometimes. The lives of people in areas like Palau or the Marshall Islands aren’t usually portrayed on TV or film. But Google Maps reviewers provide clues from which I can make up stories about these places on the other side of the earth, and sometimes they offer pictures that help fill in a coherent vision of them. It’s like a choose-your-own-adventure travel guide where everything is annotated in the most bizarre way possible—a “ Bandersnatch ” where you can play for as long or as little as you like and don’t have to worry about reaching any sort of satisfying narrative conclusion. When the story broke about the missionary who was killed trying to contact the last pre-Neolithic society on earth off the coast of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands this past November, I understood his curiosity, if not his confidence. I’d already pored over the Bay of Bengal and its archipelago from the comfort of my desk chair, and I’d seen the offerings at a roadside restaurant off National Highway 4 that takes you from the coastal point of Mayabunder to the capital of Port Blair. I’d also noticed that Google did not have the slightest data point available for the last place the missionary ever tried to set foot, beyond the fact that it existed. My procrastination habit isn’t just limited to the last blank spots on the Google map either; more familiar places work just as well. A co-worker recently told me that his sister had moved to someplace in my home state of Florida; he had to go and Google the name, even though he’d just been there. It turns out the forgettable town was called Freeport, and upon learning this, my immediate instinct was to look it up. It’s a suburb and therefore shaped like a plate of spaghetti, with no obvious Main Street or place to begin a journey. Searching for a clue of where to start, I scrolled through the place’s few commercial offerings, which is how I ended up on the page for Paul Lee Tattoo. The proprietor’s works include your typical yin-yangs and tribal patterns, sure, but photos from the shop also include a still-bleeding back freshly inked with a gator depicted busting through a wall like a reptilian version of the Kool-Aid Man. After completing this digital trek, I was pleased to report back to my co-worker with sympathies and a pointed recommendation of where his sister should never get a tattoo. Looking at your own hometown through the lens of Google Maps can also be enlightening. After all, the reviews represent a collection of what people there deem important or indicative of—something, although of what is up to you. In the case of Lake Mary, Florida, you get front-on shots of cookie-cutter houses and architecturally lacking commercial properties, a Chick-fil-A decorated for Christmas, a bad-looking steak at a sports bar, empty parking lots, and a Confederate flag in a display case. That’s a relatively accurate portrait, though not one I would have ever put together myself. I wonder how it would read to an outsider, though, or to someone as unfamiliar with the American South as I am with an app-breaking destination called Tristan da Cunha ? All I have to go on there are cryptic yet poetic messages that give me no idea of what a lived experience is actually like in the most remote yet inhabited archipelago on earth. Oddly: “The people … drift off walking sideways mid conversation.” Ominously: “The return to the past is the real future.” Or, more simply: “Too far.”"
William Barr rigged Donald Trump’s acquittal.,slate.com,William Saletan,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/barr-mueller-report-hearing-rigged-trump-prosecution.html,"How Are We Supposed to Understand Brett Kavanaugh Now? Five weeks ago, special counsel Robert Mueller gave Attorney General William Barr a 448-page report on the Russia investigation. The report documented multiple attempts by President Donald Trump to manipulate, disrupt, and terminate the investigation. But two days after receiving the report, Barr announced that the evidence was insufficient to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. How did Barr reach that conclusion? On Wednesday, we got the answer: He devised legal standards that make it impossible to convict a president of obstruction. At Wednesday’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Barr testified not as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer but as a defense attorney for the president. When Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota asked Barr about Trump’s attempts to manipulate witnesses, the attorney general rebutted her by presenting what, in his opinion, “the president’s lawyers would say.” Barr dismissed Mueller’s efforts to get an interview with Trump—Mueller “never sought it. … Well, he never pushed it,” the attorney general lied—and he complained that Mueller’s analysis of the president’s obstructive conduct “permits a lot of selectivity on the part of the prosecutors.” In place of Mueller’s analysis, Barr laid down four rules that guaranteed Trump would escape prosecution. 1. A president’s efforts to terminate an investigation of himself are presumptively innocent. Under U.S. law, anyone accused of a crime is presumed innocent. But Barr clings to this presumption even after the president has attempted, on multiple occasions, to abort an inquiry into his own alleged misconduct. Barr told the committee that Trump’s presidential orders—including the firing of then–FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 and the attempted firing of Mueller a month later—were “authorized by the Constitution” and therefore “facially innocent.” 2. No amount of evidence can disprove a president’s post hoc account of his motives. Mueller presented copious evidence that Trump, having decided to fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, seized on a completely different rationale—outlined in a memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—as a pretext for the firing. But at Wednesday’s hearing, when Sen. John Cornyn of Texas asked Barr whether Trump “was relying, at least in part,” on Rosenstein’s critique, the attorney general assured Cornyn, “That’s right.” Mueller also documented conversations in which then–White House counsel Don McGahn and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an ex-prosecutor, explained to Trump that there were no grounds to fire Mueller based on putative conflicts of interest. But at the hearing, Barr insisted that Trump’s subsequent efforts to oust Mueller might have been based not on fear of the Russia investigation but on the alleged conflicts of interest. Barr defended the president’s preposterous lie about his attempt, through McGahn, to fire Mueller. In June 2017, Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, said Trump was strongly considering firing Mueller. A few days later, Trump called McGahn twice at home and told him to get rid of the special counsel. According to McGahn, Trump repeatedly pressed him to contact Rosenstein—“Call me back when you do it,” the president told McGahn—and oust the special counsel because “Mueller has to go.” But at Wednesday’s hearing, Barr stood up for Trump’s version of the episode. “What he meant,” said Barr, paraphrasing Trump’s account, “was that the conflict of interest should be raised with Rosenstein, but the decision should be left with Rosenstein.” Barr was equally generous in his defense of Trump’s signals to witnesses. Klobuchar asked the attorney general about public comments in which Trump had warned two witnesses in the investigation, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, not to “flip.” Barr replied that Trump could easily defend those comments. “By flipping, he meant succumbing to pressure in unrelated cases to lie” against the president, Barr suggested. That’s an odd claim to make about Manafort—who was found to have lied to prosecutors while protecting Trump —or Cohen, whose testimony against Trump was corroborated by checks and audio recordings . 3. If a president thinks any part of an allegation is false, he can lawfully obstruct an investigation of that allegation. On Jan. 25, 2018, the New York Times reported Trump’s attempt, through McGahn, to fire Mueller in June 2017. In the week after the Times story appeared, Trump repeatedly pressed McGahn to deny the story. McGahn refused, saying the article was true. Trump rebuked McGahn for taking notes, demanded that he deny the story in writing “for our records,” and threatened to fire him if he didn’t recant. Mueller documented this episode through White House records and multiple witnesses. But at Wednesday’s hearing, Barr insisted that Trump’s intent was innocent because one word in the Times article was debatable. “The New York Times story said flat-out that the president directed the firing of Mueller,” said Barr. He noted that Trump later denied having used the word “fire” in his calls to McGahn. Therefore, said Barr, it was possible that “the president truly felt that the Times article was inaccurate” and, in ordering his White House counsel to recant, didn’t think “he was instructing McGahn to say something false.” 4. If a president thinks any part of an investigation is unfounded, he can lawfully shut it down. Barr told Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont that if a legal proceeding was “based on false allegations, the president does not have to sit there, constitutionally, and allow it to run its course. The president could terminate that proceeding, and it would not be a corrupt intent, because he was being falsely accused.” The attorney general made the same argument to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, contending that a “falsely accused” president could fire a special counsel without corrupt intent. Barr didn’t confine this argument to meritless inquiries. He applied it to investigations that involved any false allegations. He specifically said it was a valid basis for terminating the Russia investigation since the president “was being falsely accused.” “Two years of his administration have been dominated by allegations that have now been proven false,” Barr told the committee. In defiance of Mueller’s report , he claimed that Trump “did nothing wrong” and that suspicions of collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign were “without a basis.” Together, Barr’s four rules make an obstruction of justice case impossible. The president could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue, fire the FBI director, fire a special counsel, threaten witnesses, and instruct subordinates to lie, and he wouldn’t lose the support of his attorney general. That’s why Trump hired Barr in the first place. And that’s why Mueller’s investigation shouldn’t end with Barr’s refusal to prosecute the president. We can’t let a lawyer acquit his own client.

"Ben Sasse, Barr hearing: Explains problem with legal Trump-Russia links.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/ben-sasse-barr-hearing-explains-trump-exoneration.html,"Oglala Sioux Tribe Tells South Dakota Governor That She Is “Not Welcome” on Reservation In the first volume of his report to the attorney general about Donald Trump’s “links” to Russia, special counsel Robert Mueller wrote that the evidence his team had gathered “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Not surprisingly, Trump interpreted this conclusion as a “complete and total exoneration,” while Attorney General William Barr described it as a conclusion that “no collusion” took place in 2016. That’s not quite what the Mueller report says, though. For one, it notes that it does not address the issue of “collusion” because the word collusion doesn’t have a specific legal meaning. For another, it says that some of the witnesses investigators spoke to provided “information that was false or incomplete,” “deleted relevant communications,” or “communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption”—limitations that the special counsel says may have prevented its office from gathering information that “would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.” And finally, the report does conclude, even if it stops short of recommending criminal conspiracy charges, that the Trump campaign was “receptive” to some offers of Russian assistance and “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.” According to Mueller, Russia in turn “perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency.” Which, as Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse and Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons pointed out in their questions to Barr during Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, is not necessarily a great state of affairs. Sasse is the kind of Republican who tends to get exasperated at Trump for constantly doing things that are reckless and destructive. But he also represents MAGA-friendly red-state constituents , so his remarks weren’t phrased in a confrontational gotcha format. They nonetheless laid out concisely why it’s concerning that Trump et al.’s attitude toward Russian influence has not, as of yet, been disincentivized. Get The Angle in Your Inbox

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Sasse made his point via a question about Paul Manafort. Manafort served as Trump’s campaign chairman on an ostensibly “volunteer” basis, but, per Mueller’s report, sought to exploit the high-profile position financially. One of the ways he appears to have done so, according to Mueller, was by offering Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska—a close ally of Vladimir Putin’s who had previously employed Manafort for consulting work—access to the campaign. As Sasse put it:
Paul Manafort is hired by Deripaska for things related to the Ukraine. … He is on the payroll of a Russian oligarch that has interests completely disaligned with the American people. He is on his payroll. Is it permissible for [an American campaign official] to be paid by someone who is basically an enemy of the United States? Manafort was charged with a number of crimes that Mueller uncovered, but none were directly related to 2016 activities involving Deripaska. The special counsel also chose not to prosecute ex–National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who, like Manafort, had recent financial ties to Russia and demonstrated a willingness to advance Russian interests while working for Trump. Ostensibly, Mueller made this decision because neither Manafort nor Flynn were in touch with the specific Russian operatives who carried out cyberattacks against Democrats; likewise, neither individual appears to have been caught giving a tangible indication that their interest in Russia-friendly policies was a reward for Russia’s sabotage of Clinton. As Sasse pointed out, though, this would suggest that it would be OK with the Department of Justice for a foreign country like Russia or China to cultivate influence by systematically putting as many American campaign operatives as possible on retainer in the hopes that they’d end up, like Manafort, as influential “volunteers” on U.S. campaigns:
Could they come in and build a database of all campaign operatives in the U.S.? And just decide to hire all of them and say, why don’t you volunteer for this campaign and you volunteer for that campaign? Could we have campaign chairmen and women running around the U.S. paid for by foreign entities, choosing to volunteer on campaigns, going forward? Is that legal? And later:
If the Chinese government decides to start hacking into 2020 campaigns, I would hope there is clarity from the Department of Justice about whether or not Democratic presidential campaigns and whether the Trump re-election campaign are allowed to say, “we are interested in this hacked material.” Barr didn’t have much of a response for Sasse, calling the subject “a slippery area” and saying that whether any of the hypothetical behavior Sasse described would be criminal “depends on the specific circumstances.” The issue was framed even more pithily by Delaware’s Coons, who targeted Barr with a question based on the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting attended by three top Trump advisers and several Russians. The Russians had high-level government and intelligence connections and had conveyed through an intermediary that they were interested in providing the Trump campaign incriminating material about Clinton in the context of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” No one on the Trump campaign was charged for the incident; Mueller’s report concludes that prosecuting them for accepting illegal foreign campaign support would have been difficult because of ambiguity over whether they “had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful” and whether incriminating information legally constitutes “a thing of value” as the relevant statute requires. Coons’ question put Barr on the spot as to whether this is supposed to mean the meeting was A-OK.
COONS: Going forward, what if a foreign adversary—let’s now say North Korea—offers a presidential candidate dirt on a competitor in 2020? Do you agree with me the campaign should immediately contact the FBI?
BARR: [Long pause] If a foreign government?
COONS: If a foreign intelligence service, a representative of a foreign government—
BARR: Yes. Yes.
COONS: —says, “We have dirt on your opponent,” should they say “ I love it , let’s meet,” or should they contact the FBI?
BARR: If a foreign intelligence service does, yes. So, Barr’s answer appears to be that campaigns should worry about being approached by well-connected foreigners who want to trade incriminating information for changes to money-laundering laws only if those foreigners are wearing, let’s say, T-shirts and novelty baseball caps that say WE ARE FOREIGN SPIES. It’s an interesting position for the U.S.’s top law enforcement officer to take, but that’s where we are now."

"History of the California roll and its possible inventor, Hidekazu Tojo.",slate.com,admin,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/california-roll-inventor-origin-history-sushi.html/,"The Best Movies and TV Shows Coming to Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime, and Hulu in May Hidekazu Tojo came to Vancouver from Osaka, Japan in 1971. Young, ambitious, and classically trained in sushi arts, he was a perfect match for Shigeru Hirai, who was looking for a young chef to work with. Hirai offered Tojo a two-year contract at his small sushi restaurant, Maneki, in Vancouver’s Japantown. There weren’t many Japanese restaurants in Vancouver at the time, and even fewer still that served raw fish. Japanese diners raved about Tojo’s sushi. The local Canadians, on the other hand, only favored the cooked dishes. “I watched them eat spinach salad, tempura, and teriyaki chicken very, very quickly,” Tojo tells me over hot tea at his current restaurant, Tojo’s. “But the sushi they refused before they tasted. They didn’t eat raw crab and tuna … raw they didn’t eat.” Given the popularity and ubiquity of sushi today, it’s hard to imagine a time when we weren’t eating raw fish, but such was the case in 1970s North America. For Tojo, a trained sushi chef, watching his customers forgo his pièce de résistance, day in and day out, motivated him to make his sushi better.
Tojo on a trip to Alberta (Banff, Jasper, Calgary, Edmonton). Rocky Mountains, c. 1972 or 1973.
Momoko, Tojo’s Daughter But first, he needed to figure out why they didn’t want to try it in the first place. Eventually, Tojo moved outside of the familiarity of Japantown and became the head chef at a new spot, Jinya, on the highly trafficked and diverse West Broadway. He struck up a relationship with one of his regulars, a young flight attendant named Mami Yamaguchi, at the now-defunct CPA Airlines. Unlike most of the local Canadians who came to eat at Tojo’s restaurant, Mami was Japanese herself; she spoke multiple languages and didn’t shy away from trying Tojo’s sushi, which quickly endeared her to Tojo. She became, in a sense, his cultural translator, taking him to the popular French restaurants at the time, like William Tell, where Tojo noticed Canadians did in fact enjoy seafood, especially local Dungeness crab—when it was boiled. With Mami’s guidance, Tojo started to explore the local fish markets in pursuit of his most pressing question, “Why don’t Canadians like raw fish?” Tojo wandered the seafood aisles of Safeway and the local market on Granville Island to see where Canadians were shopping for fish. In contrast to the Japanese suppliers he was buying from, the Canadian markets, it turned out, served their fish with less presentation. “No decoration, very bad smell. Fish smell,” Tojo recounted. “In my training when you go to the market, seafood smells just like watermelon, fresh watermelon, or cucumber smell. Big difference. Over there, Safeway? Ah! Stinky! That’s why.” Suddenly the driving question to Tojo’s sushi conundrum had an answer: smelly fish. Tojo decided to create a sushi that Canadians would like, one that didn’t require the use of the local supply. It wasn’t so much a concession as a vestige of his training in Osaka, where he was known for his omakase creations, i.e. serving the customers’ needs with what was fresh and available. Omakase in Japanese loosely translates to “I’ll leave it up to you.” It’s more than just a menu; it’s a ritual built on the ever-changing ingredients in the chef’s kitchen, while still considering the desires of the customer. Many omakase chefs don’t have a predetermined menu in mind; rather, they build the menu as it unfolds, relying on a sense of what works and what doesn’t for each individual customer. It necessitates, in other words, a certain type of trust between the customer and the chef. What made Tojo’s style of omakase different was that he didn’t feel bound by his locale, North America. Take, for instance, his favorite dish unagi , or barbecued eel, which simply wasn’t available as an ingredient in Vancouver. In order to offer it as a menu item, he instead used the skin of a fish that came to Canada in droves, salmon, seasoning it with the classic sauce used on traditional unagi. This was, in effect, the way Tojo’s California roll was born: by mixing what was available and accessible to him, with what people in his restaurant actually wanted to eat. Nothing more or less elaborate than that. Tojo doesn’t remember the exact day or circumstance that led to the roll. He does, however, remember many customers complaining about eating seaweed. So one day, he replaced the raw fish with avocado and boiled local crab, inspired by what he saw at William Tell. Then, he hid the nori behind a veil of rice by rolling the sushi inside out. Finally, to really make the roll sing, he added a little mayonnaise. “We were born very poor,” he said. “That time after the war, no food. We put mayonnaise and greens from the garden. That is kind of like Western food, little bit fancy. Before they put only soy sauce. But when we discovered mayonnaise, we put in lettuce, tomato, cucumber—put mayo, I love it!” To be clear, the California roll on the menu at Tojo’s restaurant is called the Tojo Maki, not the California roll. Tojo had never even been to California at that point in time (a detail he has impressed on me several times). While the name “Tojo Maki” enjoys significantly less notoriety than “California roll,” Tojo insists that he was the first to come up with it. Asked why I should believe his version of the California roll’s origin story, he replied simply, “In Japan you have pride. Good chef never copies. Never.” The competing theory is that the California roll was, in fact, invented in California’s Little Tokyo in the 1970s. According to this version of events, a man named Kanai Noritoshi, who owned a Japanese food import company called Mutual Trading Company, started what was considered the first sushi counter, Kawafuku, and it was there that he invented the “California” maki. Kawafuku’s head chef, Ichiro Mashita, also claimed credit after starting his own restaurant, Tokyo Kaikan. As for Tojo’s attempts at solidifying his place in California roll history, he did try to trademark his roll in the early ‘90s, after the fact. For this he called on his lawyer, Barry Joe, who has been working with Tojo for 40 years. Unfortunately, for the progenitors of all things wacky maki, trademarking a recipe is extremely difficult to enforce, and extremely costly, at close to several thousand dollars a year for a patent on something like the Tojo Maki. For the rest of us, the who of who can legitimately claim credit for the California roll feels besides the point. The idea that people want to claim credit for its invention at all is a testament to its ubiquity, and to its ultimate commercial success. The California roll’s rise didn’t occur without its critics, like chef Hiroko Shimbo, author of The Sushi Experience . “The California roll is not Japanese sushi because it was created for the convenience of American diners,” she said. “We call it ‘sushi,’ but that’s another dish.” I asked Shimbo whether she thought it was authentic. “No,” she explained. “Why is it not authentic is simply the nori, when we make rolls in Japan, is always outside. And of course there is a reason nori is on the outside: to keep the sushi rice moist and juicy (and the nori gets a little chewy), and that’s how rolls are made in Japan.” As Shimbo speaks, I can’t help but wonder: Is authenticity not chimerical? Cross-cultural remakes of culinary classics date back to globalization itself. The English soup mulligatawny originated from the Indian dish molo tunny; L.A. galbi came from Korean immigrants in California who made use of a cheaper cut newly available to them; and even tempura exists thanks to the Portuguese (although now it seems so steeped in authentic Japanese tradition that considering it anything else seems preposterous). “Whenever some new dish comes to one’s country from another country, that food is always transformed into a slightly different form in order to appeal to the people in that new country,” Shimbo explained. “In Japan they like soft-textured bagels, so a few companies came up with a soft bagel, kind of a fluffy bagel, and that’s ‘bagel’ to the Japanese. And here in America no one can accept that soft bagel.” Maybe that’s what gave the California roll its staying power. Japanese sushi made a small adjustment: a piece of cooked fish in place of raw, a bit of extra sauce and some nori hidden from view. But what is authentic sushi? Even if it’s created for Americans, is it not still sushi? Maybe not what Shimbo grew up associating with sushi, but sushi nonetheless—without which some of Tojo’s most valued regulars may not have come back for a second or third taste. But what sushi needs in order to be authentic, Shimbo continued, is “respect of each flavor in each ingredient. When we cook something, we don’t add spices or something to mask. Using oil masks the flavor of ingredients, so the chefs or cooks, whenever they make some dish, try to use a method to keep the true flavor of the ingredients at the end of the preparation. So that when you eat chicken you enjoy the flavor of the chicken, not the sauce.” Some would say that the California roll, at least a good one, does just that. The balanced combination of ingredients, the subtleties of the rice’s temperature, the freshness of the nori, the perfect amount of mayo—all of these are what make a California roll sing. According to Shimbo’s definition, then, maybe there is a version of the California roll that’s “authentic” and another that’s not.
Tojo at Jinya, holding a takeout order for restaurant regular, Paul Belserene.
Momoko, Tojo’s Daughter Tojo’s creative approach to omakase has led to many other types of adaptations, like the Golden Roll, which does away with nori by wrapping sushi fillings in a thin egg crepe. Or his take on tuna sashimi, which comes pre-marinated to avoid the chance of a customer getting the wrong balance of fish to wasabi to soy. Visible in all of Tojo’s menu items is this well-worn habit of “tricking” his customers into trying more and more of his sushi—what may appear to be sushi gimmicks, but which clearly are clever maneuvers to appeal to the palette he’s catering to. One of Tojo’s most valued regulars, Paul Belserene, couldn’t stomach uni until he tried Tojo’s preparation of it, which now has him hooked. As Belserene remembers it, Tojo “saw his hesitation with uni,” so he made him an uni shiso temaki, placing the sea urchin on top of a shiso leaf so its slippery texture would be masked. “The bitterness of the shiso leaf, the crunch of the nori, and the softness and deep umami of the urchin,” as Belserene described it, was his “gateway drug into uni.” Thanks to Tojo, you can’t go a mile in any direction in Vancouver today without hitting a sushi restaurant. In 2016, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries honored Tojo as the Goodwill Ambassador for Japanese Cuisine, recognizing his work as a chef even as he pushed the boundaries of what’s accepted as “sushi.” I asked Tojo if he thought he would have received this award had he not invented the California roll. “You know, I don’t know,” he said wistfully. “I put the American palette and Japanese old-fashioned cooking together, little bit. That’s my cooking. Because otherwise, people no understand.” More from Food52 :How These Crispy Sheet-Pan Pork Chops Made It on My All-Star Dinners ListThis Chickpea Pot Pie Is So Good, You’ll Be Like ‘Chicken, Who?’Our 10 Most-Popular Recipes Right NowBanana Bread-Chocolate Chunk CookiesFilipino Chicken Porridge (Arroz Caldo)

For two years, Mueller has defied all public longings and expectations and demands, instead allowing his indictments, his report, and his words on paper to speak for themselves. But like Boo Radley, it’s now time for Robert Mueller to come out. If Attorney General William Barr’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday demonstrated anything, it was that a deep rupture has yawned open between these two old friends and Washington lifers. It wasn’t just that Barr denigrated Mueller as a “political appointee” or dismissed his March 27 letter as “ snitty ,” and thus clearly the work of underlings. It wasn’t just that Barr implied that Mueller was either too timid or too incompetent to come to a conclusion on the question of whether Donald Trump had obstructed justice. And it wasn’t just that Barr suggested that since the entire Mueller probe had been proven to be “based on false accusations,” it was illegitimate, which certainly suggests that Mueller devoted two long years to a—you guessed it—witch hunt. Presumably, from now on, if the president decides any legal investigation is “based on false accusations,” he can just go ahead and impede it , a framing that makes a hash of everything Mueller sought to do. When pressed Wednesday on Mueller’s bona fides, Barr snapped that “Bob Mueller is the equivalent of a U.S. Attorney. … His work concluded when he sent his report to the attorney general. At that point, it was my baby.” This is not how you talk about a colleague you respect. This studied restraint rested on Mueller’s unwavering assumption that if he trusted the fact-finding process of the investigation and the machinery of the Justice Department, he might come out the other side intact. But it’s not just that. At the most basic level, Barr has distorted Mueller’s actual work product, including his polite and confidential and lawyerly letter asking (twice) that Barr correct his inaccurate summary of Mueller’s careful report. It’s a letter that Wired’s Garrett Graff, who wrote a book about Mueller, described thusly : “I’ve read just about every word Bob Mueller has ever said publicly or published. He’s written precisely one letter like the angry one he sent to Barr: It excoriated Scotland for letting the Pan Am 103 bomber out of prison.” With the rollout of the report and Wednesday’s charged testimony, Barr betrayed Mueller the institutionalist not once but twice, first by warping years of his team’s painstaking investigative work in order to control the media narrative, and then by denigrating Mueller’s March 27 letter as the work of a “snitty” staffer, as opposed to a sober and deliberate bit of caution from the special counsel quietly asking that his work not be appropriated for political ends. Mueller, a lifelong Republican, has tried—probably harder than any public figure in the Trump ambit—to avoid doing anything that would draw him into the tractor beam of bullying, name-calling, and soapy melodrama that are the final resting place for anyone who involves himself with this president. Where lesser men have attempted to split the difference, compromise at the margins, and to persuade themselves that they were still doing noble work despite allowing Donald Trump to use and exploit them, Mueller simply never engaged, even when the president was attacking him by name. It was an elegant dance, along the invisible seam of public and private, institutionalism and self-protection. This studied restraint rested on Mueller’s unwavering assumption that if he trusted the fact-finding process of the investigation and the machinery of the Justice Department , he might come out the other side intact. Well, any hope that Barr the institutionalist or Barr the defender of the Justice Department or Barr the believer in truth-seeking processes was going to help Robert Mueller thread this impossibly small needle was vaporized conclusively this week , and now, as my colleague Mark Joseph Stern argues, Robert Mueller is going to have to talk . Efforts to speak through his filings have proved futile in the hands of someone willing to twist and compromise Mueller’s own words until they mean the very opposite of what they originally established. And now that the rift between these two old friends and colleagues has been laid bare, the only person who can do anything about it is the person who has practically made a religion of keeping his head down. Mueller has a narrowing path along which he might hope to salvage his own words and his own work from the attorney general, who seems to have taken custody of Mueller’s “baby” and then unabashedly attempted to tell us all that the baby was actually an accent lamp all along. Nobody has been more voluble than I have about Mueller’s right and inclination to quietly do the work, then step aside . But if he doesn’t step into the limelight to say out loud what he has written, and proved, and corroborated, and supported (with evidence Barr seems never to even have inspected ), his entire effort will only serve as confirmation that those of us who still believe in systems and investigations and truth are all a bunch of chumps. I don’t envy Robert Mueller. As the one and only character in this endless gothic saga who has managed to remain untarnished by the president’s highly contagious lack of principle, I take no pleasure in arguing that he will now have to engage. His silence and doggedness should have spoken louder than words. But in the hands of someone as bent on politicizing his efforts as William Barr, his silence and doggedness have now been weaponized against him. The special counsel cannot just live amid the heroic metaphors anymore. Like Boo Radley, Mueller needs to come out. Support our journalism

William Barr’s Justice Department Just Filed the Most Nakedly Political Brief in the Agency’s History,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-doj-obamacare-brief-partisan-hack.html,"Barr Rigged Trump’s Acquittal On Wednesday afternoon, after Attorney General William Barr finished his truculent and mendacious testimony before the Senate, the Department of Justice filed perhaps the most embarrassing, illogical, and nakedly political brief in the history of the agency. With Barr’s assent, the DOJ argued that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because Congress zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty in 2017. The timing couldn’t be worse. After obliterating his own credibility at the Senate hearing, Barr scorched the Justice Department’s legitimacy, deploying fatuous pseudo-legal arguments to further the Trump administration’s partisan goals. The DOJ will not soon recover from Wednesday’s body blow. Texas v. United States , the latest assault on the ACA, is built upon a series of sophistries. The case was brought by a coalition of conservative states, led by Texas, which recruited two consultants to serve as plaintiffs. They assert that when Congress reduced the ACA’s penalty to zero dollars, it inadvertently destroyed the whole law—the tax credits, the exchanges, protections for preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion, everything. According to Texas’ theory, the Supreme Court only upheld the ACA because it interpreted the penalty as a tax. But, they claim, a tax that collects zero dollars is not a true tax. So the individual mandate can no longer be viewed as a tax, rendering it unconstitutional. And because Congress never intended the ACA to function without the individual mandate, the rest of the law must be struck down too. This leap in logic makes no sense. It is true that taxes typically collect revenue, so perhaps the mandate cannot fairly be called a tax anymore. It could even be true that the zeroed-out penalty is now unconstitutional. But that does not matter , because ifthe penalty is illegal, it should be severed from the rest of the law. As the Supreme Court recently explained , when one provision of a statute is invalidated, courts should preserve the remainder of the law unless it is “evident” that Congress “would not have enacted those provisions … independently.” In other words, courts that strike down part of a law should not eviscerate the rest of it without evidence that Congress would’ve wanted that extreme result. Here, congressional intent is about as clear as it can get. In 2017, Congress declined to repeal the entire ACA but chose to zero out the individual mandate’s penalty in the tax bill . By doing so, it declared its belief that the law could function without an operative penalty, a lawful exercise of its legislative powers. But Texas claimed that by amending the ACA, Congress inadvertently demolished it, because the law cannot function without a penalty—even though Congress decided that it could. Thus, according to the plaintiffs, courts should simply sweep aside this legislative intent and invalidate the law top to bottom. Congressional intent is about as clear as it can get. In an opinion panned by liberals and conservatives alike, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor embraced this theory late last year and ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional. This view was too militant even for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department, which opted for a compromise position: It alleged that the mandate was unconstitutional but that only a few other provisions must fall with it. This half-measure was still a big deal, because the DOJ urged the courts to kill a centerpiece of the law: its bar on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. And the DOJ’s brief at the time reflected, as University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley put it , “enormous contempt for the rule of law.” It was, as other scholars noted , “excruciatingly stupid.” But at least the DOJ did not go whole hog, adopting Texas’ radical position that courts should reject Congress’ authority to amend its own law. Until now. After Barr took control of the DOJ, the agency changed its position and has now told the 5 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas is right—the full ACA is now unconstitutional. With a straight face, the Justice Department argues that, by reducing the mandate to zero dollars, Congress gave Americans a “legal command” to buy health insurance. The Supreme Court has said that such a direct command would be unconstitutional because the mandate could only be justified as a tax. Moreover, the justices who discussed severability said that the ACA cannot function without the mandate. In sum, the DOJ wrote, the mandate is now illegal, it cannot be severed, and so the whole law is unconstitutional. Where to begin with this lunacy? Start with the DOJ’s framing of the mandate as it stands now. As a factual matter, the ACA currently gives Americans a choice between buying health insurance and paying nothing. There’s no real dispute here; if you forgo insurance, you will suffer no legal consequences. Yet the DOJ interprets the mandate as a “command” that gives Americans “no choice” but to purchase insurance. And its brief insists that Congress created this command in its 2017 tax bill—even though legislators surely knew that the Supreme Court already ruled that such a command would be unconstitutional in 2012’s NFIB v. Sebelius . It requires willing suspension of disbelief to surmise that by giving Americans a choice not to buy insurance by zeroing out the mandate, Congress actually gave them a “command” to insure themselves. And it taxes credulity to believe that Congress would create this “command” after the Supreme Court stated that such a rule would be unconstitutional. But imagine for a moment that the DOJ is right—that the Republican-led Congress of 2017 didn’t actually relieveAmericans of their duty to buy health insurance but forcedthem to do so (without any enforcement mechanism). If the courts must strike down this new “legal command,” why should the remainder of the law fall with it? After all, Congress obviously thought the ACA could function without a mandate that raises revenue. To square this circle, the DOJ repeatedly cites the dissent in NFIB , which proclaimed that the mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the law. The Justice Department seems to think that the view of four dissenting justices (in a 2012 case) can override the view of Congress (in 2017 legislation). It appears to have forgotten that a dissent is not law. The zaniest portion of Wednesday’s brief, however, has to be its effort to salvage the few provisions of the ACA that the current administration likes. It does so by selectively raising the problem of standing. Now, in reality, the individual plaintiffs in this case—two consultants who don’t want to buy health insurance—shouldn’t have standing to sue at all. That requires an injury, and these plaintiffs have none , because they pay no penalty for forgoing insurance. The DOJ casts this problem aside by asserting that they are injured by the “legal command” to insure themselves. And its brief argues that the plaintiffs have standing “to challenge the numerous provisions of the ACA that work together to cause” this injury. But in a puzzling paragraph, the DOJ adds that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge several provisions of the ACA that criminalize health care fraud. Why? The real answer is that the Justice Department is already prosecuting people under these provisions, and those prosecutions would be thwarted if the full law were struck down. But the DOJ avows that while the plaintiffs have standing to challenge almost the entire ACA, they can’t challenge these provisions because they do not “actually injure the individual plaintiffs.” Oh, really? So the rule that insurers not discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and the tax credits for lower-income Americans, and the expansion of Medicaid in states other than Texas —all these provisions “actually injure” the plaintiffs? But prohibitions on fraud somehow do not? The DOJ makes no effort to defend this evanescent distinction, because it is indefensible. Barr reportedly opposed adopting this preposterous position but caved to President Donald Trump’s demands. He deserves no credit for his feeble resistance. Barr owns this brief , and it will live on as a testament to his craven lawlessness long after the Supreme Court rejects its casuistry. The Justice Department’s reputation will take years to recover from this nadir, if it ever does. Barr marched his agency to the brink of illegitimacy. Support our journalism

Xavi Made Modern Soccer. Did the Game Leave Him Behind?,slate.com,Eric Betts,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/xavi-retirement-barcelona-spain-undervalued.html,"Rockets-Warriors Was All About One Specific Type of Foul In 1814, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace posited a hypothetical intelligence that, given the location of every atom in the universe and the forces acting upon them, would be able to calculate the future with the same clarity with which it observed the past. This concept, which would come to be known as Laplace’s demon , would know all the causes and thus be able to see all the effects. The entire universe, from its beginning to its end, would be contained within its mind. Xavi, soccer’s own Laplace’s demon, announced Thursday that he would retire at the end of this season after 17 years at Barcelona and four lucrative swan-song seasons at the Qatari club Al-Sadd. No one in the history of the sport has ever controlled games like the diminutive Spaniard did; no one has ever been as good at the simple task of receiving the ball and knowing immediately where it needs to go next. He played as though he could see the future, as though the only input required for him to map out the rest of the game was the kickoff. Xavi sat at the literal center of two of this century’s most dominant teams, and he, more than anyone—and in this case, “anyone” includes all-timers Thierry Henry, Gerard Piqué, and even Lionel Messi—dictated how Barcelona and Spain played: retaining possession through short passing in close quarters, bending and eventually exhausting defenses with their intricate movement. Xavi found little pockets of space and weaponized them. Between 2008 and 2012, he won two Champions League trophies, three Spanish La Liga titles, two European Championships, and one World Cup, or just about everything it was possible for him to win. Yet because his game appeared so simple, because he did the things everyone is supposed to do only better, it took years for him to get the acclaim he deserved. Even after he was named the best player of the 2008 European Championship, halfway through a year spent masterminding the most dominant club season in recent history with Pep Guardiola’s first Barcelona team, the Daily Mail published a headline over a picture of the five nominees for the FIFA World Player of the Year Award that read “ The Best Players in the World (and Xavi) .” He might still be undervalued, despite all those trophies. The soccer magazine FourFourTwo named him the 50 th best player of all time in 2017, which one day is going to seem nearly as ridiculous as “(and Xavi).” His presence on the field wasn’t additive but multiplicative. Perhaps the difficulty of appraisal stems from the fact that he was so different from the midfield idols he supplanted: inexhaustible battlers like Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira, polished playmakers like Kaká and Pavel Nedved. Xavi was the stylistic opposite of the 2006 World Cup’s best player, Zinedine Zidane. Even at 34, Zidane dominated games, arresting the eye like a bolt of lightning. You were always conscious of him, always waiting for his next audacious display, up to and including the career-ending head-butt in that World Cup’s final. Xavi never played that way. He was a conduit, shepherding the game but not overwhelming it. He was not the kind of player you were always aware of; indeed, he moved about the pitch so much you’d be hard-pressed to keep constant tabs on him. Instead, you’d notice his contribution—a sudden, surprising one-touch pass to split two different layers of defenders—then go back via replay or rewind and discover that of course it was him. Trying to spot Xavi’s next pass before he played it was a good way to prove how little you knew about the game. He saw his options faster than you could even with your advantage of the wide shot. His presence on the field wasn’t additive but multiplicative. His entire game fit into one of our most-hallowed sporting clichés: He made his teammates better. On a squad of zeroes, the effect might be small; it wasn’t until this season that Al-Sadd won the Qatar Stars League with him, and he’s been hurt for much of the year anyway. But for Spain and Barcelona, his contribution was so immense it defined an era of the sport. Following Spain’s World Cup triumph in 2010, the team’s style, known as tiki-taka, appeared poised to sweep the world. Brendan Rodgers rode a couple of seasons of overachieving possession-based soccer at Swansea to the top job at Liverpool. Jürgen Klinsmann’s hire in 2011 as the U.S. men’s national team coach hinged on his promises to bring more possession play: “If you play Brazil or Argentina, you might play differently than maybe a country in CONCACAF, but it is a starting point if you say we want to start to keep possession, we want to start to dictate the pace of the game, we want to challenge our players to improve technically in order to keep the ball.” Results were mixed, we might charitably say. The chasm between original and imitators was never bridged. Teams such as Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan had sporadic success designing labyrinthine bunkers for Xavi and Andrés Iniesta to navigate during that 2008–12 run, but it was the development of more sophisticated pressing and counterpressing strategies that ultimately supplanted tiki-taka as the tactic du jour, largely because those schemes were the first to reliably beat it. The longest section of the tiki-taka Wikipedia page is about the strategies other teams developed to beat Spain and Barcelona , starting with the U.S. national team’s win over the Spanish in the 2009 Confederations Cup semifinal, Spain’s first defeat in 36 matches. Surprisingly, the list doesn’t include simply waiting them out. Not to take away from the achievement of Diego Simeone’s title-winning Atlético Madrid in 2014, but it’s no coincidence the all-consuming whirlwind unleashed by Xavi’s teams subsided just as age caught up to him. Instead of a stylistic revolution, tiki-taka turned out to be a complex exoskeleton constructed around his singular genius. Remove its pilot, or slow him down a crucial step or two, and what you were left with was a clunky and easily disrupted machine like the one eliminated before the knockout round of the 2014 World Cup. Barcelona adapted its tactics to play faster and has won four of the last five La Liga titles. Spain has clung harder to the style and, after a brilliant qualifying campaign, finally passed itself to death against the hosts during the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Even Guardiola’s Manchester City doesn’t attempt what his Barcelona did with Xavi at the helm. The next step for Xavi, the obvious step almost since he turned professional, is coaching. He may start in Qatar, perhaps with Al-Sadd, perhaps eventually even taking over the country’s national side ahead of the 2022 World Cup. There may be other stops along the way, but the final destination feels inevitable: Barcelona. No one is more ingrained in the Barcelona way. Even in Qatar, he remained the club’s moral philosopher and an easy source for quotes on a range of Barcelona-adjacent subjects, from questioning the current status of its famed youth academy to piling slight after slight on Neymar for daring to leave for Paris Saint-Germain. The one constant to it all is a strict interpretation of what it means to play the Barcelona way. As he put it in his retirement announcement: “I love seeing the teams take the initiative on the field, play attacking football and return to the essence of what we all loved since our childhood days: football possession.” If, or when, he does get the Barcelona job, that dogma may be tested. Will he learn to be flexible? Or does he have a solution to the problem that has stymied the world since his peak: How do you play like Xavi without Xavi?"
Report: FBI Sent Undercover Agent to Meet With Papadopoulos During 2016 Campaign,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/fbi-agent-george-papadopoulos-trump-campaign-russia.html,"William Barr Is a Different Kind of Trump Surrogate In 2016, the FBI sent a trusted investigator posing as an academic’s assistant to ask Donald Trump aide George Papadopoulos about the Trump campaign’s links to Russia, the New York Times reported Thursday. The news of such a proactive step by the agency is likely to cause some Trump supporters to accuse the FBI of “spying” on Trump and his campaign in an effort to damage his chances of winning, as Trump himself has insisted in the past. But the effort can also be interpreted as a signal of how concerned the FBI was at the time about potential Russian inference in the election. The FBI became alarmed about that possibility in the summer of 2016 after Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had offered to help the Trump campaign by releasing the emails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The Australian government alerted American officials once Wikileaks published that trove of hacked emails, and the FBI opened its Russia investigation in July 2016. According to the Times, the FBI decided to look into whether Papadopoulos had Russian contacts. During the investigation, the agency decided to also look into Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and Carter Page. The FBI then had Cambridge professor Stefan A. Halper, reportedly a longtime informant, reach out to Papadopoulos to set up a meeting in London to discuss a Mediterranean natural gas project. The FBI also sent along a trained agent, who had given her name as Azra Turk, to pose as Halper’s assistant. The two were meant to quiz Papadopoulos about any connection between the campaign and Russia, and Turk also met with Papadopoulos separately for drinks. Papadopoulos wrote in his book that when he met Turk in London in September, she began to immediately press him about the campaign’s connection to Russia. (British intelligence officials were also notified about the operation, according to the Times, but it’s unclear if they were at all involved.). He wrote that he met with both Turk and Halper the next day, and in a follow-up drink with Halper, the professor began immediately quizzing him about the hacked emails and Russia. Turk and Halper did not learn anything of significance from the effort, but Halper, a well-connected academic, continued his work with the FBI. He met repeatedly with Page and gradually became more closely connected to the Trump world. The FBI has said the agency carefully considered the seriousness of monitoring an active presidential campaign, according to the Times, and it was careful that word of the investigation should not reach the public. Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general, is investigating the FBI’s activities, including those involving Halper, before the 2016 election. Attorney General William Barr has said the results of that investigation could be completed in the next couple months. Support our journalism

"My cats only sleep outside, and I’m worried: pet advice from Beast Mode.",slate.com,Nick Greene,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/cats-sleep-outside-transition-inside.html,"My Mom’s Dog Despairs Each Morning I Can’t Walk Her. Should I Stop Doing It on Weekends? Two kittens bumbled into our backyard and our lives last summer, and what started out as my little project to make sure they got some food and got neutered—through our SPCA’s trap-and-release program—turned into something bigger. Now my husband and I have two cats. They’re socializing well and they come inside a lot, even to sit on the couch and snuggle with us. They’ve been to the vet and had all their shots and get monthly flea treatments. For now, they sleep in a little heated tent on our deck, which they took to immediately and treat as their home base. But I would like to transition them to being indoors more. We’re aiming to at least bring them inside at night to keep them safer and so they won’t have to deal with temperature extremes. Do you have any tips on making this transition a smooth one? We’re considering installing a cat flap to see if that makes them more comfortable. Would moving their tent inside as part of their move be a good idea? —Cats Under a Cold Tin Roof Dear Cats Under a Cold Tin Roof, Welcoming strange beings into your life is a scary proposition, so allow me to commend these cats for their bravery. Humans can be unpredictable and messy, but they’ve found two adoptees who possess great demeanors and a willingness to learn. It’s a perfect match. You and your husband deserve praise as well. The strays may have adopted you, but you’ve accepted the responsibility of keeping them healthy and safe with compassion and patience. By the sound of it, you’ve done a swell job so far. I’m sure the cats feel the same, even if they’re too busy glamping in their heated tent to tell you so. Be prepared to deal with two cranky and put-upon cats at first. If you feel totally ready to keep the cats under your roof at night, then, by all means, go for it. “It’s certainly safer for the cats to be indoors at night,” certified animal behaviorist Mikel Delgado says . “There’s more risk of injury and other wildlife [encounters] during the dark hours.” To habituate them to being inside, Delgado says it’s all about creating a welcoming environment that they will enjoy—especially since there will be more than one cat in the home. “Make sure there are enough resources for the cats to use,” she tells me. “That means multiple feeding dishes, multiple litter boxes, vertical space, things that they can climb, places to sleep.” The tent you’ve pitched is a clear example of the kindness you’ve shown to these cats, but you don’t have to restructure some of your own indoor living space to accommodate this edifice. If it creates needless clutter, feel free to keep it on the deck. The cats will deal. As with the tent, the cat flap isn’t necessary to facilitate a smooth transition. “I’m more of a cold-turkey person. Once they get used to the cat flap, great, but then that will have to change,” Delgado says. “If they truly want the cats indoors at night, then they should just rip the Band-Aid off.” In the long run, it will be less of a hassle than pitching a tent inside or punching a hole in your door. Speaking of hassles, be prepared to deal with two cranky and put-upon cats at first. “They’re going to protest for a few days because of the change of routine, but that won’t mean they won’t adjust,” Delgado says. It is key that you ignore this behavior, because they will interpret any response—even if it’s just telling them to shut up—as encouragement to meow and whine even more. “Cats are very good at manipulating humans,” Delgado says. And how. This is a big move, both for you and the cats, so now is the time to consider everything that this change in accommodations will entail. Because once you decide to upend their nighttime routine, it’s up to you to stay the course. “If these people have decided that this is the safest option for these cats,” Delgado says, “then they should just jump in and do it.” The move may be difficult initially, but if you get them on a routine and make them feel comfortable in their environment, then the cats should warm up to the new digs. They may stay outside all day, but they’ll be happy to call your house their home at night. They adopted you for a reason, after all. "
That Movie About Charlize Theron Falling for a Schlubby Seth Rogen Is Actually Pretty Feminist,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/long-shot-review-charlize-theron-seth-rogen-romcom-progressive.html,"Under the Silver Lake Is a Total Mess and Totally Worth It Like many rom-com heroines, Long Shot ’s Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) has an aspirational job, a glitzy wardrobe that makes zero sense for her salary, and an unwitting need for the right guy to come along, loosen her up, and inject some fun into her life. Unlike many rom-com heroines, Charlotte curses, has sex, occasionally wears dowdy pantsuits, and, most notably, throws even more of herself into her career at the end of the movie, to the absolute delight of her male partner, Fred (Seth Rogen). In Long Shot ’s world—as in ours—public-facing women are relentlessly scrutinized, and powerful ones are generally considered too intimidating to date. The film’s irresistible fantasy—and hopefully, increasingly, our reality—is that there are men who are perfectly content supporting their high-powered wives, just as women have been doing for their husbands for most of recorded history. Helmed by Jonathan Levine, who also directed Rogen in 50/50 and The Night Before , and based on a screenplay by Dan Sterling ( The Interview )and Liz Hannah ( The Post ), Long Shot fits neatly in the actor’s wheelhouse in most ways. It features a solid joke just about every minute—many of them about masturbation, pop culture, and Rogen’s character’s Jewishness. It also includes a getting-high sequence, unabashedly liberal politics, and more than a twinge of self-pity about Rogen’s honestly-pretty-good looks (more on this later). But Long Shot feels like something new, too—a brogressive rom-com that mixes inconvenient boners and aerodynamic cum with extensive observations about sexism and a rare romanticization of the male helpmate. The movie doesn’t get all its gender dynamics right, and an out-of-nowhere call for bipartisan cooperation feels like a ham-fisted insertion by a nervous studio exec. But all the way up to its own version of a happy ending, it’s a fresh, timely spin on the rom-com formula, the next step forward after the feminist strides in Rogen’s Neighbors movies and a possible new path for dude comedies that are no longer content to pretend that women don’t have our own stuff going on. Before it refers to the disparity in status and attractiveness between Charlotte and Fred, the “long shot” of the title describes the presidential prospects of Charlotte, the youngest secretary of state ever and a frequent target of ogling by conservative pundits. Charlotte serves a popular, numpty president (Bob Odenkirk) who became commander-in-chief by playing one on TV (his favorite line: “I’m not nuking a tsunami!”), and who has to be tricked into thinking her ideas are his to implement them. When her boss decides he’d rather pursue a movie career than seek reelection, Charlotte decides to throw her hat into the ring—and after a series of convolutions, hires as one of her speechwriters the unemployed firebrand journalist Fred, who she used to babysit 25 years ago. Charlotte and her team travel to nearly two dozen countries together as she attempts to sell an environmental deal that will make her a competitive candidate, and in such close-quartered conditions, the politico and the writer fall for each other’s idealism and accomplishments, even as they disagree on whether it’s OK to compromise to effect change. (Anyone still smarting from the intra-Democratic battles of 2016 should find some salve in this romance between Hot Hillary and a Bernie bro.) But when Charlotte wins the sitting president’s endorsement, her protective aide (June Diane Raphael) warns that the public won’t accept a model-esque woman with a schlub like Fred. Apparently the voters in this universe have never seen most movies, television shows, lots and lots of real-life couples—or simply don’t register that “mixed-attractiveness” relationships aren’t all that rare. Long Shot feels like something new—a brogressive rom-com. Rogen is as funny as he’s ever been, but it’s Theron who’s the standout. She makes the absurdities of Charlotte’s life, like being unable to eat skewered foods in public or “micro-napping” while standing with her eyes open, seem not only believable, but human. The movie has plenty of compassion for the thousand and one constraints Charlotte has to keep in mind at all times (don’t be “angry,” but don’t be “weak”), but what hits hardest are the moments when we see her breezily commanding leadership in action. In front of the cameras, she’s buttoned-up but learning how to open up (mostly through the jokes and autobiographical details Fred peppers into her speeches). But when she needs to get things done behind the scenes, she displays a surgical decisiveness, a treasure trove of wonky knowledge, and a no-bullshit matter-of-factness that’s impossible not to get a girl crush on. It’s the kind of nonpathologized portrayal of a woman taking charge that knocks you off your seat because you hadn’t realized how much you were missing it. I do wish we’d gotten to see Charlotte actually making deals, though— Long Shot would have you believe that being secretary of state is just jet-setting around the world, attending fancy parties, and tangoing with the prime minister of Canada (Alexander Skarsgard, in a hilarious sendup of his beefcake image).

The eleventh hour in a rom-com tends to be my least favorite, when the destined couple mope around for a few minutes before reuniting for the final time. But the one in Long Shot is particularly aggravating, largely contingent as it is on Rogen’s supposed hideousness. Rogen is clearly responding to one particular strain of the backlash against Knocked Up that pointed to the attractiveness gap between him and co-star Katherine Heigl—a criticism meant to draw attention to the ostensible sexism of the movie as well as of the industry at large . But the excessive focus on Fred’s everydude appearance—after such well-earned sympathy for the crap Charlotte puts up with every day—feels like, to put it in political-coverage terms, false balance. Fortunately, Long Shot soon remembers that Fred’s most lovable quality doesn’t have to be his looks. "
"The Angle: From Kavanaugh to Biden, What’s Really Changed?",slate.com,Slate Copy Desk,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/kavanaugh-biden-barr-mayor-pete-vaccines-meeting-gorbachev.html,"A Republican Senator Gave the Best Explanation Yet of Why Mueller’s Report Doesn’t “Exonerate” Trump Two steps back: In the months since Christine Blasey Ford took her stand against Brett Kavanaugh, what’s really changed ? He made it to the Supreme Court, and Joe Biden, who’s mishandled sexual harassment allegations in his work and his life, is an early front-runner in the 2020 presidential race. Christina Cauterucci looks back on the thwarted hopes of the #MeToo movement and can’t help feeling “there’s some upper threshold to the amount of justice survivors can expect to see in this country.” Calm cop, bad cop: William Barr doesn’t have the bluster of some of Donald Trump’s other hires, and Lili Loofbourow argues that’s by design. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the attorney general maintained a calm, mildly condescending demeanor while working doggedly to make the president legally untouchable: “Barr’s composure was an inverse function of the legal acrobatics he was attempting.” Vax populi: If you spent time in the science-loving corners of social media this week, you may have heard that presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg initially botched his answer to a question about vaccinations. (He later changed his position.) Daniel Engber, however, argues that the mayor’s original response—that vaccinations should be mandatory, but medical, personal, and religious exceptions should be allowed unless there’s a public health crisis—is not so radical at all and, in fact, is perfectly reasonable. “Mikhail Sergeyevich, please allow me to explain myself”: Werner Herzog’s latest film is a documentary wherein he sits down with Mikhail Gorbachev (and other Cold War–era politicians) to paint a thorough picture of the Soviet leader’s life. Joshua Keating reviews the movie, which not only explores a subject fit for Herzog’s scope but also depicts “ a love story about Germany and Russia .” For fun: At last, a beaver emoji .

William Barr Is a Different Kind of Trump Surrogate,slate.com,Lili Loofbourow,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-donald-trump-calm-defense.html,"How Are We Supposed to Understand Brett Kavanaugh Now? Given his tendency to employ the colorful over the competent, it’s slightly surprising that Donald Trump’s taste in attorneys general has bypassed loudmouths like Rudy Giuliani in favor of small, precise men. Both Jeff Sessions and William Barr are notable for their unintimidating demeanor and for the skill with which they couch extreme ideology in the garb of conventional, calm lawyering. Perhaps this is the kind of person the president believes will accept his documented efforts to dictate terms to the Department of Justice. Or maybe his tendency to view the attorney general as his own personal lawyer, rather than America’s top law enforcement officer, led him to choose a type he thought he could dominate. It’s no secret that Trump considered Sessions’ decision to recuse himself from the Mueller probe—ethically, the bare minimum—a personal betrayal. (Trump felt the attorney general should have protected him, and Sessions’ failure to do so is one reason he’s no longer in the role.) In Barr, Trump has found an attorney general with hoary Republican bona fides who accepts Trump’s view and has developed a theory according to which Trump’s feelings not only matter more than the law, but should dictate it. Barr’s ideology is a fit, and so—for a TV president who prizes style over substance—is his stagecraft. Barr has developed a theory according to which Trump’s feelings not only matter more than the law, but should dictate it. Though stolid and undramatic, William Barr has proven himself an eager finger-pointer (singling out Rod Rosenstein, Robert Mueller, the media, and Trump’s opponents for particular blame) and an able advocate for the agitated president. That’s not his role, of course—or it shouldn’t be—but Barr keeps slipping into outright advocacy for the man he was theoretically supposed to consider indicting. Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to answer questions about the Mueller report, Barr made his allegiances obvious. Asked about Trump’s remarks excoriating people who “flip” on the wrongdoers above them, Barr took the remarkable step of ventriloquizing the president’s defense. “I think what the president’s lawyers would say,” he said (as if he weren’t acting as one), “is that the president’s statements about flipping are quite clear and express and uniformly the same, which is by ‘flipping,’ he meant succumbing to pressure on unrelated cases to lie and compose in order to get lenient treatment.” (Carried away by this role-playing, Barr would eventually go on to ventriloquize not only Trump’s lawyers, but Trump himself.) Barr isn’t only there to translate Trump’s mafia-speak into legitimate legalese. The attorney general, who has a long history of doing all he can to maximize executive power, appears to be on a mission to make presidents even more legally untouchable than they already are. His strategy isn’t confrontational; it’s staid in ways that camouflage the extraordinary deference he’s showing to the president’s moods. Barr has already argued that making a determination of corrupt intent requires a deep and sympathetic study of the president’s grievances. He accordingly channels the president’s sulks just as he explains his slang: Barr explained Trump was “frustrated and angered” by public concern that he might have done questionable things against the national interest—like invite the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails , hire a compromised foreign agent as national security adviser , or give sensitive Israeli intelligence to the Russians. Barr’s calculus accords the president’s frustration so much legal weight that Trump’s “witch hunts” and “Angry Democrats” and dangled pardons and attempted firings of the special counsel are, all things considered, more than reasonable. By contrast, he characterizes public alarm over the aforementioned activities as not only unreasonable but evidence of how unfairly the president has been treated . “As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates,” Barr explained while defending the president’s outrage in his press conference before releasing the Mueller report. “At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president’s personal culpability.” If Barr extends to the president a therapist’s compassion, he seems to find Mueller, his longtime friend and colleague, both incomprehensible and incorrect. “I’m not really sure of his reasoning,” Barr said when he was asked whether he agreed with Mueller’s reasons, outlined in his report, for not offering a definite pronouncement on whether prosecution was appropriate. “I really could not recapitulate his analysis, which is one of the reasons in my March 24 letter I simply stated the fact that he did not reach a conclusion and didn’t try to put words in his mouth.” To sum up: Barr not only refused to publish the summaries Mueller himself wrote for the public, but he also wrote up such a misleading summary that the famously taciturn special counsel formally objected, asking again that his own summaries be released. And then , having substituted his own text for Mueller’s, Barr demurely suggested he hadn’t wanted to put words in Mueller’s mouth. This priggish sleight of hand is Barr’s wheelhouse. He launders impropriety with a functionary’s demeanor and a spin doctor’s acumen. In Wednesday’s hearing, Barr’s professional reserve became a kind of smoke screen for repeated swipes at the special counsel. He suggested, for instance, that Mueller should have “pulled up” (whatever that means) if he thought he wasn’t in a position to pronounce: “I think that if he felt that he shouldn’t go down the path of making a traditional prosecutive decision, he shouldn’t have. That was the time to pull up.” This curious statement omits Mueller’s clear explanation that his decision not to charge was not because prosecution wasn’t appropriate, but because it wasn’t up to him to make the next move. The next move, Mueller clearly notes, is up to Congress. Barr disagrees with this. “I’m the captain,” he said of the report. “This is my baby.” Barr’s composure was an inverse function of the legal acrobatics he was attempting. That phrasing was pretty weird, but on the whole, Barr’s conduct was calm, courteous, and slightly condescending. It was professional and meant to reassure. He framed extraordinary claims as if they were simple common sense, peppering his remarks with obviously s and looking for all the world like the put-upon bureaucrat. He would not concede that the president’s conduct was concerning or wrong or unbefitting, repeatedly insisting that it was “constitutional.” He characterized concerns about Russian efforts to compromise Trump’s campaign as overblown while noting that the phenomenon of foreign governments targeting Americans is rather commonplace, even generic. Under duress, he admitted that a presidential campaign should call the FBI if thus approached, but seemed unwilling to condemn or even disapprove of Trump’s campaign for failing to do so. Even Barr’s petty moments were muted. Yes, he called Mueller’s letter “snitty,” but spared Mueller the insult by proposing that someone else had written it. (This sly little suggestion does double work, of course: It supports his earlier claim that he didn’t know what Mueller thought. Anyone on his staff might have written that letter!) When Sen. Richard Blumenthal observed that Mueller’s letter was a truly exceptional intervention—“an extraordinary act, a career prosecutor rebuking the attorney general of the United States, memorializing it in writing, right? I know of no other instance of that happening”—a nettled Barr replied pedantically: “Well, I don’t consider Bob at this stage a career prosecutor. He’s had a career as a prosecutor.” This level of self-control, unusual in Trump’s circles, has advantages. Barr’s composure was an inverse function of the legal acrobatics he was attempting: He posits, for instance, that the investigation was illegitimate because the president wasn’t indicted. It follows that obstruction is impossible! Since Mueller didn’t pronounce on the president’s criminality, anything the president did to stop the inquiry was fair (Barr likes the phrase “the exercise of his constitutional duties”). This is the kind of wackadoodle argument one has to read several times through in order to absorb its astonishing implications; it seems to suggest that law enforcement may only pursue inquiries it knows to be true while ignoring that the pursuit is how we discover truth. This legal theory of time travel is presented as sensible and self-evident. It’s boring to blame our reality TV president for nudging the government toward reality TV shenanigans, but we work with the gifts we have. Inflammatory theatrics are Trump’s one proven skill—he likes to say his picks are “straight out of central casting.” He’s not wrong: They have tended to be larger-than-life and unconcerned about things like respectability (Anthony Scaramucci, Steve Bannon, Omarosa). Even Trump acolytes who care about such things—like Brett Kavanaugh, or the Lindsey Graham of yore—have sacrificed their probity to put on the kind of big angry show Trump loves. But in William Barr, Trump has found a new sort of character, to fill a new sort of need. Reality TV is famously scripted to maximize drama. The fights and tantrums tend to work if you squint, even if you know they’re manufactured. They attract an audience. But depending on what you’re going for, sometimes you don’t want too much attention. If you want a clean way to make the really giant twists seem boring, even routine, what you need is a drama minimizer: someone who can pass off chaos as bureaucracy. Or obstruction as constitutional duty. Or one man’s feelings as American law. For that, Donald Trump has William Barr. Support our journalism

My Husband Secretly Loves Bisexual Porn. Does That Mean He’s Into Guys?,slate.com,Stoya and Rich Juzwiak,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/husband-likes-bisexual-gay-porn-sex-advice.html,"I Think of Truly, Truly Terrible Things to Climax During Sex Dear How to Do It, My husband and I have been married for 16 years. We have sex about once a month, after kids and lots of life stuff, and that’s fine for me. I think he’d like a little more, but he’s seemed OK with our current pace. I know he masturbates pretty frequently—he goes to a particular room, and I know what’s up—but I try to respect his privacy. Recently, I was cleaning in that particular room and I brushed his laptop, which was not password-protected. You probably know where this is going: He had left some porn up on the screen. The thing is, it was bisexual porn. And the guys were definitely the focal point of this particular one from what I could tell. I was sort of shocked and I only looked for a second before I shut the laptop and left the room. My husband has never mentioned a sexual interest in men in any way, and I never would have guessed he might have one. This ate at me for a couple weeks before I finally mentioned it to him in a clumsy way. He turned bright-red and said it was just porn, nothing more. I should have let it go, but I pressed, and he eventually said he prefers bisexual porn but would never want to try anything with a guy in person. I asked him if he would if I gave him my blessing. He seemed super flustered and said he didn’t know. He denied he’s bisexual and said it’s just curiosity, but I could tell he was a little unsure. He seemed happy to change the subject and I finally let it go, but I feel really uneasy about what I found out. He would die before talking about this with a couples’ therapist. I also have no idea if I’d be OK with letting him explore, but I definitely can’t just forget about this. What should I do? —Not Snooping Stoya : So, some fantasies are just fantasies. Sometimes people fantasize about things they would never want to actually happen. Rich : Yeah, and porn can kind of tease out those very fantasies but also keep them at bay. Stoya : That too. Rich : Could it be possible that the fact it is so distant is what makes it hot? Like, it’s hot precisely because it’s so removed from his experience? Stoya : Definitely possible. Rich : All of which is to say, this isn’t necessarily a sounding of the alarm.Maybehe’s just bored with the aesthetics of straight porn and wanted to branch out. Plenty of straight women are into gay porn, which depicts scenarios that they are excluded from by definition. Stoya : Absolutely. Or he could want to kiss another dude, on the penis. Rich : He very well might. One thing that I have to say, even if it’s ultimately immaterial, is that I don’t believe this instance of porn discovery was as innocent as the letter writer makes it out to be. “I was cleaning in that particular room and I brushed his laptop.” Please. I think she was snooping. That’s probably neither here nor there, but let’s not bullshit a bullshitter. Stoya : Sometimes, I think I take our letters at face value too often. Rich : It’s because you’re pure of heart. I’m the cynic. Stoya : It’s good to have roles. Porn-watching habits are not statements of a desire to act. Rich : It’s true. But maybe, ya know, it’s worth acknowledging that there may be a violation of privacy afoot. A minor one. Ideally, these things would be out in the open in a relationship, so I also kind of feel like as long as it isn’t devastating, whatever it takes to get to the truth is ultimately OK. Stoya : Yeah, I was mostly thinking how sad it is that they can’t just, like, talk about this. Rich : I felt for the guy. He seemed really shaken—and this is from her perspective. Stoya : He might be dealing with a lot of shame or fear. Rich : For sure. I know that this is not a fashionable thing to say and could be contradicted with a man cave full of counterexamples, but it’s hard for straight guys in some ways. “Straight” is such a narrow path for a lot of guys, and deviating from it means calling into question your entire identity. This kind of thing can be worldview-altering. Stoya : I’m wondering if there are ways that our writer can be cautious with her husband while satisfying her own need to address this further. Rich : Like if she put on bisexual porn for their next sex session? A way to kind of illustrate her acceptance? Stoya : That might be the worst option! I’m imagining the guy turning into an actual turtle and retracting his head into his upper chest out of embarrassment. But at the end she says she definitely can’t just forget about this. Which leads me to believe she’s going to want to address his taste for bisexual porn again in the future. Rich : Right. So how to do that delicately? Stoya : Displays of acceptance might be part of that, but I think she should proceed slowly. Rich : Yes, and you know, this is still recent, so he’s still getting used to the idea of someone knowing his secret. So maybe his wife’s discovery didn’t yield an immediate exhale moment, but that could be coming as he becomes more comfortable with what all of this means. Which is to say that these conversations could go better in the future. Maybe a good way to approach this is for her to make herself available to talk about this without pushing. Ask him if he’s comfortable talking about it, instead of staging a confrontation every time. Stoya : Or sharing some of her own undisclosed sexual interests if she has any. Sometimes that kind of vulnerability goes a long way to putting a partner at ease. Rich : That’s a great point. Does she have any bi-curiosity herself? Stoya : An interest in toes? A desire for latex? Rich : It would be useful to really understand his sexuality. If he is indeed bi, then in theory this poses about as much threat as if he were into redheads but married a brunette. Just another element of his taste palate, you know? Stoya : Totally. There’s no reason to panic, and porn-watching habits are not statements of a desire to act. Rich : But ideally, as the letter writer hints, he’d be allowed to explore this if he were really interested in it. I know it’s a big ask, but life is short. Seems a waste to go through it wanting but never getting your hands on some dick. Stoya : I think she could do some thinking on what she would need to feel comfortable. Boundaries about sleepovers? No green boxer shorts? Or, you know, deep conversations about what “ fluid bonding ” means so she’s prepared in case he does want to explore and expresses that? Rich : Yes. It’s a big idea to get used to. I totally understand why people use monogamy as a security blanket, but allowing him to experience this sex he’s potentially interested in and presumably never has had would be a great gift to him. Stoya : She might find she enjoys compersion. Rich : Yes—and/or participating. Stoya : Ooooh, yes, that too. I think, just remember their love and trust for each other, nurture that, and be careful with each other if they decide to explore. Rich : I agree. If these conversations instill a sense of fear in him, there’s a good chance he’ll have a fight-or-flight response and then they’ll be no further along than they were in the first place. Stoya : Definitely. So use plenty of caution and be gentle."

Palantir Said It Had Nothing to Do With ICE Deportations. New Documents Seem to Tell a Different Story.,slate.com,April Glaser,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/documents-reveal-palantir-software-is-used-for-ice-deportations.html,"The Surprising Way Bodycams Can Keep Police Officers From Helping People Palantir Technologies, the $20 billion data-analytics firm founded by Peter Thiel with the help of $2 million from the CIA’s venture capital firm, has never been shy about its work with governments and law enforcement. But in December, when it was reported that the company renewed a $38 million contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Palantir sent a statement to the New York Times that appeared to distance the company from the Trump administration’s detention, deportation, and family-separation policies. Palantir stressed that it works with the Homeland Security Investigations unit of ICE, not Enforcement and Removal Operations, which “is responsible for interior civil immigration enforcement, including deportation and detention of undocumented immigrants,” the statement read. “We do not work for E.R.O.” That might be the case, but a close read of recently released ICE documents reveals that Palantir has been far more involved with the detention and deportation functions than previously implied. The May 2017 documents, which were obtained through Freedom of Information Act litigation led by the American Immigration Council in partnership with other immigrant rights groups and published last week in the Intercept , come from the Homeland Security Investigations unit. One particular seven-page report, titled “Unaccompanied Alien Children Human Smuggling Disruption Initiative,” explains the formation of a 90- to 120-day program targeting smugglers who help unaccompanied minors cross the border into the United States. The document outlines a plan for “identification, investigation, and arrest of human smuggling facilitators, including, but not limited to, parents and family members.” Once an unaccompanied minor is located by an ICE investigation agent, the document instructs the agent to log the “arrival in the Investigative Case Management (ICM) system.” The advocacy group Mijiente, which has been tracking Palantir and other tech companies’ ties to ICE, found the name of the Palantir software in the document, which it described in a blog post Thursday. ICM is a system built by Palantir, funded initially by a $41 million contract with ICE in 2014. With the ICM system, immigration agents are provided access to intelligence from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and other law enforcement agencies, in addition to information like a subject’s criminal record and work history. “When an unaccompanied minor comes to the U.S. and goes to a shelter, various departments help find a sponsor for the child to take them out of custody and allow them to do be united with their families,”Mijente’s Jacinta Gonzalez told me in an interview. Previously, immigrants would be able to come forward and claim their child, be reunited, and then go through the immigration process. But under the program listed in the documents, ICE appears to have been conducting background checks on parents claiming children. This, according to Gonzalez, deters family members from claiming children, which has caused them to be detained for longer periods of time. “What these documents show is that as ICE was starting this program to try to prosecute and arrest people, and the key place where that information was stored and communicated to be able to prosecute them was through the ICM and Palantir’s information sharing,” says Gonzalez. According to the ICE documents, after an unaccompanied child is apprehended, law enforcement border teams are instructed to check their database and contact suspected family members or sponsors. If applicable, the documents instruct agents to then “seek charges against the individual(s) and administratively arrest the subjects and anybody encountered during the inquiry who is out of status.” A 2017 letter from a coalition of immigrant rights groups to oversight officials at the Department of Homeland Security detailed how ICE and Customs and Border Control “are using unaccompanied child asylum seekers as bait to prosecute and deport their parents.” In a statement provided to the Intercept last week, ICE said that in the course of the operation, 443 people without documentation were arrested. Only 35 of those arrests were due to criminal activity. While the specific program detailed in the documents that describe how children crossing the border were used to arrest their family members appears to not be ongoing, the process of verifying the immigration status of sponsors is still active, according to Gonzalez. The Investigative Case Management software is not limited to identifying families of unaccompanied minors. The Palantir software is used in range of investigations with DHS and ICE, providing agents with the ability to search across government databases, according to a 2017 report in the Intercept. Palantir did not respond to a request for comment. Over the past year, tech workers across the U.S. have been calling on their employers to sever ties with Immigration and Custom Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol. Last summer, hundreds of Microsoft employees called on CEO Satya Nadella to end the company’s contract with ICE. Hundreds of Salesforce employees likewise last summer called on CEO Mark Benioff to cancel the company’s contract with CPB. This led the CEOs of both companies to make statements about how they don’t support the separation of families at the border. But Palantir, which owes its existence to government investment, is a different breed of tech company. As CEO Alex Karp has said , Palantir is “proud that we’re working with the U.S. government.” Support our journalism

Baltimore’s Mayor Is Brought Down by a Series of Self-Published Children’s Books,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/baltimores-mayor-pugh-is-brought-down-by-a-series-of-self-published-childrens-books.html,"Trump Changes His Mind, Says Mueller Shouldn’t Testify Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh’s bizarre tenure in office came to an end Thursday, when she resigned amid a cloud of scandal and scrutiny over, of all things, a self-published series of children’s books. Scandal erupted in March when the Baltimore Sun reported that the sale of Pugh’s “Healthy Holly” books raised serious ethical and legal questions. The books themselves are harmless, featuring a young black protagonist Holly and positive themes of healthy eating and exercise, but it’s the whopping $700,000 the series netted Pugh that caused problems. In the six weeks since the story broke, the 69-year-old Democrat has faced raids of her home and City Hall office, and has taken an extended leave of absence from office as the stories of apparent impropriety continued to pile up. The number of copies sold by Pugh is a staggering haul for 99 percent of authors, much less a self-published one, where sales can often range in the hundreds to low thousands. The extraordinary success of the books authored by someone holding public office raised questions about who, exactly, was buying the books—and why. It turns out the books were bought in large chunks by entities that had business before the government that Pugh had influence over—first in the statehouse and then in the mayor’s office. The University of Maryland Medical System, for instance, paid Pugh $500,000 for an order of 100,000 books. The order was filled in installments of 20,000 beginning in 2011. “Joseph Cohen, vice president of Kromar Printing in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said his company was paid between $13,000 and $15,000 for each of the 20,000-book orders it completed,” the Washington Post reports . That means Pugh was clearing close to $85,000 per batch of books depending on shipping and other associated costs. At the time, Push was a state senator and also on the hospital network’s board. In the statehouse, Pugh was on a committee that provided some funding to the hospital network. Kaiser Permanente also paid Pugh, who was elected mayor in 2016, more than $100,000 for another 20,000 copies. In 2017, the health care provider landed a $48 million contract with the city of Baltimore. The Associated Black Charities ponied up another $80,000 for 10,000 copies. With federal and state investigations digging deeper into the financial mess, Pugh submitted her resignation Thursday. “I am sorry for the harm I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and the credibility of the office of the mayor,” she said in the statement. “Baltimore deserves a mayor that can move our great city forward.”"

How bodycams affected one former police officer’s job.,slate.com,Katie Miller,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/body-worn-cameras-police-officers-discretion.html,"The Decadelong Humiliation of Runner Caster Semenya It was a routine traffic stop. A Subaru Forester blew past a stop sign in northwest D.C., and I pulled it over. But the driver, a middle-aged woman with an infant in the back seat, seemed shifty. “Good afternoon, ma’am. My name is Officer Miller. May I please see your license, registration, and proof of insurance?” “I don’t have my license on me,” she blurted. “No problem.” I pulled my notebook and pen out of my back pocket and handed it to her. “I can look your license up in the system. Please write down your name and date of birth.” The driver didn’t reach for my notebook. Instead, she reached for her purse and said, “I’m sorry. I just lied to you.” She handed me her license—two years expired. I was supposed to arrest her. I looked at the grocery bags on the floor and then the child, wide-eyed, my red and blue lights splashing across his hairless head. Violating protocol, I asked the woman to park the car and call a friend to pick her up. In five minutes, she was gone. That traffic stop took place at the tail end of 2015. I couldn’t have gotten away with that decision today. I didn’t know it then, but the era of “nothing to see here” and “keep it moving, folks” was coming to an end. A year earlier, Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri. Amid calls for increased police accountability, a prominent reform that took root was body-worn cameras for officers. Not long after that traffic stop, I was wearing one too. Seemingly overnight, keeping my job meant doing everything by the book. At first, I loved it—the impartial third party affixed to my chest. I could review video when I forgot something a witness told me, letting me include extra details in my reports at the end of the shift. The footage squashed false complaints at a time when it felt like everybody hated the police. I watched my colleagues speak more respectfully to citizens and fellow officers. But the new system wasn’t without its downsides. My footage was subject to review by my supervisors, who could punish violations of our general orders, no matter how petty. Body cameras provided a piece of evidence shown to judges, juries, and, of course, defense attorneys, who could now pick apart both my recorded voice and my testimony at trial. And it was a public record the mayor sometimes released to local news outlets when there was a use-of-force incident. Seemingly overnight, keeping my job meant doing everything by the book. And seemingly overnight, the technology proliferated. Before Ferguson, there were only a couple dozen police departments piloting body-worn cameras. Today, half of the country’s 18,000 police departments have them. The change was sweeping, and it was fast. Part of this is because the perceived benefits of body-worn cameras are obvious—citizens and officers behave better in the presence of a camera. Yet studies do not present a clear picture of their effectiveness. According to some , a bodycam program is correlated with a reduction in civilian complaints against officers as well as use-of-force incidents. But a study conducted on the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, where I worked, found no meaningful change at all in these statistics.* Regardless of their broader efficacy, my colleagues and I adapted our behavior to preserve our relationship with members of the community, even as body cameras forced an unfamiliar formality with them. Gone were the days of being able to tell a mom to park her Subaru. I made fewer traffic stops. I spent less time patrolling on foot. If I discovered a homeless person urinating in public, the video forced me to fine him, arrest him, or violate general orders by not recording the interaction. I used to pop into a market on New Hampshire Avenue and holler at Mike, the owner, who gave me the latest news from the block. Technically, I should have pressed “record” the moment he indicated there was criminal activity underfoot, like people blocking the sidewalk in front of his business. For fans of The Wire , a television show about politics, police, and crime in Baltimore, my dilemma may ring familiar. In most American cities, it’s unlawful to consume alcohol in public—an ordinance that burdens both the police who have to enforce it and people in low-income neighborhoods, where the addicted and unemployed sit on stoops and at street corners, passing Mad Dog 20/20 or Colt 45 back and forth. Thus, an official explained in one episode , drinking from a brown paper bag came to be a gentlemen’s agreement. By concealing the beverage, police weren’t obligated to address it and folks could enjoy their beverages on a hot summer day without interruption. It didn’t make drinking in public lawful; it provided a workaround for police and citizens who agreed it was frivolous. Body-worn cameras had the reverse impact of the brown paper bag. Whereas the brown bag gave officers permission to look the other way, the body-worn camera was a third party making certain we didn’t. So, bodycams may have made it easier to hold bad cops accountable for their actions, but they also have the effect of holding citizens strictly accountable for theirs. I did what I could to preserve community policing, but when I was called to people’s homes for family disputes, it was particularly challenging. Often, I found, people call police because they want someone to listen to them. They don’t necessarily want anybody locked up. They’re inviting a third party to a matter that overwhelms them. I found this most common with single mothers dealing with rebellious children. Before body-worn cameras, I was happy to listen fully to their account of events, describe civil and criminal recourses, and take their preferences into account when deciding whether an arrest was prudent. If a mother told me her child had broken something of hers in a heated argument, we could talk candidly about her safety and whether a police intervention was the best strategy to address the problem Since the adoption of body cameras, the law is the law. If a person described being the victim of a crime while I was interviewing them, I was obligated to take police action. I once interrupted a mother who called 911 on her son, pointed to the camera on my chest, and said, “If you’re about to report a crime, we have a duty to apply for a warrant for his arrest.” Her son was a young man of color without a criminal history. She was unharmed but frustrated. And there was a hole in the drywall that could have been punched in. Whether it became evidence that her son committed a crime was entirely dependent upon what she chose to say next. She nodded, suppressing the mouthful she had rehearsed before I had even arrived, understanding the discretion I had given her. We stood looking at one another for a moment—the two of us, skirting a system. Even if the benefits of body-worn cameras are disputed , the technology is likely here to stay. Once they are outfitted with them, police officers generally believe the pros outweigh the cons. Citizens are supportive of them. Though it made community policing more difficult for me, with clever communication, I could work around it—I could build the trust that it, ironically, was intended to foster. That’s because I’m confident good cops will always find a way to be good cops. And as much as I hope it spells change for the bad apples, that conclusion is far from foregone. As I wrapped up on the scene with the mother who called 911, I asked, “Is there anything else I can do for you, ma’am?” She said, “No, I guess not.” As I turned to leave, she went out of her way to add, “Thank you.” My department’s motto was: “We are here to help.” When I left the department last year, it struck me how much harder that mission had become.

Already a member? Sign in here. Danny: yeah the LW seems a little bit … blasé about that? Nicole: He seems lax, not abusive Danny: “if we had the kids six days a week instead of three, i’d end it” Nicole: which is a lot easier to work with And if having a big difficult convo doesn’t work, marriage definitely won’t Also, have you attempted to talk about if/how YOU are allowed to be a less lax person in their lives? Signing up to be the bitch doesn’t sound great either Danny: right! my take is that she’s erred on the side of just staying totally uninvolved for fear of seeming like she’s putting her oar in or trying to take the place of the kids’ mom but if you have lived together for over a year and plan on getting married, you definitely have a stake in this family you’re, if not a parent, at least part of a co-parenting team, right? Nicole: Right! The living together for over a year thing AND the impending wedding seem like this is the perfect opportunity to say “hey, let’s talk about my role as a parental figure, and also our philosophy around raising kids.” Danny: yes! and that’s exactly the tone you should take Nicole: which everyone should do before marrying ANYONE if they plan on having kids Danny: yes! and I hadn’t even considered the question of whether or not the LW wants to have kids with her fiancé so that’s also worth talking about first especially because she doesn’t really say anything about the kids besides “they’re not disciplined enough” Nicole: Right! No particular affection Danny: which definitely sounds TRUE, but also makes me worry she hasn’t been able to develop her own relationship with them, even if it’s just of the sort of “friendly aunt-like person” variety Nicole: She says she loves them, but it’s not coming off super warm here Right Danny: I would say do not get married unless and until you feel reasonably confident that you and your husband are at least on the same chapter, if not the same exact page, about child-rearing together and if you’re still feeling like “things are fine but ONLY because the kids spend half the week somewhere else, if we had to take them on full-time i’d end it” I think you should not marry him! that feels like a big enough qualification that you would be signing up for a lifetime of likely frustration and alienated affection Nicole: Yep. Process it to the ground, get everything on the table, and make it an absolute must for marriage Danny: right! and you don’t have to make it a DEMAND just acknowledge you’ve both left this pretty big issue mostly unaddressed so far Nicole: This is a v logical step Danny: and it’s time to figure out how to become a parenting team, not just a couple and also maybe find ways to spend a little one-on-one time with both your stepkids so you have a sense of what they’re like and what kind of relationship you can establish with them Nicole: And, if the convo is good, that convo should expand to include the kids a bit 3 and 7 are super young, but if things are going to change, prepare them for it Danny: yeah that is part of why I wanted your read here—what kind of discipline is (broadly) appropriate for 3-year-olds? Nicole: Yes! timeouts, basically Danny: like, i picture a lot of careful explaining and like “here are your two options: do you want to brush your teeth first or put on your jammies first?” kind of stuff Nicole: Natural consequences if they’re safe Yep, that’s pretty much how it goes! Danny: and maybe your stepkids’ mom could potentially be helpful here? assuming you have a cordial relationship which is maybe assuming too much Nicole: There is a lot of missing detail here in general, I fear Danny: that’s never stopped me from filling in all the detail myself with wildly confident brush strokes! a reader: three sentences, bare Nicole: Lolo possibly they are Russian spies! Danny: me, a master of interpolation, shading, and chiaroscuro: yes … like me you had your heart broken by a british stranger in 2003, then again in 2005 … you never stick to what’s on your grocery list … you are full of secret contempt for others you disguise as affableness etc etc"
"With Smarter Living, the NYT is making an old bet on service journalism.",slate.com,Shannon Palus,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/nyt-smarter-living-section-service-journalism-financial-bet.html,"Hate-Filled Letter Posted Online Claims to Be From Synagogue Shooting Suspect I have been thinking a lot about what to say no to in my life. Second dates with people who are just fine, a new maxi dress that is cute but expensive, and a day hike that would take longer to travel to than to do have all gotten the boot as of late. That’s thanks to the words, “if it’s not a ‘hell yeah,’ it’s a ‘no,’ ” which have been stuck in my mind like they’re on a Post-It Note. The quote is from entrepreneur Derek Sivers , but it didn’t come to me via his book “Anything You Want,” nor did I hear in one of his advice videos or on a “Monday Motivation” edition of a podcast , or even on Pinterest . Those are all places it’s appeared, but I first read it in the New York Times—and not in an interview about Sivers’ company, but in an earnest newsletter entry about how to make decisions. The newsletter also references a study suggesting that many people who perceive themselves as too assertive are not perceived that way by others, to assure readers that if they do opt for “no’s” they probably won’t come across as assholes. The self-help-y soundbite might seem unusual for the paper of record, but it’s part of a strategy that’s proven successful. The New York Times has been on a bit of a hot streak financially speaking , a trend that has been at least partly attributed to the boost in digital subscribers in the months after Donald Trump’s election . While the “Trump Bump” leveled off midway through 2017, the paper’s subscription base has continued to grow, in part thanks to growing initiatives in lifestyle-oriented areas, including Smarter Living—the Times’ central hub of how-to’s, which includes the newsletter where I found advice on how and when to say no. The section does very well: Its weekly newsletter has 360,000 subscribers and is opened by a vast majority of those people (80 percent), Digiday reported in June of last year. A full third of the most saved articles on the paper’s app so far that year were Smarter Living stories. Spend a couple hours reading these Smarter Living originals, and the world becomes a series of problems and answers of varying levels of helpfulness. Jealous? Here’s how to get around it . Anxious? “ Talk therapy is rarely a bad thing ,” says a source. Biking in the winter? Here are five cheap(ish) things you can buy. Some of the advice is strikingly pat. Want to live like a successful entrepreneur? Wake up at 6:27 a.m . each morning. Need to “ save a few bucks ”? “Cut out nonsocial eating out.” Wondering how to cope with emotional downs of participating in a capitalist economy? Build a failure resume ! Some of it is surprisingly useful, deep dives into corners of the world that most of us experience, but rarely think about so carefully. Headed to a party? Here is a long packet of information on how to speak to people. Which is all to say: It’s service journalism—reported advice that basically attempts to help you live your best life. This has long been a staple of women’s magazines, BuzzFeed listicles, and WebMD. What’s it doing alongside in-depth, nuanced, and newsy reporting? In part, it’s keeping the Times afloat. Smarter Living evolved out of a bid for both money and clicks, part of the paper’s strategy to double digital revenue to total $800 million by 2020, as WWD notes . That strategy includes other advice services like Cooking , Wirecutter (disclosure: my former employer), and a new parenting section , none of which are primarily news-based. The Smarter Living vertical began as a “module on the homepage” in the summer of 2016, WWD reported , serving as a magnet for the service journalism that was already appearing elsewhere in the Times. The landing page still pulls much of its advice from other sections, like the magazine , Food and Drink , and Style . But today, Smarter Living has also evolved into wholly original content, including a weekly newsletter, helmed by Tim Herrera, an editor with a background in social media and growth, a chatty and informal voice, and a cabal of staffers and freelancers. (In a piece for Nieman Lab, Herrera said that he gets between a dozen and 200 cold pitches per day.) This has long been a staple of women’s magazines, BuzzFeed listicles, and WebMD. What’s it doing alongside in-depth, nuanced, and newsy reporting? As it gets harder and harder to make money in media (and some of those service-journalism staples shutter ), building a how-to station inside of the Times makes sense. Combined with money-earning affiliate links on any advice that involves making a purchase (a strategy that many digital publishers, including Slate, have recently deployed) this type of journalism is almost always apolitical, caters to a universal logic, and rarely digs into profound quandaries that could alienate readers. As Digiday notes , this makes it a safe option for advertisers. At the same time, there’s nothing that new about supplementing the Times’ hard-hitting reporting with lighter fare. In the late ’70s, the paper launched a Living section, and then a Home section, which it framed in similar terms to today’s forays: “The Times wants its own to be unique, to have the best graphics, to be the most informative, serviceable and innovative and above all, the liveliest,” said publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger at the time. “Our aim is to create an authoritative voice—the way we have tried to do in other critical fields, such as theater, architecture, music, ballet, art and food.” The authoritative voice in the ’70s was similar to today’s Smarter Living—it was primarily occupied with the minutia of self-improvement. In digging through the archives to read a recurring feature called “Home Clinic,” I learn the life hack of turning down your thermostat during the day to save energy , and a tip on how to remove a broken bulb from its socket ( use a bar of soap !). In a June 22, 1977 edition of the Living section, I read about a new trend: Fresh vegetables are suddenly “in” and can be found at farmers markets. There’s a column with questions about cooking, including such small queries as where to find “corn flour” (it’s just the British word for “cornstarch”). There’s even the kind of commerce fare that I’d previously figured was spurred by the world of online shopping and affiliate links: a list ( listicle , if you will) ranking food processors based on some light testing, and a chart comparing the merits of various store credit cards. Food processors from the 1970s are not relevant to my life, but reading about them invokes in me a similar feeling to reading service journalism today: It’s comforting, akin to staring into a well-organized closet. That there is a correct way to do something as mundane as unscrewing the jagged remains of a lightbulb or as becoming an extrovert at parties is comforting, even if it won’t always work as seamlessly as advertised. This strategy for luring readers, as a report on the paper’s future published in 2017 noted, “succeeded brilliantly.” Which is why the paper is trying to replicate it now, in the digital age. While the particulars of consumer tech and home thermostats have certainly evolved—today you’ll be advised to get a smart thermostat—the ever-enduring readership for more instructions, more recipes, more tips and quotes, even if they are sometimes re-runs, reveals just how reliable telling readers the correct way to do things can be."
Choosing restaurants from the outside: tips from restauranteurs.,slate.com,Chason Gordon,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/choosing-restaurant-street-tips-food-experts.html,"You Can Hate Sarah Michelle Gellar’s “Mug Cakes” All You Like. I’ll Eat Them. Standing face to façade with a restaurant while deciding whether to commit is the speed dating of the food world. The eatery’s sign flickers at us hopefully, trying to grab our attention without desperately saying, “If you ate here, you’d be full by now.” The menu tries a little sweet talk—promising “house made” dishes “grilled to perfection” and “drizzled” with something that came from a nearby farm, they swear. And the ambiance does everything in its power to convince us through the window that here, in this comfortable, flatteringly lit assortment of tables and chairs, we’ll eat a good meal—if only we’d just come inside. We suitors, on the other side of things, have our own prejudices regarding the dance of culinary seduction. Many look for flowery menus and rustic buildings filled with happy, eating people; the brazen may even step just inside to examine the atmosphere more fully, scanning coldly past the humanity of the host to spy, ideally, our double sitting at a table. I find myself spouting off overconfident reasons why a restaurant looks good to my very patient friends. “That place serves teriyaki and burgers,” I announce. “The burgers will be terrible.” Or, “Ooh, it has a flora of restaurant guide stickers on the window. That must be tasty.” Big lines, cool lighting, an ethnic restaurant that actually has people of that ethnicity eating there—there are numerous signals many of us look out for. But are any of these tactics actually effective? Is there a hard and fast way to avoid spending your evening angrily eating a bad meal? I took up the question with some restauranteurs, because they own the joints and can see past many of the contrivances that lure the uninitiated (like me). Overall, they recommend seeking a consistent authenticity and clarity of vision that begins in the kitchen and reverberates throughout every element of the restaurant, from a genuine ambiance to the menu’s earnestness to the building’s character and where it’s located. “Does the place look like it fits where it is? Does it look like effort was put into the design and setup?” asks chef Ethan Stowell, the James Beard nominee behind How to Cook a Wolf and numerous Seattle restaurants. “When you’re dealing with a place that feels good and is designed to make the customers feel the way the menu makes them feel, that’s great.” Telling whether a human being is genuine is hard enough; it’s even more difficult when it’s an inanimate object like a building. Ideally, you want an exterior and ambiance that reflects the tone of the menu—barbecue in a joint designed around the smoker, historic-looking buildings for authentic Old World food—and a place with personality that looks like the owners care, but without trying too hard. Stowell explains: “If everything is sleek chairs and polished white and super flashy, that’s different to me than having a rustic off-white finish with marble countertops and some ceramic pots around that make it feel a bit more homey.” Different, in that the former ambiance is adopting every inauthentic design cliché, which bespeaks a lack of creativity and care that could translate into the food itself. Beware of Edison lightbulbs. That line between unaffected effort and forcing it is difficult to negotiate, but for Stowell it’s even visible in the name. “There’s creative, and then there’s going too far,” he says. “And there’s just something like Luigi’s Italian Palace. Really, is it a palace? Is there even a guy named Luigi? That’s too stereotypical.” A good name can convey the vibe one might be looking for and intrigue with originality. Like the name Chason, for instance: Clearly, I’m a great guy. (What?) “If you’re everything for everybody you’re usually nothing for nobody.” — Ethan Stowell Past the sign and through the window, it would be helpful if a random customer rubbed their belly and beckoned you in, but a better indicator is seeing the actual food being prepared. Sometimes a visible kitchen illustrates freshness and openness, a “sliver of that world that you see from outside of the street, and what are you showing the public as a restaurateur,” says owner Kathy Sidell of the Saltie Girl and the MET Bar restaurants in Boston. “If you see yummy stuff in the window, you’re going in.” Stowell is a fan of this in Seattle spots as well. “You go to Spinasse and they’re making the pasta right in the window, they’re slicing the prosciutto right there on a meat slicer,” he says. “At Din Tai Fung they’re making the dumplings in the window. All that kind of theater stuff is good.” It’s not that eateries without visible kitchens are necessarily lacking, but the more a restaurant is willing to show, the easier it is to assess before sitting down. These initial quick judgments usually take a few seconds, at which point we walk over to the posted menu and study it like the Dead Sea Scrolls. Here’s what you don’t want to see: everything. This isn’t a food court, and while figuring out what you want to do in life is often a long journey for people, restaurants should have this decided far before the menu is printed. “When it’s too cross-cultural, when it’s too all over the place, that’s an issue. There’s a restaurant I’m thinking of right now that has fettucine Alfredo with your choice of shrimp, chicken, or salmon. You’re like, ‘OK, that’s not a good sign,’ ” says Stowell. “That’s the way people used to eat in the ’80s: They would offer everything for everybody, and let them combine it how they want. But we’ve gone away from that and more toward, ‘We’re going to guide you to what’s good.’ If you’re everything for everybody you’re usually nothing for nobody.” For Sidell, a single focus is ideal. “There are Japanese masters that have been doing just tempura for 80 years, and extraordinarily so. When you go there you realize how much it takes to do one thing well, let alone trying to do many things well,” she says. Along these lines, it helps if the menu goes into a bit of detail. Imagine you’re interviewing a steak for the job of being eaten. You don’t want the steak to just say, “I’m a good steak, I swear.” Details like suppliers and cooking methods show that it’s sincere about wanting the job. “If people are taking the time to use morel mushrooms, they’re caring more. Calling out specific varieties of oysters, where the chicken and beef are from, and all the seasonal ingredients that are out there,” says Stowell. “The more in-depth they get with those descriptions, the better off they are.” Carrying around a bingo card with all these guidelines is hardly practical and wouldn’t fit in your wallet. But whether it’s fancy or casual, old-fashioned or modernist, you can often tell if the restaurant is full of crap. Sidell and Stowell—hey, not a bad name for an eatery—seem to be seeking a singular vision that expresses itself in every facet of a spot, rather than an unoriginal concept created by committee to pander. So if you’re standing outside a restaurant that feels organic to the city, features an authentic ambiance that lets the food do the talking, and has a menu that’s as personal as it is focused; by all means, head on in. Should it turn out to be bad, just grab a slice of pizza on the way home. But not at Luigi’s."

Oglala Sioux Tribe bans South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem from reservation over anti-protest laws.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/oglala-sioux-tribe-ban-south-dakota-governor-kristi-noem.html,"Trump Says Political Correctness Caused Kentucky Derby Upset The Oglala Sioux Tribe, the largest tribe in South Dakota, has banned the state’s governor from its reservation after she supported a pair of recently passed laws aimed at deterring protests of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, according to a letter the tribe sent on Thursday informing the governor she was “not welcome” on tribal lands. “I am hereby notifying you that you are not welcome to visit our homelands, the Pine Ridge Reservation, until you rescind your support for [the two laws] and affirm to your state and this country that First Amendment rights to free, political speech are among the truths you hold to be self-evident,” Julian Bear Runner, the tribe’s president, wrote in a letter to Gov. Kristi Noem. According to the Washington Post , the move is a dramatic one, and a spokesman for the tribe said he couldn’t remember another time when the leaders banned a representative of the state government. According to the letter, the ban will remain in place until she withdraws her support for the two laws, which allow officials to sue activists for something the law has called “riot boosting,” a term the American Civil Liberties Union contends the state invented to go after protests that could disrupt pipeline construction. Under the laws , passed in late March, the state can sue activists if any violence or lawbreaking occurs at a protest they organized, promoted, or even encouraged, and the money from the suit can be used to pay for damages or law enforcement costs. The ACLU is challenging the laws in federal court, contending that its overly vague language gives broad power to crack down on political expression and makes for a chilling effect on speech. The Oglala Sioux, many of whom are opposed to the pipeline because it would run through sacred tribal lands and have participated in protests against it, also allege the state legislators crafted the bills with the input of TransCanada, the company behind the project to build the pipeline, and without that of the tribe, in violation of the tribe’s sovereignty according to the treaty it signed with the U.S.—something the leaders were “particularly offended” by, according to the letter. “We have superior legal title to all the land west of the Missouri River that you and/or big oil seek to trespass and aggress on,” Bear Runner wrote in the letter. “These are our lands and our waters. Before you presume to visit our homelands again, the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council must rescind its action as of May 1, 2019.” According to the tribe, Noem has made recent trips to the reservation without informing the tribal leaders, a move they saw as a further dismissal of tribal sovereignty. According to the letter, another diplomatic violation would put Noem at risk of a more serious tribal process: “If you do not honor this directive—for example, if you were to repeat your recent visit absent permission from our tribal government—we will have no choice but to banish you.”"
This week in Brexit: Labour and Conservatives both take a hit in local elections,slate.com,Joshua Keating,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/brexit-local-elections-rory-stewart-penny-mordaunt.html,"Trump Says Political Correctness Caused Kentucky Derby Upset For once, the biggest political news in Britain this week wasn’t directly Brexit-related. Gavin Williamson, the defense secretary seen as a close ally of Prime Minister Theresa May, was fired on Wednesday over a media leak about a National Security Council meeting concerning plans to allow the controversial Chinese company Huawei to help build the country’s 5G network. (Williamson denies he was the sources of the leak.) Parliament also declared a “ climate emergency ,” making Britain the first country in the world to do so, following widespread protests in London by the group Extinction Rebellion and a speech to MPs from teenage activist Greta Thunberg. But don’t let this focus on critical global concerns like climate change and cybersecurity make you think there was no Brexit news this week. There’s always Brexit news. This week in bipartisan shellackings: Voters throughout much of England and Northern Ireland went to the polls on Thursday to vote in local elections. These voters may or may not have included former foreign secretary and aspiring future prime minister Boris Johnson, who tweeted that he had just voted , then deleted that tweet after people noted that no elections were being held in his district of London. Aides suggested he voted near his second home in South Oxfordshire, but that raises questions about why he deleted the tweet or why he’s registered to vote outside the constituency he represents in Parliament. That mystery aside, it was expected to be a very bad night for the ruling Conservative Party, with supporters frustrated over Theresa May’s failure to deliver Brexit on time, and it was very bad : Although votes are still being counted, the Tories have already lost 850 local council seats throughout the country and have lost control of at least three councils. Sajid Javid, the home secretary and another aspiring future prime minister, says the party should expect to do even worse in European Parliament elections later this month, assuming those actually happen. It was also an unexpectedly bad night for the Labour Party, which has lost at least 80 seats. The big winners of the night are the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, and independent candidates. Prime Minister Theresa May, who was heckled at a Conservative conference in Wales by a party member telling her to resign, said the election results were a message from voters to the leaders of both parties to “just get on and deliver Brexit.” That’s certainly true for her party’s supporters, but for Labour, it’s not as clear. The party lost votes to the Lib Dems and Greens, two staunchly pro-remain parties that both favor a second referendum on Brexit. It may be that voters don’t like Jeremy Corbyn’s ambivalent position in negotiations on Brexit and want him to take a firmer stand. This week in negotiations: Before the elections, May and Corbyn were both signaling that they were getting closer to a Brexit deal. May is reportedly considering agreeing to keep the U.K. within a customs union with Europe . This would allow British businesses to continue to enjoy tariff-free trade with Europe. It would restrict Britain’s ability to negotiate its own trade deals on goods with other countries, though May’s allies emphasized this week that Britain would still be able to negotiate deals on services, intellectual property, and other areas. This would be viewed as a betrayal by hard-line Brexiteers within May’s party. But after they rejected her withdrawal agreement three times, she’s more or less written them off and decided to try to negotiate with Labour. Corbyn could also face a backlash for helping May deliver Brexit, particularly if he ignores demands from supporters for a second referendum. This week’s new faces: After Williamson was sacked, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt was appointed defense secretary. The Navy reservist will be the first woman to hold the role. She’s also known for having once appeared on a diving reality show , which is a thing, apparently, and once saying the word cock six times in a speech to Parliament after losing a bet with her Navy buddies. So, that’s fun. She’s also a pretty hardcore Brexiteer. Taking her place as international development secretary and joining the Cabinet is Rory Stewart, the former diplomat known for his best-selling memoir about walking across Afghanistan . Stewart was a remainer but has been an enthusiastic public advocate for May’s Brexit plan, which may be part of the reason he’s in the Cabinet now. Naturally, he too thinks he’d be a great prime minister . Days left until next deadline: 182"
"What It’s Like to Sing “Under My Thumb,” Over and Over Again",slate.com,Studio 360,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/under-my-thumb-rolling-stones-romantic-songs-patriarchy.html,"Jules Indelicato. Courtesy of Magnolia McKay “Every Breath You Take” by The Police sounds like a romantic ballad about devotion, which is why it’s been played at countless weddings. But listen to the lyrics a bit more closely and it’s hard to imagine a worse song for walking down the aisle. The song is a pretty nasty piece of business about stalking. Which is why, while it’s actually a terrible wedding song, it was a perfect song for a site-specific art project in San Francisco in the fall. The project was called Romantic Songs of the Patriarchy , and it took place in the Mission District of San Francisco in the Women’s Building, a provider of health, social, and legal services to women. It was by an Icelandic artist named Ragnar Kjartansson and it worked like this: Female musicians were positioned throughout the building on three consecutive days, and each one of them was assigned to sing one song that might sound romantic but which actually is pretty misogynistic. Like this bit of lechery from Rod Stewart: And this from the Beatles: And this particularly astonishing one from the Crystals: The singers who took part in the project didn’t cover their song just once. They performed the same song over and over and over again for three days, basically on a loop. So visitors to the building would climb a set of stairs, or round a corner, and hear another song. About 20 female and nonbinary singers took part in the marathon performance. One of those singers was a Bay Area musician named Jules Indelicato. And they are featured on Studio 360 , the public radio show and Slate podcast. You can hear them singing their cover in the segment, which was produced by Magnolia McKay, in the link below. Jules Indelicato: We were each given songs. The songs were not our choice. I got “Under My Thumb” by the Rolling Stones. My whole demeanor when performing this song was very full of myself and suave and proud that I had tamed this wild beast. “The difference in the clothes she wears, it’s down to me. The change has come. She’s under my thumb.” And at the end of the song there’s this gigantic release that becomes greater and greater with every repetition. And then a breath and you start again. You stop seeing it in the lens of time, and it becomes more of a sculpture, or a painting. In the first minute, people would come in and they’d realize what song I’m singing. And excitement would come over their face like, “Oh, honey, she’s doing the Rolling Stones! Listen.” By the end of the first chorus I’d see the smile kind of leave. And I’d see them start to fidget and I’d see their eyes kind of searching to lock onto mine. There was this one very emotional turn where I had really, really gotten into it and really started to feel like I was that person in the song. That toxic, powerful, snide man with no shame. And I was singing my heart out very subdued, but very intense. And I look up and this woman is crouched in the corner, clutching her heart and clutching her mouth with her other hand and just shaking her head and sobbing. And I look up with a sneer and a smile on my face right as I say, “She’s under my thumb.” And at that moment, I—my throat caught up in my chest, and my eyes started welling up, and I look at her and she looks at me, and I realize that some of this is kind of seeping into my body. Some of this pride, and some of this, like, snarky toxicity. I just felt so gross. And I look at her on the ground and I see how much she’s going through. And then I look up and I realize that there’s a little girl in the room and she’s watching this whole interaction, and she’s been there for the whole song. I don’t see her parents around anywhere. And then I think about her, and I think about all of the songs that she’s heard today. And how she’s growing up being shaped by the same stuff. And it kind of just made me really overwhelmed at how deeply hurt we are by pop culture. And so I wanted to stand up right there and just leave. But I sat back down and I took a breath. And I started the song again, and again, and again. To hear a full audio version, listen to this episode of Studio 360 below, where host Kurt Andersen introduces the story at 39:00.

President Trump spoke to Putin about the Mueller report during phone call.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-mueller-report-phone-call.html,"Trump Says Political Correctness Caused Kentucky Derby Upset In a pair of tweets Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump said he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and discussed, among other topics, the “Russian Hoax.” It appears to be the first time Trump has spoken with Putin since the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, speaking with reporters, said that the Mueller report was only discussed “very, very briefly” and “in the context that it’s over and there was no collusion, which I’m pretty sure both leaders were both very well aware of long before this call took place.” Had a long and very good conversation with President Putin of Russia. As I have always said, long before the Witch Hunt started, getting along with Russia, China, and everyone is a good thing, not a bad thing.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2019 But Trump has already been criticized for the way in which he appeared to depict Putin as an ally in matters related to the Mueller investigation, given the Russian government’s confirmed role in attempting to sway the election. “A hostile foreign power attacked our democracy,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a tweet. “The president welcomed that attack, obstructed the investigation into it, & is now cozying up with the leader who orchestrated it. Congress needs to do its job, stand up for our national security, and begin impeachment proceedings.” Sanders told reporters that the call lasted more than an hour—as the New York Times pointed out, that makes it one of Trump’s longest calls with a foreign leader. Asked if Trump pressed Putin on the 2016 election meddling, Sanders avoided a direct response. “[W]hat I can tell you is that this administration, unlike the previous one, takes election meddling seriously,” she said . “And we’re going to do everything that we can to prevent it from happening. That’s why we’ve taken a whole-of-government approach.”"

Eva Stories is a Holocaust memorial on Instagram.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/holocaust-instagram-eva-stories.html,"A post shared by Eva (@eva.stories) on Apr 28, 2019 at 4:36am PDT Eva’s narrative, which played on Instagram Stories and was permanently saved to the account’s Story Highlights, begins in relative peacetime. Eva introduces us to her grandparents and her best friend Annie and, from afar, shows us the cute boy she has a crush on. Eva hangs out at her grandfather’s pharmacy, where Annie gives her a “love potion” made of gold glitter. The videos are charming, if cutesy, often decorated with app add-ons like hashtags, location tags, stickers, and emoji. But the silliness is flecked with anxiety. When we meet Eva’s papa, she calls him “just as handsome as an Aryan,” before bragging, “One day, when I get older, I’ll marry an Aryan Englishman.” Later, while Eva fools around on the sidewalk, we can just make out a passerby muttering “dirty Jew” and see Eva’s face fall before she shuts off her camera. We watch as her freedoms dissolve one by one, until her family is carted off to a ghetto. Screenshot from @Eva.Stories The power of Instagram, and the reason it makes for a punchy story medium, lies in its immediacy. When Eva addresses the camera, she speaks freely in intimate close-up. Mia Quiney, the British actress who plays Eva, is capable of toggling between a charming, breezy adolescence and tangible rage and fear when things get dark. Her naturalism is amplified by the story’s structure: Scenes last minutes or seconds, allowing us to experience a full revolution of mood over just a few moments. When Eva’s mother sews a yellow star on Eva’s favorite peacoat, her response is to scream and thrash like a petulant child. “This isn’t me,” she cries, fretting that the kids at school will make fun of her. Seconds later, Eva’s wearing the star in a quiet selfie video, staring into the camera coolly. The project’s set design and costumes are faithful to 1944 Hungary, with the notable exception of Eva’s smartphone—the only one that exists in the world of the story. Since our narrator is alone in using the device, the story feels less like a modern, fantastical update on the Holocaust—like Inglourious Basterds or Life Is Beautiful— than a highly stylized slice of it. The project brings to mind the 2015 film Son of Saul , which was similarly shot in intimate close-up—and, despite its eventual Oscar win, drew equal criticism for depicting the Holocaust in an “entertaining” form. Not long after the end of World War II, the German philosopher Theodor W. Adorno posited that “to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.” Adorno later retracted the statement , but it gestures at the overwhelming challenge of approaching the Holocaust’s horrors as an artist. While the war bred documentaries and Hollywood-style propaganda films to support the Allied war effort, depicting the Holocaust seemed to require a dignity and gravitas that felt too massive for ordinary cultural tools. But slowly, art crept into the void, helping to commemorate the troubling past and confront lingering pain. Yet even now, each time a new work that touches on the Holocaust is released, it becomes the subject of scrutiny: Does it sensationalize its material? Does it trivialize it? Does it offer insight? We’re right to ask these questions, about Eva Stories and everything else. Screenshot from @Eva.Stories When I first saw Eva ’s promo ad on Instagram, I was skeptical. The project seemed blasé and inappropriate, not to mention pathetically out of touch in its presumption that Instagram is the only way to reach young people. My suspicions were partially confirmed when I began watching. A clumsy early scene in which Eva’s young cousin is deported to Poland feels both stagy and awkwardly abrupt, as if the episode were being improvised by school kids on a playground. The Instagram frills—like the hashtags #lifeduringwar and #reporterlife, which are both repeatedly appended—can also be cringy, and were so obviously engineered by adults that they come to function like a Brechtian distancing device, taking us out of a scene when they should be adding to its teenage realism. But slowly, Eva Stories won me over. The character of Eva does most of the work, both through Quiney’s performance and Eva’s identity as an aspiring journalist, a detail that was lifted from Eva Heyman’s real journal entries. This job ambition becomes the narrative driver behind Eva’s incessant smartphone recording (hence #reporterlife), which helps to justify the inherent queasiness of her whipping out her phone while soldiers harass her family. By the time Eva crams onto the train that will take her to Auschwitz, we’ve gained a real sense of her life. She was a normal, silly, happy kid—one among millions whose lives were ruined and cut short. The smartphone is an obvious embellishment to this history, but Eva Stories isn’t inventing a new past; it’s retrieving a truth about these kids’ existence. Every day, appalling, terrible things are conveyed to me through my iPhone, arriving on Twitter or Facebook or news apps. Typically, I look to Instagram for fun stuff—cute animals, delicious food, friends, fashion, art. It’s understandable that, for many, it would be jarring to see this safe, superficial space merge with war and suffering. But that jarring-ness is part of the point. The Holocaust’s memory is a painful one, but these days, it is perhaps more painful to realize that it might not persist, that as the atrocities grow further away in the rearview and fewer survivors remain, the Holocaust is liable to lose resonance. While watching Eva, I kept thinking of a story that’s told at Passover during one of the best-known parts of the Seder. It identifies a “Rebellious Son” as a child who asks his parents, “What is this service to you ?” and thus separates himself from his community. The Seder story’s goal—to teach kids to feel engaged in their culture so that the Jewish memory doesn’t fade—is the same as the mission of Eva Stories. Like Eva herself, the project is reporting from a new frontier of difficult storytelling, and its timing is crucial.

The International Planetary Defense Conference asks what to do if an asteroid is headed to Earth.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/international-planetary-defense-conference-asteroid-impact.html,"Mayor Pete Is Not an Anti-Vaxxer Imagine this: Scientists have just detected an asteroid hurtling toward Earth. According to their calculations, the damage would be catastrophic, and we don’t have long to prepare. Experts determine that the best plan of action would be to launch armed spacecraft, perhaps with nukes, to rendezvous with the asteroid. Though this sounds suspiciously like the plot of Armageddon , it’s also the plot of the sixth International Academy of Astronautics Planetary Defense Conference. Representatives from NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the European Space Agency, the U.N., and other international space experts have gathered in College Park, Maryland, this week to do a cosmic fire drill. The premise of this role-play universe begins with an imaginary asteroid called 2019 PDC, which has a 1 in 100 chance of striking Earth in 2027. According to NASA , those odds were selected for this drill because experts worldwide generally agree that that’s the threshold for when we should take collective action. Sure, it seems far-fetched, but it’s only a matter of time until we’re faced with a serious asteroid threat. This year has already seen three close asteroid flybys , between 73,500 and 274,000 miles away from us, but none close enough to sound the alarm. (For reference, the distance between Earth and the moon is 238,900 miles.) Small asteroids pass within 4 million miles of Earth all the time. Earth has definitely seen some giant impacts before, but it seems in our best interest to be ready next time around. (As this amazing shirt from the European Space Agency says: Dinosaurs didn’t have a space agency .) So, the logic goes, practice makes perfect. The conference looked like any other—experts giving presentations in a nondescript meeting hall—but instead of covering new advances in the field, the talks gave a broad outline of the hypothetical impact scenario and discussed the questions and decisions that would stem from it. The scenario is wrapped around an excellent and compelling storyline. Though every tweet from organizers and attendees, as well as the PowerPoint slides, included the word EXERCISE in bold letters, I found myself getting drawn into the role-play as I watched the conference livestream from home (and, apparently, so did some momentarily alarmed folks on Twitter, prompting one astronomy account to remind followers that the scenario was not real). Like a good sci-fi storyline, each day of the exercise advanced the story forward. While Day 1 took place in real time, Day 2 took place three months later, in July 2019, and then we jumped forward to Dec. 30, 2021, on Day 3, to 2024 in Day 4, and to 10 days before impact on Day 5. At first, efforts focused on quantifying the problem: Where might the asteroid strike, and with how much force? By Day 3, experts had calculated that 2019 PDC would land in the middle of Denver, completely incinerating the immediate area (one scientist used the phrase “molten buildings” to describe the damage) and casting shock waves hundreds of miles out. “Windows are breaking from Pueblo to Laramie,” said physicist Mark Boslough to set the scene at his end-of-day briefing about the asteroid’s physical effects. A great deal of discussion has focused on how best to deflect the asteroid’s path. Some suggested deploying kinetic impactors, launched to collide with the asteroid and knock it into a different path, as well as launching nuclear weapons. The problem is that scientists aren’t yet sure exactly how each method would move the asteroid because they’re not sure of the asteroid’s mass, which, as you may guess, matters a lot when it comes to physics. The logistics of this exercise assume that humankind will send a probe up to study the asteroid more closely, but given the lag in how long it takes for spacecraft to reach the asteroid, scientists will need to make a decision about their deflection method before the probe sends back additional data. In imaginary 2024, the experts decide to send up a series of kinetic impactors, which successfully move the asteroid out of Earth’s path, but the force of the impacts also causes a chunk of the asteroid to break off—and the simulation has it hitting Earth in April 2029. Luckily, the fake piece is small, by celestial standards: It’s estimated at 60 meters. While it will likely become smaller or even vaporize while entering our atmosphere, it still has the power to inflict damage; for instance, the Tunguska meteor in 1908 was thought to be around the same size, and while it didn’t leave a crater, it flattened hundreds of miles of Arctic forest. On Day 5, it was revealed that 2019 PDC would hit Manhattan in 10 days, an incident “worse than Tunguska.” Experts drew up models of the damage and began planning for evacuations. Unsurprisingly, much of the drill focused on decision-making and mission logistics. How do we learn as much as we can about this asteroid, and what do we do to minimize its damage? But a full-scale rehearsal like this also brings more practical considerations to the forefront, and attendees’ questions and experts’ analyses highlight the very real concerns people might have should a scenario like this arise in real life. One attendee seemed pretty hand-wavy about potentially destroying a huge swath of the western U.S. At the end of Day 3, for instance, one attendee seemed pretty hand-wavy about potentially destroying a huge swath of the western U.S., even for a thought exercise, saying, “I might be biased since we’re all on the East Coast here, but … ” This person went on to ask: Had we considered possibly sending spacecraft up just to nudge the asteroid slightly away from any major population center, instead of nudging it out of Earth’s orbit? The speaker, NASA’s Brent Barbee, politely shot him down. “I would characterize that as a last resort. Our primary goal would be to move the asteroid off of Earth,” he said. The moderator of the Q&A also jumped in to add that the impactors’ targeting wouldn’t be precise enough to ensure the exact amount the asteroid would be moved. But still, this questioner is probably not alone. The people who would be tasked with huge decisions like this are more likely to live in certain cities, and, as well-intentioned as they may be, that could color decisions. But it’s also not clear who, ultimately, will get to make those calls. Attendees brought up questions about the possibilities of different countries “getting in each other’s way” when it comes to launching spacecraft meant to work together, like if three different space agencies each contributed kinetic impactors to a global mission. “With a mission of this scope, you’d need strong coordination,” said discussion moderator Paul Chodas, of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “With procedures and protocols, we could achieve the coordination necessary, but it would be essential to coordinate very closely.” In theory, there would be an international team that coordinates important intergalactic decisions, like how to launch defense against the asteroid or, if nuclear weapons are used, who actually initiates the detonation. (Hopefully, this coordination is better than that of the crew in Armageddon , when Bruce Willis pushes young Ben Affleck out of the way at the last moment.) “We don’t have those procedures in place right now, but we’re developing them,” Chodas said. Figuring that out appears to be outside the purview of this conference, but it seems like a piece of the puzzle law and politics experts should figure out long before we’re faced with an actual asteroid threat. And one hopes that any team meant to represent the interests of all humans on Earth includes delegates from countries that don’t have their own space programs but can contribute in other ways, like drawing up policies and offering technical expertise. Currently, the International Asteroid Warning Network is the go-to group for finding and monitoring near-Earth objects and coordinating international resources, and while there are a good number of institutions from space-faring countries represented , it’s definitely biased toward wealthier powers. This thought experiment also demonstrates how important it will be to bring in experts outside of physics and astronomy. In several summaries, experts have mentioned the consequences of a huge asteroid event on plane or train travel and internet access, as well as the possible destabilization of the economy as property values in potential strike areas plummet. Others have pointed out that areas outside the immediate strike zones will likely be ravaged by wildfires caused by the impact. There are real costs to culture, as well. One researcher noted that when 2019 PDC incinerates Manhattan, museums like the Met would need to move their collections elsewhere as quickly as possible. My favorite question came from an attendee who has clearly seen his share of action movies: “How big would [the asteroid] need to be to pop the cork on Yellowstone?” The scientists onstage didn’t seem to immediately understand his question, so the attendee went on to explain that an impact could destabilize the Wyoming supervolcano . “We have not considered volcanic impacts,” replied one of the scientists. “Well,” the attendee said, “maybe it’s something to take a look at.”"

But even viewed without the lens of low expectations, O’Rourke’s proposal still looks remarkably bold. It calls for a “legally enforceable standard”— think carbon tax —to force the United States to be carbon neutral by the middle of this century, and a federal investment in renewable energy that is greater than what the nation spent to put a man on the moon. Sounds ambitious, right? Now for the shocker. The Sunrise Movement, an upstart advocacy group that has been loudly calling for climate action, responded with a giant thumbs down . O’Rourke, according to Executive Director Varshini Prakash, got “the science wrong” when he chose 2050 as his carbon-neutral deadline instead of 2030. “Beto claims to support the Green New Deal,” Prakash said in a statement, “but his plan is out of line with the timeline it lays out and the scale of action that scientists say is necessary to take here in the United States to give our generation a livable future.” For good measure, Sunrise cited the previous times when O’Rourke had pointed to 2030 as his ideal target. Then came the backlash to the backlash, from progressive policy wonks who see the 2030 target as unattainable, including Vox’s David Roberts , the original climate hawk , who has defended Sunrise in the past. And then another surprise followed before the week was up: Prakash walked back her criticism of Beto, considerably, by way of a Twitter mea culpa. We came out a bit too hot on @BetoORourke ’s climate plan, focusing just on his timeline & not enough on everything that’s spot on abt it.2050 *is* too late a deadline for the US to reach netzero GHG emissions, but Beto’s plan was a great start & I hope many others follow suit. https://t.co/Id2eIcJwXP — Varshini Prakash 🌅 (@VarshPrakash) May 1, 2019 The week’s twists and turns originally had me fearing that the climate movement was about to eat itself at a moment when the stakes are higher than ever. But now I think that Beto’s rollout, the insta-backlash, the counterbacklash, and the semi-retreat, taken together, illustrate how climate infighting on the left is more productive than destructive. To understand why, first let’s look at the fault line from which this fight erupted: the target date by which the United States needs to be carbon neutral. Climate math, to put it mildly, is complicated. It does not lend itself easily to pithy summary, which is why the focus on specific dates can be a bit counterproductive. The broad brushstrokes, though, are important: While the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does not address what individual countries need to do, it does lay out a timeline for the world as a whole. And while there’s some wiggle room around the edges depending on what happens down the road, the IPCC has concluded that the world most likely needs to cut its carbon emission in half by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by roughly 2050 in order to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the point at which the damage caused by a warming world would go from bad to really, really bad . And so many climate-conscious Democrats have settled on 2050 as their goal for the United States— including presidential hopefuls like Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who has made global warming the signature issue of his campaign (and who rolled out a sweeping climate plan of his own on Friday that takes a creative sector-by-sector approach ). Even Sunrise’s beloved Green New Deal is a little fuzzy on its timeline. It calls for a 10-year “mobilization,” but one of its co-authors, Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, has been clear that’s not the same thing as complete decarbonization. Things only get considerably more complicated from there, as they tend to when you’re talking about an existential crisis. The world’s governments are not going to move in unison toward that goal. And so many believe the United States and Europe will need to lead the way—for reasons of morality (the West has been burning obscene amounts of fossil fuels for far longer than the rest of the world), practicality (the West has more money to invest in clean energy), and geopolitics (the United States, in particular, has given everyone good reason to doubt its commitment to the fight). Again, estimates vary, but some experts see 2030 as the date by which the United States would need to be carbon neutral in order to give the rest of the world the cushion it will likely need to get there by 2050. In order to hit that expedited timeline, though, the United States would have only a few years to fundamentally reshape American life—from how we travel to what we eat to where we live. That is not going to happen as long as there is a climate denier in the White House, but even a climate-focused Democrat would face myriad and possibly insurmountable challenges—both practical (how to decarbonize the aviation industry) and political (how to overcome GOP climate denials in Congress)—should one be sworn in as president in January 2021. Things only get considerably more complicated from there, as they tend to when you’re talking about an existential crisis. So, if the world can’t get to carbon neutral by 2050 unless the United States does by 2030, but the United States can’t get there by then, what’s the answer? I don’t know! No one does yet. But I am pretty confident the solution to that quandary isn’t in the existing advocacy playbook that pushed Congress to the brink of major climate action a decade ago but has yet to come anywhere close since. That’s why I was excited to see the Sunrise Movement instigate this week’s push and pull among a host of well-meaning actors, even though it was messy and a bit awkward. Sunrise is relatively new to the scene, and it’s still finding its footing. But the fact it isn’t always marching in lockstep with the larger climate community is a feature, not a bug. The group’s defiant streak has enabled it to harness the energy of so many young progressives, and then to use that energy to push the Democratic establishment to do more—by taking to the streets , by confronting lawmakers in their D.C. offices, and by releasing strongly worded press releases even when White House hopefuls unveil proposals that are quantum leaps forward from the status quo. That’s a good thing because doing more is clearly what’s needed. Yes, there are risks to being the progressive gadfly. If Democratic candidates start to think proposing anything short of a 2030 goal is going to get them ridiculed by the climate crowd, they may decide to focus their attention on other issues on which their base is more easily pleased. But Sunrise doesn’t represent the entire climate movement, merely the leftward flank of it. By creating a little chaos, as Sunrise tends to do, the group make it harder for candidates, the media, and voters to complacently downplay the full scale of the climate crisis. And in the process, these rabble-rousers can notch a few tiny victories along the way, as they did this week when O’Rourke announced Wednesday —after Sunrise had softened its criticism of him—that he’d no longer accept campaign donations above $200 from fossil fuel company executives, which Sunrise had been pushing him to do. A small step, to be sure, but a step nonetheless. There won’t be some buzzer that sounds on Jan. 1, 2030 or Jan. 1, 2050 to confirm whether the United States has averted climate disaster. Progress on global warming is not a binary. Success, both literately and figuratively, is a matter of degrees. Support our journalism

Montunas' Trellis Lirio tote: who would buy it?,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/montunas-tote-who-would-buy-it.html,"The Legend of the Vomelet, the Absolute Worst Food in the Military It’s that time of the year again, when the pollen-heavy rains of spring have overstayed their welcome, and we all breathlessly await the real arrival of summer. Along with the prospect of beach days comes the annual opportunity to guess what new trends and takes on warm-weather staples will overtake Instagram. Throwing her hat into the predicting ring early is Who What Wear senior news editor Erin Fitzpatrick, who declares that “the Montunas’s Trellis Lirio Rope-Trimmed Acetate and Linen Tote … is ripe to become a summer It bag.” How exactly Fitzpatrick has divined this forecast isn’t entirely clear, but the Montunas bag is certainly ripe to be named of the strangest objects I’ve ever laid eyes on. Apparently inspired by the “shape of plant pots,” the Trellis Lirio tote is a curious little bag that costs a mere $435 and resembles either an inverted lampshade or one of the little trash cans that one keeps in their bathroom. Or perhaps a half-full, to-go cup of ice cream. Maybe an Easter basket? The tote features a structural exterior made of acetate pearlescent slats and a drawstring pouch interior. There’s also a pink tassel involved. The website copy suggests that buyers “match your lip color to the pretty pink rope handle” and that the tote is “one for Instagram,” which makes sense since it looks as if it will fit approximately three things. Other bags in the Montunas line are comparably … eccentric. The Guaria tote , for example, looks a bit like a rectangular green spice rack attached to a silk scarf and is “inspired by hanging pots and planters.” The Lirio bag is similar in structure to the Trellis Lirio, except without the slats, which somehow makes it look even more like a bathroom trash can, albeit one cast in resin. According to one of the founders of Montanaus, all of the acetate bags are inspired by their orchid house in the mountains of Costa Rica.
The shapes are all based on orchid pots and vessels, and the names are native Costa Rican orchids. For us, nature is our biggest inspiration—it’s not hard when you’re from Costa Rica! The new Pearl collection fuses together the two important parts of nature there: the jungle and the sea. Yes, of course. Now that I’ve read that, I definitely understand the raison d’être for this little trashcan orchid pot bag. While the entire “bag” strikes me as nonsensical, what I will say is that the most confounding part is that the little interior linen pouch is apparently removable, which feels both like a security risk and a huge hassle. Whoever owns this purse is stuck holding it perfectly upright, lest their linen bag of three things tumble out onto the street. Or should you leave your home without the linen pouch, you’re walking around with what is functionally a bucket with slats through which anyone can see what three things you’ve chosen to carry with you. Actually, now that I think about it, this might be the perfect bag for a concert venue where you’re only allowed to bring in a transparent vessel. Price: $435 Who would buy this thing?

Why Facebook’s ban of Alex Jones and Milo was so underwhelming.,slate.com,April Glaser,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/facebook-alex-jones-ban-underwhelming.html,"The Decadelong Humiliation of Runner Caster Semenya On Thursday, we found out what the sound of a defenestrated troll is like. That afternoon, Facebook banned Infowars, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, and other inflammatory figures like far-right personalities Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos, white supremacist politician Paul Nehlen, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has long been criticized as holding anti-Semitic and homophobic views. These bans are reportedly permanent and extend to the fan pages and groups affiliated with their accounts. The breakup wasn’t clean. The news broke before Facebook had actually banned all of their accounts across its platforms. Loomer and Yiannopoulos were still able to post to Instagram for nearly an hour after the Washington Post, the Atlantic, CNN, and the Verge published stories saying they were getting the boot. In that time, Loomer and Yiannopoulos used their accounts to tell their legions of followers where else to find them. On Facebook, Alex Jones was able to stream on Facebook Live for nearly two hours after the world learned that he was technically no longer welcome there. Facebook told Wired the reason for the time lag was that scrubbing these characters’ footprint was a bigger job than they anticipated. While Facebook briefed news organizations ahead of time over these actions, the company didn’t specify how these accounts had violated the platform’s policies. Instead, a spokesperson told multiple outlets that the company has “always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,” which was a bit tough to swallow, considering these accounts have been spewing hate for years—and many, many hateful accounts remain on the social network. (A quick search Friday on Facebook for the term “jews oven” unearthed a page called “Jewsinoven?”) The Facebook spokesperson continued, “The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.” Facebook didn’t share what rules specifically were violated or what the process was for reviewing its rules. Presumably, if Thursday’s actions reflect a new approach that Facebook is now taking—or at least a new sense of urgency—then far more than seven accounts would have been banned. Still: At the end of the day, a bunch of high-profile bigots had been stripped of a major platform. It should’ve resonated as a victory against the fringe figures who have benefited from the distortionary effects of social media, where ranking algorithms tend to benefit divisive, emotional content. So why did this latest act of content moderation instead feel underwhelming? The lack of transparency is so troublesome because Facebook’s content moderation processes aren’t only applied to famous racists. Deplatforming certainly does help to reduce the spread of hate. Since Alex Jones lost his main Facebook and YouTube pages in August, traffic to Infowars has plummeted . Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right provocateur who was banned from Twitter for directing racist harassment at the actress Leslie Jones, can no longer receive financial backing from his fan base via Venmo or PayPal and is reportedly in severe debt. (Those services banned him last year after he sent $14.88, a number that symbolizes a salute to Hitler in neo-Nazi communities, to a Jewish journalist.) But, particularly in Facebook’s case, deplatforming also has to align with a set of clearly articulated policies so that it isn’t read as a tyrannical act of corporate censorship that will further inflame accusations of bias. In this case, Facebook created a news story in much the way it might if it had announced a new product , but it didn’t actually say why specifically the accounts were removed. What should have been a by-the-book punitive act became a spectacle—and probably one that Alex Jones and the like will try to spin to their advantage. Facebook has the power to punish wrongdoers, as it did on Thursday. But we don’t know its full rationale for doing so, nor do we know who will be next. The lack of transparency is so troublesome because Facebook’s content moderation processes aren’t only applied to famous racists. For years, black users on Facebook have been forced to navigate the platform’s mercurial enforcement of its speech policies. It’s become so routine for black activists to get suspended when they complain about racism that it’s become common practice in activist communities to create backup accounts and use slang like “wypipo” to dodge the company’s content moderation algorithm. Complaining about racism isn’t hate speech. But Facebook appears to have done less hand-wringing when moderating content from this community than it has with content that is anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, or racist, or that promotes dangerous conspiracy theories that have led to violence. While figures like Alex Jones might attract the attention of higher-up Facebook executives, most people are moderated by a mix of algorithm and low-level contract workers—and are subject to a broad brush with little room for appeal. I emailed Facebook to ask specifically which rules were violated, what the process was for reviewing the rules, and if this means more accounts, presumably of lesser-known users, would be banned for engaging in hateful rhetoric soon, too. I have yet to hear back. But unless this move is part of an overall cleanup effort in which the company includes its rationale for taking action and promises to do so consistently into the future, don’t expect Facebook to become free of bigotry anytime soon. Removing hate will always be a game of whack-a-mole. It’s good to ban high-profile bigots. It’s also critically important to explain in clear terms what policy was violated, how many violations were tabulated, and what they did to violate the policy—either shared with the account holder or with the public. Simply saying the company “always” does this isn’t sensical or sufficient. What might be more bothersome, however, is that Facebook risks unleashing a whole other breed of hate and disinformation across its network—one that a high-profile act of deplatforming doesn’t address. Earlier this week, Facebook shared that it is redesigning its platform to promote the use of private groups for sharing Facebook posts, which would reduce the prominence of the more open news feed. Moving people into private rooms will certainly make it a lot easier for Facebook to continue its haphazard style of governance. It’s a lot easier to promote and share bigotry in a closed group of racists than it is to do so on a public page—and for that bigotry to spread widely without anyone noticing, as it did on WhatsApp during the Brazilian elections last year. And it’s a lot harder for users who are trying to fight hate to report it. I expect the people who lost their accounts on Thursday to start new ones soon, or worse, commandeer an account or group with a large following from an ally. Sure, they probably won’t have the reach they did before, but hate is insidious. Policies against racism don’t eradicate racism. Unless Facebook applies its rules consistently and transparently, people with an agenda will find a way to come crawling back to find their fans. And if they’re in big private groups, where only their fellow sexists, anti-Semites, Islamophobes, homophobes, and racists are allowed in, they may well find a hideout there too."

"North Korea launches short term projectiles, according to South Korea.",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/north-korea-short-term-projectiles.html,"Trump Changes His Mind, Says Mueller Shouldn’t Testify North Korea fired several short-term projectiles into the sea Saturday, in what could be the country’s first missile test since 2017 and a possible warning to the U.S. after the two countries’ denuclearization talks stalled. While it’s not clear what the projectiles are, the South Korean military, which reported the test and originally identified the projectiles as “short-term missiles” before revising its statement, has used the term before for missiles before they can be identified. There is no evidence that the test Saturday involved a nuclear explosion and it appears not to have been an intercontinental ballistic missile, according to the New York Times . The projectiles were fired from the east coast of the peninsula and launched 45 to 125 miles. The launches will not have violated the moratorium the country declared in November 2017 on nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile tests, according to the Washington Post . That moratorium was intended to help clear the path for negotiations with the U.S. and South Korea. In April, North Korea tested a new weapon, which it called a “tactical guided weapon,” and which is thought to have been a more conventional weapon. That test appeared to be a warning to President Trump to continue the talks between the two nations, as in February a failed summit in Vietnam between Trump and Kim Jong-un resulted only in frustration. In that summit, Kim demanded sanctions relief in return for partial disarmament and Trump refused to lift sanctions until North Korea gave up all of its nuclear weapons. The two did agree to remain in discussions, and both nations have said a third summit between the two leaders remained a possibility. Since then, it appears North Korea has only become more frustrated with sanctions and the hard line taken by the U.S, as well as with continued U.S.-South Korea military exercises. Last month, Kim said in a speech he was losing patience and that he would give the U.S. until the end of the year to come up with new terms. According to the Post, South Korea’s president said the North’s actions violated a September military cooperation agreement between the two countries aimed at reducing tensions. A spokeswoman for the president said the South would work with the U.S. to “ramp up vigilance and closely communicate with neighboring countries as needed.” According to the Times, the South Korean foreign minister said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said in a conversation with her that the U.S. would respond “with caution.” In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said he still believes he can reach a nuclear deal with Kim.

Portland and Denver’s Four-Overtime Game Revealed the Six Stages of Exhaustion,slate.com,Nick Greene,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/portland-and-denvers-four-overtime-thriller-took-its-toll.html,"Sadly, delirium often presents itself as confidence in the truly fatigued.

"Tyson recalls 11.8 million pounds of frozen chicken, according to the USDA.",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/tyson-recall-frozen-chicken-metal.html,"Trump Changes His Mind, Says Mueller Shouldn’t Testify Tyson Foods Inc. has recalled 11.8 million pounds of frozen chicken strips because of the possibility that some may contain metal, the United States Department of Agriculture announced Saturday. That announcement came after six people complained of finding pieces of metal. Three of the people said they sustained cuts to their mouths. The company had already recalled 69,000 pounds of chicken strips in March but dramatically increased that nationwide recall after more of the complaints were filed. The potentially contaminated chicken strips were produced between October 2018 and March 8 of this year, and their “use by” dates range from October of this year to March 2020. They can be identified by the number “P-7221” on the back of the package. While most are listed under the Tyson brand, the recall also affects some products from Publix, Kirkwood, Giant Eagle, Hannaford, Spare Time, Best Choice, Great Value, Meijer, and Food Lion. You can see a more detailed list of recalled items here . It’s rare, but not wholly unheard-of, for frozen chicken products to become contaminated because of the process of producing the “meat slurry” with processing equipment. As Aaron Mak wrote the last time Tyson issued a major recall—in that case, for reports of rubber in its chicken—there are processes to prevent contamination, but there is no fail-safe. While maintenance programs monitor equipment for fatigue and inspectors usually check the equipment during cleaning and sanitation at the end of the day, it can still be hard to screen out material that contaminates the chicken because the slurry can’t easily pass through filters. However, metal pieces, unlike rubber, could be caught with metal detectors. In a statement posted to the company’s website, a spokeswoman for Tyson said the company had “discontinued use of the specific equipment believed to be associated with the metal fragments” and that it would install “metal-detecting X-ray machinery to replace the plant’s existing metal-detection system” and use a “third-party video auditing system for metal-detection verification.” In January, Tyson recalled 36,000 pounds of chicken nuggets after rubber was reported found in some of the chicken nuggets. That same month, Perdue issued a recall after receiving complaints of wood in their gluten-free chicken nuggets."

All 143 people on board the plane survived and sustained no life-threatening injuries. The jet, which had departed from Guantanamo Bay and was operated by charter airline Miami Air International, crashed at 9:40 p.m. after passing through thunderstorms, according to CNN . It’s unknown if the weather had anything to do with the rough landing. Passengers told reporters that after a hard landing on the runway, the plane bounced, swerved, and then crashed into the water in the middle of a storm. The passengers on board were a collection of active-duty military members, their family members, and government employees. Many were traveling home to see their families. Passengers took to the wings of the plane to await rescue, and firefighters helped ferry them to safety with rafts. Twenty-one of the people on board were sent to the hospital for minor injuries. A commanding officer at Naval Air Station Jacksonville said at a press conference that the landing and the survival of all the passengers and crew amounted to a “miracle.” “We could be talking about a different story this evening,” he said. The jet did not fully sink into the water, as it came to a stop in a shallow portion of the river, but the bottom of it—including the cargo hold, where the pets were held—was submerged. It’s not yet known how many pets were on the flight, but there were at least four. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash landing. As a result, the jet has been left untouched on the site, and passengers have not yet been able to retrieve their luggage. Authorities have not yet said what caused the plane to end up in the river."
Watch Stephen Colbert do a Nixon impression that is absolutely devastating to the Republican Party under Trump.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/stephen-colbert-nixon-impression-donald-trump-scandals.html,"This is not normal! CBS There’s a fierce debate going on inside the Democratic Party right now—mostly between Joe Biden and observable reality , to be honest—over whether Donald Trump is some sort of dark aberration in American history or just a particularly exuberant expression of the greed, fear, and hatred that have powered the Republican Party for decades. But there’s one way in which Trump undeniably represents a break from the past: His braying, cracking voice is impossible for comedians to resist imitating, and nearly as impossible for them to make funny, or even tolerable. Countless late-night monologues have run aground on this shoal, because it’s hard to write jokes about Donald Trump without quoting or imitating the absurd things Donald Trump says; but as soon as you give a comedian the chance to do his voice, they’ll do it; and as soon as any version of Donald Trump’s voice goes out over the airwaves, a significant portion of the audience will be involuntarily plunged into eyelid-twitching paroxysms of rage and sorrow. That’s not exactly a comedy sweet spot, but it’s interesting, because it represents a way in which the Republicans have actually disgraced themselves in the Trump era, as opposed to just being a little more honest about who they always were and what they always wanted. Take Richard Nixon, for instance. Perhaps no Republican president before Trump did more to align the Republican Party with white supremacy —although there’s certainly stiff competition—and while every president of every party abuses their power to some degree, Nixon was forced to resign in disgrace , the very definition of overstepping your bounds. But although Republicans long ago abandoned their commitment to the rule of law and our common humanity, there was one responsibility Nixon took very seriously: He was funny in a way that insured basic minimum standards for Nixon impressionists. On Friday’s Late Show With Stephen Colbert ,* the host briefly took the audience back to the halcyon days of a more civilized era: Colbert’s Nixon impression alternates between not sounding much like Richard Nixon and not sounding anything like Richard Nixon, but it’s still funny: The victory sign, the hunched shoulders, and the basset hound jowl shake do most of the work. Even fictional characters can do a good Nixon—see, e.g., Mr. Burns’ Nixon on The Simpsons , in which Harry Shearer filters a Nixon impression through his Mr. Burns voice, itself a combination of Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Tracy Morgan set out to do a bad impression of Nixon and still couldn’t stop it from being hilarious, as this video, entitled “Tracy Morgan’s Terrible Nixon Impression” and previously hailed in the pages of Slate as “ the nation’s worst Nixon impression ,” proves. As a bonus, it also features Conan O’Brien’s Nixon: It’s true that a gifted Trump impressionist like Anthony Atamanuik can somehow turn Trump’s unbearable personal affect into laughter, but this is expert-level work: For everyday, run-of-the-mill hosts of major network late-night television shows, Trump’s voice is a tar pit where laughter goes to die. In Lincoln’s day—and even in Nixon’s—the Republican Party was committed to helping all comedians succeed, backing a slate of candidates with silly, easy-to-parody affectations ranging from stovepipe hats to handlebar mustaches. With a simple, graceful shake of his jowls, Stephen Colbert reminded the nation just how far the GOP has fallen. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

"Trump rails against Facebook's decision to ban ""dangerous individuals.""",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-rant-conservatives-facebook-ban.html,"The 2020 Election’s Approach Is No Reason to Avoid Impeachment On Twitter Friday night, President Donald Trump railed against “ the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms” and complained that conservatives were being unfairly pushed off social media. The president has on several occasions before complained of broad suppression of conservative voices by tech companies, but this time, Trump singled out a number of people, including James Woods—whom he called a “Conservative thinker”—and Paul Joseph Watson. He then proceeded to amplify the tweets of a number of conspiracy-minded accounts (including one bizarre video by an account called Deep State Exposed asserting that “the ‘elite’ proclaim America must submit to Islam or else!!!”). Most of the tweets had to do with censorship. In total, he sent out more than a dozen tweets on the subject. But the people he retweeted are not known for mainstream conservative thinking. Instead, many of them peddle right-wing conspiracy theories and overt white supremacy. The Twitter rant was sparked by Facebook’s decision to bar seven users from its services, citing its policies against “dangerous individuals and organizations.” The purge included Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, the virulent anti-Semite Paul Nehlen, and Alex Jones. In particular, Trump focused on Paul Joseph Watson, an Infowars personality known also for his conspiracy-mongering . Trump mentioned Watson in his own tweet Friday, and he retweeted a video Watson made criticizing Facebook the next morning. Watson’s conspiracies are not harmless. While it can sometimes be hard to see the ways in which “chemtrails” and 9/11 conspiracies—conspiracy theories he supports that have been popular for many years—are harmful, his efforts to push the conspiracy theory about murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich directly brought anguish to Rich’s mourning family . Besides his conspiracy-mongering, Watson is also known for his racism and sexism. He once joked that the Women’s March should be renamed “handful of self-entitled, fat, ugly feminists trying to get arrested in desperate attempt to impress any man.” He once said “science” proves African and Middle Eastern people have problems with “aggression” because of “low IQ.” He has asserted that “there’s no such thing as moderate Islam. Islam is a violent, intolerant religion which, in its current form, has no place in liberal western democracies.” But the greatest harm likely has to do with his insistence on constantly amplifying absurd right-wing fake news stories without any apparent concern for the truth. Trump also retweeted Lauren Southern, a far-right Canadian activist who has faked transitioning genders as a pretext to interview transgender activists. She claimed Black Lives Matter caused more deaths than the Ku Klux Klan. She showed up at an anti-rape protest with a sign that read, “There is no rape culture in the West.” Even actor James Woods, who has used slurs to describe Muslims, had his Twitter account briefly suspended because of a tweet that violated the site’s rules, according to CNN Business . The president has amplified the voices of racists , misogynists, and white supremacists on his Twitter feed before. But in a dust-up between tech companies and extremists over those extremists’ right to say offensive and bigoted things on those platforms, he sided explicitly with the extremists in a shared sense of victimhood. “Why is @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN, @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter & Facebook,” he said, to conclude his rant. “Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!”"
Eta Aquarids meteor shower: How to watch this weekend’s meteor shower connected to Halley’s Comet.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/eta-aquarids-meteor-shower-how-to-watch.html,"The 2020 Election’s Approach Is No Reason to Avoid Impeachment The annual Eta Aquarids meteor shower is expected to occur this weekend, reaching its peak on Monday, according to NASA. The meteor shower is a result of debris left behind by Halley’s Comet. Every year, when the earth passes through the trail the comet left behind, some of the material burns up in our atmosphere, giving us a flash of light. While the shower will be more visible for viewers in the Southern Hemisphere, those in the Northern Hemisphere should still be able to catch some of the display. Luckily, there will be no bright moon to get in the way of viewing, so if you can find a clear patch of sky, you should position yourself to face eastward between 3 a.m. and dawn. It’ll take about half an hour in the dark for your eyes to adjust, but then you should be able to spot some shooting stars. And, according to NASA, even if you can’t take the time to go star-gazing Sunday or Monday morning, you should still be able to catch some for up to a week after. Support our journalism

Country House wins 145th Kentucky Derby after Maximum Security is disqualified.,slate.com,Nick Greene,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/country-horse-wins-145th-kentucky-derby-after-maximum-security-is-disqualified.html,"I Wish Both Teams Could Lose the Warriors-Rockets Series For the first time in the 145-year history of the Kentucky Derby, the horse that crossed the finish line first was not crowned the winner. Maximum Security appeared to win by one and three-quarter lengths on Saturday, but celebrations were cut short as officials reviewed footage of the race to determine whether the horse had bumped into War of Will at the final turn. After a protracted period of deliberation, Maximum Security was disqualified and second-place Country House was announced as the winner. There’s the old question jockeys get about whether or not a horse knows he’s won a race, but, in this instance, everyone at Churchill Downs was equally confused. If you ever wanted to see “Dewey Defeats Truman” played out with horses, today is your lucky day. Maximum Security broke loose from the pack to win the 145th running of the @KentuckyDerby ! #KYDerby pic.twitter.com/WuBZIEArLm — NBC Sports (@NBCSports) May 4, 2019 According to ESPN, Country House’s jockey filed a rider’s objection after the finish to complain that Maximum Security had veered into another horse’s path. After video review, race officials disqualified the 9–2 favorite for committing the equine equivalent of changing lanes without checking his blind spot.

Facebooks Clear History tool might actually happen. Its about time.,slate.com,,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/facebook-clear-history-button-real-wow.html,"With Smarter Living, the NYT Is Making an Old Bet on Service Journalism At the height of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in May 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg floated a very un-Facebook-like idea. He said the company was building a “clear history” feature that would let users “flush” their browsing data from Facebook, much like you can erase it from your web browser. He added that the feature would start with the data that Facebook collects from “websites and apps that use Facebook’s ads and analytics tools.” The concept is something privacy advocates have long called for. Yet Zuckerberg’s apparent embrace of it came as a surprise. That’s because it runs counter to Facebook’s long history of agglomerating as much user data as it can, from wherever it can find it. So the trial balloon immediately raised three questions: 1) Really? 2) When? And 3) Really?? We now have an answer to at least the first two of those questions—and a strong hint as to the third. The answers are: 1) Yes, really. 2) This year. And 3) Well… probably really. Mostly. Until Tuesday, the “clear history” idea was starting to look like it might have been an empty promise, made by Zuckerberg under duress and quietly scuttled after the fuss died down. After initially saying the feature would take a few months to build, Facebook told the tech site Recode in December that it was “ taking longer than we initially had thought ,” citing technical obstacles. It’s an excuse that might hold more water if it didn’t come from a company that employs thousands of the world’s most skilled software developers. By last week, the press was losing patience. BuzzFeed’s Ryan Mac wrote a story headlined, “ Mark Zuckerberg promised a clear history tool almost a year ago. Where is it? ” Mac’s reporting suggested that the project was a fantasy at the time it was proposed, and may have never really gotten off the ground. “Mark just wanted to score some points,” one anonymous company source said. On Tuesday, however, Facebook gave a strong indication that “clear history” really is coming—and it attached a more credible timetable. Specifically, Chief Financial Officer David Werner told an audience of bankers, investors, and industry insiders at a Morgan Stanley conference that the feature is coming later this year—and that it would likely hurt Facebook’s targeted advertising business. “”Broadly, [clear history is] going to give us some headwinds in terms of being able to target as effectively as before,” Wehner said, per CNBC. The context is noteworthy, because Wehner wasn’t glad-handing world leaders at Davos or trying to smooth over a controversy in the media. He was warning a bunch of moneybags to expect a punch in the pocketbook. These are people who have more of a vested interest in advertising-industry profits than they have in Facebook’s public image or its users’ privacy. So if it weren’t really happening, Wehner would have little incentive to bring it up. More importantly, the fact that Facebook’s CFO is talking about the feature in terms of “headwinds” to its business suggests that it’s not mere window-dressing. The implication of my third question above—“ Really??” —is that Facebook might indeed release a feature called “clear history,” yet design it in such a way that it’s either ineffectual or unlikely to be broadly used. Facebook and other tech platforms specialize in manipulating users’ behavior via the design of their products. So they know how to bury a feature when they don’t want many people to avail themselves of it. Such a move allows them to mollify privacy critics while maintaining the status quo for the vast majority of users who aren’t aware they can opt out. That still might turn out to be the case with “clear history.” But Wehner’s statement makes it seem more likely that this is a feature Facebook expects people to actually use—perhaps because they’ll actually be able to find it. Otherwise, the effect on its ad business would be negligible. Even so, important questions remain about the feature’s design and function. One question I asked Facebook was: Will the data actually be deleted , or just cleared in some way that leaves it stored on Facebook’s servers? The answer from a Facebook spokesperson suggested it won’t be deleted, per se, though it at least reaffirmed that the data will no longer be used for ad targeting:
From a targeting and optimization perspective, Clear History will be similar to our existing partner data control in Ads Preferences­­—the data a person clears will not be used to personalize their ads. We’ll share more guidance and details on impact for advertisers as we get closer to the launch. That would be in keeping with Facebook’s early statements about the feature. In a May 2018 blog post, the company said it would “remove identifying information so a history of the websites and apps you’ve used won’t be associated with your account.” In other words, the data will still exist, it just won’t be attached to you anymore. Deleting would be a stronger step, but short of that, this seems like a relatively strong form of anonymization, if implemented carefully. Here’s hoping Wehner is right and the feature hurts Facebook’s ad revenues. Not because Facebook losing out on some profits is a good thing in itself—but because it would mean that the feature is actually doing what Facebook promised it would. Support our journalism

"SNL: Adam Sandler hosts for the first time, reprising his classic characters and performing a song about the late Chris Farley.",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/snl-adam-sandler-monologue-chris-farley-song-chris-rock-kristen-wiig-jimmy-fallon.html,"Adam Sandler, singing a song about Chris Farley. NBC Adam Sandler hosted Saturday Night Live this week for what was somehow the first time in his career, in an episode filled with nods to his time on the show in the early 1990s, his film career in the decades since, and the almost unbelievable fact that he’s never hosted the show before now. Although Sandler is a Saturday Night Live legend today, when he left the show in the summer of 1995—following a critically reviled season that spawned headlines like “ After Two Decades, How Much Longer? ” and “ Comedy Isn’t Funny ,” many of which specifically called him out as an emblem of the show’s decline—there wasn’t much sense that he was on his way to a great career. (The Associated Press story announcing his departure from Saturday Night Live summed up his non- SNL work in two sentences, one of which was, “He appeared last year in the flop Billy Madison .”) Box office success came later , critical acclaim later still , and Sandler’s return to host Saturday Night Live ? That only happened this week. Sandler opened the show with a monologue that helped explain why he has only returned for a few cameos, with an assist from Chris Rock, who has a Saturday Night Live story of his own: It’s not the first time Sandler has addressed his complicated feelings about the way he and Chris Farley left the show, but it’s the first time he did it in song. Here’s what he told the Daily Beast in 2014 :
Yes, we were [fired]. We kind of quit at the same time as being fired. It was the end of the run for us. The fact that me and him got fired? Who knows. We were on it for a few years, had our run, and everything happens for a reason. We kind of understood because we did our thing. It hurt a lot at the time because we were young and didn’t know where we were going, but it all worked out. In the decades since leaving SNL , Sandler has become part of the comedy landscape, so much so that Saturday Night Live was able to build an entire sketch around the current cast members imitating Adam Sandler characters. The appeal of getting to play one of Sandler’s dunces was so great that it attracted former cast members Jimmy Fallon and Kristen Wiig, neither of whose time on the show overlapped with Sandler’s: It’s a nice structure for a sketch that basically exists to let the cast geek out about getting to work with Adam Sandler. Sandler then revisited one of his own classic bits, returning to the Weekend Update desk as Opera Man, last seen in the days when Colin Ferguson was a household name. But Sandler saved his deepest dive into early 1990s nostalgia for his final appearance, performing a country song about Chris Farley from his Netflix special 100% Fresh . If you told a random television critic in the spring of 1995 that 24 years later, Adam Sandler would return to Saturday Night Live to perform a sincere country song about mourning Chris Farley, that critic would probably be furious that you mastered time travel, then used it to pass on news about SNL instead of bringing back a sports almanac or at least killing baby Hitler. But he or she would also be surprised that the passage of time had turned Sandler and Farley from “the guys ruining Saturday Night Live ” into beloved objects of nostalgia from the show’s glory days. Maybe there’s hope for Alec Baldwin yet. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again. Email address: Send me updates about Slate special offers.
