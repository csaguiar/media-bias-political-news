Mick Jagger’s Coming to America for Surgery?,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/mick-jaggers-coming-to-america-for-surgery.html,"Rush Limbaugh April 2, 2019
RUSH: The Rolling Stones had to cancel their tour starting later this month. Mick Jagger needs heart valve replacement surgery. He’s gonna get it done in New York this week. He was in Miami for the weekend. Why not Britain?
He’s from the U.K. Why isn’t he getting heart valve replacement surgery in the U.K. with the national health system? Well, I’m just wondering.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: Mick Jagger was yesterday down in Miami getting ready for heart valve surgery this week in New York. Seventy-five years old. Jagger was gonna go on tour with the Stones middle to later part of April and it was announced over the weekend that he had to cancel it because of a medical emergency, but nobody knew what it was.
Matt Drudge ferreted the details out, put ’em on the Drudge Report today. Jagger needs heart valve replacement surgery, 75 years old, said to be in perfect physical condition. So everybody’s expecting a full-fledged recovery on this. The Stones tour has been put back I think ’til summer, they say, when Jagger will be fit for the rigors and the grind. He’s on family vacation, spring break. 5:01 "
"‘Right to bare arms’, ‘Donlad Trump’: Error-filled assignment exposes bias against conservatives, poor state of public schools",www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/right-to-bare-arms-donlad-trump-error-filled-assignment-exposes-bias-against-conservatives-poor-state-of-public-schools.html,"American Mirror April 2, 2019
A Washington mother is raising the alarm over an Advanced Placement U.S. History lesson at her son’s high school that illustrates a pattern of bias against conservatives in public schools.
The woman, identified only as Kimberley, shared the 11 th grade AP history handout with KIRO , and discussed why she’s speaking up about it.
“I would say there has been a pervasive issue throughout our time in the district,” Kimberley said of the Edmonds School District. “We’ve been overall very happy with the school district, but there’s been kind of a pervasive political bias that I’ve noticed, all the way back to elementary school.”
“I think a lot of times, this is not even a conscious or intentional bias,” she said.
The most recent issue came in the form of a lesson designed to help students understand where they stand on the political spectrum, based on two different worksheets explaining the differences.
On one, left-wing Democrats and liberals tote signs that read “gun control” and “universal healthcare,” while those representing Republicans and conservatives supposedly want “less funding for social programs” and the “right to bare (sic) arms.” Further down the page, a political spectrum of world leaders depicts Karl Marx at the left wing extreme, and Adolf Hitler representing the right wing.
“You have a genocidal maniac identified as the right wing, and a philosopher/economist as the far left wing,” Kimberley said. “It just seems like, if you have kids trying to figure out where they fall on that spectrum, that’s an unfair example.” A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Hitler was a member of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party and espoused socialist and anti-capitalist policies.
The error-filled sheet spelled the president’s name “Donlad Trump,” and Hillary Clinton’s first name with only one L.
A second worksheet goes into more detail with other inaccurate generalizations about the “right” that clearly paint conservatives in an unfavorable light. The conservative perspective “looks to the past” with a focus on creating a society and culture that’s “exclusive,” “established,” and “nationalistic,” according to the handout. Liberals, meanwhile, are depicted as focused on the future and work to build a world that’s “inclusive,” “multicultural,” and “evolving.”
Under “beliefs,” liberals view criminals as “social and economic victims,” while conservatives supposedly believe criminals “choose to be criminals.” For the homeless, liberals view them as “downtrodden, victims of the system,” but conservatives think they simply have “no work ethic, no sense of shame,” according to the worksheet.
Kimberley contends the assignment’s perspective of liberal and conservative families was one of the issues that bothered her the most.
“A Left-wing family is shown as having nurturing parents and relationships with their children that are built on respect and trust,” she said. “Whereas the Right-wing family is depicted as — the mom is actually wagging her finger — and Right-wing parents are shown as strict, they have relationships built on respect and fear, rather than respect and trust.”
Other issues included conservatives described as voting for “aggression” and “militancy” – depicted as hawks – while dove-loving liberals support “diplomacy” and “pacifism.”
Kimberley told she thinks it’s important to help youngsters develop their own perspective on politics and social issues, and the misleading and offensive worksheets aren’t helping.
“I really try with the kids to always point out the valid concern that is at the root of opposing views, without disparaging it or belittling that concern, because I think that’s important, for kids to be able to develop their own opinions, but respect the root of what is behind the other side’s arguments,” she said.
“I feel frustrated that that is not being reflected in the schools, and so my efforts to try and create a balanced perspective for my kids are, I feel like, being undermined,” she said. “I don’t know how we can have any diversity of thought moving forward.”
Kimberley’s complaints are becoming increasingly common as public schools across the country continue to embrace political perspectives tied to one of the biggest special interests in American education – the national teachers unions.
The National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers almost exclusively support Democrats, and resources, classroom materials, and other union initiatives are always aligned with liberal progressive politics.
During the NEA’s recent Read Across America initiative last month, for example, NEA president Lily Eskelsen Garcia teamed with LGBTQ advocates to read books to kindergartners about transgender ideology.
The intent, according to the union, was to help the 5-year-olds “promote and celebrate” transgender folks, EAGnews reports. 4:51 "
Bill Maher blasts ‘fragile’ Millennials who need ‘trigger warnings and safe spaces’,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/bill-maher-blasts-fragile-millennials-who-need-trigger-warnings-and-safe-spaces.html,"Campus Reform April 2, 2019
Liberal comedian Bill Maher blasted “fragile” Millennials who want trigger warnings and safe spaces on his HBO show on Friday, and also took on students at Harvard University for protesting the fact that one of the school’s professors agreed to legally represent Harvey Weinstein.
Maher made the comments during an interview with South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg who is running for the Democrat nomination for president in 2020. Buttigieg, who is 37, is himself part of the millennial generation.
“They’re not all fragile,” Maher said, referring to Millennials, “but in general they’re fragile.” The HBO host went on to say that he was “talking about people who need cry rooms and trigger warnings and safe spaces.” It’s not the first time Maher has sounded off on topics familiar to college students. In March, Maher railed against cultural appropriation as “just made up.”
On his show Friday, Maher also took aim at Harvard University students, who recently protested Harvard Professor Ronald Sullivan Jr., who is representing Harvey Weinstein, who faces charges of rape, according to the New York Times .
“These are Harvard students who don’t understand that everybody gets a lawyer in this country,” Maher said.
Buttigieg then suggested that students were protesting because they see it as the “toleration of sexual harassment.”
“Isn’t the principle that everyone gets a lawyer in America more important?” Maher replied. A d v e r t i s e m e n t

Did Biden Brag About Groping Women Or Pay Off Porn Stars? No? OK,www.nationalmemo.com,Gene Lyons,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/did-biden-brag-about-groping-women-or-pay-off-porn-stars-no-ok/,"Gene Lyons April 2, 2019 Share If you didn’t know Joe Biden was of Irish descent, you might think he was French, or Italian. The man exudes personal warmth. He touches people, leans in close, pats their shoulders, whispers in their ears, and plants unsolicited kisses. Upon women, that is. To my knowledge, he doesn’t kiss men. That, he leaves to our Mediterranean brethren. But he hugs everybody. I have a young dog rather like Biden. Aspen loves everybody and expects everybody to love him back. At the dog park, he races joyously up to total strangers, puts his paws on their shoulders—he’s a big boy, Aspen—and gives them sloppy kisses. Not everybody’s crazy about it, but unsolicited dog kisses come with the territory. Aspen is eighteen months old, still in the baseball glove-eating stage of life. Joe Biden is 76, no longer a puppy. Indeed, I’m on record as saying he and Bernie Sanders are both too damned old to be president. Like Aspen, Biden too wants everybody to like him, and most do. Even Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in urging him to join “the straight-arm club,” of which she’s a member—“I just pretend you have a cold, and I have a cold”—adds that her grandchildren love him. “He’s a very affectionate person,” Pelosi said. Not to Lucy Flores, however. Flores is the former Nevada state legislator and Bernie Sanders activist who wrote in The Cut accusing Biden of violating her by putting his hands on her shoulders and kissing the back of her head before she took the podium at a 2014 political rally. Flores was a candidate for Lt. Governor of Nevada, a race she lost badly. “My brain couldn’t process what was happening,” she wrote . “I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “ tragame tierra, ” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” So had the vice-president touched her impurely, as they used to ask in the confessional? No, he had not, Flores wrote. Then why are we talking about it at all? Because she felt diminished. “[H]e stopped treating me like a peer the moment he touched me. Even if his behavior wasn’t violent or sexual, it was demeaning and disrespectful.” Flores later told Politico that she’d seen photos and videos of Biden behaving improperly. “When I started to see pictures of him behaving in the same way he did with me and with other women, it was very triggering,” she said. “I felt so much empathy for them…I had been in their shoes.”\ We’ll come back to the cant term “triggering.” Biden emitted his sincerest non-apology apology. He confessed to being a very tactile politician, but added that “not once—never—did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.” What else could the man say? Indeed, it appeared that Flores may have indulged in creative mind-reading. There’s a lot of that going around. After Stephanie Carter, the wife of former defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, kept seeing photos and videos of herself being hugged by Biden, she wrote that contrary to speculation, “the Joe Biden in my picture is a close friend helping someone get through a big day, for which I will always be grateful.” Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) said that another photo of Biden smooching his 13 year-old daughter was entirely appropriate. “All three of my kids have known Joe their whole lives.” A twenty-something Washington Post columnist opined that Coons was raising his children wrong. Every Democratic woman I’ve spoken with agreed with Pelosi: hands off. But also with a Facebook friend who called Biden “an anachronism in this new age of paranoia . You can kiss the back of my head when I’m nervously taking deep breaths waiting to go on stage, Joe, and I’ll be nothing but grateful for the paternal vote of confidence. My father used to do the same thing when I was scared to dive off the high board.” Which brings us back to “triggering,” and the Democrats’ growing image as the persnickety party; the party of busybodies, prigs and lifestyle commissars. The party that can’t keep its eye on the ball. For that, I turn to CNN Republican commentator, Ana Navarro-Cárdenas. Biden should keep his hands to himself, she wrote. “But pls get back to me when +15 women say he sexually harassed them, or he boasts of grabbing a woman’s kitty-cat, or he pays hush-money to a stripper who reminds him of his daughter. “I’ll wait.” IMAGE: Vice President Joe Biden announces he will not seek the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination during an appearance with his wife Jill (R) in Rose Garden of the White House in Washington October 21, 2015.

The War Against Warming: Why We Must Fight,www.nationalmemo.com,Froma Harrop,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/the-war-against-warming-why-we-must-fight/,"Froma Harrop April 2, 2019 Share
Even after Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland, a strong pacifist movement in Britain opposed a military buildup to confront Nazi Germany. It vilified Winston Churchill as a warmonger for pushing one.
“What is it that Britain and France are fighting for?” Churchill asked rhetorically in a March 1940 broadcast. “If we left off fighting you would soon find out.”
Five months later, bombs started dropping on London. Britain found itself alone and teetering on the edge of an invasion by Nazi Germany. And in these dark hours, when a militarily weak Britain suffered frightening losses on the battlefields, politicians who opposed preparing for war blamed Churchill for being a poor wartime leader.
Climate change is a very different kind of peril, but it, too, is menacing our planet with catastrophic consequences for both our natural environment and built civilization. The warnings have been coming fast and furiously for years as the powers in Washington lifted not a finger to deal with the danger. Worse, many denied it is real.
Now listen to Cathy Crain, mayor of Hamburg, Iowa, whose Missouri River town was inundated to the rooftops by apocalyptic flooding.
“I’m looking at global warming — I don’t need to see the graphs,” Crain said. “I’m living it and everybody else is living it.”
Americans are finding out why they must fight. They see the devastating fires, droughts, hurricanes and tornados. They watch towns and beautiful farmland in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri disappear under the water.
And it’s just started. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says 25 states could see moderate to major flooding through May. Some will surpass the infamous floods of 1993 and 2011.
Case in point is Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley. When the subject came around to climate change, the Republican pointed fingers at the all-purpose “radical environmentalists” for killing jobs. Now he blames them for allegedly forcing the Army Corps of Engineers — which oversees flood control efforts — to favor wildlife over farmers.
The corps serves several constituencies, but as its deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations said in a recent statement, “The Corps’s No. 1 priority in its operations is life safety.”
Thing is, for over a century, the corps has been building, building, building levees, spillways and other infrastructure to control the waters. This system is crumbling under the pressure of climate-induced flooding. You could build levees seemingly halfway to heaven with more borrowed money, but in many cases, they won’t meet the growing challenge.
And even when levees — built or sometimes removed — succeed in preventing floods in one place, they can create problems elsewhere. After all, the water has to go someplace. When a levee was demolished in 2011 to save Cairo, Illinois, from a rampaging Mississippi River, some 100,000 acres, mostly farmland, was flooded.
In his previous job as Missouri attorney general, Hawley joined a suit against Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, designed to contain global warming. President Trump applauded.
With leadership like this, the war against climate change hasn’t even reached the end of the beginning. Surrender and blaming others is not a winning strategy.

"‘What’s Next, Instagram DMs?’ AOC Burns White House Security Breaches",www.nationalmemo.com,Oliver Willis,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/whats-next-instagram-dms-aoc-burns-white-house-security-breaches/,"Oliver Willis April 2, 2019 Share
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blasted the Trump administration’s repeated failures to follow protocols that protect national security, which she pointed out could put “thousands of lives at risk.”
“We’re getting reports that there’s communication happening with Saudi officials via WhatsApp,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN reporter Manu Raju on Tuesday. “What’s next, Instagram DMs? This is completely insecure.”
The congresswoman added that “anything can get hacked” if Trump administration officials use “insecure channels of communication.”
“If we don’t know what hostile forces know about us, we are putting thousands of lives at risk,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
The House Oversight Committee, of which Ocasio-Cortez is a member, is currently investigating such potential security breaches by Trump officials.
Trump’s former deputy national security adviser, KT McFarland, reportedly used her personal email to discuss giving sensitive nuclear technology to the Saudi Arabian government.
And Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, is under scrutiny for using the messaging program WhatsApp to communicate with the Saudi crown prince — which could violate federal law requiring government officials to preserve their communications for the record, since WhatsApp is encrypted and not archived by the government.
Kushner’s decision to ignore the law and protocol is also alarming because of Trump’s decision to grant him access to classified material despite warnings from intelligence officials not to do so.
Congress is also investigating the administration’s use of security clearances after a whistleblower revealed that many others were given clearances despite “serious disqualifying issues,” such as a criminal background or troublesome foreign entanglements.
Before she spoke to CNN, Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the problems with how Kushner’s access had been handled during a hearing of the House Oversight Committee.
“Every day that we go on without getting to the bottom of this matter is a day that we are putting hundreds, if not potentially thousands, of Americans at risk,” she said.
Ocasio-Cortez advocated for issuing subpoenas to the Trump administration to solicit the details of how security clearances are granted, since the Trump team continues to cover it up.
“Every day that there is an insecure line of communication that could be leaked, that could be hacked, that could be screen-shotted, without our proper channels, is a day that we are pushing our national security at risk,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
For two years , the Republicans leading Congress ignored the rampant violations of national security coming from the Trump White House — not to mention a long list of other scandals.
But Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez are finally changing that.

Trump Admits Republicans Have No Plan To ‘Replace’ Obamacare,www.nationalmemo.com,Dan Desai Martin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/286405-2/,"Dan Desai Martin April 2, 2019 Share
Trump is still obsessed with trying to undo Obamacare and take health care from millions of Americans, but on Monday he admitted that he and his fellow Republicans still don’t have a replacement plan — and they won’t until after next year’s election.
“Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare,” he tweeted Monday night, add that Republicans won’t be voting on it until “right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House.”
That’s a far different claim than what Trump was saying just a week ago, when he insisted a group of Republican senators were hard at work crafting a magical new health care plan that will be “really spectacular.”
That was a lie. The Washington Post reported no Republicans in Congress have a health care plan, nor is there anything in the works. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chair of the Senate Finance Committee, told the Post flatly that there are no plans or efforts to draft any such plan. A White House official told the Post that there wasn’t a specific proposal from the White House, either.
But now Trump is admitting that Republicans aren’t even going to bother with an Obamacare replacement for more than a year. That means if Trump’s latest attempt to strike down Obamacare in its entirety succeeds, 20 million people could lose their health insurance and millions more with pre-existing conditions could be at risk of sharply higher health care costs — while Trump and GOP wait to see how next year’s election turns out for them.
Only if Republicans win back the House, which they might not do, will they even bother trying to clean up the mess Trump wants to make right now.
After an outcry over protections for pre-existing conditions from voters during last year’s election cycle, Trump began swearing that he vowed to keep them. And he’s still doing that now. But none of the prior plans from Trump and the GOP do that.
Those plans saw Republicans attempting to increase health care premiums, rip health care away from tens of millions of families, and take away protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions.
Republicans have promoted these ideas time and again, even as voters have a different solution in mind. The majority of voters prefer to work with the current system, and even Republicans who were polled would rather fix the system than destroy it.
Republicans have threatened, for nearly a decade, to repeal and replace Obamacare. Under Trump, they have tried and failed to do it. Now Trump is fighting in the courts to repeal Obamacare while he worries about replacing it later, but only if he and his party win in 2020. And if they don’t? The millions of Americans who’ve lost their care will be out of luck, but it won’t be Trump’s problem to fix.

"At Hearing On Equality Bill, Republicans Spew Anti-LGTQ Bigotry",www.nationalmemo.com,Emily Singer,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/at-hearing-on-equality-bill-republicans-spew-anti-lgtq-bigotry/,"Emily Singer April 2, 2019 Share
The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday held a historic hearing on the Equality Act , a bill that would legally “prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, and for other purposes.”
And while Democrats on the committee asked thoughtful questions of the witnesses — including two people who had been fired or denied medical care because of their sexual orientation or gender identity — Republicans instead built straw men arguments about why transgender individuals shouldn’t receive the same protections as everyone else.
There was GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert, the Texas crackpot who argued that allowing transgender women into women’s shelters with cisgender women (women who are not transgender) was a “war on women.”
“Women they seem to have more post-traumatic stress disorder on sexual assault, and yet we’re going to force them to have men in confined spaces in shelters where they’re seeking a refuge away from men inflicting violence on them?” Gohmert said, grossly misgendering transgender women. “And because we’re going to stand up here and say, ‘Well it’s just too bad we’re going to force men to be into your spaces and you’re going to have to like it I think is a war on women that should not be allowed.'”
Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who has gone to great lengths to protect Trump, suggested there are “bad actors” who would somehow pretend to be transgender to “exploit the provisions of this law for their own gain.”
“Consider this possibility, if President Trump were to say, ‘I am now the first female president.’ Who would celebrate that?” Gaetz said, eliciting boos from onlookers in the hearing room. “Would those who support the legislation think that was a good thing? Or would they be dismayed?”
Of course, this is a ridiculous straw man argument. Transgender individuals are discriminated against and subjected to violence at higher rates than cisgender individuals. And the thought that someone would pretend to be transgender to get rights that everyone else already had makes absolutely zero sense. Rep. Matt Gaetz, during a hearing on transgender rights, wonders what would happen if Trump were to declare himself the first female president. pic.twitter.com/uYFheZVjUN

If you thought that was the worst of the comments from Republicans on the committee, well, you thought wrong.
Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) made possibly the most insane and offensive remark of the day.
He asked Jami Contreras — a lesbian whose infant daughter was refused medical care by a doctor because the doctor didn’t want to treat the child of a same-sex couple — whether a Jewish doctor should be forced to treat a Nazi.
Yes, Buck — who was just elected chairman of the Colorado Republican Party — compared a child of lesbian mothers seeking medical treatment to a Nazi.
Contreras was clearly caught off guard by such a hateful question, comparing her gender identity to a Nazi, that she asked other experts on the panel to weigh in. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler, a Jew himself, piped in to remind Buck that Nazis are not a “protected class.”
Of course, at the end of the day, this bill would simply provide the same equality protections to LGBTQ individuals and women that cisgender men have enjoyed for centuries. And Republicans reverted to such patently absurd and vile hypotheticals because there is no good reason not to codify those rights into law.
“No one is hurt when trans people live authentically,” the ACLU tweeted as Republicans spewed their vile bigotry. “Not in the restroom. Not in the locker room. Not on the court, field or track.”

It’s April 2019: Where Are Donald Trump’s Tax Returns?,www.nationalmemo.com,Cody Fenwick,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/april-2019-where-donald-trumps-tax-returns/,"Cody Fenwick April 2, 2019 Share
President Donald Trump has promised to release his tax returns . Democrats have promised to release Donald Trump’s tax returns.
So why is it the beginning of April 2019 and we still haven’t seen his damn tax returns?
There seems to be no good reason for this concealment. Trump and his defenders have repeatedly claimed that he is waiting for an audit to be completed before he releases the returns — though this is transparently a lie, and occasionally his people have admitted as much. Even since being elected president, he has filed his taxes for the years 2016, 2017, and will soon file for 2018 if he hasn’t already — any of these returns could have been released as soon as they were finished.
Trump seems to have something to hide, to be sure. But why are Democrats in Congress dawdling in obtaining his tax returns? They ran in 2018 in part of the promise to release his returns, and as former federal prosecutor Harry Litman has argued, they have a firm legal basis for the demand: The law that permits [Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA)], as head of Ways and Means, to receive Trump’s returns is simple and clear: 26 U.S.C. §6103(f) specifies that “upon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives … the Secretary [of the Treasury] shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request.” The return is furnished in closed executive session. “Shall” means, well, shall. The language is the well-established norm, across a range of legal settings, used to denote an absence of discretion on an official’s part. It leaves no room for quibbles by the secretary. Ryan Cooper, writing for The Week , argued that not only does Congress have the legal right to request the returns, but that the mechanism for obtaining them is designed precisely for the situtation we find ourselves in:
Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to agree with Neal’s slow-and-steady approach.
“We have to be very, very careful as we go forward. It’s not an issue of just sending a letter,” she said. “You have to do it in a very careful way.”
But it’s not clear why Democrats should be “careful” about it. Republicans and the president will obviously put up a fight, but they have no legal grounds for doing so, and no moral or political grounds either. Trump promised to release his taxes, and yet he broke that promise. Democrats can even say that they’re helping Trump fulfill his own promise — in addition to living up to their constitutional oversight responsibilities.
And for what it’s worth, public opinion is strongly behind Democrats’ obtaining and releasing the president’s returns.
“Trump paying taxes isn’t the most precious issue we face, but it’s symptomatic of the central endemic problem of the Democratic Party: the fear of using power that it actually has, that it’s been given by voters, to do good things,” said Paul Blest of Splinter. “They are allergic to power. And if the Democrats can’t even use this power to do something as minor as make the tax returns of the literal president of the country public, what good can they actually be counted on to do?”
Catherine Rampell, writing for the Washington Post , noted that the tax returns could help answer important questions about the president: “From whom has Trump been getting money? To whom does Trump still owe funds, and under what circumstances might they be able to demand immediate repayment? And how much has his income gone up since he became president?”
She noted that they won’t give us all the answers we’re looking for, but the tax returns would be a start. And that’s all the more reason that we should get them as soon as possible. Share this..."
WATCH: Trump Repeatedly Demands Probe Into ‘Oranges’ Of Mueller Investigation,www.nationalmemo.com,Cody Fenwick,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/trump-repeatedly-demands-probe-oranges-mueller/,"Cody Fenwick April 2, 2019 Share
Reprinted with permission from Alternet .
While speaking with reporters Tuesday in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump repeatedly called for an investigation into the “oranges” of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.
The flub was apparently a mangling of the word “origins” — like many Republicans, the president has been trying to raise suspicions about the propriety of how the probe started, which has, in fact, been extensively reported on . Of course, anyone can mispronounce a word, or stumble over a sentence, and such slips are hardly noteworthy. But Trump repeatedly and clearly said the word “oranges” instead of “origins” and appeared unable to correct himself or even to realize that what he was saying was not only incorrect but, in context, ridiculous.

He wants to know the names of the 25 individuals who got access to sensitive classified information despite “possible foreign influence” in their background not to mention “concerning personal behavior, drug use, and criminal conduct.” (Hint: Unscramble “Ivared” and “Janka.”)
Evidently Trump aides overrode the whistleblower who flagged these security risks because such worrying behavior “occurred in the past.” So what if some top administration staffers were compromised last year, or last week. At least there’s no proof they’ve done anything wrong in the future . Yet.

I have been patiently waiting for The Providence Journal to apologize to the readers of this paper for its coverage of the Trump-Russia scam. While the paper generates little national news itself, it chooses what stories from other sources to print. The editors chose to print negative and flat-out lies about President Trump in this hoax.
You owe all of us an apology for choosing negative stories to print, while ignoring stories that portrayed President Trump as innocent. Still waiting!

Executive Editor Alan Rosenberg replies: ""We can't and won't ignore a developing national story because it is either positive or negative toward President Trump or anyone else. We have published numerous stories both of substantive developments in the Trump-Russia investigation — including indictments, guilty pleas and sentencings — and of denials of collusion by the president and his surrogates. And our six-column front-page display of the attorney general's report that the special counsel found no Trump-Russia conspiracy speaks for itself."""

The March 14 Commentary piece by abortionist Scott Walker (""Mother's health matters in abortion bill"") states that ""newly diagnosed fetal abnormalities incompatible with life"" are the reason for late abortion. Others have often conjectured the same.
The Guttmacher Institute, however, indicates that late abortions, later than 20 weeks' gestation, generally occur because patients are in conflict with their partners, because the patients took too much time to decide about the abortion, because they are depressed or on illicit substances (and a couple of other reasons).
Is this how people define ""life or health of the mother?""

Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 11:00 PM
Mary Ann Sorrentino’s March 30 Commentary piece about Robert Kraft (“Kraft deserves his humiliation”) raises several questions.
First: When Kraft pleads not guilty to the charge against him, why does she accuse him of “choosing how justice should be served” by “putting Florida law through hoops""? Last time I checked, every person in this country legally has the right to defend himself without being maligned.
Second: How does she know that “an average John” would pay a fine if he were arrested in a police sting? How many Johns has she polled?
Third: How does she know what ""hot sex"" is for an ""old buck,"" as opposed to, say, a young buck?
Fourth: On what basis does she opine that Kraft is “addicted to the thrill of power and control""? Addicted?
Fifth: Why is she so resentful of the wealth of a man who has earned it and who has given a vast amount of his wealth to this city, this state, this region, this country and the world beyond?
Sixth: Why do we need her to tell us what Kraft should do? (“He should just take the punishment and pay the fine.”) Are we unable to think for ourselves? Do we need her guidance?
Seventh: If she is “tired of all the whining about Kraft,” why does she waste space on the Commentary page whining about Kraft?
Final question: Why does The Providence Journal waste space on such drivel?

MADISON, Wis. — The Latest on the Wisconsin Supreme Court election (all times local):
11 p.m.
The campaign manager for the liberal-backed candidate in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race says the contest is ""too close to call"" and ""almost assuredly headed to a recount.""
As the unofficial vote count was nearly complete, conservative Brian Hagedorn and liberal-backed candidate Lisa Hagedorn were separated by just over 3,000 votes out of more than 1.1 million cast.
That is well within the 1 percentage point difference that allows the trailing candidate to request a recount.
Neubauer campaign manager Tyler Hendricks says ""We are going to make sure every vote is counted. Wisconsinites deserve to know we have had a fair election and that every vote is counted.""
The court is currently controlled 4-3 by conservatives. A Hagedorn win would increase it to 5-2 and insure that liberals don't have a chance at taking control in next year's election.
___
10:20 p.m.
Liberal-backed Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Lisa Neubauer has a slight lead over her conservative opponent in a race that was within the margin for a recount as the vote count neared completion.
Neubauer led by less than 7,000 votes out of more than 1 million cast, or a little over a half percentage point.
If the loser is within 1 percentage point of the winner, they may request a recount. The last time that happened in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race was in 2011.
A Neubauer win would put liberals in position to capture majority control of the court next year. A Hagedorn victory would increase the conservative majority to 5-2 and ensure it will be maintained for years.
Both Hagedorn and Neubauer are state appeals court judges. The race is officially nonpartisan but is seen as a potential barometer of the mood in Wisconsin a year before the 2020 presidential primary.
___
8:35 p.m.
Liberal-backed Lisa Neubauer holds a narrow lead over her conservative opponent in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race after early returns.
Neubauer was ahead of Hagedorn by about 7 percentage points with more than a third of precincts reporting totals Tuesday.
A Neubauer win would put liberals in position to capture majority control of the court next year. A Hagedorn victory would increase the conservative majority to 5-2 and ensure it will be maintained for years.
Both Hagedorn and Neubauer are state appeals court judges. The race is officially nonpartisan but is seen as a potential barometer of the mood in Wisconsin a year before the 2020 presidential primary.
___
9:35 a.m.
Wisconsin voters picking a new state Supreme Court justice say the partisan backgrounds and support of the candidates in the officially nonpartisan race are a major factor.
Appeals court judges Brian Hagedorn and Lisa Neubauer are facing off in Tuesday's election. Hagedorn was former Republican Gov. Scott Walker's chief attorney and is backed by conservatives. Neubauer was appointed by a Democratic governor and has liberal support.
Lana Nenide, of Madison, says she voted for Neubauer because she wants a Democratic woman representing her rights, not ""Scott Walker's puppet.""
Kathy Halverson, a Republican from Franklin, says she chose Hagedorn because ""he has morals."" Halverson says Hagedorn will ""judge according to the law.""
Conservatives have a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
___
7 a.m.
Polls are open in Wisconsin for voters to choose a new state Supreme Court justice to serve a 10-year term.
The winner in Tuesday's election will replace 85-year-old Justice Shirley Abrahamson, who is retiring.
Conservatives have been in the majority on the court since 2008, currently with a 4-3 split. If state appeals court Judge Brian Hagedorn wins the race, it would increase their majority.
A win by fellow appeals Judge Lisa Neubauer would give liberals a chance to take control of the court in the 2020 election.
Voter turnout in past Supreme Court races in non-presidential years has generally been around 20%. Voters need a photo ID to cast their ballots. Polls close at 8 p.m.
___
12 a.m.
Wisconsin voters face a partisan choice in an election for the state Supreme Court.
The outcome of Tuesday's race won't immediately change the ideological control of the court. But a victory by liberal-backed Lisa Neubauer would make it possible for liberals to win majority control in the 2020 election. She faces fellow state appeals court Judge Brian Hagedorn.
He was former Republican Gov. Scott Walker's attorney for more than five years before Walker appointed him to the bench in 2015. Neubauer was appointed by former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. Her family has deep ties to the Democratic Party.
Both Neubauer and Hagedorn insist their personal views do not affect how they would rule on the Supreme Court.
But liberal outside groups backed Neubauer, while Hagedorn won support from conservatives.

Paolino Jr.: Legalized pot would be a terrible mistake for R.I. By Joseph R. Paolino Jr. 11:00 PM
This year, legislators in Rhode Island are once again faced with calls to legalize marijuana for recreational use. If state leaders vote to permit legal access to marijuana within our borders for recreational purposes, it will be a terrible mistake.
Our state is in the midst of an addiction crisis. We have already paid too high of a price socially and economically fighting the curse of opioids and illicit drugs. It makes no sense to vow to do everything in our power to combat one drug while condoning the use of another.
As our state legislature considers this matter, we should remember the circumstances that fueled the devastating opioid epidemic. When OxyContin hit the scene in the 1990s, pharmaceutical companies and interest groups marketed the drug as a safer, less addictive alternative to pain medications on the market. What they actually sold was a powerful, highly-addictive opioid that would devastate entire families and communities.
Today, the marijuana industry tries to market their products as a safe, all-natural commodity with limited side effects. In reality, many of today’s pot shop products are more potent and processed than at any point in time, made with added chemicals for marketable qualities such as flavor and a dangerously high THC content.
I am not against the legal use of medical marijuana for those suffering from illnesses that their doctors feel could be treated with cannabis. I am, however, against the idea that we would discourage cigarettes and nicotine products while encouraging the use of marijuana in a completely recreational setting.
I do not believe that Rhode Island can fully understand the consequences of legal marijuana without further studying the impact it is having on our neighboring states. I know I am not alone in being deeply concerned about individuals getting behind the wheel after using marijuana. While our police departments have readily available tests to determine blood alcohol content, there is no common field test that assesses a person’s level of marijuana impairment. We do not have the resources to combat any increase in drivers getting on the road while under the influence of drugs.
I also worry about the consequences this will have on employment opportunities for our youth. Our state has long benefited from our relationship with government contractors and the defense industry, and we have worked hard to develop relationships with companies like Electric Boat. We have told our students that if they work hard, they can access these high-paying jobs and make a life for themselves here in Rhode Island. That simply is not true if they are unable to pass the rigorous drug tests conducted by these companies for employment.
We are setting our children up to fail by on the one hand telling them that this substance is safe and legally available to them while also telling them that the federal government will not let them secure their dream job if they take part.
The people of Rhode Island need to stand for something. We wouldn’t legalize heroin for taxes if Massachusetts chose to do, so why start here?
We have an incredibly special state, one that was founded on the idea of being different and exploring new ideas. Let’s continue on that path by not blindly following in Massachusetts’ footsteps but promoting Rhode Island as a special state that stands above the fray and holds to its principles.
If we’re going to follow Massachusetts, let’s follow its lead in education. Legalizing marijuana shouldn’t be what we stand for.

Dear Carolyn.
My nephew was born a year and a half ago. When my father learned my brother and sister-in-law did not name the baby after someone on his side of the family, which they never said they'd do, he broke off all contact with them and their children.
My mother has given up on trying to convince him to change his mind, including suggesting he see a therapist. Now she and I just try to compartmentalize it. I still love my dad, but my suppressed anger over the situation often keeps me awake at night. It hangs in the background every time I visit my parents or my brother.
I'm trying to live my own life and move on, but I still want a relationship with my family.
— The Good Kid
That signature.
It's everything. Don't you think?
You have a rigid and punitive father. You have an accommodating mother. You have, reading between the lines, a brother who is just so done with all of this, and rightly so, given the pettiness and severity of the (latest?) tantrum. A brother who I hope is creating a safe and warm family apart from and in living protest of the tyranny of your vain and self-centered dad.
Or, your ailing dad.
You don't say whether your father has always been like this, and if he hasn't, then he could be newly descending into illness instead of living out the latest test to an abusive nature.
For your purposes, though? Your father is who he is now, past or future notwithstanding, and that's the challenge you need to face. Your inability to sleep, your ""suppressed anger"" — and, oh, that signature — are all saying you can't ""compartmentalize"" this. They also say the nature of your challenge is to separate your identity and sense of well-being from the feedback loop of your father's approval.
So.
You need to know what you believe in.
You have to trust your own judgment.
And you must summon the courage to live by the code you write for yourself in those first two steps.
I would suggest a narrower, less ambitious solution if I thought one would suffice. But knowing who you are and not trying to answer to anyone but your own moral code — that is how you ""live my own life and move on,"" that is how you sleep at night, that is how you silence the noise and Kondo the clutter hanging ""in the background every time I visit.""
That is how you keep a relationship with your family while also not kowtowing to anyone, or feeling as if you have to just to hang on.
It's possible that, once you decide where you stand in this familial cold war, your father won't like your position and will cut you off, too. It's possible you can't have your integrity and your family relationships both.
However, coming at it from a position of integrity cuts through the torment. It reminds you that you had only bad options to choose from and this was the one you decided, after careful thought and self-analysis, you could live with.
Good family therapy might be just the sleep aid you need. The more years you've spent under Dad's emotional rule, the more stands between you and your peace.

Dear Amy,
I am married with three very young kids. My good friend is single.
One of the things I truly enjoy about my friend is that she is in a different place in life. Her schedule is flexible, and she is always willing to spend time with me on my tighter, more inflexible schedule. She doesn't talk about kids or husband or compare her ""mom"" life to mine.
It is so nice for me to go out together and turn off my ""mom"" brain, and to feel like a person independent of my family.
Lately, she has been asking to come over to my house to cook for my family. The first time she asked, she said she was going through a difficult time and so I told her to come on over. We had a nice time, but I felt anxious and stressed the entire meal. Later, talking to my husband, I realized it has so much to do with wanting to compartmentalize my ""worlds."" I enjoy my friend, but I don't want to have to clean my house for her. I don't want her to see my kids throwing fits at dinnertime. I don't want a potty accident to take over the evening.
I want to have one person outside of my family life that is just for me to enjoy.
I mentioned to my friend how I don't like to host, but she reinforces that I don't need to clean for her and she understands that kids can be disruptive.
I don't think she understands my anxiety around the whole idea.
Home is filled with love and laughter, but it is also where we fall apart and make chaos and create mess.
How can I tell her this, and still keep the valued friendship? Or should I just get over my anxiety about it for the good of the friendship?
— Upset
My sisters and I have a shorthand way of communicating, based on an old advertisement: ""Calgon, take me away."" When we say this to each other, we mean: ""If I don't get away from my kids, I'm going to l-o-o-o-s-e my mind.""
It's OK to see to your own needs! And you need occasional restorative time away from your family. Every parent does.
So tell your friend: ""I love my family. I love spending time with you. But what I really want, and need ... is to get away from my kids; to be me — only me — now and then. Can you help me with that?""
Your pal sounds awesome. She has needs, too! She may be longing for a good dose of what you have. I hope you will occasionally loop her into your family's poopy, messy, chaotic life. But first — you do you.
Nude pictures disturb child
Dear Amy,
Recently my neighbor boy (age 7), ran out of his house yelling that his dad was looking at naked ladies on his computer, and it was ""sick.""
Not sure what, if anything, I should have done. Should I mind my own business? Say something to dad, or ... do something else altogether?
— A Denver Fan
Any time a child is in distress — for any reason — you should first concentrate on the child, comfort the child and make sure that he is OK.
Then yes, if possible you should speak to the parent and make sure he realizes that his son ran out of the house and seemed distressed. It is best to remain neutral during this conversation with the parent, and simply report that the child was upset and that you did your best to comfort him.
Sounding off on audience recording
Dear Amy,
Thank you for your response to the ""Symphony Subscriber."" As a classical musician by profession, nothing makes me angrier than seeing someone record a performance.
Depending on the venue, ushers are not always helpful.
I have on many occasions tracked someone down at intermission and told them to delete their video, or stop recording. It is disruptive to other audience members, but more than that, it is disrespectful to the musicians. A live concert should be enjoyed in the present moment. We work very hard to create a concert experience, which is what you pay for when you buy a ticket. This is how we make our livelihood, and recordings are a separate part of that — not something we give away for free!
Thanks for your ""sound"" advice!
— Musician
Thank you -- so sincerely -- for the music you bring into the world.

Dear Dave,
I’m an admissions counselor for a university, and I make $37,000 a year. I spend a lot of time on the road, and I’m trying to get out of debt, but I have one credit card I’m still using for travel expenses. The university refunds me for these expenses, which always run $300 to $400 per trip, but usually it takes about three weeks for this to happen. Do you have any advice for someone in my situation?
Roxanne
Dear Roxanne,
Let’s set up an account, and prime the pump once. By this, I mean in the next few months I want you save up $500, then open a separate checking account for reimbursable travel expenses only. Make sure a debit card is attached to the account, too.
If you put $500 into this account one time, you’ll never have to save for it again. You’ll use some of that money for your travel expenses- on your debit card - and when they reimburse you, you’ll put the reimbursement check directly into your travel account. After you get the initial $500 in there, your travel account will run off your reimbursement checks.
Lots of people carry credit cards on the road for expenses, but often they’ll end up buying things that aren’t reimbursable. It happens to everyone who travels. Then, over time, you accidentally run up credit card debt. But when you use a debit card with an account that’s completely separate, and you’re not using it for anything except reimbursable travel expenses, it’ll help you become a lot more disciplined with your purchases on the road.
Everyone who travels a lot does some stress eating and stress spending. Why? Because being on the road often, or for long periods of time, is no fun. The only people who think travel for work is glamorous are those who don’t do it for living.

Loretta Lynn sings with friends at birthday concert,www.providencejournal.com,The Associated Press,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190402/people-loretta-lynn-sings-with-friends-at-birthday-concert,"The Associated Press Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 6:24 PM Apr 2, 2019 at 6:24 PM
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Loretta Lynn was honored like country music royalty by country and rock stars alike with gifts of flowers and songs during a concert Monday night celebrating her upcoming 87th birthday.
Lynn, whose birthday is April 14, closed out the all-star concert in Nashville, Tennessee, by singing her signature hit, ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" her first major public performance since suffering a stroke in 2017.
The Country Music Hall of Famer sat side-stage at Bridgestone Arena for the show as more than a dozen artists came to sing songs from her catalog and sing her praises to a packed arena. Keith Urban even popped out of a giant birthday cake to fulfill a birthday wish for the singer-songwriter from eastern Kentucky.
Tanya Tucker brought out a bouquet of flowers after singing ""While I'm Living"" with Brandi Carlile, and Margo Price, who is eight months pregnant, said she was giving her daughter the middle name Lynn and sang ""One's On the Way."" Alan Jackson brought her a single yellow rose in a Jack Daniel's whiskey bottle, which he called ""a perfect example of country music.""
Darius Rucker gave a rousing performance of her controversial song released in the 1970s about a woman celebrating birth control, ""The Pill,"" after explaining that no one else had picked it, so he decided to sing it.
Other artists performing during the show included Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, Little Big Town, Lee Ann Womack, Martina McBride, George Strait and more.
50 Cent sells opulent
Connecticut mansion
FARMINGTON, Conn. — Rapper 50 Cent's 50,000-square-foot mansion in Connecticut that first went on the market 12 years ago has finally sold at a fraction of the original asking price.
Jennifer Leahy, an agent at Douglas Elliman in Greenwich, tells the Hartford Courant the 21-bedroom. 25-bathroom home in Farmington was sold for $2.9 million.
The rapper, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, asked $18.5 million for the 17-acre estate in 2007. Jackson purchased the mansion in 2004 from boxer Mike Tyson for $4.1 million, and then sank millions into it in renovations.
The home also has an indoor pool, a gym, racquetball courts and a dance room.
Leahy did not disclose the buyer."

A new start for the GOP,www.providencejournal.com,providencejournal.com,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20190402/editorial-new-start-for-gop,"Editorial: A new start for the GOP Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 11:00 PM
Nationally, the Republicans are by far the most powerful party in America. They control the U.S. presidency, a majority of the U.S. Senate, 27 governorships and 30 legislatures (with split control of two). Republican appointees dominate the U.S. Supreme Court.
In Rhode Island, by contrast, Republicans seem to be at risk of going the way of the dodo. They hold no congressional seats and no statewide offices, and control a piddling 14 of the state’s 113 legislative seats.
For those of us who believe that a strong two-party system is in Rhode Island’s interest, the departure of Brandon Bell after his four years as party chairman is not unwelcome. But it is an open question whether Suzanne Cienki, who won a four-way race for the party chairmanship Saturday, will fare any better.
Ms. Cienki, 56, the former president of the East Greenwich Town Council, believes in fighting hard. Her war cry Saturday: “Heels on, gloves off. What’s left in your wallet after the Democrats have taxed everything? … I hope you are sick and tired of being taxed to death.”
But even in Republican-friendly East Greenwich, her stridency did not play very well last November, when voters threw her out of office.
She does recognize that the crucial mission of state Republicans is putting more members in the legislature. “The sole job of the state party chair is to get more bodies elected up there. How are we going to do that? Message, money, manpower,” she said.
As of now, the cupboard is virtually bare of all three.
At the same time, the state’s Republicans seem bitterly divided. Some members of this tiny, shrinking club evidently feel little loyalty to their party, which once dominated Rhode Island.
This week, Barbara Ann Fenton, the wife of two-time gubernatorial nominee Allan Fung, demonstrated her gratitude to the party by announcing she was quitting from the state committee, in protest of Ms. Cienki’s victory over her chosen candidate.
Adding to the Republicans’ challenge is the dominance of Rhode Island politics by moderate Democrats. They own the center. Should Ms. Cienki craft her message to appeal only to the hard right, the party’s prospects for success would seem limited at best.
Not that Rhode Island’s government has no potential for improvement. The state has one of America’s worst business climates, by some measures. Its public schools are shamefully mediocre. Its government is dominated by special interests and prone to corruption. Surely, a dynamic and sensible leader from the opposition could make something of that.
If there is any positive news for the state's Republicans, it is that their abysmal performance has left room for growth. After all, Donald Trump captured 42 percent of the major-party vote in Rhode Island in November 2016, the best showing by a GOP presidential contender since George H.W. Bush in 1988.
Providence College political science professor Adam S. Myers estimated that Mr. Trump carried 20 of the state’s 75 House districts. If Republicans actually fielded and financed candidates, something a serious party would do, they could make significant inroads into the legislature.
We wish Ms. Cienki well. The public interest is greatly served by hotly contested elections and two parties that can hold each other accountable. Never miss a story

2020 Census: Drive begins to count all in R.I.,www.providencejournal.com,Kevin G. Andrade,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190402/2020-census-drive-begins-to-count-all-in-ri,"2020 Census: Drive begins to count all in R.I. Kevin G. Andrade Journal Staff Writer Kevprojo Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 6:57 PM Apr 2, 2019 at 6:57 PM
PROVIDENCE — Rhode Island officially began revving up for the 2020 Census on Tuesday afternoon with only 364 days left before the count starts.
""We will be working to ensure that every Rhode Islander is a part of the 2020 U.S. Census, regardless of their ZIP code, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, level of education or level of income,"" said Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health and co-chair of the state's Complete Count Committee.
The U.S. Census Bureau is constitutionally mandated to count the U.S. population every 10 years to determine the apportionment of congressional seats and the distribution of federal funds.
According to state officials who spoke at the ""Count Me In"" event in the State House rotunda, the last census was worth $3.5 billion a year in federal money to Rhode Island.
""Without knowing the true amount of people in the state, we are at risk,"" said state Rep. Anastasia Williams, D-Providence. ""We have too much to lose, but I am confident that these dire scenarios can be avoided.""
If the count is too low, Rhode Island stands to lose one of its two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. With that in mind, several speakers called for historically undercounted populations — including undocumented residents — to participate because the information collected, by law, cannot be shared with any other federal agency.
""No matter what,"" said Marcela Betancur, director of the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University and co-chair of the Hard to Count Communities Working Group, ""we need to make sure every single person is counted.""
""[We are] not just counting but empowering and building a capacity,"" said Chanda Womack, director of Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education and the group's other co-chair. ""Everybody needs to participate in the democratic process and not have their civil rights violated.""
Hard to count communities — including marginalized racial, ethnic and immigration-status groups — make up about 24% of the state's population.
Also of concern is the proposed citizenship question currently tied up in the U.S. Supreme Court. The uncertainty surrounding its inclusion has many in immigrant communities worried.
""Many are worried about the political and social environment in which we are living,"" Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea said in Spanish. ""We have to be counted on the 2020 Census.
""I am counting on you all for 2020.""

DOT to repair Stone Bridge in Portsmouth,www.providencejournal.com,The Newport Daily News,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190402/dot-to-repair-stone-bridge-in-portsmouth,"The Newport Daily News 2:48 PM Apr 2, 2019 at 2:48 PM
PORTSMOUTH — Within the next two weeks the state Department of Transportation will begin repairing part of the Stone Bridge abutment on the Portsmouth side that recently eroded and broke off into the water.
""We will permanently stabilize this wall so it remains structurally sound and provides a safe and secure causeway to protect the environment and navigation,"" RIDOT Director Peter Alviti said in a statement Tuesday. The department owns the causeway.
The structure was once part of a bridge that connected the Island Park neighborhood to Tiverton and was rendered obsolete when the first Sakonnet River Bridge was constructed.
The abutment still serves a practical purpose as a breakwater, Town Administrator Richard Rainer previously told The Daily News. The abutment on the Tiverton side was rebuilt last fall. The $2.5-million project was paid for with state and federal grants.
RIDOT has deemed the damage to the Portmsouth side a class one emergency, meaning ""funding and other resources will be made available to repair it as soon as possible,"" the department said in the statement.
The department will meet with representatives from the state Department of Environmental Management and the Portsmouth to discuss plans for the structure."
Russell Westbrook Dedicates 20-20-20 Triple-Double To Slain Rapper Nipsey Hussle,www.newsweek.com,Donica Phifer,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/russell-westbrook-dedicates-20-20-20-triple-double-slain-rapper-nipsey-hussle-1384237,"One man dominated Tuesday's matchup between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Los Angeles Lakers.
Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook made history in his team's 119-103 win over the Lakers by posting a triple-double with 20 in each category: 20 points, 20 rebounds and 21 assists. The feat has only happened once before in NBA history when Wilt Chamberlain earned the same stat line in 1968 while playing with the Philadelphia 76ers.
Westbrook averages 23 points, 11 rebounds and 10.4 assists for the season and is on pace to earn the third triple-double season average of his career. Tuesday's game also marked the eighth 15-15-15 for Westbrook, which ties him with Chamberlain for the second-most games in NBA history.
""That wasn't for me ... that's for my bro man. That's for Nipsey,"" Westbrook told broadcaster Jason Terry in an interview after the game, referencing rapper Nipsey Hussle who was shot to death in front of his Los Angeles clothing store on Sunday.
Westbrook tweeted a photo of himself and Nipsey exchanging a hug on April 1 and also shared a photo of the rapper with the message, ""YOU’RE ONE OF ONE BRO!!! Rest Up King"" on March 31 after news of Hussle's death was reported by media.
Westbrook was one of several NBA athletes who tweeted their reactions to Hussle's death, including Lakers star Lebron James.
Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry reportedly found out about Hussle's death from teammate Kevin Durant before Sunday's game against the Charlotte Hornets.
""That was tough. Obviously surprised a lot of people,"" Curry told TMZ. ""I got to know him last year and had a great conversation about who he was as a person, what he stood for, what his message was, how he tried to inspire people considering where he grew up and how he turned that into something extremely powerful, represented an entire city.""
The man accused of killing Nipsey and injuring two others in the shooting was taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department on Tuesday.
