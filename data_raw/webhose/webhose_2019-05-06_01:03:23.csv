Commentary: Chick-fil-A and NRA Prove Democrats Can Never Be Trusted With Power,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/commentary-chick-fil-a-and-nra-prove-democrats-can-never-be-trusted-with-power/ ,"by CHQ Editor George Rasley
The recent sagas of the political discrimination against Chick-fil-A and the NRA are just two of the many cases of politically-driven regulatory action by Democrat officeholders and elected officials. What’s been done to Chick-fil-A and the NRA demonstrate just how bad life in America could get if Democrats ever return to complete control of the federal government.
In San Antonio, TX and Buffalo, NY Chick-fil-A was prohibited from expanding into those cities’ airports by Democratic lawmakers who claimed, without evidence, that Chick-fil-A discriminated against homosexuals and transgendered individuals.
The trampling of the First Amendment rights of the openly Christian business was so outrageous that the New York affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement after the chicken sandwich chain was blocked from the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.
“Government actors cannot officially silence speech or take punitive actions based on a person’s or private entity’s political viewpoints,” NYCLU Assistant Director for Legislative Affairs Erika Lorshbough said in a statement to The Hill .
“The First Amendment does not permit the NFTA to base its contracting decisions on the political views of a vendor.”
According to reporting by RedState, the Texas-based First Liberty Institute legal group sent a formal request last week to DOT Secretary Elaine Chao and US Attorney General William Barr to investigate whether the action the San Antonio City Council took against Chick-fil-A violated the First Amendment. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also directed his office to look into the San Antonio situation.
Texans are fortunate to have conservative Republican elected officials like Attorney General Paxton to defend them against Democrats bent on using the authority of their office to harass or bankrupt those whose political views differ from theirs, but New Yorkers are not so fortunate.
The NRA has been forced to file a lawsuit that alleges that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and top members of his administration abused their regulatory authority over financial institutions to threaten New York banks and insurers that associate with the NRA or other “gun promotion” groups, and that those threats have jeopardized the NRA’s access to basic insurance and banking services in New York.
As the ACLU pointed out in its friend of the court brief in the NRA lawsuit against Cuomo, political advocacy organizations like the NRA (or the ACLU or Planned Parenthood) need basic business services, like insurance and banking, to operate. The NRA says that the state, using its regulatory powers over those industries, is threatening financial companies that do business with the NRA.
As David Cole, ACLU Legal Director noted in an August 2018 column, the NRA points to both public and non-public actions taken by the Cuomo administration to penalize it for its views. State officials issued press releases and sent threatening letters to banks and insurance companies, and also allegedly communicated “backchannel threats” to companies with ties to the NRA, warning that they would face regulatory action if they failed to end their relationships with the organization.
And let’s be clear about what has been going on in New York; the state has admitted, in its own words, that it focused on the NRA and other groups not because of any illegal conduct, but because they engage in “gun promotion” — in other words, because they advocate a lawful activity.
If this sounds vaguely familiar it should, because it is very similar to what the Obama administration did in its so-called Operation Choke Point.
As John Berlau, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, wrote in a 2018 column for Forbes, documents obtained through discovery and introduced in a lawsuit stemming from the Obama administration’s “Operation Choke Point,” show that powerful bank regulatory agencies engaged in an effort of intimidation and threats to put legal industries they dislike out of business by denying them access to the banking system.
Mr. Berlau found that in 2011, an FDIC guidance document featured a chart of business categories engaged in what it called “high-risk activity.” These included “dating services,” “escort services,” “drug paraphernalia,” “Ponzi schemes,” “racist materials,” “coin dealers,” “firearm sales,” and “payday loans.” The FDIC would post this and similar lists in other guidance documents and on its web site.
A staff report of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, reviewed for Berlau’s column, puzzled over many of these categories. “FDIC provided no explanation or warrant for the designation of particular merchants as ‘high-risk,’” the report observed. “Furthermore, there is no explanation for the implicit equation of legitimate activities such as coin dealers and firearm sales with such patently illegal or offensive activities as Ponzi schemes, racist materials, and drug paraphernalia.”
In 2014, the Washington Times reported that a number of gun shops had their bank accounts abruptly frozen or terminated. One shop owner received a note from his bank stating that “while this letter in no way reflects any derogatory reasons for such action on your behalf,” his “line of business is not commensurate with the industries we work with.”
The list of “high risk” businesses was nothing but pure liberal politics, because, as George Mason University law professor Todd Zywicki noted in the Washington Post , “Notably absent from the [Obama] FDIC’s hit list, for example, are abortion clinics [and] radical environmental groups.”
It took the election of Donald Trump and a diligent investigation by House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, chaired by Republican Rep. Blain Luetkemeyer (MO-3), to bring Operation Choke Point to an end. However, as what’s going on with Chick-fil-A and the NRA prove, there remains no protection except the ballot box to curtail the ability of Democrats to shut down arbitrarily whole classes of businesses they deem to be “politically incorrect.”

"Microsoft Ignored Numerous Cases of Sexual Harassment, Employees Say",tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/microsoft-ignored-numerous-cases-of-sexual-harassment-employees-say/ ,"by Tim Pearce
Microsoft leadership is conducting a review of numerous employee sexual harassment claims the company’s HR department did not address, according to a string of employee emails reviewed by Quartz.
After one woman employee emailed several of her colleagues looking for advice on how to move up at Microsoft, an email chain began that resulted in more than 90 pages worth of messages detailing harassment and discrimination cases allegedly ignored by HR.
“This thread has pulled the scab off a festering wound. The collective anger and frustration is palpable. A wide audience is now listening. And you know what? I’m good with that,” one Microsoft employee said on the email thread.
One woman in the thread detailed an event in which a Microsoft employee asked her to sit on someone’s lap during a meeting with other Microsoft employees present. At the time, the woman was serving as a senior level Microsoft employee, known as a “Microsoft partner.”
“As a Microsoft Partner, [I] was asked to sit on someone’s lap twice in one meeting in front of HR and other executives,” she wrote on the chain of emails, according to Quartz. “I can assure you that nothing was done. I alone objected and cited Microsoft policy. The person said that he did not have to listen and repeated the request a second time. No one said anything.”
Microsoft’s head of human resources Kathleen Hogan weighed in on the thread of emails March 29 pledging to personally look into the allegations and grievances listed on the thread, according to her email which was shared with The Daily Caller News Foundation.
“While reading some of this is very disheartening, I am proud and encouraged to see people empowered to speak up, say this is not right, and stand together for change. Thank you,” Hogan said.
“The topic was addressed in the Monthly Employee Q&A with [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella]. It was a powerful dialogue,” a Microsoft spokesperson told TheDCNF in a statement.
Microsoft has come under scrutiny for sexual harassment in the past. In March 2018, court filings showed that women at the company filed 238 internal complaints alleging discrimination and sexual harassment between 2010 and 2016, according to Reuters.
The court documents resulted from a lawsuit brought in 2015 by a female Microsoft engineer alleging discrimination.

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke made five false statements in an attack on President Donald Trump this week when he was confronted over why he compared the president to the Third Reich.
""I compared the rhetoric that the president has employed to the rhetoric that you might have heard during the Third Reich,"" O'Rourke said. ""Calling human beings an 'infestation' is something we might have expected to hear in Nazi Germany.""
""Describing immigrants who have a track record of committing violent crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans as 'rapists and criminals,'"" O'Rourke continued. ""Seeking to ban all Muslims, all people of one religion, what other country on the face of the planet does that kind of thing or in our history or in the history of the western world?""
""Putting kids in cages,"" O'Rourke added. ""Saying that neo-Nazis and Klansman, and white supremacists are 'very fine people.'""
WATCH: Democrat Beto O'Rourke lies a lot right here: -Trump said “we have an 'infestation' of MS-13 gangs in certain parts of our country” -The travel ban is not a Muslim ban -Trump never said neo-Nazis and KKK members were ""very fine people"" -The remaining comments need more context pic.twitter.com/vwhSlw2IlG — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 6, 2019
O'Rourke's claim that Trump called ""human beings an 'infestation'"" is highly misleading.
On July 3, 2018, Trump slammed the notoriously hyper-violent MS-13 street gang in a tweet, writing: ""When we have an 'infestation' of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal (elements) that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do!"" When we have an “infestation” of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2018
Here are just some of the crimes that MS-13 gang members have been implicated in:"
Trump Resister Encouraging Illegal Teacher Strikes in Tennessee Has Links to a Left-Wing Organization That Received Funding from George Soros,tennesseestar.com,Laura Baigert,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/trump-resister-encouraging-illegal-teacher-strikes-in-tennessee-has-links-to-a-left-wing-organization-that-received-funding-from-george-soros/ ,"An activist group, Tennessee Education Report, has ramped up its efforts in encouraging teachers in the state to strike through a series of three posts in as many weeks on its blog, as The Tennessee Star reported .
Andy Spears is the head of the Tennessee Education Report.
“Teachers in West Virginia, Arizona, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Los Angeles have experienced some level of success in recent strikes. Teachers in Virginia were on strike today. These strikes have earned the support of parents and community members and have yielded tangible results both in terms of new investments in schools and increased political power for teachers,” Spears wrote in a January article titled, “ When are teacher strikes coming to Tennessee ?”
“Here in Tennessee, however, teachers have yet to strike. In fact, it’s difficult to find serious discussion of a strike. Sure, our investment in schools is less now than when Bill Haslam took over ($67 less per student in inflation-adjusted dollars). And yes, our teachers earn among the lowest salaries in the region with no significant improvement in recent years. Oh, and our own Comptroller says we’re at least $500 million short of what we need to adequately fund schools. A closer look at what the state’s BEP Committee leaves out reveals that number is very likely $1 billion,” he added.
“So, when will Tennessee teachers strike?” Spears wrote.
This, despite the fact that teacher strikes are illegal in the state of Tennessee.
Here’s what the law states:
Tennessee Code Annotated 49-5-606, Education Personnel, Professional Educators Collaborative Conferencing Act of 2011, Unlawful Acts (b) It is unlawful for a professional employees’ organization or its representatives to (4) engage in a strike; (5) urge, coerce or encourage others to engage in unlawful acts as defined in this part
and
Tennessee Code Annotated 49-5-607 Strikes – Remedies (5) When local boards of education have determined which employees have engaged in or participated in a strike, the employees may be subject to dismissal and, further, shall forfeit their claim to tenure status, if they have attained tenure, and shall revert to probationary status for the next five-year period. Any professional employee who engaged in, or participated in, a strike and who is not a tenured teacher may also be subject to dismissal.
A commenter on Spears’ article if it is illegal for teachers to strike in Tennessee. Spears responded, in part, “Yes, striking is technically illegal” but that it is also illegal in other states, parenthetically referencing Kentucky and Ohio.
Despite the potential loss of a job and forfeiture of tenure status for striking, Spears told the commenter, “those telling you ‘not to strike’ are not on your side.”
Strong Schools Connection
Strong Schools is a Political Action Committee (PAC) that was started in 2014 and focused on the May primary elections for County Commission in Sumner County. The group, with Andy Spears as its executive director , favored additional allocations by the Sumner County Commission to Sumner County Schools.
Williamson Strong , based in Williamson County, Tennessee, sprang up at around the same time also with a similar focus on elections.
While “strong schools” organizations present as developing organically out of a local need to support schools, particularly with a view toward additional funding, an internet search will reveal that the moniker is used in various places around the country, and using similar messaging.
In 2014, Strong Schools supported candidates in Sumner County defeated many of the conservative candidates running for County Commission. Just a few months later, a 24 percent property tax increase was approved with all of the Strong Schools candidates voting in favor of it.
For the August 2018 general election, Sumner’s Strong Schools PAC once again endorsed County Commission candidates. The endorsements included candidates running as Democrats, Independents and Republicans, but none that identified as conservatives.
Most of the recent public posts to Sumner’s Strong Schools Facebook page are from Spears’ Tennessee Education Report.
The most recent Tennessee Education Report post dated April 5, tells of a parent group – Tennessee Strong – and the plan for action regarding proposed “voucher” legislation at the Cordell Hull Building at noon on Tuesday, April 9.
Link To George Soros-Funded Organization
Another one of Spears’ organizations, Tennessee Citizen Action , is a “member organization” of People’s Action Institute or its associated 501(c)4 or People’s Action, according to Influence Watch , a Capital Research Center project.
Indeed, the People’s Action website states that it is a national organization that is driven by local and state organizing. The site encourages, “Take action in your community by joining one of our member organizations,” under which 26 states are listed, including Tennessee. Tennessee’s only listed member organization is Tennessee Citizen Action , that lists Andy Spears as its Executive Director .
“People’s Action Institute is one of the most aggressive left-wing advocacy organizations” according to Influence Watch. The group formed in 2016 from the merger of several progressive agitation groups, including National People’s Action, Alliance for a Just Society and USAction Education Fund, also says Influence Watch.
According to its website , “The mission of People’s Action Institute is to advance a long-term agenda for racial, economic and gender justice by investing in powerful state and local organizations and campaigns that win real change in people’s lives.”
With People’s Action Institute or its associated People’s Action apparently not disclosing its donors, Influence Watch looked at contributions by progressive foundations to its predecessor organizations and found that George Soros’ Foundation to Promote an Open Society was one of the substantial contributors.
Activist Facts is a website created by Center of Organization Research and Education (CORE), through analyzing media clippings official statements and government documents that includes a database of detailed information about organizations and activists.
Activist Facts calling out National People’s Action , one of the predecessor organizations to People’s Action, for its actions and funding, says “The Chicago-based, union-associated, and George Soros-funded organization is somewhat notorious for radical, over-the-line campaigning tactics that resort to demonstrations in residential neighborhoods designed to intimidate employees of financial services firms.”
National People’s Action, according to Activist Facts, “is heavily backed by left-wing foundations in the United States,” having received $1.2 million since 2009 from multi-billionaire financier George Soros’s Foundation to Promote Open Society.
People’s Action Institute’s director is George Goehl, who co-sponsored a demonstration at the U.S. Mexico border against the separation of immigrant families. Goehl was one of eight credited by left-leaning newspaper The Guardian as “leaders of the grassroots resistance” to Donald Trump.
Resisting President Donald Trump
Resistance to Donald Trump is another area where Spears’ aligns with People’s Action’s Goehl.
While Tennessee elected Donald Trump as President of the United States with nearly 61 percent of the vote and more than a 25 percent margin over Hillary Clinton in 2016, Spears protested the President at a 2017 rally in Nashville.
Spears looked proud as he displayed a banner outside the rally disparaging the President, a picture of which was shared on Twitter .
In another tweet, Spears replied to then U.S. Senator Bob Corker that @realDonaldTrump, using the President’s Twitter handle, is the greatest threat our nation is facing.
The greatest threat is @realDonaldTrump why do you insist on standing by him? https://t.co/JaF9bbHCDN

As the Executive Director of Tennessee Citizen Action, Spears wrote a piece for the OurFuture.org blog, which bills itself as the “daily progressive strategy and insights from People’s Action.” In the article , Spears tells of a march against Trump’s planned repeal of Obamacare held in March of 2017 organized by a coalition including his Tennessee Citizen Action, Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC), Nashville Indivisible, Planned Parenthood and others.

Pence Announces More Sanctions on Venezuela as Chaos Continues Under Socialist Dictator,tennesseestar.com,Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/pence-announces-more-sanctions-on-venezuela-as-chaos-continues-under-socialist-dictator/ ,"by Evie Fordham
The U.S. will impose even more sanctions on Venezuela after recognizing the rival of socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro as the country’s leader in January, Vice President Mike Pence announced Friday at Rice University in Houston.
The U.S. is targeting 34 vessels owned or operated by the nation’s state-run oil firm PDVSA and two companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba, Pence said.
A word to this rising generation: Those of you who feel drawn to the siren song of socialism, be careful what you wish for. Socialism is not the road to freedom. Socialism is the road to government control. And it grows in the soil of censorship. pic.twitter.com/WZ7uNNMbIg
— Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) April 5, 2019
“The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, but freedom has the momentum … Nicolas Maduro must go,” Pence said. U.S. President Donald Trump shunned Maduro and recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido in January , as did other countries, including Brazil and Canada.
“Thousands of Venezuelan children are starving at this very hour,” Pence later added. He also was heavy-handed in his criticism of Cuba.
“Cuba’s leaders are the real imperialists in the western hemisphere. The truth has to be told. … Cuba’s influence has driven Venezuela’s failure,” Pence said.
The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, and freedom has the momentum. Nicolas Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolas Maduro must go! pic.twitter.com/GaLwgUa6T6
— Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) April 5, 2019
U.S. sanctions already in place to pressure Maduro include those on BANDES, the country’s national development bank exploited by Maduro’s “inner circle,” and on Minhervin, its state-owned gold-mining company. Pence said Friday the U.S. is considering additional sanctions on Venezuela’s financial sector.
Members of the military still loyal to Maduro have blocked shipments of aid into the country , and Maduro and his subordinates in March blamed the country’s widespread power outages on sabotage, cyber attacks and even Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.
Pence and Trump met with Guaido’s wife Fabiana Rosales in the White House March 27.
“I said to her then we know that the Venezuelan people will never be intimidated and neither will we. She’s a remarkable young woman standing beside her courageous husband,” Pence said Friday.
Pence will speak to the United Nations Security Council about Venezuela later in April.

-Enforce E- Verify and start locking up companies knowingly hiring illegals
- Enforce theft of ID and stealing of SS numbers laws which are felonies!! We Americans could go to jail for years. Only a few of these arrests would be necessary to send a message. Just make sure you get hard core bad illegals first or the MSM will scream ""breaking up families"".
-Make it a Fed Rule to stop all Federal aid, stipends, food stamps to illegals
These three along with above would bring immigration to almost a halt.
Finally have DOJ sue to not allow Anchor Babies. This never was the intent of the 14th Amendment/ It was to ensure that slaves would be granted citizenship as some Southern States were passing laws to not consider slaves citizens.

And Kris Kobach is the guy to replace her. We need somebody who can use ""Critical Thinking"" TO PERFORM AND NOT WAIT TO BE TOLD HOW TO STOP THE ILLEGAL INVASION OF THESE COCKROACHES."

The commercial trucks were all waiting in a closed line.
The Border Patrol said they had to take the agents that inspect the trucks to work at other points on the border.
So in essence that port was shut down to commercial traffic..
I am sure this was one intentionally instead of Trump completely closing the border.
Hopefully, Mexico will get the message.
Kobach is right on."

It's not making sense that he hasn't done more. Any move likely to be halted by Democrat lawmakers from the bench should have been done a year and a half ago so it could have already been fast tracked through the Supreme Court and we would know what actions he can take that can't be blocked. At this point it is obvious he is stalling. What good is it going to do us for the President to threaten to close down trade and borders with Mexico an entire year from now when the crisis began years ago and is reaching a peak? To me it doesn't make sense.
