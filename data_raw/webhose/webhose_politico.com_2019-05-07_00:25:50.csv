They all want, from what I've heard, a legal orderly process that respects the laws including the law of granting asylum to the persecuted. Instead of applying the law, separating the illegal from the legal immigrants, this administration is following Trump's latest declaration, that America is FULL (his caps, not mine). Trump is confusing ideology with the law, bigotry with democratically passed statutes. If Trump doesn't like it, change it in Congress not like some autocrat. Find ways to process these people in a humane way, that is his responsibility. Trump is a failure because he's an autocrat, only his way counts, a demagague who lies to America and misdirects responsiblity onto others. When it comes down to it, Trump can't work with others, he has to be calling all the shots, a strongman, our despot. His response is the extreme and untrue position to misdirect, scapegoat others with open borders lies."

Shortly after World War I a burst of nativism spread over the USA and highly restrictive immigration laws were passed that to all practical purposes cut off immigration from southern and eastern Europe. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, needing employees for its lowest paid and dirtiest jobs, most especially at its Coke Works in Hellertown, turned to Mexican labor, importing a large group of workers with an arrangement with the Mexican government. Which is why in my time there was a large group of Hispanic workers in that department, many of whom were descendants of those Mexican laborers of the 1920's."

Alex Wong/Getty Images The Forgotten Reason Congress Needs to See the Mueller Report Legislators have a responsibility to police obstruction of justice, according to the Constitution. By ASHA RANGAPPA Continue to article content
Asha Rangappa is senior lecturer at Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs and former special agent in the Counterintelligence Division of the FBI.
News that Attorney General William Barr might have mischaracterized special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on obstruction of justice by the president has increased calls for Barr to release the report to Congress. If Barr refuses to do so and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler issues a subpoena, we may be in for a separation of powers showdown—and a central question will be the legal basis upon which Congress is entitled to see the fruits of Mueller’s investigation.
The argument for Congress obtaining Mueller’s full report on obstruction is typically based on its constitutional power to impeach: Since Congress alone has the power to take action against the president, if he has broken the law or abused his power—which is true if the Justice Department adheres to its policy of not indicting a sitting president, even if it is not settled law—Congress would by necessity need to see the evidence Mueller has gathered to determine if impeachment is warranted. If lawmakers weren’t able to see the report, then the president would effectively be immunized from accountability for wrongdoing while he is in office, putting him above the law. Story Continued Below
This is a powerful argument in the battle that could ensue in the coming weeks. But it overlooks an additional constitutional basis that Congress has for reviewing the president’s conduct: Congress has a responsibility, rooted firmly in the Constitution, to safeguard the integrity of the justice system, including to prevent obstruction of justice. Therefore, Mueller’s findings are as much about whether President Donald Trump has stepped on Congress’ toes as it is about whether he broke the law.
In contesting a subpoena from Congress, the White House likely will make its favorite defense, which is that the president, legally speaking, can’t obstruct justice. This “unitary executive” theory rests on Article II of the Constitution, which gives the chief executive the power to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” According to this view, this language means the president alone is in charge of which cases to pursue in the justice system: If he decides to stop an investigation, that is his prerogative, and his reasons for doing so are beyond the purview of investigators, Congress and the courts. A year before being confirmed as attorney general, Barr laid out an ancillary proposition in a long and rambling memo to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, arguing the president can’t be investigated for obstruction based on something that is, on its face, a valid exercise of his power — like firing the FBI director. According to Barr, questioning the motives behind such an action would have disastrous consequences and open a Pandora’s box of potential inquisitions into “all exercises of prosecutorial discretion.”
The problem with this defense is that it conflates enforcement of the laws—a power that resides in the executive branch—with the administration of justice, which is constitutional responsibility that is shared by all three branches, including Congress. When it comes to the administration of justice—and those who would thwart the integrity of that process—Congress has a big role to play.
The idea of obstruction of justice has its origins in an 1819 Supreme Court case, McCulloch v. Maryland (a case you might be familiar with if you’re a Hamilton fan), that challenged Congress’ power to create a national bank. The court found that Congress’ authority to create a bank—even though not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution—stemmed from its power to create laws “necessary and proper” for executing its explicit powers, like collecting taxes, borrowing money and regulating commerce. Importantly, the court noted that under the same reasoning, Congress could similarly pass laws which are “necessary and proper” to execute the powers of the other branches, as well. As an example of the latter, the Supreme Court pointed out that Congress could pass laws to ensure the effective functioning of the courts, noting that crimes like “falsifying … a process of the court,” or perjury, were “conducive to the due administration of justice.” In other words, the court made clear that Congress has the constitutional authority to ensure that the justice system can function without malevolent interference: This is exactly what obstruction of justice is about.
As courts have observed in more recent cases, it makes sense that Congress would be entrusted with safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process. After all, Congress itself is responsible for creating all federal courts apart from the Supreme Court. Protecting the procedure through which cases are investigated, tried and adjudicated is what allows the judicial branch to function as a coequal branch—if defendants could derail cases, mislead investigators or lie to the court with impunity, courts would cease to have the ability to administer justice at all. This is why “process crimes”—the family of crimes that includes not only obstruction of justice, but false statements, perjury, witness tampering and contempt of court (a mechanism by which the judiciary can assert its own interest in fair administration of the laws)—are indispensable to the rule of law: They ensure that the integrity of the justice system is maintained from start to finish. If it’s Congress’ job to create rules that protect the courts’ ability to do their job, then it’s also Congress’ duty to get to the bottom of whether the president has tried to thwart those efforts.
In short, while the president can decide what cases to pursue, it’s Congress’ job to protect how they move through our judicial system. In fact, understanding obstruction of justice as an expression of Congress’ constitutional power to safeguard the judicial process means that contrary to Barr’s assertions, the motive behindthe obstructionmatters—particularly when it comes to the president. Precisely because the test for obstruction of justice is whether someone acted with a “corrupt” motive, the crime gets to the heart of whether Trump has upheld his oath to ensure “faithful” execution of the laws—and gives the “take care clause” meaning and accountability. If there is evidence, for example, that Trump tried to stop the Russia investigation to shield his own private conduct because it is illegal, politically damaging, or even merely embarrassing to him personally, then he has not only violated the U.S. legal code, but also his own constitutional duty to enforce the laws in good faith.
It’s because the president holds such immense power that the obstruction of justice law not only applies to him, but applies especially to him: When he abuses that authority, he is not only potentially breaking the law, he is encroaching on Congress’ constitutional interest in the administration of justice—which means Congress has a lens, independent of its impeachment power, through which to review his actions. The full details of Mueller’s report will reveal if Trump used his power to undermine the efforts of the coequal branches to uphold the rule of law—and Congress has every right to find out. "

Are Georgetown Students About to Make History on Racial Reparations?,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/09/georgetown-unviesrity-reparations-slave-trade-226581,"In September 2014, a Georgetown junior published a column in The Hoya , the student newspaper, with the headline: “Georgetown, Financed by Slave Trading.” It unearthed a known but largely forgotten history: that the esteemed Jesuit university had saved itself from financial ruin in 1838 by selling 272 enslaved people. The sale had been orchestrated by one of the school’s presidents, Thomas Mulledy, himself a Jesuit priest, and the namesake of a residence hall that was at the time of the article undergoing renovations. The author, Matthew Quallen, urged the administration to strip Mulledy’s name from the building. Quallen’s demand was effectively the first shot in what has become a four-and-a-half-year debate over how the school should atone for its slave-holding past. In September 2015, Georgetown’s president, John J. DeGioia, impaneled a working group of academics, administrators, and students to study the issue. Two months later, black students staged a sit-in in his office successfully demanding the removal of names like Mulledy’s, which still graced several prominent buildings on campus. In 2016, the university agreed to give admissions preference to descendants of the 272 slaves; and the first two descendants arrived in the fall of 2016. College officials and the Jesuits held a mass of contrition in the spring of 2017 as a formal mea culpa for the sale.
But the perception has grown among some of the approximately 7,000 undergraduates that the university has moved too slowly. There is still no public marker of that dark chapter of Georgetown’s history. Most importantly, the university still has not addressed what many saw as the most crucial element in the working group’s report: financial compensation for the estimated 4,000 living descendants. In a word, reparations.
This week, Georgetown students are attempting to change that.
On April 11, undergraduates will vote on a referendum to create a $27.20 per semester student fee to create a fund that would benefit the descendants through education and health care initiatives in the Louisiana and Maryland locales where many of them still live. If the measure passes, and the university’s board of directors approves, it will mark the first time a major American institution has gone beyond the platitudes of “dialogue” and actually compensated the victims of slavery. And it comes at a moment, not entirely coincidentally, when the conversation about America’s racial reckoning has suddenly emerged as a subject many progressives are using to winnow the sprawling field of Democrats in the 2020 presidential campaign.
Top: Graduate student Elizabeth Thomas, her brother, Shepard Thomas, a junior, and Mélisande Short-Colomb, a junior, all descendants of the slaves in the 1838 sale, stand outside Anne Marie Becraft Hall. Bottom: Dr. Marcia Chatelain, an associate professor of history and African American studies and Dr. Adam Rothman, an associate professor of history, were both members of the working group impaneled by university administrators to study slavery and its legacy. | André Chung for Politico Magazine
“What is happening right now on Georgetown’s campus is a reflection of a larger political climate, in which, I think, people are taking seriously what anti-racist action looks like,” said Marcia Chatelain, a professor of history and African American studies and a member of the president’s working group. “So it’s not just being nice to each other or saying racism is a bad thing. It’s about actually taking account and responsibility for the ways that these decisions and processes in the past shape contemporary life.”
And while the Georgetown student fee, which would raise about $400,000 in the first year, does not come close match the multi-billion-dollar price tags of the national reparations projects being discussed by presidential hopefuls, its mere existence indicates the degree to which an idea once thought to be impractically extreme has now moved into the mainstream. (On Monday, Senator Cory Booker introduced a bill to study racial reparations for African Americans, a companion proposal to one offered in the House by Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee.)
William Darity, Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University and one of the leading scholars on the economics of reparations, said he was “admiring” of the student efforts, while also pushing them to lay the groundwork for a nationwide effort that avoids “piecemeal” solutions. “We do need to move away from viewing this as a matter of individual guilt or individual responsibility that can be offset by individual payments, towards the recognition that this is a national responsibility and a national obligation that must be met by the federal government,” he said.
Mélisande Short-Colomb, of New Orleans, is a descendant of the GU272 and a sophomore at the University. One side of her family, the Queens, were part of an 1810 Supreme Court case where Francis Scott Key represented them in their bid for freedom. | André Chung for Politico Magazine
Indeed, the debate on campus mirrors some of the wider discussion about the nature of collective responsibility and whether there is such a thing as a statute of limitations on a crime of such magnitude. Like the American public at large, Georgetown students are far from unanimous in their support for the reparations fee. For one, it puts the burden of paying on students instead of the university. It raises the cost of attendance for families, many already on shoestring budgets. Some black students wonder why, if they too are descended from slaves, they should pay reparations they feel entitled to themselves.
“That’s the problem, people don’t want to be uncomfortable,” said Mélisande Short-Colomb, a sophomore and descendant who came to Georgetown at 63. “Everything happens for students here on campus. If you can receive a benefit, are you not capable of extending a hand in service? … Are you capable of washing feet?”
***
Like many other top-tier American colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Brown, and the University of Virginia, Georgetown’s ties to slavery pre-date the Union. And in Georgetown’s case, they persisted even after the sale splintered 40 families and shipped them to plantations in Maryland and Louisiana. Slaves continued to wash the clothes of white, wealthy students from landowning families until Emancipation . After the end of the Civil War, black people continued to work on campus as servants, and integration of the student body wouldn’t happen until the first black undergraduate was admitted in 1950. To this day, the colors worn by Georgetown’s basketball team, Blue and Gray, are an homage to Union and Confederate military uniforms.
“The story of Georgetown, the Jesuits, and slavery is such a vivid microcosm of the entire history of American slavery, going back to the early origins, colonial settlement, all the way through Emancipation and beyond,” said Adam Rothman, a professor of history, and the curator of the Georgetown Slavery Archive. “You can tell the whole history of American slavery through this particular story.”
Georgetown students vote whether or not to add reparations fee for slave descendants

Rothman takes no public stance on the referendum so as not to intrude in an initiative that he sees as belonging to the students. But he does encourage them to know their history. “A partial truth is not the truth,” he told me on a recent morning in his office.
And that history continues to emerge in shocking ways.
Kuma Okoro, a junior studying international political economy, said he was moved to action when he learned that during construction of a residence hall in December 2014, workers had unearthed a human thigh bone in the site of a segregated cemetery that is known to have had remains of slaves and free blacks. The discovery was kept under wraps until August of last year. “For me, that was, like, crazy. But it also kind of showed that they don't really care, right? The university's goal is to keep the conversation controlled and keep everybody moving along.” He reached out to Short-Colomb, and within a month they were having meetings with other advocates of color in what would become the group Students for the GU272.
Students were already frustrated by the administration’s refusal to erect a memorial honoring the 272 slaves. A student proposal in September 2018 to construct a five-foot-tall, illuminated, marble and granite block, completely free of cost, to be placed near the residence hall built on the segregated cemetery, was politely rebuffed. The president’s office, a representative wrote in an email reviewed by POLITICO, was focused on “developing a framework for dialogue.” It was committed to “engaging these important topics.” “Patience and understanding” were appreciated.
Despite its inaction on the memorial proposal, the university has not totally ignored the recommendations that emerged from the working group’s 104-page report. Senior administrators are in the middle of tightly guarded talks with descendants, mediated by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, to figure out the right steps for atonement. A grant from the Andrew Mellon Foundation has funded faculty positions and fellowships to study slavery. Some professors have dedicated entire classes to discussing the conflict between the school’s founding principles, rooted in Catholic beliefs, and the moral stain that sustained it.
Nevertheless, the pace of atonement has led to impatience. “What they were doing was more like kiss and hug babies ... to handle the media attention that was present at the time,” Shepard Thomas, a junior studying psychology and one of the first descendants to be admitted under the new admissions policy, told me. “Yeah, it’s important to rename buildings. [But] what’s legacy status if they can't go to high school? You know, what are you promising at the end of the day?”

Last summer, Thomas, who comes from New Orleans, visited Maringouin, a small town outside of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, whose 1,000 residents are overwhelmingly descended from the 1838 sale. What he saw there—a town with a dearth of jobs, an absence of quality secondary schools, and a median income ($36,518) far below the national median ($57,617)—spurred him to action. (Not all of the descendants think Georgetown has the wherewithal to solve the real problems that beset places like Maringouin, Chatham, and Terrebonne Parish. Jessica Tilson, a descendant from Baton Rouge, recently told me: “What Maringouin needs is something Georgetown students can’t provide — and that’s jobs.”)
Last fall, instead of dwelling on what the university hadn’t done, a group of students gathered repeatedly in Short-Colomb’s dorm to brainstorm how they could empower the student body to do what the administration had declined to do. They studied the legal intricacies of nonprofits. They drafted a resolution to permit a vote on the fee and saw it through four sessions of debate in the student senate. Finally, on February 3, the resolution passed, setting up the vote for April 11.
The precedent-setting measure, which they have termed a “reconciliation fee,” would create a nonprofit governed by a board of five descendants and five students who would allocate the funds collected from the $27.20 fee assessed each semester and funnel them into projects that help cover descendant needs. For instance, there’s talk of providing eye exams free of cost and laying the groundwork for a scholarship foundation for descendants to attend college, not just Georgetown. But ultimately, students say, it is up to descendants to decide how best the money should be used.
The biggest and most popular argument in opposition to the referendum is not against reparations, but rather who should pay. Many students think that the university needs to make a full commitment to the report of the working group, which reads in part, “While we acknowledge that the moral debt of slaveholding and the sale of the enslaved people can never be repaid, we are convinced that reparative justice requires a meaningful financial commitment from the University.”

“When you target undergraduates, to be quite frank, you’re literally targeting the least financially successful subset of people who benefit from Georgetown,” said sophomore and student senator Sam Dubke, an international economics major.
Many return to the question of who bears the true responsibility for righting the wrong. “While we agree that the Georgetown of today would not exist if not for the sale of 272 slaves in 1838, current students are not to blame for the past sins of the institution, and a financial contribution cannot reconcile this past debt on behalf of the university,” Dubke and another student, Hayley Grande, wrote in an op-ed earlier this semester.
The problem, supporters of the fee say, is that the university doesn’t seem to want to have anything to do with financial restitution—not even if it’s paid for by students. Two days before the senate resolution was passed, administrators filed into a room with students and launched a last-ditch effort to oppose their efforts. The fee, they said, was “just not appropriate” and outside the bounds of what the student government could do. Even federal research grants to the school could be threatened by this fee, officials said, according to an audio recording made by students in the room. An email statement from Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs, to POLITICO reaffirmed the administration’s position that the vote is primarily symbolic: “Student referendums help to express important student perspectives but do not create university policy and are not binding on the university.”
This fight has turned personal for many, including Thomas. “At the end of the day, this is my history,” he said.
***
Each year since 1989, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the longest-serving member of Congress, has introduced a bill to form a commission that would study slavery in the colonies and early Union and recommend appropriate measures—but it has never been brought up for a vote. The explanation for its perennial failure might be as simple as the negligible amount of support for the idea of reparations in any form; at most 26 percent of Americans favor the idea and that level drops to 6 percent when polling white adults.
It was in the face of that disinterest, that in mid-2014, Ta-Nehisi Coates published a piece in The Atlantic called “The Case for Reparations.” In unsparing detail, Coates traced the crushing financial toll that slavery, and the pernicious segregation that followed, has wreaked on black citizens. “What I’m talking about is more than recompense for past injustices—more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe,” Coates wrote . “Reparations would mean a revolution of the American consciousness, a reconciling of our self-image as the great democratizer with the facts of our history.”
For all the attention Coates’ 15,000-word piece garnered, it did not entirely bring a reparations policy to the forefront. (Though its influence endures: The conservative columnist David Brooks last month changed his stance on the issue, citing Coates’ essay.) Indeed, the 2016 presidential contest, driven by Donald Trump’s obsession with illegal immigration, scarcely touched on how to move forward on racial injustice. That has changed dramatically this cycle. And this might be a function of a significant generational split: While reparations have net negative support of 39 percent among voters 45 and older, according to a 2018 poll , voters 45 and younger have a net positive of 2 percent, according to the left-leaning group Data for Progress.
In town halls and living rooms across the country, reparations has emerged alongside Medicare for all and climate change as a litmus test on the Democratic side. Almost every candidate has been asked if they support reparations.

The answer is overwhelmingly yes, though not everyone agrees on exactly how . Julián Castro, and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris generally support the idea that any reckoning with slavery must include some form of restitution. Booker has embraced a “baby bonds” proposal, very similar to one put forth by Darity, the economist at Duke, and Darrick Hamilton, an economist at the New School, which creates a public trust fund that allows children to access monies — determined on a graduated scale based on their parents’ wealth position — at 18. (The measure, though not specifically targeted toward descendants of slaves, would effectively be aimed at closing the racial wealth gap.) Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist, has been much slower to establish a position. After opposing it at first in 2016 and again this year, he announced April 5 he was throwing his support behind the Conyers bill.
The Conyers commission may be the first step. The reparations checks and formal apologies doled out in 1988 by Ronald Reagan to victims of Japanese-American internment camps during World War II were preceded by such a panel. (And it may not be that checks are the ideal solution — Darity and other scholars have argued that it could end up benefiting white business owners and doing little to ameliorate the racial wealth gap.)
But the one candidate who is furthest ahead on this issue is one you’ll rarely see on television. Democrat Marianne Williamson, a spiritual adviser and best-selling author whose campaign seeks to “heal the soul of America,” came out swinging with a $100 billion reparations plan that would create a board of “esteemed African American leaders” to disburse the money. After Darity called the dollar amount “paltry” in a New York Times article , she upped the ante to $200 to $500 billion.
“I don't believe the average American is a racist,” Williamson told me over the phone. “I do believe the average American is vastly undereducated about the history. … When I actually draw the timeline — speak about it for five to 10 minutes — by the time I reach the end and say, ‘Therefore, reparations are only reasonable,’ I get a lot of affirmation.”
At Georgetown, plenty of question marks hang over the upcoming referendum. Campus sentiment seems to be leaning in favor of the fee. A poll conducted by The Hoya in early February, soon after the referendum was passed in the student senate, showed that only 16.3 percent of the 615 students surveyed were against the measure. Nevertheless, roughly as many students as were in favor of the fee were also undecided. Members of the advocacy team are confident in their campaigning since then, and students are banking on the message that a positive vote would send to the university’s board of directors, which has the final say. If the board strikes the proposal down, Okoro said, it will be “a horrible mistake … Also, I think it would be a statement of Georgetown's values.”
“Without us there is no Georgetown,” he said. “Change in society always comes from activism from college students.”"

Next time he tries to squarely blame Democrats, we should ask him this: “How did purging the top officials at DHS move you closer to an immigration overhaul?”
THE PRESIDENT has been stymied by both the legislative process and his own administration. If you’re a vulnerable Republican senator, how do you feel about the president vowing to get tougher at the border?
BACKLASH …
-- WAPO’S SEUNG MIN KIM: “Grassley warns White House not to oust any more top immigration officials”: “The most senior Senate Republican is warning the White House not to oust another top immigration official, making appeals to the administration against dismissing Lee Francis Cissna, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, amid a purge of Homeland Security leaders.
“In an interview with The Washington Post, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said he was ‘very, very concerned’ regarding reports that Cissna could be next in a series of rapid-fire DHS dismissals that began late last week when the White House suddenly pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello, who had been tapped as director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“‘One, those are good public servants,’ Grassley said Monday evening, after rumors of Cissna’s potential exit percolated all day. “Secondly, besides the personal connection I have with them and the qualifications they have, they are the intellectual basis for what the president wants to accomplish in immigration.” WaPo
-- BURGESS EVERETT, JOHN BRESNAHAN and MELANIE ZANONA: “Trump’s DHS purge floors Republicans”: “‘It’s a mess,’ Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said, summing up the dynamic on the border and in Washington.
“‘Strikes me as just a frustration of not being able to solve a problem . Honestly, it wasn’t Secretary Nielsen’s fault. It wasn’t for lack of effort on her part. I don’t know if there’s anybody who’s going to be able to do more,’ said Cornyn, who spoke to Nielsen on Monday and planned to speak to her interim replacement, Kevin McAleenan, later in the day.
“‘I thought that Nielsen was doing a fantastic job,’ added Joni Ernst of Iowa, the No. 5 Senate GOP leader. ‘I would love to see some continuity. I think that’s important.’” POLITICO
WHAT THIS ALL MEANS … NYT A1: “Trump Signals Even Fiercer Immigration Agenda, With a Possible Return of Family Separations,” by Michael Shear, Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Maggie Haberman: “President Trump’s purge of the nation’s top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration, including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents, current and former administration officials said Monday. …
“But the longer term effect of the eruption of Oval Office frustration is likely to be a burst of hard-line policies that stand out even in an administration that has pursued an unprecedented series of executive actions and rules changes aimed at reducing legal and illegal immigration into the United States.
“In addition to urging Mr. Trump to revisit the idea of family separation, several of the president’s closest immigration confidants have been pushing him to consider even harsher measures. Those include further limits on who can seek asylum; stronger action to close ports of entry along the Mexican border; an executive order to end birthright citizenship; more aggressive construction of a border wall; and a more robust embrace of active-duty troops to secure the border against illegal immigration.
“In an administration that is famous for chaos and last-minute decision-making, it is unclear on which of those policies the president might choose to move forward. But by removing Ms. Nielsen, Mr. Vitiello and perhaps others, Mr. Trump is getting rid of voices who sometimes cautioned him against taking actions they believed to be illegal or unwise.” NYT

“The hearing is ostensibly focused on the Justice Department’s budget, but it will be Barr’s first public appearance since crafting a four-page summary of Mueller’s findings. Members of Mueller’s team were reportedly frustrated with the summary, claiming it doesn’t accurately represent their 22-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential Trump-Russia collusion.

Driving the Day CANADA REBOOTING TARIFF TARGETS AS 232 RELIEF BID STALLS: America’s northern neighbor is cranking up the pressure in its efforts to get President Donald Trump to lift the Section 232 tariffs he imposed last year on the country’s steel and aluminum exports.
Canada is refreshing the list of U.S. products it will target with retaliatory duties, David MacNaughton, Canada’s ambassador to the United States, said Monday, adding that the tariff relief talks have hit the skids, as the Canadians see things. The updated list will likely be out within the next week, he said at a North American Agricultural Journalists meeting in Washington, yours truly reported .
Ag on watch: MacNaughton said he expects “a significant number” of agricultural products to be on the new list. He said it was too early to name specific products but noted some in Canada have called for including apples, pork and ethanol. Canada, one of the largest markets for American wine, is likely to look to U.S. wine exports as well, MacNaughton said.
Don’t call it escalation: The ambassador said the goal is “not to escalate anything” — it’s just a substitute for old counter-tariffs Canada waived under its exemption programs . Canada promised dollar-for-dollar retaliation when Trump imposed the metals tariffs last year, but it has since waived more than $214 million worth of tariffs on targeted U.S. products, Canada’s Finance Department said Monday.
A Canadian Finance Department spokesperson told our Pro Canada colleagues that number could increase over time, as Canada receives new applications for product exemptions. Two other Canadian officials said more than $750 million in U.S. goods, or north of $1 billion in Canadian dollars, could ultimately be hit with new duties.
The agriculture industry wants the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement ratified — and soon. But the existence of the steel and aluminum duties threatens to derail legislative consideration of the deal in all three countries.
“There are no negotiations at the present moment,” MacNaughton said, referring to 232 relief talks. “There have been what I would describe as restating positions.”
FLOODING DISRUPTS ETHANOL SHIPMENTS: Shipments of ethanol, corn and other cargo are backed up in parts of Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri as major railways like BNSF and Union Pacific work to restore service in subdivisions pummeled by widespread flooding last month. The closures have led to shortages on the West Coast — among several reasons why gas prices jumped and forced some stations to shut down pumps, Reuters reported Monday.
In Nebraska, where 13 percent of the country’s ethanol is produced, 11 of the state’s 25 plants have been affected by the rail closures, said Megan Grimes, program manager for the Nebraska Ethanol Board.
New storm a-brewin’: Another round of blizzard-like conditions and flooding is expected to hit the Great Plains this week. USDA meteorologist Brad Rippey told Agri-Pulse that 200 water gauges in the Mississippi and Missouri river valleys are already experiencing flooding before the storm hits.
ORGANICS TRIES TO ‘FORCE THE ISSUE’ WITH TRUMP’S USDA: The organic industry is getting creative as it tries to get around the Trump administration’s hostility toward much of its regulatory agenda.
Laura Batcha, CEO of the Organic Trade Association, told reporters Monday that her industry is extremely frustrated USDA has scrapped some of its highest priorities, including an organic livestock standards rule that had been in the works for several years.
But she said OTA is working to spring regulations free where needed. The group sued the department over its withdrawal of the standards rule, and the U.S. District Court for D.C. ruled in February OTA has standing and allowed the case to advance.
“We’re optimistic about that,” Batcha said. “We think we can win that fight.” Batcha said OTA and USDA will be in briefings with the court this summer.
Congressional mandates: As another workaround, OTA is teaming up with congressional allies to try to “force” regulations, Batcha said. “The one thing USDA can respond to is a directive from Congress,” she said.
For example, USDA has 12 months from the signing of the 2018 farm bill, H.R. 2 (115) , to release a rule aimed at combating organic fraud. She said that deadline could end up being key to getting the department to actually do it.
“We know that without a date certain and a forcing of the issue we’re not going to make much progress in this administration,” Batcha said.

TRADE CORNER MEXICAN GROWERS FLOAT TOMATO COMPROMISE: Mexico’s tomato industry has made a new proposal that would increase the minimum price for selling tomatoes in the U.S., as it tries to land a deal to replace a six-year-old “suspension” agreement between the two countries, Pro Trade’s Doug Palmer reports.
Mexican growers are looking to avoid the Commerce Department restarting an anti-dumping probe that could result in steep duties on their tomatoes. Commerce has said it will withdraw from the suspension agreement on May 7 to proceed with the anti-dumping case. An attorney representing Mexico’s growers told Doug they’re prepared to fight the issue before the U.S. International Trade Commission if Commerce isn’t willing to agree to a fair deal.
Florida tomato farmers welcomed the proposal because, “for the first time, it contains some useful suggestions on how to prevent circumvention of the suspension agreement by Mexican producers,” the Florida Tomato Exchange, which initially requested the agreement get renegotiated, said in a statement.
MEXICO ON TRACK FOR LABOR REFORM PASSAGE: Mexico is poised to pass a major overhaul of its labor laws — a reform it agreed to make as part of the new North American trade deal, and a step Speaker Nancy Pelosi said must take place before the House will consider a bill to implement USMCA, Pro Trade’s Sabrina Rodriguez reports this morning.
Once the labor legislation is passed, implementation will start immediately, said Jesús Seade, Mexico’s undersecretary for North America. Pelosi said last week the House will also wait to see how the reforms are implemented, noting it will “take some time.”

THE TOPLINES PURITY TEST — Many freshmen Democrats have sworn off donations from corporate PACs — but that doesn’t mean corporate power has been removed entirely from their fundraising universe.
There’s “a larger trend of Democratic lawmakers who have promised to steer clear of corporate PACs allowing the same corporations’ lobbyists to write them personal checks — and in some cases even host fundraisers for them,” POLITICO’s Theo Meyer wrote (read his whole story , it is worth it). “Some lawmakers who’ve taken the pledge have defended their decisions to reject corporate PAC money while accepting money from lobbyists and other PACs.”
Still, K Street Democrats are frustrated. “They view [the pledge] as arbitrary restrictions on which kinds of money lawmakers will take and which kinds are forbidden,” Theo writes. “While Democrats who’ve taken the pledge are allowed to accept contributions from trade association PACs, for instance, End Citizens United PAC has circulated a list of 43 trade group PACs whose corporate ties might make accepting such money problematic for those Democrats.”
PAC operators are also working to get candidates and lawmakers who haven’t taken the pledge to hold off. “We are trying to educate Members about the importance of employee-funded PACs to the campaign finance system,” Catherine McDaniel, the president of the National Association of Business PACs, a trade group for corporate PACs, said in a statement to Theo.
IN THE TRENCHES PRESIDENTIAL BIG BOARD — California Rep. Eric Swalwell is the latest Democrat to announce he’s running for president. Swalwell made his announcement on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” (and here’s his FEC filing ). “In a separate video posted to his newly launched campaign website titled ‘Go big. Be bold. Do good.’ — a line he also floated during his Colbert interview — Swalwell highlighted his Iowa roots, said Trump has espoused ‘bullsh*t’ and emphasized his youth,” POLITICO California’s Jeremy White wrote.
— Sen. Amy Klobuchar raised $5.2 million in the first quarter for her presidential bid. She’ll report having $7 million in the bank. An interesting note from The New York Times’ Shane Goldmacher : Fundraising invitations from Klobuchar shows she has also been raising general election money, which she can’t spend right now.
— Party leaders in early primary states largely don’t expect former Vice President Joe Biden to suffer long-term damage after women said he made them feel uncomfortable, but they do want him to stop joking about it, POLITICO’s Natasha Korecki and Chris Cadelago reported. “Other early state activists cautioned that Biden’s future behavior will be under a microscope. If he moves forward with a campaign, the pressure will be on for the 76-year-old to adapt to new social norms and to diversify his staff to add more women and people of color,” they wrote.
— New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s City Hall communications director, Mike Casca, is going to work for de Blasio’s federal PAC, the latest sign the mayor is considering a run, per POLITICO New York’s Sally Goldenberg .
HOUSE RECRUITMENT WATCH — New Jersey state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., a Republican and son of a former governor, is expected to announce next week that he’ll challenge Malinowski in NJ-07, the New Jersey Globe’s David Wildstein reported. However, Malinowski is showing signs that his fundraising operation is still going strong: He raised more than $560,000 in the first quarter of 2019, per Wildstein . Kean’s also no stranger to raising money: In his failed 2006 bid for the Senate, in which he lost to Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, Kean raised nearly $8 million .
— Michigan Democratic state Rep. Jon Hoadley announced plans to challenge GOP Rep. Fred Upton in MI-06, per The Detroit News’ Melissa Nann Burke (I reported in Score last week that he was considering a run).
— A weekend announcement I missed: Democrat Kathleen Williams is running again for Montana’s at-large seat, per the Billings Gazette’s Tom Lutey . Williams lost last year by less than 5 points to GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte , who is a potential gubernatorial candidate.
IN CALIFORNIA — Hunter is doubling down on his 2018 campaign , which ran Islamophobic ads in his successful bid to hold off Campa-Najjar. Hunter’s camp is attacking Campa-Najjar, who is running again. “A fundraising pitch from Hunter claims that Campa-Najjar’s last bid was buoyed by ‘supporters of the Palestinian Liberation Organization’ and noted that the Democrat’s grandfather was involved with planning the terrorist attack on the 1972 Munich Olympics (the email repeatedly misstated Campa-Najjar’s name),” Jeremy reported . Campa-Najjar said Hunter is “just trying to fearmonger.”
OUR GUY — The DSCC endorsed Mark Kelly’s Arizona Senate campaign, with Kelly unlikely to face serious competition for the nomination, per Campaign Pro’s James Arkin .
STAYING HOME — Fun while it lasted: Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz texted the Pensacola News Journal’s Jim Little that he would not run for Senate across state lines in Alabama. Gaetz responded to a question from Little on if he’ll run with a one-word response: “No”.
THE CASH DASH — Freshman Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher in TX-07 raised over $515,000 in the first quarter, per a release from her campaign. Perpetual battleground Democrat Rep. Collin Peterson in MN-07 raised $282,000 with $742,000 in cash on hand, per his FEC report .
— Hawaii state Sen. Kai Kahele, a Democrat who is running in HI-02 as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard runs for president, said he raised over $250,000 in the first quarter.
PRIMARY PROBLEMS — Some West Virginia Republicans are unhappy with Democrat-turned-Republican Gov. Jim Justice. “The Mineral County Republican Executive Committee released a statement and a resolution Sunday morning in support of Justice after the Kanawha County Republican Executive Committee passed a resolution of no confidence last week,” The Martinsburg Journal’s Steven Adams reported.
TWEETERS IN CHIEF — No, not President Donald Trump . An analysis from The Washington Post’s Kevin Schaul and Kevin Uhrmacher broke down what the Democratic hopefuls are tweeting about the most. “While most candidates discussed social justice and health care, only a few talked much about foreign policy or immigration,” they wrote. “No candidate made gun control a first or second priority in their social media strategy during the month.”
STAFFING UP — Former NRCC Executive Director John Rodgers and veteran ad-maker Jason Meath are launching their own firm, Torchlight Strategies, POLITICO’s Scott Bland reported .
— Marcia Lee Kelly was named the president and CEO for the 2020 Republican convention. She was director of operations for the 2016 convention.
WEB WARS — Andrew Yang outpaced the field last week on Facebook spending. The long-shot presidential candidate dropped over $156,000 on ads on the platform last week, nearly doubling the total amount he’s spent on Facebook to date. Pros can get more details about Facebook spending from our roundup.

This Could Be the First Slavery Reparations Policy in America,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/09/georgetown-university-reparations-slave-trade-226581,"In September 2014, a Georgetown junior published a column in The Hoya , the student newspaper, with the headline: “Georgetown, Financed by Slave Trading.” It unearthed a known but largely forgotten history: that the esteemed Jesuit university had saved itself from financial ruin in 1838 by selling 272 enslaved people. The sale had been orchestrated by one of the school’s presidents, Thomas Mulledy, himself a Jesuit priest, and the namesake of a residence hall that was at the time of the article undergoing renovations. The author, Matthew Quallen, urged the administration to strip Mulledy’s name from the building. Quallen’s demand was effectively the first shot in what has become a 4&frac12;-year debate over how the school should atone for its slave-holding past. In September 2015, Georgetown’s president, John J. DeGioia, impaneled a working group of academics, administrators and students to study the issue. Two months later, black students staged a sit-in in his office successfully demanding the removal of names like Mulledy’s, which still graced several prominent buildings on campus. In 2016, the university agreed to give admissions preference to descendants of the 272 slaves; and the first two descendants arrived in the fall of 2017. College officials and the Jesuits held a mass of contrition in the spring of 2017 as a formal mea culpa for the sale.
But the perception has grown among some of the approximately 7,000 undergraduates that the university has moved too slowly. There is still no public marker of that dark chapter of Georgetown’s history. Most important, the university still has not addressed what many saw as the most crucial element in the working group’s report: financial compensation for the estimated 4,000 living descendants. In a word, reparations.
This week, Georgetown students are attempting to change that.
On April 11, undergraduates will vote on a referendum to create a $27.20 per semester student fee to create a fund that would benefit the descendants through education and health care initiatives in the Louisiana and Maryland locales where many of them still live. If the measure passes, and the university’s board of directors approves, it will mark the first time a major American institution has gone beyond the platitudes of “dialogue” and actually compensated the victims of slavery. And it comes at a moment, not entirely coincidentally, when the conversation about America’s racial reckoning has suddenly emerged as a subject many progressives are using to winnow the sprawling field of Democrats in the 2020 presidential campaign.

“What is happening right now on Georgetown’s campus is a reflection of a larger political climate, in which, I think, people are taking seriously what anti-racist action looks like,” said Marcia Chatelain, a professor of history and African-American studies and a member of the president’s working group. “So it’s not just being nice to each other or saying racism is a bad thing. It’s about actually taking account and responsibility for the ways that these decisions and processes in the past shape contemporary life.”
And while the Georgetown student fee, which would raise about $400,000 in the first year, does not come close to matching the multibillion-dollar price tags of the national reparations projects being discussed by presidential hopefuls, its mere existence indicates the degree to which an idea once thought to be impractically extreme has now moved into the mainstream. (On Monday, Senator Cory Booker introduced a bill to study racial reparations for African-Americans, a companion proposal to one offered in the House by Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee.)
William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University and one of the leading scholars on the economics of reparations, said he was “admiring” of the student efforts, while also pushing them to lay the groundwork for a nationwide effort that avoids “piecemeal” solutions. “We do need to move away from viewing this as a matter of individual guilt or individual responsibility that can be offset by individual payments, towards the recognition that this is a national responsibility and a national obligation that must be met by the federal government,” he said.

Indeed, the debate on campus mirrors some of the wider discussion about the nature of collective responsibility and whether there is such a thing as a statute of limitations on a crime of such magnitude. Like the American public at large, Georgetown students are far from unanimous in their support for the reparations fee. For one, it puts the burden of paying on students instead of the university. It raises the cost of attendance for families, many already on shoestring budgets. Some black students wonder why, if they too are descended from slaves, they should pay reparations they feel entitled to themselves.
“That’s the problem, people don’t want to be uncomfortable,” said Mélisande Short-Colomb, a sophomore and descendant who came to Georgetown at age 63. “Everything happens for students here on campus. If you can receive a benefit, are you not capable of extending a hand in service? … Are you capable of washing feet?”

Like many other top-tier American colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Virginia, Georgetown’s ties to slavery predate the Union. And in Georgetown’s case, they persisted even after the sale splintered 40 families and shipped them to plantations in Maryland and Louisiana. Slaves continued to wash the clothes of white, wealthy students from landowning families until Emancipation . After the end of the Civil War, black people continued to work on campus as servants, and integration of the student body wouldn’t happen until the first black undergraduate was admitted in 1950. To this day, the colors worn by Georgetown’s basketball team, Blue and Gray, are an homage to Union and Confederate military uniforms.
“The story of Georgetown, the Jesuits and slavery is such a vivid microcosm of the entire history of American slavery, going back to the early origins, colonial settlement, all the way through Emancipation and beyond,” said Adam Rothman, a professor of history and the curator of the Georgetown Slavery Archive. “You can tell the whole history of American slavery through this particular story.”
On Thursday, April 11, The #GU272 referendum passed with 66.08% of the vote. Now, the board of directors must approve the measure for the reparations fee to actually take effect.

Rothman takes no public stance on the referendum so as not to intrude in an initiative that he sees as belonging to the students. But he does encourage them to know their history. “A partial truth is not the truth,” he told me on a recent morning in his office.
And that history continues to emerge in shocking ways.
Kuma Okoro, a junior studying international political economy, said he was moved to action when he learned that during construction of a residence hall in December 2014, workers had unearthed a human thigh bone in the site of a segregated cemetery that is known to have had remains of slaves and free blacks. The discovery was kept under wraps until August of last year. “For me, that was, like, crazy. But it also kind of showed that they don't really care, right? The university's goal is to keep the conversation controlled and keep everybody moving along.” He reached out to Short-Colomb, and within a month they were having meetings with other advocates of color in what would become the group Students for the GU272.
Students were already frustrated by the administration’s refusal to erect a memorial honoring the 272 slaves. A student proposal in September 2018 to construct a 5-foot-tall, illuminated, marble and granite block, free of cost, to be placed near the residence hall built on the segregated cemetery, was politely rebuffed. The president’s office, a representative wrote in an email reviewed by POLITICO, was focused on “developing a framework for dialogue.” It was committed to “engaging these important topics.” “Patience and understanding” were appreciated.
Despite its inaction on the memorial proposal, the university has not totally ignored the recommendations that emerged from the working group’s 104-page report. Senior administrators are in the middle of tightly guarded talks with descendants, mediated by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, to figure out the right steps for atonement. A grant from the Andrew Mellon Foundation has funded faculty positions and fellowships to study slavery. Some professors have dedicated entire classes to discussing the conflict between the school’s founding principles, rooted in Catholic beliefs, and the moral stain that sustained it.
Nevertheless, the pace of atonement has led to impatience. “What they were doing was more like kiss and hug babies ... to handle the media attention that was present at the time,” Shepard Thomas, a junior studying psychology and one of the first descendants to be admitted under the new admissions policy, told me. “Yeah, it’s important to rename buildings. [But] what’s legacy status if they can't go to high school? You know, what are you promising at the end of the day?”

Last summer, Thomas, who comes from New Orleans, visited Maringouin, a small town outside of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, whose 1,000 residents are overwhelmingly descended from the 1838 sale. What he saw there—a town with a dearth of jobs, an absence of quality secondary schools and a median income ($36,518) far below the national median ($57,617)—spurred him to action. (Not all of the descendants think Georgetown has the wherewithal to solve the real problems that beset places like Maringouin, Chatham and Terrebonne Parish. Jessica Tilson, a descendant from Baton Rouge, recently told me: “What Maringouin needs is something Georgetown students can’t provide — and that’s jobs.”)
Last fall, instead of dwelling on what the university hadn’t done, a group of students gathered repeatedly in Short-Colomb’s dorm to brainstorm how they could empower the student body to do what the administration had declined to do. They studied the legal intricacies of nonprofits. They drafted a resolution to permit a vote on the fee and saw it through four sessions of debate in the student senate. Finally, on February 3, the resolution passed, setting up the vote for April 11.
The precedent-setting measure, which they have termed a “reconciliation fee,” would create a nonprofit governed by a board of five descendants and five students who would allocate the funds collected from the $27.20 fee assessed each semester and funnel them into projects that help cover descendant needs. For instance, there’s talk of providing eye exams free of cost and laying the groundwork for a scholarship foundation for descendants to attend college, not just Georgetown. But ultimately, students say, it is up to descendants to decide how best the money should be used.
The biggest and most popular argument in opposition to the referendum is not against reparations, but rather who should pay. Many students think that the university needs to make a full commitment to the report of the working group, which reads in part, “While we acknowledge that the moral debt of slaveholding and the sale of the enslaved people can never be repaid, we are convinced that reparative justice requires a meaningful financial commitment from the University.”

“When you target undergraduates, to be quite frank, you’re literally targeting the least financially successful subset of people who benefit from Georgetown,” said sophomore and student senator Sam Dubke, an international economics major.
Many return to the question of who bears the true responsibility for righting the wrong. “While we agree that the Georgetown of today would not exist if not for the sale of 272 slaves in 1838, current students are not to blame for the past sins of the institution, and a financial contribution cannot reconcile this past debt on behalf of the university,” Dubke and another student, Hayley Grande, wrote in an op-ed earlier this semester.
The problem, supporters of the fee say, is that the university doesn’t seem to want to have anything to do with financial restitution—not even if it’s paid for by students. Two days before the senate resolution was passed, administrators filed into a room with students and launched a last-ditch effort to oppose their efforts. The fee, they said, was “just not appropriate” and outside the bounds of what the student government could do. Even federal research grants to the school could be threatened by this fee, officials said, according to an audio recording made by students in the room. An email statement from Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs, to POLITICO reaffirmed the administration’s position that the vote is primarily symbolic: “Student referendums help to express important student perspectives but do not create university policy and are not binding on the university.”
This fight has turned personal for many, including Thomas. “At the end of the day, this is my history,” he said.
***
Each year since 1989, former Representative John Conyers (D-Mich.) introduced a bill to form a commission that would study slavery in the colonies and early Union and recommend appropriate measures—but it has never been brought up for a vote. The explanation for its perennial failure might be as simple as the negligible amount of support for the idea of reparations in any form; at most, 26 percent of Americans favor the idea and that level drops to 6 percent when polling white adults.
It was in the face of that disinterest, that in mid-2014, Ta-Nehisi Coates published a piece in The Atlantic called “The Case for Reparations.” In unsparing detail, Coates traced the crushing financial toll that slavery, and the pernicious segregation that followed, has wreaked on black citizens. “What I’m talking about is more than recompense for past injustices—more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe,” Coates wrote . “Reparations would mean a revolution of the American consciousness, a reconciling of our self-image as the great democratizer with the facts of our history.”
For all the attention Coates’ 15,000-word piece garnered, it did not entirely bring a reparations policy to the forefront. (Though its influence endures: The conservative columnist David Brooks last month changed his stance on the issue, citing Coates’ essay.) Indeed, the 2016 presidential contest, driven by Donald Trump’s obsession with illegal immigration, scarcely touched on how to move forward on racial injustice. That has changed dramatically this cycle. And this might be a function of a significant generational split: While reparations have net negative support of 39 percent among voters 45 and older, according to a 2018 poll , voters 45 and younger have a net positive of 2 percent, according to the left-leaning group Data for Progress.
In town halls and living rooms across the country, reparations has emerged alongside “Medicare for All” and climate change as a litmus test on the Democratic side. Almost every candidate has been asked whether they support reparations.

The answer is overwhelmingly yes, though not everyone agrees on exactly how . Julián Castro, and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris generally support the idea that any reckoning with slavery must include some form of restitution. Booker has embraced a “baby bonds” proposal, very similar to one put forth by Darity, the economist at Duke, and Darrick Hamilton, an economist at the New School, which creates a public trust fund that allows children to access monies — determined on a graduated scale based on their parents’ wealth position — at 18. (The measure, though not specifically targeted toward descendants of slaves, would effectively be aimed at closing the racial wealth gap.) Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist, has been much slower to establish a position. After opposing it at first in 2016 and again this year, he announced April 5 he was throwing his support behind the Conyers bill.
The Conyers commission may be the first step. The reparations checks and formal apologies doled out in 1988 by Ronald Reagan to victims of Japanese-American internment camps during World War II were preceded by such a panel. (And it may not be that checks are the ideal solution — Darity and other scholars have argued that it could end up benefiting white business owners and doing little to ameliorate the racial wealth gap.)
But the one candidate who is furthest ahead on this issue is one you’ll rarely see on television. Democrat Marianne Williamson, a spiritual adviser and best-selling author whose campaign seeks to “heal the soul of America,” came out swinging with a $100 billion reparations plan that would create a board of “esteemed African American leaders” to disburse the money. After Darity called the dollar amount “paltry” in a New York Times article , she upped the ante to $200 billion to $500 billion.
“I don't believe the average American is a racist,” Williamson told me over the phone. “I do believe the average American is vastly undereducated about the history. … When I actually draw the timeline — speak about it for five to 10 minutes — by the time I reach the end and say, ‘Therefore, reparations are only reasonable,’ I get a lot of affirmation.”
At Georgetown, plenty of question marks hang over the upcoming referendum. Campus sentiment seems to be leaning in favor of the fee. A poll conducted by The Hoya in early February, soon after the referendum was passed in the student senate, showed that only 16.3 percent of the 615 students surveyed were against the measure. Nevertheless, roughly as many students in favor of the fee were also undecided. Members of the advocacy team are confident in their campaigning since then, and students are banking on the message that a positive vote would send to the university’s board of directors, which has the final say. If the board strikes down the proposal, Okoro said, it will be “a horrible mistake … Also, I think it would be a statement of Georgetown's values.”
“Without us there is no Georgetown,” he said. “Change in society always comes from activism from college students.”"
Cybersecurity toolkits ahead for elections and media people,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2019/04/09/cybersecurity-toolkits-ahead-for-elections-and-media-people-576116,"With help from Laurens Cerulus, Jordyn Hermani and Mary Lee
 First came small businesses, and now it’s election folks and journos up for cybersecurity toolkits. Also on deck for help: aspiring cyber pros who can swap federal service for scholarships.
— A Senate panel today explores implementation of a law that established a U.S. policy and strategy framework for the Indo-Pacific region. That law authorized money for the administration to combat cyber theft.
— European and Chinese leaders are holding a summit today. Cyber espionage and security issues surrounding Huawei might take a backseat to other concerns, however.
HAPPY TUESDAY Eric is speaking on a Tech Policy Institute panel today about Huawei. Check out the details here .
Driving the Day GETCHER TOOLKITS HEA — Scoop: The founder of Craigslist and the Global Cyber Alliance are teaming up to provide free cyber defense toolkits to election officials, nonprofit election rights groups and the media modeled after the ones GCA recently pioneered for small businesses. Craig Newmark Philanthropies is offering GCA more than $1 million for the project, and GCA is netting $1.5 million from other sources, the groups are announcing today.
“Elections bodies and the media are facing increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that can impair the exercise of democracy and affect election results, and they are not prepared to deal with the threat,” Phil Reitinger, president and CEO of the GCA, told MC. The idea is to assemble a set of immediately available resources, rather than just advice. “I've been lucky enough to do well and put my money where my mouth is and help protect the people who protect our country,” Newmark told MC.
Reitinger said the election-related toolkits are closer to completion than the ones for media after working with the Center for Internet Security and Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center. There are both similarities and differences between the small business and election toolkits; Reitinger said elections are further along on cyber than small businesses, which means the election toolkit will likely offer more sophisticated protections. Newmark said stealing and tampering with information are among the worries of both groups.
Meanwhile, journalists are more concerned about protecting sensitive source information or having a social media account hijacked, which might make their information look less trustworthy, Reitinger said.
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, THERE’S CYBERSECURITY — Mastercard, Microsoft, Workday and 11 federal agencies are teaming up to recruit and train the “next generation of cyber leaders,” the Partnership for Public Service announced today . The Cybersecurity Talent Initiative will place recent college grads accepted into the program with a federal agency for at least two years, where applicants can then compete for a full-time position with the program’s private sector partners and receive up to $75,000 in student loan assistance.
Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, told MC that applicants must have a degree that specializes in cyber issues and that the program’s initial goal is to place 50 participants within federal agencies. Students can apply online on the Initiative’s website from today until Oct. 18. Agencies will make offers by spring 2020 and participants will start in the summer or fall of 2020, according to the organization. Federal agencies participating in the initiative include the CIA, DoD, FBI and the Federal Election Commission.
HILL PREVIEW — A Senate Foreign Relations panel will hear testimony this morning on U.S. leadership in promoting human rights, in the context of legislation with cybersecurity provisions that President Donald Trump signed into law in December. The measure, known as the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, S.2736 (115) , established a U.S. strategy and policy framework in the Indo-Pacific region, including authorizing $1.5 billion for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023 to advance those interests and objectives. The bill authorized $100 million for each of those fiscal years to shore up cooperation between the U.S. and Indo-Pacific nations for “combatting cybersecurity threats.”
It also authorized the president to “deter and punish commercial cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property.” The law requires the president to submit a report on efforts to combat such violations, particularly from China. References to the law made their way into a resolution announced by Sens. Cory Gardner and Chris Coons on Monday that that calls for a cybersecurity treaty with Indo-Pacific countries.
CHINA, EU TALKS — European and Chinese diplomats meet today for their long-awaited summit . Our counterparts at POLITICO Europe reported that officials in Brussels would like to come away with assurances that Beijing will reduce cyber espionage activities. But there’s not much hope EU officials will win on that front — or receive assurances regarding security risks posed by Huawei — as trade issue are expected to dominate the agenda.
Ahead of the summit, China’s ambassador to Brussels, Zhang Ming, told POLITICO Europe that he hoped the EU would not yield to political pressure in siding with U.S. in its global campaign to sideline Huawei over cybersecurity concerns. “For some time, some are trying to exercise a presumption of guilt against Chinese enterprises, their technologies and products. But they have failed to come up with any solid evidence,” he said. Read the full interview here .
SOLARIUM TIME — We’re told by a couple sources that the Cyberspace Solarium Commission held its first informal business meeting Monday. Sen. Angus King told MC in February the commission was “gonna really buckle down” ahead of a September deadline to complete its work. Its overall mission is to figure out how to preserve the U.S. edge in cyberspace.
NIELSEN DEPARTURE FALLOUT — “The progress Washington has made in the past few years to combat cybersecurity risks could be in jeopardy with the departure of DHS chief Kirstjen Nielsen, warned ex-federal officials and technology experts,” Tim reports. “Nielsen came to the agency in 2017 with a background in cybersecurity and over the past two years built up its focus on the issue, helping states improve election security ahead of 2020 and working more closely with private industry to identify and combat criminal hackers.
“Now, with President Donald Trump's preoccupation with the border and the arrival of Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary, observers are concerned that those advancements to improve the nation's cyber defenses against Russian and Chinese cyberattacks could be at risk of vanishing.” Read more here .
IRAN YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION — Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, designated a terrorist group on Monday by the Trump administration, also has a long history of alleged cyberattacks. The U.S. has issued indictments for figures tied to the corps over stealing U.S. research, hacking U.S. banks and dams, and conducting espionage operations. Cyber intelligence firms have linked the corps to an even greater volume of nefarious cyber operations.
Some cyber experts warned of cyber retaliation amid reports that the U.S. had placed military forces on alert. “Only US forces on alert?” tweeted Cristin Goodwin, assistant general counsel for cybersecurity at Microsoft. “Every IT admin will need to be aware.” Recorded Future noted that Iran has responded to sanctions and other perceived provocations with cyberattacks dating back at least a decade. “It’s logical to anticipate Iran quickly retaliating via cyberattacks,” the company cautioned . “Financial services, energy companies, and military contractors are the most likely targets of Iranian attacks.”
GET GOING, PENTAGON — The Defense Department has been slow to act on cyber threats to weapon systems, a government watchdog said in a letter released Monday. “Although we and others have warned of cyber risks for decades, DOD did not begin to prioritize weapon system cyber security until recently,” the letter from the Government Accountability Office states. The GAO had six high-priority recommendations in cybersecurity for DoD on strategy, the Cyber Mission Force and “cybersecurity best practices.”
RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — A group of senators introduced legislation creating a grant program to help state and local governments withstand cyberattacks. … The upcoming congressional recess has Democrats scrambling to craft a response to the release of redacted report by special counsel Robert Mueller. … Huawei hired a former Obama administration official as a lobbyist.
TWEET OF THE DAY — MC operates at cyber speed, though…
People on the Move — The Software and Information Industry Association announced Monday that Jesse Spector, former EU delegation policy officer, will become its new technology policy director. Former FTC official Sara DePaul also recently joined as senior director for technology policy.

"Judge blocks ""remain in Mexico""",www.politico.com,politico.com,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-shift/2019/04/09/judge-blocks-remain-in-mexico-422841,"— Judge blocks ""remain in Mexico."" — Immigration hardliners to Trump: Don't fire USCIS chief Francis Cissna.
Story Continued Below
— The 60-day comment period on DOL’s joint employer proposal starts today.
GOOD MORNING! It’s Tuesday, it’s April 9, ‘REMAIN IN MEXICO’ BLOCKED BY FEDERAL JUDGE: A federal judge Monday halted the Trump administration’s policy of forcing certain non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico during their court proceedings, POLITICO’s Ted Hesson reports. “In a 27-page order , San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg issued a preliminary injunction against the policy, a decision that represents another legal setback for the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration agenda,” Hesson writes. “The ruling did not tackle the question of whether DHS has the authority to send asylum seekers to Mexico. Instead, it found that plaintiffs were likely to demonstrate that the policy did not comply with federal regulatory law.” More here .
Inside the Agencies IS CISSNA NEXT?: President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration allies are urging him to hang on to USCIS Director Francis Cissna as de facto White House immigration czar Stephen Miller cleans house, POLITICO’s Ted Hesson, Anita Kumar, and Nancy Cook report. Secret Service Director Randolph Alles was the latest DHS official to be shown the door Monday, following Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s abrupt resignation Sunday and the Friday withdrawal of Ronald Vitiello’s nomination to lead ICE. Cissna is expected to go next. But Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, said: “He’s great. He’s worked in this issue for years, he’s extremely knowledgeable. He’s exactly the type of person who needs to be in DHS in leadership.” Miller, though, has grown frustrated as he's pressed Cissna, ""unsuccessfully, to launch more experimentally and legally questionable policies,” Hesson and Orr write.
With top Nielsen allies out of the way, Miller ""wants tent cities to house migrants on the border and is pressing to extend the amount of time U.S. immigration officials can detain migrant children beyond the current 20-day limit imposed by a federal judge"" POLITICO reports.""Miller wants to force migrant parents arrested at the border to choose between splitting apart from their children or remaining together indefinitely in detention while awaiting court proceedings, according to five people familiar with the plans.""
Two other DHS officials expected to be pushed out, POLITICO reports, are General Counsel John Mitnick and Acting Deputy Claire Grady. More here .
Nielsen is going quietly. She told reporters outside her house Monday: “I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border,” according to Playbook . CNN reports that Nielsen argued at a White House meeting two weeks ago ""that if you close all the ports of entry all you would be doing is ending legal trade and travel, but migrants will just go between ports. According to two people in the room, the President said: ""I don't care."" More here .
More: “ Stephen Miller pressuring Trump officials amid immigration shakeups, ” from POLITICO
AT THE BORDER REPORT: TRUMP TOLD BORDER AGENTS TO KEEP OUT MIGRANTS: During President Donald Trump’s trip to the border in Calexico, California last Friday, he told border agents not to let migrants in, CNN’s Jake Tapper reported. “Tell them we don't have the capacity, he said. If judges give you trouble, say, ‘Sorry, judge, I can't do it. We don't have the room.’"" Leaders told agents after the meeting “they were not giving them that direction and if they did what the President said they would take on personal liability.”
“You have to follow the law, they were told.” More here .
BORDER JOB KILLER: Delays as much as “four and five hours to cross the border near San Diego” are prompting concerns that the administration’s redeployment of 750 U.S. customs personnel to help process migrants will cost jobs and a lot of money, POLITICO’s Doug Palmer reports. ""For us, the quick fix is: Bring the CBP officers back, open those lanes and allow trade to proceed,"" Pete Saenz, mayor of Laredo, Texas, said during a call hosted by the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute Monday. ""Thirty percent of our lanes were closed last week."" More here .
Visa Update H-2B RALLY ON THE HILL: The Seasonal Employment Alliance will host a rally on Capitol Hill this morning with 10 lawmakers, including Republican Reps. Andy Harris (Md.), Doug Collins (Ga.), and Jack Bergman (Mich.), to urge Congress to lift the H-2B visa cap and to “commend” the Trump administration’s “recent efforts to save seasonal businesses.” A total of 66,000 H-2B visas are available each fiscal year, with the allotment released in two installments. DHS recently announced that it will nearly double the number of H-2B visas allocated through September, making an additional 30,000 available to “returning workers.” A clause included in appropriations bills in recent years grants DHS the option to roughly double the number of existing visas. The rally starts at 9:30 a.m.
UNIONS AFL-CIO GETS NEW DIGITAL CHIEF: Nick Gaw will lead data and technology operations for the labor federation's organizing and political campaigns. Gaw most recently was technology director at Avaaz, a nonprofit dedicated to global activism, and has served as director of engineering at the Democratic National Committee.
CORPORATIONS SEEK OUT TRANS WORKERS: A job fair in Los Angeles for “transgender, gender non-binary and non-conforming individuals” drew more than 700 job seekers and 70 employers, including “corporate giants such as Hilton, Sony, Starbucks and Viacom,” Melissa Gomez reports for the Los Angeles Times. “In seeking qualified job candidates for positions including sales, marketing and entry-level executive assistants,” Gomez writes, “the companies were taking a definite stance in a supporting a community whose rights have been debated — both politically and culturally — for well over a decade.”
The unemployment rate among transgender people in 2015 (the most recent year for which data is available) was three times higher than the national rate, the National Center for Transgender Equality told Morning Shift. According to NCTE’s 2015 US Transgender Survey , 30 percent of those respondents who were employed during the previous year “reported being fired, denied a promotion, or experiencing some other form of mistreatment in the workplace related to their gender identity or expression.” Another 77 percent said they “took steps to avoid mistreatment in the workplace,” including “quitting their job.”
No federal law explicitly prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity or expression; the Justice Department in 2017 reversed its previous position that transgender workers were protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964's prohibition against discrimination based on sex. A House Education and Labor subcommittee will hold a hearing today at 2 p.m. on Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.)’s Equality Act, H.R. 5 (116) , which would bar discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation or gender identity. More info on the hearing here . More from the Times here .
GAO: DOL NEEDS BETTER AUTOMATION DATA: A Government Accountability Office report released Monday said that DOL needs to develop ways to use data “to identify and systematically track the workforce effects of advanced technologies,” such as automation and artificial intelligence. Read a summary here and the full report here .
Joint Employer COMMENT PERIOD ON DOL JOINT EMPLOYER: DOL will publish its joint employer proposal in the Federal Register today , starting the 60-day comment period. The proposed regulation released last week would make it harder to hold businesses jointly liable when their franchisees or contractors violate the Fair Labor Standards Act. More on the proposal from POLITICO’s Ian Kullgren here .
DELAURO THREATENS LEGAL ACTION: “Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) today warned HHS that she’s reviewing ‘legal remedies’ after three House Democrats were barred from accessing a Florida facility where migrant children are being housed Monday,” POLITICO’s Dan Diamond reports. More here .

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— House lawmakers will be briefed by NTSB today on the contents of a preliminary report from the crash of a Boeing 737 in Ethiopia.
— Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation at DHS has kicked off a game of high-stakes musical chairs.
— New Jersey’s transit agency faced off with WWE over the weekend. Be warned: wrestling puns ahead.
IT’S TUESDAY:
“Over the horizon / She's smooth sailin' / These concrete seas / Now she's headed / East down the boule, the vard.”
IN CONGRESS LET'S BE BRIEFED: Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), chairman of the House Transportation Aviation Subcommittee, told MT that he, full committee Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), full committee ranking member Sam Graves (R-Mo.) and subcommittee ranking member Garret Graves (R-La.) will be briefed by NTSB today on the preliminary Ethiopian Airlines crash report. “It’s 33 pages, I think I had 27 questions,” Larsen said.
CHAO’S FIRST FACE-OFF WITH DEM MAJORITY: Elaine Chao will enter hostile territory as Transportation Secretary on Wednesday when she sits down with the House Appropriations Committee to talk, ostensibly, about the administration’s budget request for her agency. Other topics she’ll be asked to weigh in on: the ongoing standoff over federal funding for the Gateway project, and the criticism against FAA for its role in approving the Boeing 737 MAX. Rep. David Price ( D-N.C.), chairman of the subcommittee overseeing transportation spending, wouldn’t talk to MT about what he’s got in store.
BARGING INTO D.C.: Fly-in season is kicking into high gear, and several transpo groups will be bringing their members in to meet with lawmakers this week. The American Waterways Operators is holding a “barge-in” on Wednesday, and members are planning 200 meetings to talk about policy issues affecting the tugboat, towboat and barge industry. They’ll be focusing on the importance of the Jones Act, the need for a consistent national regulatory framework for commercial vessels involved in interstate commerce, and calling for investment in modernizing waterways infrastructure.
The ask: Also coming into town are the Portland Cement Association and the North American Concrete Alliance, which are sending executives to the Hill to push for infrastructure legislation. PCA’s big idea: Require a life-cycle cost analysis for major infrastructure projects to assess the total cost of a project across its entire life span. They’re supporting a bipartisan bill ( H.R. 1890 (116) ) that would mandate such an analysis for all projects over $30 million. “Had we used life-cycle cost analysis on the FAST Act, we could have saved $2.43 billion,” Rachel Derby, PCA vice president for Government Affairs, told POLITICO. “That would build 1,680 additional lane miles.”
COMMENT PERIOD CLOSED: Friday was the deadline for senators to submit to EPW Chairman John Barrasso and ranking member Tom Carper their priorities for a surface transportation reauthorization. Senators were asked to fill in a Word form and an Excel document for each specific request. An EPW spokesperson said the committee is in the process of holding hearings and finding out senators’ priorities ahead of consideration of a bill “in the coming months.”
A CHALLENGER APPROACHES: House Transportation freshman Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), who has become a leading voice in challenging the administration’s slow-walking of Gateway, will have a high-profile challenger in 2020. The New Jersey Globe reported Monday that state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., the son of a popular former governor, is planning to enter the race to represent New Jersey’s 7th District.

Security DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE: Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said President Donald Trump violated the law when he tapped CBP chief Kevin McAleenan to step in as acting DHS secretary instead of Claire Grady, who has been acting deputy secretary since April. However, Trump’s decision appears to have been very intentional, given reports he also wants her out of the department, our Stephanie Beasley reports .
ON THE GROUND: TSA has created a new surface transportation advisory panel that will make recommendations on security for rail, highways and other modes, Stephanie also reports . The 35-member committee was mandated by a recently enacted reauthorization that pushed the agency to give surface transportation higher priority.
Infrastructure HITTING THE AIRWAVES: Rebuild USA, the building trades unions 501(c)(4), and the American Trucking Associations are launching a new advocacy campaign calling on Congress to invest in infrastructure. The centerpiece is this TV ad , which shows parents missing important life moments for their children due to traffic congestion and road closures.
Aviation UP IN THE AIR: Boeing’s decision to slow production of its 737 planes will not immediately affect its credit rating, Moody’s said Monday in a new report . But the financial analysts do say that it signals it will take longer for the 737 MAX to return to service after being grounded by FAA and countries around the world. If the grounding extends beyond four months, according to Moody’s, cash flow pressure will mount on the company, which has already taken a significant free cash flow hit.
Transit IN THE RING: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest spectacle in transportation journalism. In this corner, the premiere wrestling league in the world, a sports entertainment behemoth: the WWE. And in the other corner, hailing from Newark, N.J., the third-largest transit provider in the nation: N...J...Transit! The two squared off Monday after thousands of fans were stranded in the rain following the WWE’s showcase event, WrestleMania, on Sunday night. NJ Transit blamed the company, saying the event ended later than expected, and some of its crew had reached federal work limits. The WWE hit back: “Just like other sports and entertainment events, we don’t advertise an end time,” it told POLITICO New Jersey’s Ryan Hutchins, who wrote up the fiasco here .
From the top rope: Gov. Phil Murphy dropped the elbow on the transit provider, saying the delays were unacceptable and that he’d be “damned if it happens again.” As Ryan writes, “Murphy has made improving NJ Transit one of his top priorities, but he continues to blame the last administration for lingering problems, including the shortage of engineers.”
