Have you ever had the feeling of being watched? That your life may be a real life version of The Truman Show ?Well, Airbnb is once again in the hot seat. This time for concerns over its quality assurance, which is being seriously questioned after a hidden camera was found by a family staying in one of its listings in Ireland. According to a CNN report, a New Zealand family were on the Irish leg of a 14-month Euro-trip when they discovered they were being both recorded and live-streamed by a hidden video camera that was posing as a smoke detector.Father, Andrew Barker was staying at the property with his wife, Nealie, their four children and a niece when the shocking discovery was made. He told CNN that he was running a scan of the Wi-Fi network, and while running a group of routine tests such as checking the Wi-Fi strength and security, he found that the smoke detector was in fact hiding a camera that was live-streaming their every move.Andrew called the owner of the home who immediately hung up after it was revealed that he knew about the cameras adding that the man did call back later saying there was ""only one camera"" in the home and that was it. Nealie said that the owner wouldn't give them any more information even when asked how and why the live-stream was being used.She said that the discovery ""was a really horrible feeling,"" adding that they ""didn't feel relieved"" following the owners admission of guilt.The family said that Airbnb was not much help on the matter charging that they failed ""to listen properly"" to their concerns or understand ""the seriousness of the matter.""""They were treating it like a canceled booking,” Nealie added.Only once story received major publicity through the media and on social media, did Airbnb finally ban the host for his actions.In a statement sent to CNN, Airbnb said that “the safety and privacy of our community — both online and offline — is our priority.""""Airbnb policies strictly prohibit hidden cameras in listings and we take reports of any violations extremely seriously,"" the group said emphasizing that ""we have permanently removed this bad actor from our platform.”It also acknowledged that the ""original handling of this incident did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves, and we have apologized to the family and fully refunded their stay.""""There have been over half a billion guest arrivals in Airbnb listings to date and negative incidents are incredibly rare,” it concluded.

Democrats rejected a Republican bid to make an anti-Yemen war bill about the Israel boycott movement. How they got there takes some explaining. The Democratic-led House on Thursday voted 247-175 to pass a bill that would end US support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. President Donald Trump sees Saudi Arabia as one of the closest US allies and is likely to veto the bill. Even if he does, it represents a major domestic rebuke of his Middle East policy.Republicans in the House couldn’t scuttle the bill, but instead used the inevitable yes vote to box Democrats into a corner: The GOP members exercised a maneuver, called a motion to recommit, in an effort to attach to the bill unrelated language condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel.Democrats don’t want to be seen as anti-Israel or soft on antisemitism. Nevertheless, they also knew that according to parliamentary rules, any bill that includes language irrelevant to its main subject requires the bill to get approval by the Senate — these days, Republican-led.The last time the Yemen bill was considered, in February, Republicans tried a similar maneuver, attaching language condemning antisemitism. In that case, Democrats surprised Republicans by allowing the language to go through. Republicans were then placed in the odd position of voting against the entirety of the Yemen bill while having promoted its component on antisemitism.Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., then used the attached antisemitism language as a pretext, under parliamentary rules, to quash the bill. Democrats swore that this time they would defeat the motion to recommit so the Yemen bill would pass.And indeed, all but five Democrats voted against the motion to recommit so a “clean” version of the Yemen bill could move forward.As expected, Republicans immediately seized on the opportunity to depict Democrats as anti-Israel.“Every single Democrat but five voted against Israel and voted to allow the BDS movement to grow,” Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said after the vote. “Today’s a sad day.”McCarthy’s dig raises the specter that Republicans will use the vote against Democrats in the next election. It would be a risky move; Democrats could run ads noting that Republicans in February ultimately voted against a bill that condemned antisemitism.Jewish Democrats were already pushing back against attempts to politicize the vote. Rep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., a moderate Democrat and a veteran, lashed out at McCarthy on Twitter. Americans have been murdered because they’re Jewish. When I was deployed, there were times I couldn’t say I was Jewish. Typical for you to lie about my support for Israel, but I’m not going to tolerate anyone using my faith like a game. Not now. Not ever. https://t.co/TRQyqplAwq — Max Rose (@MaxRose4NY) April 5, 2019 “Americans have been murdered because they’re Jewish. When I was deployed, there were times I couldn’t say I was Jewish,” he said in response to Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican New York state legislator who mocked Rose and attached video of McCarthy’s statement. “Typical for you to lie about my support for Israel, but I’m not going to tolerate anyone using my faith like a game. Not now. Not ever.”Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., a Navy veteran and former prosecutor, said the focus should be on the crisis in Yemen, separate from her own and her colleagues’ support for Israel.

WASHINGTON — At first, it reads like a grim joke: Less than six months after the worst attack on Jews in US history, the Trump administration took the bold decision to … shut down a unit tracking domestic terrorism. Dig a little, however, and it’s a more complicated picture. The good news is that there are existing government agencies tracking domestic terrorism and particularly white supremacists, like the man who allegedly shot dead 11 Jewish worshippers in Pittsburgh in October.The bad news, say some experts, is that the way the government, and particularly the Trump administration, tracks antisemitism is a mess, with or without the dedicated unit inside the Department of Homeland Security that just got disbanded.Here are some questions about the move and its implications. What happened? The Daily Beast reported this week that the Department of Homeland Security shut down the domestic terrorism analysis unit within its Office of Intelligence and Analysis.The analysts compiled and shared information on homegrown extremists with state and local law enforcement agencies, and with possible targets. Those targets include Jewish groups that handle security, like the Anti-Defamation League and the Secure Community Network, a group affiliated with the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.DHS in a lengthy statement to the Daily Beast said that the changes will make the tracking of potential domestic terrorists, and the sharing of information, more efficient and that the tracking had, in fact, increased recently.“The idea presented by some that we have cut our commitment to defeating all forms of radical ideology — including white supremacist and domestic terrorist — is patently false and the exact opposite of what we have done,” said David Glawe, the recently installed chief of Intelligence and Analysis.Less clear was exactly how the change would lead to enhanced information sharing. Steve Pomerantz, a former FBI agent who is now the director of counterterrorism programs at the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, said it would make more sense to devolve the intelligence analysis and sharing to the FBI, which institutionally had greater experience in tracking domestic threats. DHS, he said, was better suited to ensuring that ports of entry were secure.“When you talk about intelligence gathering in domestic terrorism, analysis of intelligence gathering, that is the FBI’s responsibility, they are the principal agency to combat terrorism, whether it is international terrorism that presents itself in the US, or domestic terrorism,” he said. “It’s hard for me to understand the value added of DHS in terms of domestic terrorism.” What do DHS’s Jewish clients think of this? The two clients, SCN and ADL had radically different takes.Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL’s CEO. said the move “defies logic.” He took direct aim at the Trump administration, citing what he depicted as its muted responses not only to the Pittsburgh massacre but to the deadly neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017, and to the mass killing of 50 Muslims in New Zealand this year, carried out by a white supremacist.“The current administration has been chipping away at our nation’s ability to address a deadly serious national security threat: right-wing extremism,” Greenblatt said in a statement. “To simply disregard this threat, especially after what we witnessed in Pittsburgh, Charlottesville, Charleston, and even overseas in Christchurch, New Zealand could put lives at risk.”He called for greater congressional oversight of domestic terrorism tracking.Michael Masters, who directs SCN (which works closely with ADL in tracking threats), said that DHS’s argument that the move would increase efficiency was persuasive.“I have been assured by DHS that the changes they have made will lead to better information-sharing and coordination between law enforcement partners, notably between DHS and the FBI,” he said in an email. “In this, it is my understanding that the changes were designed to not only improve the sharing of information but increase the likelihood that domestic terrorist events were stopped.” What is it the ADL worried about? Ryan Greer, the ADL’s director for program assessment and strategy, said the mission of tracking domestic terrorists would be diluted without a dedicated team.“What they are saying is that other people who cover a range of issues, airline security, cybersecurity, maybe sometimes they will deal with domestic terrorism,” said Greer, who worked in senior anti-terrorism positions in the Obama administration’s State Department and Department of Homeland Security. “To say that the same person who will be focused on baggage handling policy or traffic control will have the same focus” as the disbanded team “is simply laughable.”A properly functioning dedicated team would notice, for instance, that the alleged Pittsburgh attacker and the confessed New Zealand killer were in the same online forums, being radicalized by the same propaganda, Greer said.John Cohen, a senior adviser at Rutgers University’s Institute for Emergency Preparedness and Homeland Security, said in an interview that he was sure that DHS would pass on tips of pending attacks. But he was concerned that the DHS clients, including local law enforcement and faith-based groups, could miss a bigger picture now that a dedicated team was not compiling reports.“There’s no doubt DHS will share information on potential attacks,” he said. “What I’m more concerned about is whether faith-based organizations and others getting more strategic analysis that allows them to understand the threat environment and take steps to secure communities and congregations.” So we’re losing an important means of tracking the rise of white supremacists? This is where it gets really complicated. Whether white supremacy is on the rise depends on how you assess it — and whether DHS tracking has been any help at all is also an open question.JINSA’s Pomerantz says that the threat from white supremacists was more lethal when he was at the FBI in the 1980s and 1990s, noting the 1984 assassination of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg, attacks on synagogues and the existence of The Order, an armed white supremacist militia. Pomerantz said he believed the more imminent threat was from radical Islamists, who he said are organized and control territory overseas in a way that white supremacists do not.The ADL released a study , however, noting that “extremist-related murders in 2018 were overwhelmingly linked to right-wing extremists.”“Largely absent from this list of killers were extremists motivated by radical interpretations of Islam,” Greenblatt wrote in an op-ed for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency . “Only one of the 50 murders had any connection to Islamist extremism — and even then the perpetrator had ties to white supremacy. In 2018, the US was thankfully spared the mass murders by Islamist extremists we’ve seen in recent years.”Michael German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, agreed that white supremacists were better organized a generation ago, when he was working for the FBI undercover and infiltrating white supremacist groups. He cited one of the worst terrorist attacks on US soil, the 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City.But German, an expert on extremism, said that law enforcement tracking of white supremacists was also hampered structurally. Law enforcement staffing tends to be overwhelmingly white, and officials historically have been likelier to play down the threat from the communities with which they are familiar.“White people who go to work and then come home to a safe white neighborhood don’t worry about white supremacists attacking them or their families,” he said. German routinely reviews the reports from DHS and other agencies and said that reports on potential violence from non-white supremacist groups tended to be more alarmist, if only because the reporters were less familiar with the communities.“It’s not surprising to see police coming out in riot gear” to face a Black Lives Matter protest “when they read in their intelligence briefings that there’s a movement of black extremists trying to kill them.” So is the fight against extremism of all types being politicized? Another factor inhibiting reporting on white supremacists was the Obama administration’s botched rollout of a report on “right-wing extremism.” Republicans objected to the term “right wing” and veterans’ groups objected to its reporting that extremists would likely target young veterans returning from overseas. German said that controversy led DHS officials to become wary when tracking white supremacists.Compounding the institutional reluctance to track white-supremacist extremism, German said, is an administration that has downplayed and in some cases appeared to encourage white supremacists. When asked after the New Zealand attack whether white nationalists were a growing threat around the world, Trump replied: “I don’t really. I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. It’s certainly a terrible thing.”After the Charlottesville violence, Trump initially blamed both sides for the violence, a day later condemned the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, and a day after that said there were “some very fine people” on both sides of a clash that pitted anti-fascist protesters against white power marchers who had chanted “Jews will not replace us.”Greer agreed that the White House and other politicians set priorities through their rhetoric and actions. “There is an overall trend of politicians mainstreaming hate,” he said, noting that Trump plays up threats from the Islamic State, while downplaying threats from white supremacists, although both organize similarly, through online recruiting.More insidiously, German said, law enforcement is susceptible to a white supremacist tactic of provoking violence, and then depicting it as the fault of the leftist counterprotesters, noting that was how police initially treated the 2017 Charlottesville violence, a riot in Sacramento in 2016, and a rally in New York last year by the far-right Proud Boys group.“What the supremacists are doing at these rallies is a tactic they’ve used for generations,” he said. “The idea is to have a large public event for the purpose of attracting protesters so they can attack them.”

Friends of Padre Steve’s World,
Today was a good day. I was able to do a limited amount of work to help Judy around the house last night and today as we get ready for her second knee replacement surgery Friday, and I will continue with that tomorrow. It hurts and I have to use a cane to get around, but we are making progress. I have my own appointments for my knees on Monday and Tuesday and submitted my cancellation request for my voluntary retirement on Friday so I can get my knees, hips, and other medical needs fixed before I leave active duty.
I helped Judy to the extent I could today and she allowed me to watch on the ESPN app the progress of the Bayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund “Klassiker” match since Fox Sports dropped it to their Spanish channel which needs a subscription to view. That pissed me off because Bayern blew out Dortmund in every sense of the meaning of blowout by a score of 5-0. Bayern Striker Robert Lewendowski scored his 200th and 201st Bundesliga goals in the beat down. In which Bayern controlled the ball 59% of the game, had 22 shots, 10 of which were on goal while limiting Dortmund to 4 shots, just one of which was on goal, taking command of the race for the Bundesliga title, leading by a point with a 15 goal differential. The difference between today and the winter break for the Bundesliga when Dortmund had a 9 point lead on the table and had beaten Bayern 3-2 in a thrilling game made Dortmund the team to beat. But since then it has been all Bayern, as die Röten chipped away at Dortmund’s lead battling injuries and questions about their first year coach Niko Kovac and finally took the lead on Dortmund with 6 matches left in the season. If Bayern can finish strong it will be their 7th straight Bundesliga championship, but the first one in years that has had been such a thrilling title chase. It’s not over yet but I think, as I told my NATO German friends back in January, when it is done Bayern will be on top. Of course to understand this you have to be a fan of a team which has big rivals and a tradition of winning. For the record, Bayern has won a total of 70 league, National, European, and international championships or cups. There are not that many other professional sports teams that have such a record of championships. I expect they will add to that this year with another Bundesliga title and probably another German Cup, but I digress…
In other news I had the honor of officiating the marriage of a dear friend and colleague from the Joint Forces Staff College. She is a wonderful woman, brilliant intellect, retired Navy Commander, with a great personality and sense of humor. Over the years she has gone through a lot of hard times, but with grace and dignity. When she asked me to conduct her wedding and to meet her fiancé I was overjoyed. I had never seen her look so happy and to at the same time discover that her fiancé was a gem. It was an honor and joy to marry them this evening.
Likewise, the event was a reunion with a lot of my friends from the Staff College. That was a remarkable time. I have missed them since transferring to Little Creek in April 2017. Today I got around with the help of a cane. Last year I was walking and running 5-15 miles a day 5 days a week and would go to Gettysburg and Antietam and walk up to 20 miles a day with a pack on my back across those hallowed battlefields. My friends there want me to come back when my voluntary retirement is canceled, which it should be.
So anyway, until tomorrow,"

Shame on her for not making enough money and screwing her son over. Now this boy will probably grow up to become a blue-pilled beta cuck who will be happy to give half his sh*t to the first woman he dates and ultimately marries. This boys future is doomed. Hopefully he’ll find out about the MGTOW philosophy before it’s too late and follow it."

This boys mom should be ashamed of herself. Isn’t she supposed to be strong and independent? She should be making enough money to get herself a car. Not taking from this poor boys childhood. This boys is gonna grow up to be a blue-pilled beta cuck who’ll marry the first dame he meets and give her half his stuff when she divorces him. Hopefully he takes the red pill of men going their own way and continues to live that philosophy.

The internet is full of stories from parents like me. I had an aunt, deceased now, whose oldest son and his wife had a disagreement with, and never saw or spoke yo her again in her lifetime. It broke her heart. So there are worse stories than mine. I at least have one son who calls from time to time. But the youngest, who was terrific when he was little, now couldn't care less about me. I thought once he became a parent he would appreciate me but since he hangs with his father I get the disrespect his father should be receiving. My mom tried talking to him when she was living, and so has my now husband. All to no avail. He only calls when he wants something, never acknowledges Mother's day or my birthday."
