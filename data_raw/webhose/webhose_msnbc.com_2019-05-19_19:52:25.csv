"On Mueller report hearing, Barr, Graham failed to do their homework | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mueller-report-hearing-barr-graham-failed-do-their-homework,"By Steve Benen Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) did not do himself any favors with his role in yesterday’s hearing with Attorney General Bill Barr. As a Washington Post analysis made clear, the Republican senator “played pretty fast and loose with the facts.”
Indeed, the list of missteps wasn’t brief. Among other things, Graham repeated obvious factual errors on everything from “collusion” evidence to Robert Mueller’s intentions on obstruction allegations.
The Republican does, however, have an excuse, though it’s not an especially good one: Graham admitted he hasn’t read the Mueller report . It’s easy for a senator to say things that aren’t true about an investigation when he hasn’t bothered to familiarize himself with the details of the investigation’s findings.
By this reasoning, Graham wasn’t trying to deceive people with his bogus claims; he just didn’t know, in a rather literal sense, what he was talking about.
But this in turn got me thinking about what Graham and William Barr may have in common: maybe both have struggled because neither one has done enough reading.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) asked the attorney general yesterday whether he personally reviewed the underlying evidence, alleging presidential obstruction of justice.
BARR: No, we accepted the statements in the report as the factual record. We did not go underneath it to see whether or not they were accurately accepted as accurate. And made our–made our–
HARRIS: Accepted the report as the evidence?
BARR: Yes.
HARRIS: You did not question or look at the underlying evidence that supports the conclusions in the report?
BARR: No.
HARRIS: Did Mr. Rosenstein review the evidence that underlies and supports the conclusions in the report to your knowledge?
BARR: Not to my knowledge. We accepted the statements in the report–and characterization of the evidence as true.
HARRIS: Did anyone in your executive office review the evidence supporting the report?
BARR: No.
HARRIS: No. Yet you represented to the American public that the evidence was not ‘sufficient to support an obstruction of justice offense’?
It was a rough exchange for the attorney general, but it wasn’t the only one.
A separate Washington Post report added, in reference to yesterday’s hearing, “Barr admitted he hadn’t reviewed the evidence underlying Mueller’s findings on obstruction, he hadn’t looked at the evidence undergirding the origination of the probe into possible coordination and, at one point, even made a comment raising questions about his familiarity with one of the key issues at the heart of the probe.”
This whole process might be more productive if key players were willing to do their homework.

Trump's infrastructure plan faces opposition from his own party | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-infrastructure-plan-faces-opposition-his-own-party,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump hosted a surprisingly productive meeting with congressional Democrats this week, and the result was an agreement in principle: federal policymakers will move forward with a plan to invest $2 trillion in American infrastructure.
By all accounts, the president told Dems his interest in the issue “may not be typically Republican,” but he assured the opposition party of his seriousness. “I’ll lead on this,” Trump said.
Whether his party cares or not about the president’s willingness to “lead on this” is another matter entirely. Indeed, GOP lawmakers did not participate in the talks, and as Politico reported yesterday, they’re now vetoing the White House blueprint.
“The likelihood of that happening at $2 trillion – just on the face of what I saw – is pie in the sky,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). […]
“I don’t see where the pay-fors will come from,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump’s closest allies on Capitol Hill.
“It’s a tremendous amount,” said Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the ranking member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. When pressed on whether a package that size would have a realistic chance of passing in Congress, Graves did not mince words: “No,” he said, literally waving off the idea with his hand.
Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) added that to pass the GOP-led Senate, an infrastructure plan would need to be fully paid for. In practical terms, that creates a hurdle that will not be cleared: Republicans won’t support tax increases, and Democrats aren’t likely to approve $2 trillion in spending cuts to finance an infrastructure package.
All of which suggests there’s one area in which congressional Dems and Donald Trump appear to be on the same page – and it’s an area unlikely to produce real results.
And while that’s no doubt disappointing to infrastructure advocates, it’s also worth stepping back to acknowledge the familiarity of the circumstances.
When Trump met with lawmakers on gun policy , he endorsed progressive goals sought by Democrats, only to be told by his party that Republicans would never go for those measures.
When Trump met with lawmakers on immigration , the exact same thing happened. In fact, as regular readers may recall, it reached the point that Republican officials insisted that the president not negotiate directly with Democrats, for fear that he might be “ tricked ” into endorsing proposals he wasn’t supposed to like.
The same was true during the 2017 drama over health care, when it was an open secret that Republicans were terrified of the prospect of Trump negotiating directly with Democratic leaders. The fear, of course, was that the amateur president would sit down Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, he’d find their pitch compelling; and Trump would end up giving Dems everything they asked for.
This week, it apparently happened again, with the broad strokes of an infrastructure plan.
As important as the specific details of the various negotiations are, this track record raises an awkward question: what’s the point of sitting down with Trump to discuss policy?

Collins eyes second letter to AG Barr on fate of health care law | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/collins-eyes-second-letter-ag-barr-fate-health-care-law,"By Steve Benen In late March, the Justice Department alerted a federal appeals court to a striking request from the Trump administration: it expects the judiciary to destroy the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. There were subsequent reports that some, including Attorney General Bill Barr, counseled against the move, but the White House was insistent on the matter.
The underlying argument is convoluted and based on the absurd idea that when Congress zeroed out the ACA’s individual mandate, it lit the match that should burn down “Obamacare” altogether. On April 1, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who voted for the bill that gutted the individual mandate, wrote to the attorney general to say he was making a mistake. Politico reported at the time:
Sen. Susan Collins wants Attorney General Bill Barr to reverse the Justice Department’s aggressive move, seeking to obliterate the Affordable Care Act.
In a letter to Barr on Monday, the Maine Republican argues that if the Trump administration wants to change the health care law, it should come to Congress and ask. Otherwise, Barr’s department should be defending the law from a lawsuit seeking to cripple it, she says.
“Rather than seeking to have the courts invalidate the ACA, the proper route for the administration to pursue would be to propose changes to the ACA or to once again seek its repeal. The administration should not attempt to use the courts to bypass Congress,” Collins wrote to Barr, whom she supported in his confirmation vote in February.
If the attorney general agreed with the Maine Republican’s concerns, he didn’t show it. In fact, Barr’s department appears to have ignored Collins’ advice altogether: it filed a brief with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals this week, making the case for the judiciary taking coverage from millions of families.
It was against this backdrop that Collins told a Bloomberg News reporter yesterday that she’s prepared to … write another letter to Barr.
In all fairness, I have no idea what this second letter, which will apparently be co-signed by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), is going to say. It’s entirely possible that Collins will throw caution to the wind, author a furious screed, and make a series of substantive threats that will both get the attorney general’s attention and give him pause.
But at some point, concerned senators may need to do a little more than write concerned letters.
Collins, who’s up for re-election next year, is in an awkward spot. The Republican senator voted against the Affordable Care Act; she voted for the tax legislation that’s imperiled the ACA; she voted to confirm Bill Barr as attorney general; and though we don’t yet know how the case will play out in the courts, it’s entirely possible she also voted to confirm some of the federal judges who may yet side the with the Trump administration against the health care law.
Perhaps it’s time to explore options that don’t involve asking the attorney general to be more responsible?

"Moore's record was his fault, Moore's job offer was Trump's fault | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/moores-record-was-his-fault-moores-job-offer-was-trumps-fault,"By Steve Benen We now know that Republican pundit Stephen Moore will not join the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Donald Trump wanted him for the position, and said he’d fight for Moore, but the commentator was done in by a combination of incompetence, ignorance, a total lack of qualifications, sycophantic partisanship, and a lengthy record of publishing offensive missives.
But before the political world moves on, it’s worth pausing to appreciate who bears responsibility for this fiasco. To be sure, Stephen Moore is to blame for his own record, though in this case, it’s Donald Trump who’s to blame for choosing the pundit for the Fed in the first place without doing any due diligence.
Politico had a good piece on this overnight, explaining that the White House should’ve seen this mess coming.
Past administrations have historically spent weeks or even months trying to identify potentially damaging information about candidates for administration jobs – long before their nominations are announced. Yet Trump’s White House again appeared to neglect the basic vetting that has for decades been the cornerstone of the nomination process. […]
The Trump administration’s long-standing vetting problems have contributed to a surge in doomed nominees.
In total, Trump has withdrawn 62 nominees since taking office, according to data provided to POLITICO by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that tracks federal vacancies. At this point in his presidency, Barack Obama had withdrawn 30 nominees. The figures include only people who were formally nominated, so Moore and others who took themselves out of consideration before their official paperwork was sent to the Senate aren’t counted.
If this were May 2017, the circumstances would still be embarrassing, leading to all kinds of chatter about “amateur hour” in the new White House.
But it’s May 2019. Donald Trump and his team have been in office for more than two years. They’re supposed to have some sense of how to handle tasks like these responsibly.
And yet, despite these expectations, the president and his operation actually seem to be getting a little worse – as evidenced by the back-to-back failures of Herman Cain and Moore.
A former senior White House official told Politico , in reference to the president, “He’s impatient and impulsive. When he makes a decision, he wants to move forward. There aren’t any people around him urging caution.”
It’s that last part that struck me as especially important. As we recently discussed , Trump appears unrestrained at this point in his presidency. The ostensible grown-ups have left the White House; the hand-holding period is over; and what’s left is a hapless president with no one willing to tell him, “This is crazy.”
Just the opposite is true: Trump has now surrounded himself with officials who take pride in letting the president do as he pleases.
In Stephen Moore’s case, Trump saw a poorly written op-ed; it told the president what he wanted to hear; and the president decided on the spot that the Republican pundit belonged on the Fed.
None of the considerations a responsible president would be expected to make ever entered the equation. The idea of vetting before tweeting apparently wasn’t part of plan – because in this dysfunctional White House, it never is.
Trump has assured Americans his operation is a “ fine-tuned machine .” He occasionally offers powerful evidence to the contrary.

"Trump finds a new way to lie about Russia scandal, Mueller report | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-finds-new-way-lie-about-russia-scandal-mueller-report,"By Steve Benen In recent weeks, Donald Trump has relied heavily on a series of brazenly false claims about the Russia scandal and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, though it’d be a mistake to assume he’s done adding to the list.
The president has said Mueller found no evidence of collusion, which we know is false . He’s said the investigation turned up no evidence of obstruction, which is the exact opposite of the truth . The Republican has even said the Mueller report “totally exonerated” him, which some Republicans believe, despite the claim being plainly untrue .
Overnight, however, Trump added a new one :
“The Mueller Report strongly stated that there was No Collusion with Russia (of course) and, in fact, they were rebuffed at every turn in attempts to gain access “
Right off the bat, we already know that the Mueller report didn’t “strongly state” there was “no collusion.” (I’m starting to suspect Trump didn’t actually read the report. Call it a hunch.) In fact, the special counsel strongly stated that the probe didn’t examine the “collusion” question, and instead considered evidence of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and its Russian benefactors.
And on that front, instead of clearing the Republican operation, Mueller concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.
But it’s the idea that Russians were “rebuffed at every turn” that stands out. A Washington Post analysis described the presidential tweet as “immediately, obviously and somewhat amusingly untrue.”
For those who hold a looser standard of collusion than does Mueller, a central example of a questionable Trump campaign interaction with Russian interests is in the meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. You know that meeting. It’s the one where a music promoter working for the family of a powerful Russian developer emailed Donald Trump Jr. to say that the Russian government wanted to aid Trump’s campaign, and Trump Jr. “rebuffed” them by saying “if it’s what you say, I love it.”
May we all be similarly rebuffed by those we love.
The Mueller report is in fact replete with examples of Trump campaign members and allies doing the opposite of rebuffing overtures from Russia.
The list wasn’t short and featured familiar stories of all kinds of people in Trump’s orbit “rebuffing” Russians by meeting and exploring opportunities with them.
Let’s make this plain: either Donald Trump is once again lying to the public or he hasn’t the foggiest idea what “rebuffed” means.

Sanders' dubious claim: Trump admin 'takes election meddling seriously' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/sanders-dubious-claim-trump-admin-takes-election-meddling-seriously,"By Steve Benen White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders alerted reporters this afternoon to an interesting tidbit: Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had an hour-long chat this morning, and the two covered quite a bit of ground – including the resolution of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
Toward the very end of the Q&A with Sanders, there was an exchange that stood out for me:
QUESTION: So, you had said that they talked about the Mueller report being over. But the Mueller report also outlines in extensive detail attempts by Putin and Russia to interfere in the election. Did that not come up at all in the course of the–
SANDERS: Again, the conversation on that part was very quick. But what I can tell you is that this administration, unlike the previous one, takes election meddling seriously. And we’re going to do everything that we can to prevent it from happening.
There are three core elements to this, and each one is important.
The first is the angle raised by the reporter, which the White House press secretary was quick to dismiss: the Mueller report makes clear that Russia attacked our elections. It’s a point even the Trump campaign no longer contests . When the American president speaks with the chief executive of a country that launched a military intelligence operation against the United States, it’s not unreasonable to think the American leader would make his dissatisfaction known.
There’s no indication that Trump did anything of the kind.
Second, note Sanders not-so-subtle condemnation of the Obama administration’s approach to foreign election interference. It might be a more compelling point were it not for everything we know about what transpired in 2016 – when Barack Obama and his team urged congressional leaders to show “ solidarity and bipartisan unity ” against foreign manipulation of our democracy, but Mitch McConnell refused .
It’s curious that Sarah Huckabee Sanders overlooked these relevant details.
And third, the idea that the Trump administration takes foreign election meddling seriously is a point of considerable controversy. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, for example, reportedly told Kirstjen Nielsen, before her ouster as Homeland Security secretary, not to even broach the subject of foreign interference in our elections around Trump, apparently because it makes the president feel bad.
The New York Times reported this week, meanwhile, that the Republican president has “little interest or patience for hearing about” warnings of election meddling because Trump “views any discussion of future Russian interference as effectively questioning the legitimacy of his 2016 victory.”
What’s more, it was just last week when one Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ colleagues – I believe his name is Jared Kushner – downplayed the Russian attack in 2016 as being little more than “ a couple of Facebook ads .”
This is the same White House that – a year ago this month – eliminated the job of the nation’s cyber-security czar. The New York Times reported at the time, “Cyber-security experts and members of Congress said they were mystified by the move…. It was the latest in a series of steps that appeared to run counter to the prevailing view in Washington of cybersecurity’s importance.”
When Sanders brags about seriousness with which the administration is taking the issue, some skepticism is in order.

"On Venezuela, Trump sides with Putin over his own team | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/venezuela-trump-sides-putin-over-his-own-team,"By Steve Benen Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 5/3/19, 11:31 PM ET Trump contradicts top aides with reversal after Putin phone call Rachel Maddow reports on a Friday phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, first reported by Russian media, and Trump’s declaration of Russia’s benign intentions toward Venezuela contradicting the significantly more antagonistic perspectives share tweet email save Embed A few months ago, Axios had an interesting report on Donald Trump’s perspective on Venezuela, which had been shaped in part on the president’s interactions with “the Venezuelan expats who frequent his golf club” in south Florida. As crises in the South American country mounted, this did not inspire confidence in the future of the administration’s policy.
Late last week, however, anxieties grew more acute. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the case that Russia had effectively “ invaded ” Venezuela, and as a consequence, Moscow was exerting undo control over developments in the country. It was a message Pompeo – the United States’ chief diplomat and the man responsible for executing the American president’s foreign policy – had pushed repeatedly in a variety of forums.
Similarly, White House National Security Advisor Michael Bolton thought it was his job to push back against Russian interference in Venezuelan affairs. All of which made this Oval Office exchange between a reporter and Donald Trump on Friday afternoon that much more notable.
Q: Mr. President, you spoke with Vladimir Putin earlier today.
TRUMP: Yes, I did.
Q: What options are you looking at to get humanitarian assistance to Venezuela?
TRUMP: Yeah, I had a very good talk with President Putin – probably over an hour. And we talked about many things. Venezuela was one of the topics. And he is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela other than he’d like to see something positive happen for Venezuela.
So, on the one hand, Trump has heard from top members of his team – powerful officials whom the American president personally chose for the posts – who’ve left no doubt about Russian involvement in Venezuela. On the other hand, Trump spoke to Putin, who told the Republican he’s not involved in Venezuela.
Trump, naturally , simply took the Russian president’s word for it.
And what, pray tell, did the American president’s team have to say in response?
On “This Week” yesterday, ABC News’ Jon Karl showed Mike Pompeo the clip of Trump’s comments and asked for some kind of explanation .
KARL: What does he mean the Russians – that Putin does not want to get involved in Venezuela? Aren’t they already deeply involved in supporting Maduro?
POMPEO: The president has said that the Russians must get out. I’m going to meet with Foreign Minister Lavrov in a couple of days. We’ll have more conversations about this. The objective is very clear; we want the Iranians out, we want the Russians out, we want the Cubans out. That’s ultimately what has to take place in order for Venezuelan democracy to be restored. It’s very clear. I don’t think anything the president said is inconsistent with that.
KARL: But wait a minute, you said that Maduro was on the plane ready to leave and to flee for Cuba and it was the Russians that told him to stay. And the president is saying that Putin told him that he’s not looking to get involved in Venezuela. Does the president not realize what you have said publicly and what is obvious, that Putin is deeply involved in Venezuela? I mean, what does he mean when he’s saying he’s not looking to get involved?
POMPEO: Yeah, I didn’t see the full context of the quote there. I don’t know what context that was in.
Look, I don’t mean to put too fine a point on this, but consider how the circumstances unfolded. On Thursday, the U.S. secretary of state used aggressive rhetoric about Russian interference in Venezuela. On Friday, Donald Trump said the exact opposite, humiliating his chief diplomat in the process.
We’re supposed to believe that Mike Pompeo made no effort to learn what his own boss said about the crisis that he and his State Department are working so diligently to address? Pompeo couldn’t go to the transcript of Trump’s comments – which, conveniently, the White House published to its website – and Ctrl-F for the word “Venezuela”?
Pompeo “didn’t see the full context of the quote.” Why not? Wasn’t he at all curious? Shouldn’t he have taken a look sometime before doing three Sunday-show interviews?
If I send him a copy of the transcript, and give him a chance to read the full context – a task that would take roughly 10 seconds – perhaps the cabinet secretary could get back to me as to why he and his boss seem to have two very different views about the ongoing crisis?

"As election threats mount, Trump flaunts weakness toward Putin | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/election-threats-mount-trump-flaunts-weakness-toward-putin,"By Steve Benen Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 5/3/19, 11:31 PM ET Trump contradicts top aides with reversal after Putin phone call Rachel Maddow reports on a Friday phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, first reported by Russian media, and Trump’s declaration of Russia’s benign intentions toward Venezuela contradicting the significantly more antagonistic perspectives share tweet email save Embed Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has had multiple opportunities to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin on Moscow’s military intelligence operation targeting American elections. Throughout his presidency, for reasons the White House hasn’t even tried to explain, Trump has refused .
The problem is even more acute now. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report just told the American president, and the rest of the world, “The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.” Soon after, Trump’s handpicked FBI director, Christopher Wray, gave sworn congressional testimony in which he described Russian efforts to interfere in American elections as a “significant counterintelligence threat.”
It was against this backdrop that Trump had a lengthy phone call with Putin on Friday, creating a new opportunity for the Republican to stick up for his own country, demand accountability, and warn the autocratic leader not to target us again. Would Trump step up?
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that the two presidents spoke about the resolution of the Mueller investigation, but when a reporter asked whether Trump broached the subject of Russia’s attack, she dodged .
Her boss, however, removed all doubt .
Q: Did you tell [Putin] not to meddle in the next election?
TRUMP: We didn’t discuss that. Really, we didn’t discuss it.
I especially liked the use of the word “really,” as if the Republican was eager to convince everyone that he wasn’t peddling a dubious line: Trump “ really ” didn’t bother to tell our attacker not to do it again.
In other words, even after the American president was confronted with definitive evidence that Russia attacked us – the Trump campaign now accepts this as fact – he still has no interest in holding the Russian president accountable or demanding that Moscow back off ahead of 2020.
It’s hard to say why, exactly, the Republican is so timid. Maybe Trump still doesn’t believe his own country’s intelligence. Maybe he’s been compromised in some way by his Russian benefactor. Maybe he assumes Russian election interference will benefit him and his party, so there’s no reason to press the issue.
Whatever the reasoning, Trump’s weakness is pitiful.
In fact, even some of the president’s most loyal allies have struggled to come up with an explanation for the American president’s cowardice. On “Face the Nation” yesterday, CBS News’ Margaret Brennan asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, “Why didn’t he bring up election interference on this phone call when he said he did discuss the findings of the Mueller report which found ‘sweeping and systematic’ Russian interference in 2016?”
Pompeo responded , “Well, you’ll have to ask the White House that question.”
The cabinet secretary had two days to think of an answer to this fairly obvious question, which he must’ve known was coming. Apparently, this was the best he could come up with.
Postscript : For the record, it’s worth taking a moment to acknowledge the fact that Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin about the Mueller investigation, but Trump refused to speak with Mueller about the Mueller investigation.

Trump's confusion over China and trade causes new troubles | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-confusion-over-china-and-trade-causes-new-troubles,"By Steve Benen With trade talks between the United States and China poised to enter a new phase, Donald Trump apparently decided it’d be wise to threaten Beijing with ridiculous new tariffs. Here was the American president’s latest salvo, delivered via Twitter yesterday afternoon:
“For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results.
“The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday. 325 Billions Dollars of additional goods sent to us by China remain untaxed, but will be shortly, at a rate of 25%. The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China. The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!”
Right off the bat, it’s important to note that the Republican appears to still be struggling with the details of his own trade policy. China, for example, isn’t paying those tariffs ; consumers in the United States are. The idea that non-existent “payments” from Beijing are boosting the American economy is completely bonkers.
Trump added this morning, “The United States has been losing, for many years, 600 to 800 Billion Dollars a year on Trade. With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars.”
No, actually, we don’t. The American president continues to wildly exaggerate the size of our trade deficit with China, but just as importantly, Trump also doesn’t yet grasp the fact that trade deficits are not evidence of money we’ve “lost.”
Trump recently boasted , in reference to trade policy, “I understand that issue better than anybody.” He later added , “I know every ingredient. I know every stat. I know it better than anybody knows it.”
Oh, how I wish that were true.
But the larger significance of this goes beyond pointing and laughing at the American president’s ignorance about one of his signature issues. In this case, Trump’s confusion came with real consequences.
Specifically, the Republican’s odd tweets sent international markets tumbling , and they simultaneously led Chinese trade negotiators to consider puling out of this week’s talks altogether.
I understand the basic idea behind the American president’s strategy: with the next round of negotiations scheduled to begin on Wednesday, Trump wanted to gain some kind of leverage, so he sent a shot across China’s bow. The point was to effectively say, “Reach an agreement that I like or I’ll start doing more harm.”
But even if this escalation doesn’t push Beijing away from the negotiating table, is Trump’s strategy real? Was it done in consultation with U.S. trade officials? Does he intend to follow through with his threat – later this week – regardless of the consequences?
Or was this simply the latest in a series of poorly thought out bluffs ?

John Bolton sends Iran a dubious 'message' with carrier strike group | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/john-bolton-sends-iran-dubious-message-carrier-strike-group,"By Steve Benen White House National Security Advisor John Bolton announced late yesterday that the United States “is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the U.S. Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime.” As NBC News’ report noted, the strike group is not small.
The strike group consists of the Abraham Lincoln, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier; the USS Leyte Gulf, a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser; Carrier Air Wing Seven; and destroyers from Destroyer Squadron Two.
There’s no shortage of questions surrounding the announcement. For example, was the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group going to be there anyway? NBC News’ report added, “According to the Navy, the strike group left Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, on April 1 on a regularly scheduled deployment.”
We similarly don’t know what, if anything, this announcement was a response to.
But stepping back, I’m also eager to hear why John Bolton was the one to make this announcement. As a rule, the Pentagon would be responsible for issuing statements about deployments like these.
Does it have anything to do with the fact that Donald Trump still hasn’t nominated anyone to serve as the secretary of Defense – an unprecedented vacancy that’s now lasted more than four months?
It’s the kind of question that might be answered at the Pentagon’s next press briefing, except in the Trump era, the DOD doesn’t really have press briefings anymore.
Reporters might also ask the White House why Bolton is tackling a responsibility that would ordinarily fall with the Defense secretary, but the Trump White House doesn’t hold many press briefings, either.
What we have instead is a vague press release from an ultra-hawk on Iran, who may or may not speak on behalf of the president, about a provocative military move in the Middle East. What could possibly go wrong?

* Late Friday, a federal court struck down Ohio’s gerrymandered congressional districts as unconstitutional and ordered Republican officials to submit a new map by June 14. It was a major development, though it may soon be rendered moot by conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court, which is scheduled to soon rule on partisan gerrymandering.
* Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a Democratic presidential contender, this morning unveiled an ambitious plan to address gun violence , including a proposal to create a federal gun licensing program.
* Over the weekend, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled a sweeping agricultural plan , which, among other things, called for breaking up major agriculture corporations and placing a moratorium on future agri-business mergers.
* Sen. Mike Enzi (R) announced over the weekend that he will retire next year rather than seek a fifth term. He’s now the fourth sitting U.S. senator to announce retirement plans ahead of the 2020 cycle, following Sens. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), and Tom Udall (D-N.M.).
* Reinforcing suspicions that the White House is concerned about former Vice President Joe Biden’s candidacy, current Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC that his predecessor is “advocating a socialist agenda” – a claim that may come as a surprise to some of Biden’s more progressive critics.
* The latest NBC News/ Wall Street Journal and Gallup polls both show Donald Trump’s approval rating reaching 46%. While that may sound underwhelming, the president is currently enjoying some of the strongest support he’s seen since taking office.
* Ahead of Pennsylvania’s congressional special election in the 12th district, Trump on Friday tweeted his support for Fred Keller, the heavily favored Republican nominee. Election Day is May 21.
* And as of Friday, Julian Castro crossed the minimum-donor threshold and qualified to participate in the upcoming debates for Democratic presidential candidates.

"With Trump's new ICE chief, the 'how' matters as much as the 'why' | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-new-ice-chief-the-how-matters-much-the-why,"By Steve Benen About a month ago, Donald Trump withdrew Ron Vitiello’s nomination to lead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), because as the president put it, he decided to go “in a tougher direction.”
Even for Trump, this was an impulsive and unexpected move, which “stupefied Homeland Security officials and lawmakers” and left many in the administration “ baffled .” Asked about Vitiello’s ouster, ICE officials initially told reporters “they thought the White House had made a clerical error.”
Yesterday, Trump named a new ICE nominee: Mark Morgan, who briefly ran the Border Patrol under President Barack Obama. In this case, I’m just as interested in how he got the nomination as why .
It’s not hard to figure out what made Morgan appealing to Trump: he does, after all, support building a giant wall along the U.S./Mexico border. But something in Roll Call ’s report on his nomination stood out for me.
A former assistant FBI director, Morgan has made appearances on Fox News Channel in recent weeks to discuss both immigration policy and the report of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Morgan told “Fox & Friends” on March 7 that the idea migrants – including children – were being held in cages was really a “talking point for the Democrats”
What’s more, just four days before the president made the announcement via Twitter, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs – a Trump confidant – posted a clip of an interview he’d just done with Mark Morgan in which he insisted no one from the White House had contacted him about the ICE position, but quickly added, “[I]f this president asked me to come up, I’d say yes in a heartbeat…. I know this border; the president’s doing the right thing. He’s right on this issue. If he asked, I would work for him in a heartbeat.”
Four days later, Trump said Morgan had the job. By Morgan’s own reasoning, there couldn’t have been much of a vetting process, since he admitted on national television no one at the White House, “at any level,” had communicated with him at all about the ICE post.
What do you suppose the odds are that the president saw the interview and simply made the decision?
The Washington Post reported that Trump’s Twitter announcement “caught White House aides and Homeland Security officials by surprise. They had not been informed Morgan was Trump’s choice, and at ICE, senior leaders learned of the decision from the president’s tweet, according to two senior administration officials.”
Or put another way, the process was oddly typical for this administration.
This is a position that requires Senate confirmation, though if recent history is any guide, Trump assumes the Republican-led chamber will serve as a rubber-stamp for anyone he chooses.

Trump picks the wrong day to say. 'All the crimes are on the other side' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-06-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-picks-the-wrong-day-say-all-the-crimes-are-the-other-side,"By Steve Benen As recently as last year, Michael Cohen was a deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee and a prominent employee of the Trump Organization. As of this afternoon, however, Donald Trump’s former lawyer and “fixer” is a federal prison inmate .
Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and fixer who pleaded guilty last year to an array of white-collar crimes, arrived at a federal prison in upstate New York on Monday to begin serving his three-year sentence Monday.
Cohen gave a brief statement to reporters outside his New York City apartment Monday morning before jumping in a waiting car to travel to the Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville, a large federal prison complex in the Catskills region.
Cohen, of course, was convicted of a variety of crimes, including two counts related to hush-money payments he made to the president’s alleged former mistresses.
And with that in mind, it was curious to see Trump declare on Twitter this morning, in an all-caps message, “All the crimes are on the other side.”
The president’s timing could’ve been better.
For one thing, there’s no evidence that suggests the Democrats on “the other side” committed any crimes, at least not with regard to the allegations surrounding Trump and his operation.
For another, “all” was probably a poor choice of words. The same day as Trump’s declaration, his former personal attorney will report to a federal prison. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is already in federal prison. Trump’s former White House national security advisor, Michael Flynn, is awaiting sentencing, and may yet be sent to federal prison.
George Papadopoulos, Trump’s former campaign foreign policy adviser, has already served a prison sentence, and Roger Stone will soon go on trial, his fate uncertain.
What’s more, when it comes to Cohen, let’s also not forget that Trump was directly implicated in one of his fixer’s felonies. Trump even received a handy little nickname for his trouble: “Individual 1.”
What was that the president was saying about “all the crimes” being committed by those “on the other side”?

The problem with Pence serving as Trump's policy 'decoder' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-07-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-problem-pence-serving-trumps-policy-decoder,"By Steve Benen The New York Times ran an interesting piece today on Vice President Mike Pence and the specific role he often plays in Donald Trump’s White House: that of presidential “decoder.”
More than halfway into Mr. Trump’s term, he and Mr. Pence have developed what aides describe as a rhythm, in which the president lays out the broad contours of policy and then hands off to the vice president to make the granular sales pitch. […]
In a White House with a revolving door of top officials and a president who is often focused on his own message, it is often left to Mr. Pence – who has ties to the traditional conservative movement – to try to clarify the administration’s approach on key issues.
At face value, this probably makes a fair amount of sense. Every administration works a little differently, but in this White House, it stands to reason that Trump, who neither knows nor cares about governing, would play the role of “big picture” president. In this model, he wants to lay out a vision in broad strokes, while asking Pence to fill in the gaps.
Despite his limitations, the vice president is a former member of the congressional leadership and a former governor of a fairly large state. It’d be an exaggeration to say Pence excels in governing, but compared to Trump, he’s practically a wonk.
My concern is not with the model, but rather, the application of the model – because even if the president delegates some power to Pence to “make the granular sales pitch” and/or “clarify the administration’s approach,” we’ve all learned that the vice president often has no idea when or whether Trump will step on his efforts.
During the lengthy government shutdown, for example, Pence tried to broker a deal with congressional Democratic leaders. It was Trump who rejected the terms his own vice president had offered.
Soon after, Pence spoke with Juan Orlando Hernandez, the president of Honduras, and the vice president praised Hernandez’s cooperative efforts to limit migrant caravans. Soon after, as regular readers may recall, Trump publicly rejected Pence’s line and said the opposite.
When Trump was weighing whether to use an emergency declaration to divert federal funds to a border project, in defiance of Congress’ wishes, Pence worked with some GOP senators on possible revisions to the National Emergencies Act – the law Trump had decided to abuse. After Pence signaled to Capitol Hill that the White House was open to legislative changes, the president quickly closed the door .
I don’t blame Trump for dispatching Pence to make the case for the administration, but since the vice president has little role in shaping policies, and Trump routinely contradicts Pence, why would anyone listen to him?

Georgia's new anti-abortion law part of a radical new trend | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-07-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/georgias-new-anti-abortion-law-part-radical-new-trend,"By Steve Benen At the national level, anti-abortion policymakers have repeatedly pushed in recent years for measures to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. A new Republican law in Georgia draws the line much, much earlier .
Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed legislation on Tuesday banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. That can be as early as six weeks, before many women know they’re pregnant.
Kemp said he was signing the bill “to ensure that all Georgians have the opportunity to live, grow, learn and prosper in our great state.”
The signing caps weeks of tension and protests at the state Capitol in Atlanta, and marks the beginning of what could be a lengthy and costly legal battle over the law’s constitutionality.
It’s that “before many women know they’re pregnant” line that stands out for a reason. Under the new policy in Georgia, which will be tested vigorously in the courts, women can still terminate an unwanted pregnancy, but they’ll have to do so five or six weeks after conception.
Those who don’t know they’re pregnant that early on in the process will, evidently, be out of luck.
Other states, including Alabama and North Dakota, have pushed similar measures in recent years, but each of those laws have been struck down in the courts,
Anti-abortion forces, however, believe the courts are a whole lot further to the right than they used to be.
Indeed, Anna North noted today that these six-week measures, once seen as fringe proposals, have quickly become the norm in Trump-era GOP politics. It’s precisely why the new anti-abortion law in Georgia is the fourth such bill to be signed this year, following similar measures in Ohio, Kentucky, and Mississippi. Iowa passed its version last year.
All of this is predicated on an assumption: the new U.S. Supreme Court, having moved to the right with two justices from Donald Trump, will overturn the Roe v. Wade precedent, possibly with one of these so-called “heartbeat” bills.
That assumption may very well be correct – and we may know for sure before Election Day 2020.

FBI's Wray isn't on board with Barr's talk of campaign 'spying' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-07-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fbis-wray-isnt-board-barrs-talk-campaign-spying,"By Steve Benen Attorney General Bill Barr’s reputation and credibility were already in trouble when, four weeks ago, the Republican lawyer told a Senate committee “ spying did occur ” by the government on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Barr added, “I think spying on a political campaign – it’s a big deal, it’s a big deal.”
Despite the dubious and needlessly provocative nature of the attorney general’s comments – which he’s refused to retract – Republicans seized on Barr’s assessment, with the president’s re-election campaign even using his “spying” talk as the basis for political fundraising .
We learned today, however, that another high-ranking Trump appointee – FBI Director Chris Wray – doesn’t share Barr’s perspective .
During a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, Wray was asked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., about Barr’s statement last month that “spying did occur” on the Trump campaign.
“I was very concerned by his use of the word spying, which I think is a loaded word,” Shaheen said. “When FBI agents conduct investigations against alleged mobsters, suspected terrorists, other criminals, do you believe they’re engaging in spying when they’re following FBI investigative policies and procedures?”
“That’s not the term I would use,” Wray said of “spying.” “So, I would say that’s a no to that question.”
When the Democratic senator asked Christopher Wray specifically whether he’s seen “any evidence that any illegal surveillance” into Trump’s 2016 operation, the FBI director replied, “I don’t think I personally have any evidence of that sort.”
I think it’s safe to say the president’s re-election campaign won’t be using Wray’s testimony as the basis for any fundraising letters.
To be sure, the FBI chief was diplomatic in his phrasing. Wray was no doubt aware of the political debate and the coverage of Bill Barr’s earlier comments, and Wray made no effort to explicitly say the attorney general went too far.
But the FBI director also made it abundantly clear he wasn’t willing to endorse Barr’s assessment, either. Wray didn’t take a direct shot at the attorney general’s political antics, but he seemed to take an implicit one.
Last fall, NBC News reported that Trump has been known to privately complain about his FBI chief, believing that Wray is “ not protecting his interests .” After today, it seems likely those complaints will grow louder.

The myth of Donald Trump's success in business is shattered | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-08-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-myth-donald-trumps-success-business-shattered,"By Steve Benen Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 5/7/19, 9:07 PM ET Trump red line failing despite urgency to keep finances opaque Rachel Maddow shares details from a new blockbuster report from the New York Times about what Donald Trump’s taxes show about the bleak state of his business affairs from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, and notes that Trump’s best efforts to keep his share tweet email save Embed Last October, the New York Times first published a devastating report on Donald Trump’s finances. As regular readers may recall , the newspaper’s exhaustive research uncovered evidence of “dubious tax schemes” and “outright fraud” that Trump exploited to receive hundreds of millions of dollars from his father.
The findings painted a picture in which the president, far from the self-made man he pretends to be, relied heavily on legally dubious family handouts. It was brutal, not just because of the evidence of financial wrongdoing, but also because it exposed Trump as a fraud. The self-aggrandizing myth of the New Yorker as a private-sector genius was shattered.
Last night, the Times advanced the story in ways that made matters even worse for Trump, shining a light on previously unrevealed figures from the president’s finances between 1985 through 1994.
By the time his master-of-the-universe memoir “Trump: The Art of the Deal” hit bookstores in 1987, Donald J. Trump was already in deep financial distress, losing tens of millions of dollars on troubled business deals, according to previously unrevealed figures from his federal income tax returns.
Mr. Trump was propelled to the presidency, in part, by a self-spun narrative of business success and of setbacks triumphantly overcome. He has attributed his first run of reversals and bankruptcies to the recession that took hold in 1990. But 10 years of tax information obtained by The New York Times paints a different, and far bleaker, picture of his deal-making abilities and financial condition.
By all appearances, Donald J. Trump was an unusually bad business man. The Times report added, “The numbers show that in 1985, Mr. Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his core businesses – largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings. They continued to lose money every year, totaling $1.17 billion in losses for the decade.”
The article went on to note that during this period, Trump “appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer.”
Or put another way, Trump wasn’t just a loser in business, he was among the biggest losers in the country. Voters who backed the Republican because they saw him as a private-sector success story fell for a brazen scam.
While he was failing spectacularly, losing money at an extraordinary pace, this was a period in which Trump cultivated an image as a private-sector titan. Trump’s “brand” as a successful businessman – which he continues to exploit – was little more than a mirage. The persona was a cardboard cutout, which Trump hid behind, hoping no one would notice the scope and scale of his failures.
Why should you care about the president’s failures from that era? A few reasons, actually. First, Republican criticisms in 2016 about Trump being little more than a “con man” are now even easier to accept as true. MSNBC’s Chris Hayes asked on Twitter last night, “He’s got to be, quite literally, the most successful con artist of all time, right? Who comes close?”
Second, Trump continues to move heaven and earth to keep his financial history secret. We’re starting to get a better sense of why he’s engaged in such extraordinary efforts, and in the background, we’re left to wonder what more we might learn from the materials the president continues to hide.
Third, while we’re learning a lot, there are new questions about some of the details, including a “particularly hard to explain” anomaly: “the $52.9 million in interest income he reported in 1989.”
And finally, as congressional Democrats seek information on Trump’s financial history, it’s increasingly difficult for his allies to suggest there’s no point to the line of inquiry. The president climbed the ladder through a series of schemes, bluffs, and scams, failing repeatedly, despite having every advantage, while quietly pretending otherwise.
There’s no shortage of legitimate questions about where and how Trump got all of this money, and the degree to which his many financial setbacks left him vulnerable to manipulation.
