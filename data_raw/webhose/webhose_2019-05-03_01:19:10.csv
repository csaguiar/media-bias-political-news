Ty Cambria, 29 Newport Road, Cardiff CF24 0TP.
II.2.4) Description of the procurement:
NRW have had success in promoting and communicating the diversity of our services; e.g. the forestry and agricultural sectors, including but not limited to issues from water and flood defences to countryside management at 2 key events, The Royal Welsh Show and the Eisteddfod Festival.
We are committed to repeating both our attendance and success at both of these events for the foreseeable future, as well as looking for other event opportunities to promote our services in the most effective way possible; accordingly, we are looking for a supplier who can work with our communications team to deliver a “managed service” including but not limited to: project management, design, transportation, installation, hosting and presenting.
Events supported by NRW are all about interaction between those hosting the event, fellow exhibitors and visitors. Whilst not an exhaustive list NRW believe the key benefits of Event and Display Materials as:
— giving a human face to our organisation,
— providing information directly and personally to our customers,
— receiving direct feedback from customers and stakeholders,
— launching initiatives to a target audience; either as part of or alongside the main event. This could also include policy approaches,
— providing keynote speaking opportunities,
— providing other opportunities for more specialist contact through seminars, clinics or on-stand presentations,
— providing us with an opportunity to work with our partners,
— improving public/community relations and instil goodwill,
— enhancing or managing our reputation and profile,
— raising our brand image and public profile.
Whilst not limited to, NRW require the design, build and production with associated event management for:
— stand design and build,
— staging and materials for events (including consumables),
— display materials, such as:
—— banners,
—— nomadic design and creation of models and family activities.
NRW have previously and expect in future to have a presence at national and local events including the Eisteddfodau and the Royal Welsh Show. This lot also covers both external and internal ad hoc conferences and workshops.
NRW holds a Team NRW day – our staff conference which current thinking leads us to believe will be annual. This draws around 800 of our staff together for a day and we require a managed service for this, including the provision of food, exhibition materials and consumables.
In recognition of the significance of these events it is essential that supplier(s) work with NRW’s communications team to ensure that all projects and outputs are delivered according to our business objectives and plans and essentially be reflective of our values and identity.
Resultant designs and publications, etc., must be in both English and Welsh — but not separate designs.
NRW requires the supplier to assist in:
— bringing ideas to life by creating compelling stories,
— building upon and protecting our reputation,
— delivering and supporting bespoke guest experiences and unique activities,
— innovative hands on activities for event visitors,
— providing an onsite presence to support hospitality and on-site assistance.

Hollywood Actors Try To Blackmail Georgia Over Protecting The Unborn,thefederalist.com,Nicole Russell,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/hollywood-actors-try-blackmail-georgia-measure-protect-life-womb/,"By Nicole Russell April 3, 2019
Last week, Hollywood elites launched a full-fledged social media attack, threatening the state of Georgia with a boycott if the legislature passed HB 481, a “heartbeat bill,” that would essentially ban abortion after a baby’s heartbeat is detectable. Just as soon as actress Alyssa Milano spearheaded the effort, complete with a plea to Gov. Brian Kemp and some 50 signatures, the House passed the bill. Kemp is expected to sign it into law.
The Georgia Senate passed the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act on a party-line vote earlier this month. The bill will “protect the fundamental rights of all persons, and specifically to protect the fundamental rights of particular classes of persons who had not previously been recognized under law” by making it illegal to abort a baby once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is usually around the six-week mark. Alyssa Milano Tries to Bully Kemp
When this measure came up for a vote in the House, Milano unveiled a letter telling Kemp, a first-term Republican, her plans. These included a threat to remove entertainment industry-related work from Georgia, a hot spot for filming television and movies.
To back herself up, she listed dozens of big-name actors, names she has continued to ad to the list, pledging o boycott Georgia as well, should HB 481 pass. Many on the list are powerhouses in the industry, including folks like Mandy Moore, Don Cheadle, and Amy Schumer.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) March 29, 2019
Despite Milano’s boycott, the Georgia House passed the bill. Still, that hasn’t stopped her from securing additional signatures and tweeting the boycott repeatedly, tagging Kemp in attempt to lure him—extort him, even—into vetoing the bill. Not only did Hollywood stars continue to gleefully add their names to this letter, but g overnors from other states treated it like a sane business move and applauded this effort. Tomorrow, @FirstLadyNJ and I will meet with film industry reps in CA to make the case for choosing NJ over anti-choice states like GA.
States that claim to be a good value for business need to demonstrate the right values, including standing up for women’s rights. #HB481
— Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) April 1, 2019
Milano maintains the passage of the bill is “bad for business” or #HB841isbadforbusiness. Planned Parenthood quoted Milano: . @alyssa_milano : ""Women who work in Georgia’s film industry — many of them visiting from other states — need access to safe and legal reproductive care, including their constitutional right to an abortion. HB 481 takes that right away."" #HB481 https://t.co/uGiavUk7wG
— Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) March 26, 2019 Hollywood’s Boycott Was Full of Fallacies
Several states have passed heartbeat bills or are reviewing them. The governors in both Mississippi and Kentucky recently signed fetal heartbeat measures into law. Florida, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas are all reviewing heartbeat bills and expected to pass them. Of course, some states have passed them—Kentucky, Iowa, and North Dakota—and been blocked in the courts. This is normal and expected, but for many advocates, it does not lessen the point or the principle of the bill.
Heartbeat bills acknowledge the personhood of babies in the womb (heartbeat detection is one of the most common ways to confirm pregnancy) while also limiting abortions, since they’re banned once the baby’s heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks following conception. The also could kick a case up to the Supreme Court, where they will finally have to address the issue after many years of avoidance.
One of the biggest reasons Milano’s boycott efforts are completely out of bounds is that she doesn’t reside or pay taxes in Georgia—she lives on a hobby farm in California. Thus Milano and company are attempting to directly undermine the constituents who voted Georgia’s legislature into office, and who have a legal and natural right to have their political views represented and made into law. They’re essentially attempting economic sanctions on fellow Americans. Or, to use another word, blackmail.
This is a technique the left has been amplifying for some years now. Its watershed moment was in Indiana in 2015, when then-governor Mike Pence and the legislature capitulated to out-of-state mobs and big business in his state to erase potential religious freedom protections and replace them with LGBT legal preferences that his own constituents opposed. Similar tactics worked in North Carolina and many other states soon after. Milano’s Concerns are Unfounded
Milano is correct that Hollywood brings business to Georgia. The Motion Picture Association of America stats from 2016 show: “In Georgia, the film and television industry directly employs 25,700 people and pays more than $1.7 billion in wages. There are over 2,700 motion picture and television industry businesses in Georgia, including 1,822 production-related companies.” So Hollywood brings some work to Georgia. Why does it matter if Georgia essentially bans abortions?
Milano claims women working in the film industry there might want abortion access. Statistics vary, but women don’t exactly dominate the Hollywood industry. They make up about one-third (on camera and off) of it. How many of those are of childbearing age? How many of those are likely to get pregnant? How many of those will want an abortion? Right there while working in Georgia?
Let’s say a film production set hires a local wardrobe or dry cleaning company, made up of mostly women, to handle costumes on a set. They’re already living and working in Georgia, so many of them have probably already weighed in on this issue by voting and ringing up their their elected representatives. That’s their constitutional and natural right. Hollywood shouldn’t try to take it away.
The only strong argument that remains is that Milano and company don’t agree that babies are people with legal rights. That’s the most honest answer. Yet instead of just saying that, Milano is attempting to snooker the state of Georgia and its governor into believing that hypothetical economic gains ought to be more important than reducing mass murder.

"USDA ends controversial program that infected, killed cats",thehill.com,afolley@thehill.com (Aris Folley),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/437088-usda-ends-controversial-program-that-infected-and-killed-cats,"USDA ends controversial program that infected, killed cats By Aris Folley - 04/03/19 07:30 AM EDT
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on Tuesday that it will end a controversial research program in which scientists infected cats with a disease and later killed them.
The department’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) said in a statement that its toxoplasmosis research “has been redirected and the use of cats as part of any research protocol in any ARS laboratory has been discontinued and will not be reinstated.” ADVERTISEMENT
For decades, the research division had been infecting kittens and cats with toxoplasmosis – a disease that is typically caused by eating or undercooked contaminated meat – in an effort to study the food-borne illness.
After cats were infected by the disease, which is caused by a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, the animals were put down.
According to the USDA, the disease is “considered to be a leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the United States.”
The announcement arrives on the heels of bipartisan legislation that was introduced last month in Congress that sought to end the experiments.
James Varni Panetta A tax reform error is harming restaurants and costing jobs Bipartisan House bill would fix GOP tax law's 'retail glitch' Lawmakers propose bill to end fed agency's deadly experiments on kittens MORE (D-Calif.), who authored the House version of the Kittens in Traumatic Testing Ends Now Act (KITTEN) Act, told CNBC that he commends the USDA for its “decision to end this type of testing on kittens.”
“They listened to the people and responded appropriately to our concerns,” he said. “This is how our institutions, our government, and our democracy should and must work.”
The USDA added in the statement that it is in the process of putting its 14 remaining uninfected cats up for adoption by its employees in accordance with regulatory guidelines."

BOSTON - Television stars Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are to appear in federal court Wednesday with 13 other parents charged in an alleged multimillion-dollar bribery scheme to get their underqualified children admitted to selective schools, a scandal that rocked the higher-education world.
The Justice Department last month charged the pair and 48 others in connection with the scandal. Those charged included 33 parents who prosecutors say sought to use their wealth to circumvent the admissions process so their children could win admission to elite schools. Prosecutors say most of the parents targeted the University of Southern California, but others set their sights on Georgetown, Stanford, Yale and the University of Texas. The FBI called its investigation ""Operation Varsity Blues."" U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston called the case the largest college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department.
In addition to the television stars, those who are to appear Wednesday include Loughlin's husband, the fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli; Homayoun Zadeh, an associate professor of dentistry at USC, where he allegedly sought to gain admission for his daughter; Gordon Caplan, a lawyer and the chairman of a global law firm; and Manuel Henriquez, who recently stepped down as head of a Bay Area hedge fund. Thirteen of the defendants are to make their first court appearances in Boston on Wednesday. Two others, Amy Colburn and Gregory Colburn, have been indicted and are to be arraigned.
William ""Rick"" Singer, the corrupt college consultant whom prosecutors have cast as the mastermind of the scheme, pleaded guilty last month to racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering and obstruction of justice. The FBI made contact with him last year, and for months he cooperated with the investigation, recording conversations and gathering evidence against his wealthy clientele.
Prosecutors say parents paid Singer to doctor test scores and bribe athletic coaches. In exchange for a ""donation"" to a charity he controlled, Singer bribed test proctors and hired Mark Riddell, who was director of test preparation at a well-known Florida sports academy, to take tests for prospective students. But the activity allegedly went further: Prosecutors say that Singer persuaded a USC assistant athletic director, a Yale soccer coach and a Georgetown tennis coach to fabricate athletic profiles for clients' children so they could be admitted as recruits - even if they did not play the sports for which they were recruited. Prosecutors say all three coaches fabricated the profiles in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes.
According to the criminal complaint, Giannulli, Loughlin's husband, emailed Singer telling him he was concerned about his daughter's college prospects and wanted to ensure ""we have a road map for success as it relates to [our daughter] and getting her into a school other than ASU!"" At Singer's instruction, the couple had their daughter pose on a rowing machine for a photo used to create her fraudulent athletic profile. Singer then paid an athletic department official to create the profile. They repeated the process for their younger daughter, and both young women were admitted to USC.
Huffman, best known for her role on the television series ""Desperate Housewives,"" allegedly schemed with Singer to hire Riddell to take the exam for her daughter, paying $15,000 to a charity controlled by Singer.
The scandal sent shock waves through the world of higher education. It has long been criticized as favoring wealthy students by tipping the scale in favor of the children of alumni and high-figure donors and for athletes who participate in sports more prevalent in affluent communities.
The schools in the scandal have pledged to review their admissions processes to ensure that recruited athletes are carefully vetted. Yale and USC have rescinded offers of admission to students implicated in the scandal."
Tucker Carlson Slams MSNBC’s Chris Hayes: “What Every Man Would Be If Feminists Had Absolute Power” – Real Conservatives Unite,realconservativesunite.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://realconservativesunite.com/2019/04/03/tucker-carlson-slams-msnbc-s-chris-hayes-what-every-man-would-be-if-feminists-had-absolute-power/,"13.7k SHARES
Fox News’ Tucker Carlson ripped into fellow MSNBC timeslot competitor and Rachel Maddow lookalike Chris Hayes on Monday night, calling him “what every man would be if feminists ever achieved absolute power in this country” in his opening monologue.
“Chris Hayes is what every man would be if feminists ever achieved absolute power in this country: apologetic, bespectacled and deeply, deeply concerned about global warming and the patriarchal systems that cause it,” Carlson said to open his show. Breaking News Be the first to know when big news breaks
Carlson then went on to talk about a climate change town hall meeting that MSNBC host Hayes held with – who else – Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, saying it looked like an episode of “Ellen”. The purpose of the town hall was for AOC to push her Green New Deal, which was recently laughed out of the Senate, failing on a 57-to-0 vote with not a single democrat voting for it.
“This apparently seemed like a wise idea to executives over at MSNBC,” Carlson said. “The very same news outlet that spent two years lying to you about Russia brings you a 29-year-old former bartender to teach you about science.”
And that’s not the only way Carlson bested his timeslot nemesis Hayes. According to The Hill , Hayes attracted 1.57 million viewers for MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes” on Friday night, while “Tucker Carlson Tonight” won the time slot with 2.6 million viewers. In the 25–54 demographic that advertisers seek out the most, Carlson saw 420,000 viewers, while Hayes took in 232,000.
“It’s official,” Carlson ends his monologue saying, “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a moron. And nasty. And more self-righteous than any televangelist that ever preached a sermon on cable access.”
We now look forward to MSNBC’s response in what is certain to escalate into far better comedy than the usual tripe offered by the designated late night comedians. Tucker Carlson Challenges Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez To A Date https://t.co/gXa4Kn7IzY pic.twitter.com/tJC0cJWv1B

[Samuel Bray] What Bucklew Doesn’t Say,reason.com,Samuel Bray,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/volokh/2019/04/03/what-bucklew-doesnt-say,"Earlier this week, the Supreme Court decided Bucklew v. Precythe , a case about the meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause in the Eighth Amendment. I am passing along some thoughts on the case from John Stinneford, a professor of law at the University of Florida and a leading scholar on the original understanding of the Eighth Amendment. His article The Original Meaning of 'Unusual': The Eighth Amendment as a Bar to Cruel Innovation (published a decade ago in the Northwestern Law Review) was cited in Justice Gorsuch's majority opinion. Here are John's thoughts:
Two days ago the Supreme Court decided Bucklew v. Precythe , a case involving a constitutional challenge to Missouri's lethal injection protocol.The main question in Bucklew was whether a defendant who raises an ""as applied"" challenge to a method of execution must identify a feasible alternative method of execution that significantly reduces the chance of unnecessary pain. (I call this the ""pick your poison"" requirement.)
The idea behind the ""pick your poison"" requirement is that a defendant should not be able to escape execution altogether by showing that the execution method chosen by the government is cruel and unusual. The requirement has no basis in the text of the Constitution, however, nor in any precedent prior to 2008. Rather, it arose as a response to efforts by death penalty abolitionists to force states to stop imposing the death penalty by making painless executions impossible. Abolitionists pressured drug manufacturers to stop selling barbiturates to states for use in executions. This left states with the choice between reverting to obviously violent methods of execution, such as hanging or the firing squad; or coming up with experimental lethal injection protocols that could be challenged as unduly risky; or ceasing to impose the death penalty. Abolitionists hoped that states would take the third option because the first two were too politically costly or constitutionally problematic, resulting in de facto abolition of the death penalty. The Supreme Court blocked this effort by requiring condemned prisoners who wish to challenge a method of execution to propose a feasible method of execution they considered acceptable. By forcing condemned offenders rather than state officials to solve the dilemma arising from the unavailability of barbiturates, the Court checked the movement toward de facto abolition – but only by adopting a constitutional standard that was ungrounded in text and history and undeniably results-oriented.
Bucklew argued that the ""pick your poison"" requirement should not apply to him because he was not raising a facial challenge to Missouri's lethal injection protocol. (Missouri uses a one-drug protocol of pentobarbital that appears to involve a much lower risk of suffering than the three-drug protocol used in many states. Since the three-drug protocol had previously been upheld in Baze v. Rees and Glossip v. Gross , a facial challenge to the less-risky one-drug protocol would have had virtually no chance of success.) Bucklew argued that the protocol was unconstitutional as applied to him because he suffers from a very rare medical condition that heightens the risk of suffering as compared to the risk faced by most condemned offenders. Because Bucklew's condition was so rare, he argued, the Court could create an exception to the ""pick your poison"" requirement for him without risking de facto abolition of the death penalty.
The Court rejected Bucklew's argument for a variety of reasons that I will not go into here. Instead, I will focus on the Court's effort to defend the ""pick your poison"" requirement from the charge that it is results-oriented and lacks a basis in constitutional text and history. This effort was ultimately unsuccessful, but it points to important changes in the Court's approach to the original meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.
The Bucklew Court sought to ground the ""pick your poison"" requirement in the ""original and historical understanding of the Eighth Amendment."" The majority opinion is explicitly originalist in its approach to the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a rare (if not unprecedented) phenomenon in the modern history of the Court. But in contrast to some prior originalist concurrences or dissents by Justices Scalia and Thomas, the Bucklew Court does not rush to make any comprehensive claims about the original meaning of the Clause. Rather, it skirts around the edges of the Clause's original meaning, deciding only enough about that meaning to demonstrate (to its own satisfaction, anyway) that Missouri's lethal injection protocol is constitutional. In this regard, Bucklew is an admirably modest opinion.
To understand Bucklew 's modesty, one needs to know a bit about our prior knowledge of the original meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. Justice Scalia famously claimed that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was originally understood to prohibit those punishments (and only those punishments) that violated the moral standards of 1790. The Clause contained no principle of development, he claimed, and prohibited only barbarous methods of punishment, not punishments that were disproportionate to the offense. Justices Scalia and Thomas also argued that the word ""cruel"" covers only those punishments that are inflicted for the very purpose of causing needless pain. Virtually all members of the Court, originalist and non-originalist alike, ignored the word ""unusual.""
Recent scholarship (including my own) has shown that the original meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause is very different, in some ways, from the claims of Justices Scalia and Thomas. Perhaps most importantly, it has uncovered the original meaning of the word ""unusual.""
In the context of the Eighth Amendment, ""unusual"" means ""contrary to long usage,"" not ""rare"" or ""uncommon."" It derives conceptually from the common law. Although today people often describe the common law as judge-made law, it was traditionally considered a form of customary law – the law of ""long use and custom."" Its authority did not derive from any claimed judicial lawmaking power. Rather, it derived from the idea that customary practices that are used over a very long period of time are presumptively just, reasonable, and enjoy the consent of the people – for if they lacked these qualities, they would fall out of usage. Because longstanding customs are presumptively reasonable, they can appropriately be enforced as law. The job of the common law judge is to identify longstanding customs and apply them in new cases.
Over time, the normative power of ""long usage"" gave rise to the idea of rights enforceable against the state. The idea was that even the sovereign lacked authority to violate fundamental rights established through long usage. This was the key idea underlying the American Revolution as well as the Bill of Rights. In this light, it becomes clear why the Eighth Amendment prohibits ""cruel and unusual"" – and not just ""cruel"" – punishments. Under the common law ideology that underlies the Eighth Amendment, the most reliable way to tell whether a punishment is unjustly harsh is to compare it to punishments that enjoy long usage. If it is significantly harsher than the tradition will permit, it is cruel and unusual.
One corollary to the notion of ""long usage"" is that if a once-traditional punishment ceases to be used for a long period of time, it is no longer part of the tradition. As Edward Coke wrote in the 17 th century, ""Custom loses its being if usage fails."" Thus, contrary to Justice Scalia's claim, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause does not tie us to the specific moral standards of 1790. If a punishment falls out of usage for multiple generations, it loses its presumption of reasonableness. If Congress sought to reinstitute the death penalty for a crime like counterfeiting, or to reimpose methods of punishment like branding or bodily mutilation, such punishments could be challenged as cruel and unusual despite the fact that they were acceptable in 1790 – for they have been disused for so long that they are no longer part of the tradition.
The Bucklew Court gestures toward the original meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause without ever fully articulating it. The Court's reticence is particularly apparent when it comes to the word ""unusual."" The Court never says that ""unusual"" means ""contrary to long usage,"" nor does it hold that the primary purpose of the Clause is to prevent cruel innovation. Instead, it focuses on the corollary to the original meaning of unusual discussed above. The Court repeatedly describes an ""unusual"" punishment as one that has fallen out of usage for a long time. See, e.g., slip op. at *9 (""these methods had long fallen out of use and so had become ""unusual""); slip op. at *12, (describing ""long disused (unusual) forms of punishment"").
At first glance, this approach to the original meaning of ""unusual"" seems strange. It would have been simpler for the Court to focus on the primary meaning of the word. The Court could have resolved the case quite easily by saying that a cruel and unusual punishment is a new punishment that is significantly harsher than the punishments it replaces, and that although lethal injection by pentobarbital is new, it does not pose a significantly greater risk of excruciating pain than traditional methods like hanging. Therefore, it is not cruel and unusual.
As the paragraph above indicates, had the Bucklew Court focused on the primary meaning of ""unusual,"" it would have been able to draw on a relatively objective and determinate standard for measuring the cruelty of Missouri's lethal injection protocol: longstanding prior practice. Such a standard is notably missing from the Bucklew opinion. The Court notes that determining cruelty is a comparative process: for example, hanging was comparatively less cruel than long-disused punishments that ""superadded"" terror, pain, or humiliation to the process. Thus it was constitutionally acceptable even though it involved a significant risk of pain. Similarly, the Court held, the constitutionality of Missouri's lethal injection protocol must be determined by comparing it to some other punishment method. But rather than comparing the protocol to traditional methods of execution, the Bucklew Court relies on the ""pick your poison"" requirement, holding that the condemned offender himself should identify an acceptable (and feasible) method of execution to use as a point of comparison.
This requirement is obviously untethered from any constitutional standard as to what constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment. What if the only ""feasible"" alternatives are themselves unjustly harsh in comparison to traditional methods of punishment? In such a situation, the ""pick your poison"" requirement would force offenders to choose between two unconstitutional alternatives as the price of challenging the constitutionality of a method of execution. This result is precisely the opposite of what the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause requires. Let's hope that in a future case, the Court goes further and recognizes the full original meaning of ""unusual."" The point of comparison should be traditional punishments that have not fallen out of the tradition, not other ""feasible"" punishments whose constitutionality has not been established. The Constitution is strongest when judicial rulings are based on standards derived from the text and not their own invented requirements.
On the other hand, the Bucklew Court's recognition that punishments can become unusual if they suffer long disuse is a hopeful sign for the future. One of the primary objections to an originalist approach to the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause is that it would force courts to uphold punishments like branding and bodily mutilation because they were used in 1790. This objection is so powerful that it led Justice Scalia himself, early in his career on the Supreme Court, to call himself a ""fainthearted originalist"" and to express doubt as to whether – should push come to shove – he could actually enforce what he considered the original meaning of the Clause. Once the Court recognizes that the Clause does contain a principle of legal development – albeit one that operates very differently from the ""evolving standards of decency test"" – this objection evaporates. Execution for minor crimes, and the use of punishments like mutilation and branding, are no longer part of our tradition, and thus would not have to be automatically approved should the government try to revive them. Originalists need no longer be faint-hearted.
One last point about what Bucklew doesn't say: The Court flirts with the idea, long propounded by Justices Thomas and Scalia, that a punishment can only be cruel if it is inflicted for the very purpose of causing needless pain - but fortunately refrains from making this part of its holding. As a matter of original understanding, ""cruel"" means ""unjustly harsh,"" not ""motivated by cruel intent."" Were the Court to impose a cruel intent requirement, it would be plunged back into the morass of subjectivity from which the original meaning of the Clause holds the promise of delivering it - and the constitutional protections provided by the Eighth Amendment would be substantially weakened."
Any Enemy Could Do To You What They've Done To Trump,thefederalist.com,Dale Cox,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/03/enemy-theyve-done-trump/,"April 3, 2019 By Dale W. Cox
Who among us hasn’t broken the law in some respect? Very few of us, I imagine. Most likely, those who have committed no infraction haven’t done much with their lives yet.
Government regulations affect every aspect of our lives, even though the pace of adding new regulations has decreased somewhat recently. In 2016, there were approximately 46,074 pages detailing federal law and 176,420 pages of regulations associated with those laws. This total doesn’t include any local laws and regulations generated from within your state, county, or city. We are expected to obey them all automatically.
Do you know them all? Of course not—it’s impossible. From fixing bothersome boggy spots in your lawn to how and what you use to kill pesky insects to wearing seat belts and obeying speed limits to how you can defend yourself, the list of regulations is almost endless. Do you know how many were added in the last 24 hours that you are supposed to know about and obey? Probably not. Neither do I.
The problem gets much worse if you dare risk your resources and open a business, and it becomes exponentially worse if you manage to be successful at that business. For instance, my wife and I run several businesses. Despite having attorneys and membership in multiple industry associations, we are still surprised on occasion to find out about new laws and associated regulations. It’s already in force and is directly affecting our business—and we didn’t even know about it! It is very difficult to stay on top of all the new rules that come out while you’re trying to run your business.
With all this in mind, it’s likely that during this past week, you unknowingly broke some law or regulation. If you’re a business owner, it’s almost a given. There are just too many rules and regulations to follow: hiring procedures, record-keeping, environmental laws. It is impossible to know and obey everything asked of us as citizens, whether we are employees or employers. So while some people break laws intentionally, most of us break them unknowingly.
Now imagine that a competitor (or someone who just doesn’t like you) hired a group of people to dig into your personal and business past—every detail, leaving no stone unturned—with the intent to discredit and prosecute you. Even if you had done your best to do everything in your life legally, they very likely will find something. If they are then successful at finding a friendly media outlet to voice their findings, you’re in trouble. You may not even have enough money to legally defend yourself.
How is this different from what is happening to many today? It’s not. A prominent example is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. When it was becoming clear that Democrats might not find what they were hoping for, they started preparing to dig into President Trump’s entire 73-year past. Their goal was to find a broken law in any aspect of his business or personal life to discredit him.
Trump has been in business all over the world, including being involved in some very large projects. He has a fleet of attorneys to help him obey the laws and regulations. But just as for each of us, if a competitor looks hard enough, they will find something.
This type of attack is dangerous, and not just to individual citizens and their reputations and livelihoods. It is dangerous to our republic. Given the state of our laws and regulations, and since all of us have a skeleton or two in our closet (whether we know it or not), who in their right minds would subject themselves to public service, understanding that all those unknown skeletons will be dragged into the street and used to beat us? It isn’t a pleasant prospect, so good people we need may choose not to serve.
In the past, the concept of mens rea was a bedrock principle of our criminal justice system. That term means that in most cases, you are guilty only if you knowingly committed a crime. Unfortunately, that seems to be less and less applicable. Regardless of the truthfulness of an accusation, lives and businesses are ruined almost instantly.
As a country, we would be wise to step back, look at what is going on, and consider where it might lead us. We should spend our time trying to determine which laws and regulations we really need so it doesn’t take a fleet of attorneys to keep us out of trouble. Dale Cox is an entrepreneur and author."
EU Parliament committee approves post-Brexit visa waiver law amid row over Gibraltar status – POLITICO,www.politico.eu,Galaxy Henry,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-parliament-committee-approves-post-brexit-visa-waiver-law-amid-row-over-gibraltar-status/,"Updated 4/3/19, 2:24 PM CET
After weeks of stalled negotiations, a reshuffled European Parliament committee passed a draft text Wednesday which would grant Britons visa-free travel to the European Union after Brexit.
A draft law , which legally describes Gibraltar as a British ""colony,"" was approved after Claude Moraes, a British MEP and chair of the European Parliament's committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), was removed from his role as the file's rapporteur, Reuters reports .
In the uncertain run-up to Brexit, EU countries had urged the European Parliament to ratify a draft law that would allow Britons visa-free travel to the EU for a maximum of 90 days, as long as the same conditions applied to EU citizens visiting the United Kingdom. But there was no consensus on the wording of the text, which, at Spain's request, labels Gibraltar a British ""colony.""
The impasse was broken after Moraes was replaced as rapporteur this week — a rare step in the Parliament — by Bulgarian MEP Sergei Stanishev — a move described by the British MEP as an act of ""bullying.""
""I was not prepared to see Spain hold this file hostage in the European Council with an addition that described Gibraltar legally as a colony,"" he said. ""This was a misuse of our legislative duties,"" Moraes said. British MEP Claude Moraes was replaced as the file's rapporteur | Stephanie Lecocq via EPA
Britain called Gibraltar a ""crown colony"" until 1981, when it changed the title to a ""dependent territory."" In 2002, it settled on calling it a ""British overseas territory."" Moraes said he had suggested alternative wording, which he deemed ""would be acceptable to both Spain and the UK.""
The committee approved the text, calling Gibraltar a ""colony,"" early Wednesday by 38 votes to 8, with three abstentions. To become law, the measure still requires approval from a European Parliament plenary session on Thursday. "

Valeria Luiselli began volunteering as a translator for children in immigration court around five years ago. Drawing on that work, and the activism that followed, she wrote two books: Tell Me How It Ends , an extended essay based on the questionnaire used to interview the children, and her latest, Lost Children Archive (Knopf, $28) , a novel about a family traveling by car from New York City to Arizona so that the father, an audio documentarian, can work on a project about the Chiricahua Apache. During the trip, the mother becomes obsessed with news on the radio of migrant children being deported from the US. The novel unfolds in a plurality of voices, sounds, and stories, including Elegies for Lost Children , a novel-within-the-novel made up of a pastiche of other migration and travel stories.

DAILY REVIEW: Lust Never Sleeps,bookforum.com,,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://bookforum.com/inprint/026_01/20826,"
We’ve had half a century with The Second Sex, The Dialectic of Sex, Sexual Politics , and all the rest, yet straight men of letters still regard their fossilized sexism and quotidian horniness as windows into existential wisdom. Hard again! the male author marvels while streaming free porn in his book-lined office. What does it all mean? These are the inquiries of those who refuse to read feminists: How would a nerdy man have power over a pretty woman if she’s the one making him want her? How could a man be accused of disrespecting women when he’s so awestruck by their young, sexy bodies? David D. Gilmore’s attempt at self-exculpation in 2001’s Misogyny sticks in my memory as an example of this convenient cluelessness: “Like most baby-boom males, I consider myself a tolerant and enlightened man, and I harbor a sincere fondness for women as friends, lovers, colleagues, workmates, and, of course, paragons of physical beauty.” A sincere fondness for physical beauty—how could one tolerate a workmate without it?
This benevolent stance is shared by David Shields, a man who appreciates women so much that he’s eroticized their sexual rejection, disdain, and disinterest even more than their receptivity. In Shields’s latest, The Trouble with Men: Reflections on Sex, Love, Marriage, Porn, and Power , he slavers over “the sexy, young television actress” who makes him hate himself because he’s not beautiful, and he mentally admonishes a besotted girl walking with her boyfriend: “Don’t oversell the devotion.” Why ruin a good thing by enjoying it? Mutual affirmation has no place in his erotic universe unless it means two people agreeing on which one of them is inferior.

In Shields’s marriage, coldness reigns—or so he tells us. (In the past he has made much of his own unreliability as a narrator.) His wife doesn’t even like his books, and that’s how he wants it, though it’s also a source of constant anxiety. He praises her “icy temperament” and mostly addresses her in the form of wheedling questions, as if he’s playing Jeopardy! in hell: “Why do you always check to see how much I leave for a tip?”“Why don’t you have a single photo of me anywhere in the house?”“Why do all your favorite books about marriage include a dead spouse?” He claims he wrote The Trouble with Men in part to understand their union by exploring “the perils, limits, and possibilities of human intimacy,” but he also claims this book could “risk” the marriage, and that might be what he’s ultimately after.
I can’t say what the book has done or will do to his marriage—in the end the only qualities I associate with his wife are patience and good taste in reading material—but I know that “human intimacy” is not actually Shields’s focus. What he’s beguiled by is what he sees as his own fascinating sexual complexity: “I’d always envisioned this book as an exploration of something about myself that I don’t understand, and my confusion is interesting to me,” he writes. That confusion has something to do with his erotic triggers: what turns him on and when and why, and how that affects his love life—fine material for introspection. But Shields is so enraptured by his ignorance that he’s fetishized it. He’s covetous of it. He craves exhibitionism, not connection: He wants to publicly luxuriate in the nooks and crannies of his lust while passing it off as an intellectual inquiry. He writes that he’s “obsessed” with sex, and “a lot of what I want to do is think about it.” But “think about it” here only means “dwell upon it,” not interrogate or complicate or learn. Ideas don’t develop or expand. We only look on as he presents variations on the same scenario, reaffirming that it turns him on.
Consequently, this work comes across as the tedious provocations of a man desperate for any negative attention he can get. “Women, asked to describe the best sexual experience of their lives, almost always mention an exceedingly brief thing they had decades ago with a near-convict,” he declares. Upon viewing scads of hacked celebrity nudes from 2014’s The Fappening, he is filled with “relief”: “these women are as sad and afraid and shy—above all, shy—about sex as we are,” he writes, hiding behind highly dubious collectivity. “The shape of a high-end sports car’s rear end is meant to replicate a bubble-butted woman’s,” he asserts, and “pink is associated with girls because it’s the color of their pussies; blue is associated with boys because it’s the color of the veins in their cocks.” Life is too short to indulge such rapturous dilettantism. Even immortals would roll their eyes.
I’m not always so aggrieved by a man lazily stroking his own libido. Accounts of someone’s arousal can be (and often are) comic, enlivening, and, at their best, contagious. Even chauvinism can be made delightful if delivered with enough panache; The Prisoner of Sex proved as much. But Shields’s presumption that his desire necessarily contains timeless insight—usually about women qua women and, less frequently, men qua men—makes him complacent, incurious: He quotes profligately, but what he shares simply reiterates his own tastes rather than building an argument or deepening comprehension. He excerpts a William T. Vollmann novel because he finds the “awful and sad” scene “thrilling.” A message tee he once saw worn by a waitress (BEAT ME, FUCK ME, EAT ME, WHIP ME, CUM ON MY TITS, AND THEN GET THE FUCK OUT) is presented without comment, as if it were profound and revealing enough to stand alone.
Compared to the other challenges of the twenty-first century, this preening, dogged ignorance is a minor problem, but it still corrodes the spirit to see willfully uneducated fumbling passed off as philosophy. At least Mailer had the courtesy to read Millett before he soldiered on with his regressive nonsense. Shields quotes some women, including Toni Bentley, best known for her paean to assfucking, and the witty, enthusiastically pro-sex Susie Bright, but the scarier feminists are rarely mentioned at all, and sometimes only through others’ lenses. (He quotes Bright’s critique of Dworkin, but not Dworkin herself.) Would it have killed him to read something written by a woman who doesn’t tell him what he so breathlessly yearns to hear? I suspect he knows that while he could emerge from such an experience with his life intact, his boner may never be the same.
In Screwed: How Women Are Set Up to Fail at Sex , Quebecois television host and journalist Lili Boisvert explains this phenomenon in gentler terms: “Many people are afraid of a paradigm shift when it comes to sex. They fear their fantasies will cease to excite them. . . . Fundamental values around which their lives are organized would become obsolete.” Boisvert has been on the sex beat for years, and she approaches her subject not as an academic, literary aspirant, or chronic masturbator, but as a committed educator. Read as a chaser for The Trouble with Men , Screwed
Boisvert’s basic premise is what she’s named the “cumshot principle”: Men transmit desire, women receive that desire, and much of each gender’s behavior before, during, and after sex is designed to obey and preserve this one-way arrangement. She has no objection to cumshots per se; they’re just a useful metaphor. “The woman acts as a target, and a target is passive,” she writes. The book is devoted to diagramming every gendered demand, expectation, and dynamic that grows from this foundation, so much so that there’s a literal diagram at the end, right before a glossary that includes deﬁnitions for male gaze and objectiﬁcation . (I don’t know if teenagers are among this book’
As translated by Arielle Aaronson, Boisvert speaks with the patient clarity of a middle school teacher or experienced babysitter: someone who can’t risk relying on implication, because her charges will exploit any potential misunderstanding. Her delivery is nonjudgmental and unemotional, an exceedingly rare combination given the subject. This is probably why, though her observations are familiar, their repetition is welcome. Consider her take on men hitting on women they don’t know: “Frequently, men immediately perceive a woman they consider sexy and attractive to be in seduction mode (which is, of course, a passive mode for her). The man’s logic might look something like: ‘I ﬁnd you attractive, therefore you willingly provoked this reaction; you seduced me, which is a green light.’” In other circumstances, this painstaking explanation might exasperate me, but I came to see it as brilliant. It is quite hard to be rational about sex. We’re provided with so few tools to do so and assured that there’s nothing to examine anyway; intractable “biology” is always the culprit. “The truth is, we don’t actually want to understand our sexual mores,” Boisvert writes in the introduction. We prefer familiar answers “because they validate our current choices and behaviors.
Boisvert’s most radical moment comes when she acknowledges certain pleasures granted to women that are usually denied to straight men, such as reveling in being lusted after and having “eyes glued to their bodies.” Many feminists would hold the party line that such thrills are unremitting burdens, or inherently degrading, but not Boisvert. “We can concede the injustice,” she writes. “Men do not have access to this power.” And with this concession, she touches on a vital element of the magnanimous chauvinist’s psyche. Men have for centuries told themselves that their obsession with women’s bodies is the real gendered injustice, that women are allowed to be parasitical because we’re sexually indispensable, and if men were (objectively, biologically) beautiful, or if women liked sex as much as men do, they would be the pampered gender. Mailer’s diagnosis still fits (who would know better than he?): “In the profound pussy envy of men there is the simple even sentimental suspicion that it is easy to be a woman—one need merely lie back and all Heaven will come into the cunt.” Many tenacious and deeply felt fantasies ride on this conviction, not only those pertaining to sex but those that prop up gender essentialism, misogyny, male supremacy—entire worldviews. True liberation is to be an idol: a “worshipped”
Sexual compulsion is as determined and illogical as an addiction, which means it might take someone like Boisvert—calm, focused, and ﬁrm—to counteract someone like Shields. When he claims that “all desire objectiﬁes. There’s no such thing as desire without it,” Boisvert is ready with a factcheck: “Desiring someone does not equal reducing that person to a thing. The difference between the two lies in understanding that the object of our desire might not desire us in return.” It’s jarringly disingenuous for Shields to claim that a subject can’t desire someone they recognize as a fellow subject. Another person’s subjectivity—their unpredictable capacity to refuse us, lead us on, or respond in kind—
But here’s the ruse: Shields’s appetite for rejection is just another way of keeping women confined to the sexual sphere. Throughout The Trouble with Men , women are consistently tagged by visual appeal. A peer of his is “gorgeous”; an ex-student is “stunning.” And his “writer-friend” is “much better looking” than he is, which disqualiﬁes her from collaborating on the book with him. These female ﬁgures are neither fully human nor fully object. They’re subjects, sort of, but their personhood becomes irrelevant beyond the bounds of the narrator’s libido. Shields desires, and women, those powerful paragons of beauty, are desired. It’

Bad News For Boeing: Preliminary Report Shows Anti-Stall Software Sealed Flight ET302's Fate | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/bad-news-boeing-preliminary-report-shows-anti-stall-software-sealed-flight-et302s,"0 SHARES
Thought it hasn't been publicly released yet, a preliminary report on the circumstances that caused flight ET302 to plunge out of the sky just minutes after takeoff was completed earlier this week, and some of the details have leaked to Reuters and the Wall Street Journal. And for Boeing shareholders, the findings aren't pretty.
Appearing to contradict Boeing's insistence that procedures for deactivating its MCAS anti-stall software were widely disseminated, and that pilots at airlines around the world had been trained on these procedures, WSJ reported that the pilots of ET302 successfully switched off MCAS as they struggled to right the plane after the software had automatically tipped its nose down. As they struggled to right the plane, the pilots ended up reactivating the software, while trying a few other steps from their training, before the plane began its final plunge toward a field outside Addis Ababa, where the ensuing crash killed all 157 people on board.
Though the pilots deviated from Boeing's emergency checklist as they tried to right the plane, investigators surmised that they gave up on the procedures after they failed to right the plane. But when MCAS reengaged, whether intentionally, or on accident, it pushed the nose of the plane lower once again.
The pilots on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 initially reacted to the emergency by shutting off power to electric motors driven by the automated system, these people said, but then appear to have re-engaged the system to cope with a persistent steep nose-down angle. It wasn’t immediately clear why the pilots turned the automated system back on instead of continuing to follow Boeing’s standard emergency checklist, but government and industry officials said the likely reason would have been because manual controls to raise the nose didn’t achieve the desired results.
After first cranking a manual wheel in the cockpit that controls the same movable surfaces on the plane’s tail that MCAS had affected, the pilots turned electric power back on, one of these people said. They began to use electric switches to try to raise the plane’s nose, according to these people. But the electric power also reactivated MCAS, allowing it to continue its strong downward commands, the people said.
Reuters , which was also the recipient of leaks from investigators, offered a slightly different version of events. It reported that MCAS was reengaged four times as pilots scrambled to right the plane, and that investigators were looking into the possibility that the software might have reengaged without prompting from the pilots.
After the Lion Air crash that killed 189 people back in October, Boeing and the FAA published a bulletin reminding pilots to follow the emergency procedures to deactivate the software if a faulty sensor - like the one that is believed to have contributed to the Lion Air crash - feeds erroneous data to the system.
The data show the pilots maneuvered the plane back upward twice before deactivating the software. But between the two reports, one detail is made abundantly clear. The software's reengagement is what doomed everybody aboard. That is an unequivocally bad look for Boeing, which has been deflecting questions about the software's bugs, and gaps in the dissemination of its training materials, while working on an update that the company says will make the software less reliant on automated systems.

Russell Wilson Gives Seattle Seahawks April 15 Deadline For New Contract | The Daily Caller,dailycaller.com,David Hookstead,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://dailycaller.com/2019/04/03/russell-wilson-seattle-seahawks-april-15-deadline/,"Russell Wilson Gives Seattle Seahawks April 15 Deadline For New Contract 8:22 AM 04/03/2019 | Sports Send WhatsApp
Russell Wilson has apparently given the Seattle Seahawks a deadline for a new contract, and the team doesn’t have a lot of time to get it done.
The Seattle Times reported the following Tuesday:
Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has given the team an April 15 deadline to complete negotiations on a new contract, a source with knowledge of the discussions told The Seattle Times.
April 15 is the day the Seahawks will begin their official offseason workout program, and Wilson is thought to want the deal done by then. It’s also thought the two sides have had some negotiations in recent days with Wilson hoping to get the contract done quickly.
It is going to be fascinating to see what the Seahawks do here. Using the franchise tag really isn’t an option. It could work for a year, but would be more than $50 million by 2022, according to ProFootballTalk .
The Seahawks need a longterm solution and they need it immediately.

The reality is that Wilson has been one of the best players in the league at his position over the past few decades. He plays behind an atrocious offensive line and still makes plays. (RELATED: Seattle Seahawks Sign Head Coach Pete Carroll To A Massive Extension. Here’s How Much Money He’ll Make)
I’m not sure the Seahawks would have won a game in 2018 if he wasn’t on the roster. He makes that kind of impact. Again, Seattle needs to pay him and they need to do it fast. If the team can’t get him a deal, then fans should riot in the streets.
The only real question at this point is how much money Wilson is going to get paid in order to stay in a Seahawks jersey for years to come.
He will almost certainly become the highest paid player in the league. Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers got nearly $100 million guaranteed on his last deal .
You can expect Seattle to go north of that. Anything under $100 million guaranteed would be shocking, and incredibly stupid for the organization if it resulted in the the Super Bowl-winning quarterback leaving.

Pilots followed Boeing safety procedures before deadly 737 MAX crash: report | TheHill,thehill.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/437093-pilots-followed-boeing-safety-procedures-before-deadly-737-max-crash,"Pilots followed Boeing safety procedures before deadly 737 Max crash: report By Michael Burke - 04/03/19 08:16 AM EDT
Pilots on an Ethiopian Airlines flight last month reportedly followed emergency procedures outlined by Boeing before a deadly crash that killed all 157 people on board.
The Wall Street Journal , citing people briefed on the preliminary findings of an investigation, reported Wednesday that the pilots turned off an automated flight control system on the Boeing 737 Max jet that was pushing the plane's nose downward, but were still unable to prevent the aircraft from crashing. ADVERTISEMENT
The Journal noted that the revelation calls into question claims made by Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that pilots could have avoided the crash by following safety procedures.
According to the Journal, the pilots shut off power to motors driven by the system but then apparently turned the system back on. It's not clear why the pilots turned the system back on, but officials told the Journal that it was likely because attempts to raise the nose weren't successful.
The automated flight control system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), has come under intense scrutiny following the Ethiopian Airlines crash and another crash last year in Indonesia.
Investigators believe the system was erroneously activated during the Lion Air flight in Indonesia last year, forcing the plane to dive down in a crash that killed all 189 people on board. The MCAS is believed to have played a similar role in the Ethiopian Airlines crash.
Investigators are probing how the system was certified as well as whether pilots received adequate training on the system.
For weeks, Boeing 737 Max jets have been grounded in the U.S. and in other major countries as a cautionary measure. The FAA said earlier this week that Boeing needs more time to propose a software fix to the MCAS and said the proposal is expected within the coming weeks."

Despite widespread condemnation, Brunei is implementing harsh new criminal laws that make gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death.
The new laws, which are set to begin Wednesday, also order the amputation of hands or feet for crimes like theft.
According to the BBC , the sultan of the small Muslim-majority kingdom, Hassanal Bolkiah, called for ""stronger"" Islamic teachings at a public address on Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENT
""I want to see Islamic teachings in this country grow stronger,"" he continued.
The stricter laws were first announced in the nation in 2013. The new laws make Brunei the first country in East Asia to adopt Sharia law, despite backlash from international human rights.
According to the BBC, the first phase of the set of laws, which was related to crimes that were punishable by fines or imprisonment, was implemented in 2014.
The sultan said that the remaining two phases of the set of measures, which related to crimes that would be punishable by stoning and amputation, would come into full implementation in the following years, but the latter phases were delayed amid international condemnation.
The government released a statement on Saturday saying that the Sharia penal code would come into full force on Wednesday.
Homosexuality is already punishable by up to 10 years in prison in the Southeast Asian nation. However, under the new measures, those found guilty could see penalties including whipping and stoning.
A few other countries, mostly in the Middle East, also adhere to sharia law, according to The Guardian ."
"Majority Rejects Idea of Haves, Have-Nots Divide in U.S.",news.gallup.com,Gallup,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://news.gallup.com/poll/248216/majority-rejects-idea-haves-nots-divide.aspx,"18 Gallup, Feb. 12-28, 2019
Americans who believe the country is divided into have and have-not groups are evenly split as to whether they personally are haves (47%) or have-nots (50%). Meanwhile, 62% of those who do not agree that the U.S. is divided along economic lines describe themselves as haves and 26% as have-nots.
The relationship between perceptions of the country as divided and self-identification as ""have"" or ""have-not"" is most pronounced among middle-income Americans. Those in this group who believe the country is divided into haves and have-nots are about equally likely to identify themselves as haves (46%) as to say they are have-nots (51%). By contrast, 69% of middle-income Americans who reject the idea that the U.S. is divided in this way put themselves into the ""haves"" group, while 21% say they are ""have-nots.""
There are no differences in self-identification as haves among upper-income Americans based on their perceptions of whether the country is divided, and only modest differences among lower-income Americans. Implications
Although Americans are more inclined today than in 1988 to see the country as divided along economic lines, it is still the minority opinion and has not varied much over the past 20 years. That is not to say, however, that Americans are satisfied with economic equality in the U.S. -- a majority are dissatisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed . But at the same time that 62% of Americans are dissatisfied with the nation's wealth distribution, 65% say they are satisfied with the opportunity for a person to get ahead by working hard. Moreover, Americans still tend to believe it is likely that today's youth will have a better life than their parents . Thus, it may be that perceptions of opportunity weigh more heavily in people's minds than perceptions of inequality when Americans assess whether U.S. society suffers from a have/have-not divide."

New York police are searching for a woman who launched an unprovoked anti-Hispanic attack against a McDonald’s customer, hitting him in the face with a chair before fleeing the scene.
According to NBC New York, the woman hurled anti-Hispanic remarks at the 33-year-old man, who was sitting inside a McDonald’s on Canal Street at 10:30 a.m. in Manhattan, before launching a physical attack.
The man told New York police the woman, who he had never met before, had picked up a chair and hit him in the face after making the racist comments. She then fled the downtown Manhattan restaurant, the NYPD said.
Police have released footage of the woman. She can be seen wearing a beige overcoat, a grey scarf, black trousers and carrying a black bag as she attempted to get through a turnstile at Canal Street train Station. She was ultimately unable to board a train at the station.

The NYPD has given further information about the woman who they estimate was aged between 35 and 45, weighed around 180 pounds and measured 5""2' in height.
The victim of the attack was taken to a local hospital where he was treated for a contusion to the face, police added.
Spates of violence in New York’s McDonald’s restaurants are not unheard of. In January a man attacked an employee at one of the fast food chain’s outlets in the Bronx with a deep fryer basket, before punching another in the face.
ABC7 reported a dispute between the man and the McDonald’s workers flared to violence after they told him the eatery on University Ave in Morris Heights was closed. Police said the suspect stole a set of keys before fleeing the scene.
In October last year, also in the Bronx, a man attacked an elderly woman, breaking several of her bones in an apparently unprovoked attack.
NBC New York reported that the attacker, who had grey hair, walked up to the 87-year-old woman, before grabbing and throwing her to the ground.
Paramedics were called to the scene, and the woman was taken to hospital, where she was reportedly treated for a fractured arm and fractured pelvis.
CCTV from the fast-food restaurant on 149th Street in Melrose showed the attacker wearing a black baseball cap and wearing a dark blue jacket. He was wheeling a blue suitcase, which he apparently took with him as he left the McDonald’s where the attack took place. "

The Jackson Press – Biden Learns Democrats Eat Their Own,thejacksonpress.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://thejacksonpress.org/?p=94761,"by Lewis Morris | Patriot Post
Joe Biden’s impending entry into the 2020 presidential race has been anticipated by a swirl of stories painting him as an out-of-touch, racist, sexist, dirty old man. And that’s just from the Democrats.
The leftists now dominating the Democrat Party have made plain that they are interested in nominating someone for president who fits a solid socialist profile. That’s not Biden, and therefore a plan has been set in motion to take him out.
Nevada politician Lucy Flores recently wrote a hit piece about Biden for New York magazine describing how he got too close for comfort and smelled her hair at a 2014 event. We’ll probably never know if Flores’s claim is true, though Biden does do such things in public all the time. But proof of such allegations in the #MeToo era is not necessary. Elizabeth “Fauxcahontas” Warren has already stated publicly, “I believe Lucy Flores. And Joe Biden needs to give an answer.” Another female presidential candidate, Amy Klobuchar, likewise said she has “no reason not to believe” the allegation.
And as these things usually play out, a second woman — Amy Lappos, a former aid to Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) — alleges that Biden touched her inappropriately.
Some other facts about Flores include that she was a staunch supporter of Bernie Sanders in 2016 (who by the way had his own sexual-harassment trouble among campaign staff) and that until last year, Flores also sat on the board of Our Revolution, a group committed to rallying Sanders supporters for 2020. She was also spotted at a recent Robert O’Rourke campaign rally.
In the current political climate, it’s hard not to be cynical about the timing of the Flores piece, especially when considering her own political allegiances. But, to her credit, there is a long list of similar complaints against Biden going back decades.
Biden’s reputation as a handsy guy in a post-Harvey Weinstein world certainly doesn’t do him any favors, though he swears he’ll “listen respectfully” to any challenges to his behavior.
That doesn’t mean Biden doesn’t have a shot at the nomination. Democrats are experts at demonstrating selective outrage in such matters. In 1998, they rallied around serial sex predator Bill Clinton when it looked like he might get kicked out of office. It wasn’t until recently, as Clinton enters his sunset years, that a few Democrats have had the courage to call him out for his reprehensible behavior.
Similarly, recent credible allegations against Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax went nowhere when it became evident that kicking him out of office might mean a Republican taking his place. For all the grandstanding Democrats do about protecting women from such sleazy predators, they can only be counted on to walk the walk when it’s politically expedient. If Biden represents the best chance at beating President Donald Trump in 2020, Democrats will look the other way again.
Leftists want to smother Biden’s campaign before it even launches, though, and his reputation as a cad is merely one tool they plan to use. Allegations of racism because of his stance on busing four decades ago, his inability to stop Clarence Thomas from reaching the Supreme Court, and other gems from Biden’s long political career are already being wheeled out.
Biden has even been attacked for his civility. He recently criticized Vice President Mike Pence’s foreign-policy statements on Twitter, but made the mistake of referring to Pence as a “ decent guy .” Former New York gubernatorial candidate and LGBT activist Cynthia Nixon slammed Biden for the remark, claiming that Pence was not a decent guy because his stance on same-sex marriage doesn’t conform with Nixon’s. A cowed Biden quickly apologized.
This is a glimpse into the Democrat Party in which Biden wants to secure the presidential nomination.
Joe Biden’s future as a candidate is very much up in the air. He’s a touchy-feely, gaffe-prone plagiarist who was veep to a president with no respect for the Constitution. Yet he would still be a formidable challenger to Trump if for no other reason than his connection to middle-class voters. But he still must survive the primary process in a party that has drifted too far left even for Joe Biden. Share this:"
"Flood of Comments Shows Public 'Utterly Repulsed' By Trump Plan to Take Food Stamps From 750,000 People",www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/04/03/flood-comments-shows-public-utterly-repulsed-trump-plan-take-food-stamps-750000,"""This is a direct attack on the most vulnerable among us and this policy violence cannot go unchallenged,"" said Rev. William Barber
by Jake Johnson, staff writer 0 Comments U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue delivers remarks with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building December 20, 2018 in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
As the Trump administration moves closer to stripping food stamps from as many as 750,000 low-income people by imposing punitive work requirements, a flood of nearly 30,000 comments to the U.S. Department of Agriculture from experts, activists, and concerned citizens shows Americans are overwhelmingly appalled by the proposed rule change.
""The comments make it clear that most Americans not only oppose but are utterly repulsed by this plan to punish the poorest among us by denying them help to feed themselves.""
—Scott Faber, Environmental Working Group
""The comments make it clear that most Americans not only oppose but are utterly repulsed by this plan to punish the poorest among us by denying them help to feed themselves,"" Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group (EWG), said in a statement Tuesday.
""Instead of making already struggling Americans suffer even more,"" Faber added, ""we urge President Trump to cut off the farm subsidy spigot of taxpayer money flowing into the brimming bank accounts of millionaires.""
The public comment period for the Trump administration's proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) ended Tuesday night. President Donald Trump announced the rule change last year, on the same day he signed into law a farm bill that left out the GOP push for work requirements for food stamp recipients. The new rule could go into effect later this year.
Under the proposed rule, NPR reports , ""the administration would stop food stamps after three months for [able-bodied adults without dependents] who don't work, volunteer, or get job training for at least 20 hours a week.""
But critics were quick to point out that most food stamp recipients already work . The establishment of more barriers to nutrition assistance would be cruel, argued critics.
""Millions of adults and families depend on SNAP,"" wrote one commenter from Arkansas. ""The idea that it should be somehow cut back while we waste billions on our bloated military and entertain the possibility of building that pathetic, soon to be Ozymandian wall is an insult to America's soul and an embarrassment in the eyes of the civilized world. If you do your homework, you'll realize that the waste in the SNAP program is negligible. Yet, you would have Americans starve as a political stunt. Have you no shame? Have you no humanity?""
""In the richest country in the world no one should go hungry,"" said another. ""We should not allow it. It is cruel. It is un-American. Cutting taxes for the rich and letting others go hungry is just unbelievably cruel. Please do not cut off this program.""
As the Center for American Progress noted in its Hands Off SNAP campaign , ""Trump's proposed rule comes as we mark the one-year anniversary of his tax law—which gave more in tax breaks to the top one percent than the entire SNAP program costs.""
Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the national Poor People's Campaign, called the Trump administration's proposal an ""immoral and extremist attempt to hurt the poor"" in a tweet on Tuesday.
""This is a direct attack on the most vulnerable among us,"" Barber added, ""and this policy violence cannot go unchallenged.""
A reminder of this immoral & extremist attempt to hurt the poor: The Trump administration is attempting to gut food assistance. This is a direct attack on the most vulnerable among us and this policy violence cannot go unchallenged. https://t.co/myBK3Euc7c
— Rev. Dr. Barber (@RevDrBarber) April 2, 2019
Trump's proposed rule change has also drawn strong opposition from Democratic lawmakers.
""As a single mother raising two sons, I relied on food stamps to make sure my kids had food on the table,"" Rep. Barbara Lee tweeted on Tuesday. ""Trump's newest proposal would put thousands of everyday families at risk—we can't let that happen.""
As a single mother raising two sons, I relied on food stamps to make sure my kids had food on the table. Trump’s newest proposal would put thousands of everyday families at risk -- we can't let that happen. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/7jqg6PeMjW
— Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) April 2, 2019
In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Tuesday, House Democrats demanded that the Trump administration withdraw its proposed rule change.
""SNAP recipients are our nation's most vulnerable—nearly 20 million are children, almost 5 million are low-income seniors, and 1.5 million are military veterans,"" reads the Democrats' letter, which was signed by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Ro Khanna (Calif.), and more than a dozen others. ""The proposed rule is a continued pursuit of the flawed political ideology that was resoundingly rejected by Congress in the 2018 Farm Bill.""

With Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expected as early as Wednesday to use the so-called ""nuclear option"" to speed up the confirmation process for President Donald Trump's right wing judicial nominees, progressives raised alarm and urged Americans to pressure their senators to stop the ""reckless court packing"" by the Republican Party.
""McConnell has signaled he is ready to use the so-called 'nuclear option' to further pack the courts with Trump’s lifetime judicial appointments,"" tweeted the progressive advocacy group 5 Calls. ""Tell the Senate to block McConnell and stop further erosion of our democratic norms!""
McConnell is moving forward w/ the nuclear option to limit floor debate on district judge nominations & speed roll extremists onto the federal bench.
If you haven't called your Senators yet to stop this reckless court packing, DO IT NOW. : https://t.co/hPznoG9OXk https://t.co/ZetuCu3IUn
— 5 Calls (@make5calls) April 2, 2019
On Tuesday, Republicans failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to advance S. Res 50, which would change Senate rules to cut debate time on district court nominees and other lower-level judges from 30 hours to just two hours.
The vote, which was expected to fail, set the stage for McConnell to use the ""nuclear option,"" which would allow the resolution to pass with just a simple majority of 51 votes.
McConnell is expected to begin the process on Wednesday, HuffPost reported .
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, denounced McConnell for attempting to carry out ""a short-sighted, partisan power grab.""
""And it is motivated by the far-right's desire to flood the federal judiciary with young, ideological nominees, many of whom—as we have seen time and again in the Judiciary Committee—are simply unqualified to serve on our nation's courts,"" Leahy said. ""Post-cloture time is a critical tool for senators, especially those who do not sit on the Judiciary Committee, to vet nominees for lifetime judgeships.""
Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, tweeted , ""Presidencies aren't forever. But federal court nominations last a lifetime.""
""McConnell has been leading an effort to rig the rules and rubber-stamp hostile nominees who lack capacity to be fair and impartial,"" Clarke added. ""We must condemn this.""

“Even as President Donald Trump threatens to shut down the southern border, his administration is quietly working on a plan to expand some forms of legal immigration into the U.S.
Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been working for months on a proposal that could increase the number of low- and high-skilled workers admitted to the country annually, four people involved in the discussions told POLITICO. …”
That’s what we were told yesterday .

This week Marvin Gaye, the "" truest artist, "" divided soul, Motown legend and troubled ""seeker who sought salvation through music"" is back among us, both ethereal and palpable. Born April 2, 1939, died April 1, 1984: Tuesday marked what would have been his 80th birthday; Monday marked the 35th anniversary of his murder by his own father, a final act of violence after decades of abuse that was ""truly one of music’s most senseless tragedies"" among so many. In his too-brief life - he was killed the night before he would have turned 45 - Gaye reached uncommon heights and depths. He achieved super stardom as the Prince of Soul; he long struggled with substance abuse, depression and loss, including the early death of his best friend and singing partner Tammi Terrell. To those who loved and admired him, Gaye "" gave us heaven and hell...Marvin suffered for his art - and you could hear it. He was not ashamed. He knew no other way...The microphone was his confessional, the vocal booth his confession box: This is how I feel, right here, right now.""
After a years-long process , Tuesday also saw the dedication of a Commemorative Forever Stamp in his image, part of the Postal Service's Music Icons collection. Artist Kadir Nelson based it on a picture of Gaye around 1971's "" What's Going On,"" his seminal turn away from clean-cut Motown to a world torn by the Vietnam War, police brutality, racism and protest. Gaye's brother had just returned from the war, Gaye himself was in a dark place, and he had to fight for the song, once explaining, “To be truly righteous, you offer love with a pure heart, without regard for what you’ll get in return... People were confused and needed reassurance."" Near the end of his turbulent life, he likewise spoke of his music as a healing gift from a man in pain who empathized with the pain of others: He made it ""so that I can feed people what they need, what they feel."" This week we got his final, bittersweet gift: the release of a long-delayed, posthumous album in which, ""despite his divided soul, he married the secular to the sacred with exquisite grace."" The title: ""You're the Man."" May he rest in peace and power.
""Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today...""
~ Marvin Gaye, April 2, 1939 – April 1, 1984

China's Han Superstate: The New Third Reich,www.gatestoneinstitute.org,Gordon G. Chang,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/13995/china-third-reich,"Swedish
China's ruler, Xi Jinping, demands that the five recognized religions — official recognition is a control mechanism — ""Sinicize."" The Chinese, as a part of this ruthless and relentless effort, are destroying mosques and churches, forcing devout Muslims to drink alcohol and eat pork, inserting Han officials to live in Muslim homes, and ending religious instruction for minors.
In recent years, there have been many ugly portrayals of Africans in Chinese media, and although the skit last year was not the worst, it was striking because the main state broadcaster, by airing it to about 800 million viewers, made it clear Chinese officials think of Africans as both objects of derision and subhuman.
Concentration camps, racism, eugenics, ambitions of world domination. Sound familiar?
There is a new Third Reich, and it is China. More than a million people, for no reason other than their ethnicity or religion, are held in concentration camps in what Beijing calls the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Picture: Chinese police clash with ethnic Uighur women during a protest in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, on July 7, 2009. (Photo by Guang Niu/Getty Images)
More than a million people, for no reason other than their ethnicity or religion, are held in concentration camps in what Beijing calls the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and what traditional inhabitants of the area, the Uighurs, say is East Turkestan. In addition to Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs are also held in these facilities.
Families in this troubled area, shown on maps as the northwestern portion of the People's Republic of China, are being torn apart. The children of imprisoned Uighur and Kazakh parents are ""confined"" to ""schools"" that are separated from the outside by barbed wire and heavy police patrols. They are denied instruction in their own language, forced to learn Mandarin Chinese. The controls are part of a so-called ""Hanification"" policy, a program of forced assimilation. ""Han"" is the name of China's dominant ethnic group.
Because Uighurs and Kazakhs are dying in the camps in considerable numbers, Beijing is building crematoria to eradicate burial traditions while disposing of corpses.
The camps, a crime against humanity, are spreading. China is now building similar facilities , given various euphemistic names such as ""vocational training centers,"" in Tibet, in China's southwest.
At the same time, Beijing is renewing its attempt to eliminate religion country-wide. Christians have come under even greater attack across China, as have Buddhists. China's ruler, Xi Jinping, demands that the five recognized religions — official recognition is a control mechanism — ""Sinicize."" The Chinese, as a part of this ruthless and relentless effort, are destroying mosques and churches, forcing devout Muslims to drink alcohol and eat pork, inserting Han officials to live in Muslim homes, and ending religious instruction for minors.
These attempts, which have antecedents in Chinese history, have been intensified since Xi became the Communist Party's general secretary in November 2012.
At the same time, Xi, far more than his predecessors, has been promoting the concept of a world order ruled by only one sovereign, a Chinese one .
In broad outline, Xi's vision of the world is remarkably similar to that of the Third Reich, at least before the mass murders.
The Third Reich and the People's Republic share a virulent racism, in China politely referred to as ""Han chauvinism."" The Han category, which is said to include about 92% of the population of the People's Republic, is in truth the amalgamation of related ethnic groups.
Chinese mythology holds that all Chinese are descendants of the Yellow Emperor, who is thought to have ruled in the third millennium BCE. The Chinese consider themselves to be a branch of humanity separate from the rest of the world, a view reinforced by indoctrination in schools, among other means.
Chinese scholars support this notion of Chinese separateness with the "" Peking Man "" theory of evolution, which holds the Chinese do not share a common African ancestor with the remainder of humankind. This theory of the unique evolution of the Chinese has, not surprisingly, reinforced racist views.
As a result of racism, many in China, including officials, ""believe themselves to be categorically different from and impliedly superior to the rest of the humankind,"" writes Fei-Ling Wang, author of The China Order: Centralia, World Empire, and the Nature of Chinese Power .
The racism, therefore, is institutionalized and openly promoted. That was painfully evident last year in the 13-minute skit on China Central Television's Spring Festival Gala, the premier television show in China. In ""Let's Celebrate Together,"" a Chinese actress in blackface played a Kenyan mother, who had an enormous bosom and ridiculously large buttocks. Worse, her sidekick was a human-size monkey. The combination of the monkey and the woman was an echo of the Hubei Provincial Museum exhibit, "" This is Africa ,"" which in 2017 displayed photographs of Africans flush next to images of primates.
In recent years, there have been many ugly portrayals of Africans in Chinese media, and although the skit last year was not the worst, it was striking because the main state broadcaster, by airing it to about 800 million viewers, made it clear Chinese officials think of Africans as both objects of derision and subhuman. In these circumstances, it is a safe assumption that these views are shared by the Beijing leadership, which, alarmingly, is making more frequent race-based appeals to Chinese people — and not only those in China.
This century's master race has a problem, however. China, now the world's most populous state, faces rapid demographic decline. Last year's birth rate was the lowest since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. The country's population will peak in 2029, according to the World Population Prospects 2017 , published by the United Nations Population Division. But the high-point could in fact come in just the next couple years, as the U.N. numbers are based on Beijing's overly optimistic assumptions. China's official demographers, for instance, did not foresee the near-collapse of the birthrate last year.
In 2024, another momentous event will occur. Then, for the first time in at least 300 years — and maybe for the first time in recorded history — China will not be the world's most populous society. That honor will go to a country the Chinese generally both detest and fear, India. When India peaks in 2061, it will have a population 398,088 million larger than China's.
Once China begins to shrink, it will shrink fast. In 2018, China's population was 4.3 times larger than America's. By 2100, China is projected to have a population only 2.3 times larger.
China's demographic path is set for decades, and it will have momentous — and extremely adverse — consequences for Chinese society and the country's ""comprehensive national strength."" Perhaps that is why Beijing looks as if it may be trying to compensate for collapsing demography by laying the groundwork for a race of superhuman Chinese.
He Jiankui of Shenzhen's Southern University of Science and Technology announced in November that he had used CRISPR to edit human embryos that produced live births, in this case twin s girls. He claimed he was making the babies resistant to HIV, but there is speculation he was also trying to enhance intelligence. In any event, the announcement evoked Nazi eugenics experiments, especially because there is evidence that the Chinese government had backed He's ""world's first"" experiment, considered unethical and dangerous.
Certainly dangerous is Xi Jinping. ""Mao Zedong may have played on the Third World's racial resentments when trying to unite former colonial peoples against white imperialists, but he thought that Communism was a global phenomenon that would eventually find a home everywhere and Mao's utopia was in the future,"" the Hudson Institute's Charles Horner told Gatestone. ""Xi Jinping's Chinese Communist Party is not global or utopian in this way; instead, it seems in thrall to an essential 'Chinese-ness.'""
Horner sees disconcerting similarities between Xi's China and 1930s Imperial Japan. ""Like Imperial Japan then,"" Horner said, ""Xi and the Party look backward to a mythologized past when a benign Emperor brought the whole world together to bask in his glory and share his munificence.""

Theresa May to hold emergency Brexit talks with STURGEON to prep for no deal
SCOTLAND’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to travel to London to meet Theresa May for Brexit talks, including no deal preparations – just one day after warning the Prime Minister’s offer to ask for an Article 50 extension could be a trap.
Mrs Sturgeon is also expected to attend UK cabinet sub-committee on no deal preparations, tweeted BBC Scotland’s chief political correspondent Glenn Campbell.
The Prime Minister’s spokesman has confirmed the meeting will take place, although the time and venue are still to be confirmed.
Yesterday, Mrs Sturgeon said Prime Minister Theresa May’s offer to ask for a Brexit extension “as short as possible” was a potential trap.
Sturgeon said if MPs agree to the extension and not to fight European parliament elections then they will face the choice between the prime minister’s divorce deal or leaving the EU without a deal.
She tweeted: “Parliament needs to be very wary about a potential trap.
“The sensible way forward – and I think the one PM would take if this was a serious attempt to build consensus – is agree to fight election, seek longer delay and allow option of public vote on what Commons agrees.”
She added: “This does seem very much like PM kicking the can and, yet again, delaying making any decision that could break her Cabinet.” Read more Theresa May to hold emergency Brexit talks with STURGEON to prep for no deal Top Think Tanks News Feed App Think Thanks Article Search "

Trump Lays Foundation For Claiming 2020 Races Were Stolen By Dems,crooksandliars.com,Susie Madrak,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/trump-lays-foundation-claiming-2020-races,"Views:
This is what Trump said last night at an RNCC event:
We're going to watch those vote tallies. I keep hearing about the election and the various counting measures that they have. There were a lot of close elections that were -- every single one of them went Democrat. If it was close, they say the Democrat -- there's something going on. You've got -- hey, you've got to be a little more paranoid than you are. We have to be a little bit careful. I don't like the way the votes are being tallied.
In other words: Heads I win, tails you lose! Booga booga!
CNN's New Day explained the obvious.
""So it seems to me he has a problem with the way the votes are being tallied when people he wants to win lose. That's where he has a real problem. I didn't hear him concerned about the rampant election fraud that invalidated an entire election in North Carolina, for instance,"" John Berman said.
""No. Still silent on that one. This is a flipping of the script, going from allegations of rampant voter fraud, illegals voting to problems with counting. this is a different kind of conspiracy he's articulating from the bully pulpit. It is doubly troubling because it sets the stage for 2020. He's saying don't trust the people counting the votes where Democrats win tight elections,"" John Avlon said.
""Let's call it what it is. Sounds like the president setting up for, in case there is a bad outcome for himself in 2020, it can't be trusted,"" Alysin Camerota said.
""He's certainly sowing the seeds to contest the election as he did during the last one. Don't forget folks, in the leadup to 2016, he was preparing to hold the outcome as illegitimate,"" Avlon said.
Yeah, I agree that it's not exactly a ""strategy."" It's that Trump is a pathological narcissist whose fear of failing it absolutely primal, and this is how he deals with threats: He rewrites the narratives.
We need to hand him a message that's very clear: ""Go home."" Tags:"
Trump Accuses Democratic Socialists of Attacks on Biden,www.politicususa.com,Leo Vidal,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/03/trump-accuses-democratic-socialists-of-attacks-on-biden.html,"Trump Accuses Democratic Socialists of Attacks on Biden 171 Subscribe Print Flipboard
President Donald Trump said in a speech to a Republican group that former Vice President Joe Biden is “being taken care of pretty well by the socialists.” He was implying that recent criticisms against Biden, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, is the product of attacks coming from the left wing (i.e. Bernie Sanders wing ) of the Democratic Party.
Criticism of the former vice president has been snowballing over the past several recent days as more women have come out with stories about past physical interactions with Biden.
Although Biden has always been a “touchy-feely” politician, the women have all said their interactions with him left them feeling uncomfortable. Even though all of Biden’s accusers made clear that the physical contact was not sexual in nature, the criticisms against him are problematic.
If Biden does enter the 2020 presidential race he will immediately be a top contender, and he has been first in many polls of 2020 Democratic candidates. So accusations against him will undoubtedly cast a shadow over his campaign, as he takes on over 15 other Democrats, including several women.
Trump’s comments came at the spring fundraising dinner for House Republicans’ campaign arm. He very clearly insinuated, just as Biden’s own team has, that the accusations had come out because of the work of a rival campaign.
“It looks like the only non-, sort of heavy socialist, he is being taken care of pretty well by the socialists,” Trump said. “They got to him. Our former vice president. I was going to call him — I don’t know him well. I was gonna say, ‘Welcome to the world, Joe. Are you having a good time, Joe?’”
The controversy over Biden’s alleged inappropriate touching first came up last week when former Nevada legislator Lucy Flores wrote an essa y in The Cut detailing a 2014 incident when Biden allegedly kissed the back of her head. Since then, three more women have come forward with their own stories of being made uncomfortable by Biden’s physical contact.
Many Democrats have stepped forward in Biden’s defense in the last week, arguing that the former vice president’s habit of showing physical affection is simply part of his personality.
Biden has also apologized through statements to the press, admitting he may have unintentionally made the women feel uncomfortable.
Trump’s comments about Biden might be a preview of further attacks to come on the former vice president. It also shows that he will not stay silent during the Democratic primaries.
The Hill reported Tuesday afternoon that the pro-Trump Great America PAC had recently placed a six-figure ad buy for a digital spot hitting “Creepy Joe” over the accusations. Trump Should Not Be Highlighting Sexual Assault During the 2020 Campaign
This is somewhat surprising since Trump himself has not been immune to accusations of making unwelcome advances on women. He has been accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault over 20 times. In the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape he admitted kissing and groping women without their consent.
Donald Trump lives in the ultimate glass house, and he really shouldn’t be throwing any stones at an upstanding family man like Joe Biden."

Milano praised Biden as a “warm” and “generous” person who “believes [it’s] on all of us to pay attention to women’s stories and experiences.”

The actress then turned her attention to Biden’s first accuser, Lucy Flores, who alleged last week that the former vice president kissed the back of her head and smelled her hair at a 2014 campaign event. “I respect Lucy Flores’ decision to share her story and agree with Biden that we all must pay attention to it. But, just as we must believe women that decide to come forward, we cannot assume all women’s experiences are the same,” she wrote. Flores has called Biden’s behavior “problematic” and disqualified him from seeking the White House.

On Monday, Amy Lappos, a former congressional aide to Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), became the second woman to accuse Biden of unwanted touching. “He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth,” she told The Courant . The alleged incident is said to have occurred during a 2019 political fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Milano’s swift defense of Barack Obama’s number 2 draws a stark contrast to her reaction to sexual misconduct allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In a video produced by the progressive news outlet “Now This,” the actress urged her fans to “bang down” their senators’ doors to prevent Kavanaugh’s confirmation — — despite a lack of evidence corroborating the decades-old allegations against the judge by California professor Christine Blasey Ford and others.
In an opinion-editorial for Variety , Milano wrote Kavanaugh’s confirmation would “institutionalize sexual violence.” Milano even attended Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford’s testimonies, where the two offered dueling accounts of the night in which the judge was accused of wrongdoing.

In a statement Sunday, Biden said it was never his intention to make women feel uncomfortable and if he did so, “I will listen respectfully.”
“I will also remain the strongest advocate I can be for the rights of women,” said the former vice president. “I will fight to build on the work I’ve done in my career to end violence against women and ensure women are treated with the equality they deserve. I will continue to surround myself with trusted women advisers who challenge me to see different perspectives than my own. And I will continue to speak out on these vitally-important issues where there is much more progress to be made and crucial fights that must be waged and won.”
Biden spokesman Bill Russo on Monday issued another statement addressing the controversy surrounding photos of the possible 2020 candidate interacting awkwardly with women, blasting some of them as “smears and forgeries.”
“The Vice President has issued a statement affirming that in all the many years in public life that he has shaken a hand, given or received a hug, or laid his hand on a shoulder to express concern, support; or reassurance, he never intended to cause discomfort,” said Russo. “He has said that he believes that women who have experienced any such discomfort, regardless of intention, should speak and be heard, and that he will be among those who listen.”
“But the important conversation about these issues are not advanced, nor are any criticisms of Vice President Biden validated, by the continued misrepresentation of the Carter and Coons moments, or a failure to be vigilant about a cottage industry of lies,” he added .
