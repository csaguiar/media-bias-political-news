The other report makes out Kane was the victim of a heavy challenge from Delph when in fact Kane’s ankle buckled underneath him whilst he was going in late on Delph.
Delph is not at fault here: Kane injured the same ankle in January and residual weakness obviously contributed to it buckling again.
Also the pitch was being carved up and players losing footing routinely. Maybe a mixture of too much give in the turf, and too much give in Kane’s ankle, resulted in the injury.
Pochettino should apologise to Delph."

India: police charge Catholic bishop with raping nun | World news,www.theguardian.com,theguardian.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/10/india-police-charge-catholic-bishop-with-raping-nun,"Franco Mulakkal denies multiple charges, including unlawful detention, in southern state of Kerala. Police on Tuesday charged an Indian bishop with repeatedly raping a nun at a rural convent in a case that has cast a new shadow on the Catholic church’s global sex abuse crisis.
Franco Mulakkal was charged with raping the nun several times between 2014 and 2016, according to K Subash, police deputy superintendent in the district of the southern state of Kerala where the investigation was carried out.
Indian Catholic nuns protest against bishop accused of rape Read more
The bishop also faces charges of unlawful detention, unnatural sex and abuse of authority. Mulakkal – who would face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment if convicted – has denied the allegations.
The police report ran to more than 100 pages and contained statements from nuns, priests and other bishops, media reports said.
The victim filed a complaint in June last year, but police only started formal questioning in September as fury over the case mounted.
In a rare public show of dissent within the church five nuns staged days of protests with dozens of supporters to force authorities to take the allegations seriously.
Mulakkal was arrested in October before being released on bail. Senior members of the church in Kerala have supported the 55-year-old bishop, and he was cheered when he returned to his diocese.
Sexual abuse by clergy and the failure to take action has mired the Catholic church in scandal across the world in recent years.
In February, Pope Francis publicly addressed the sexual abuse of nuns by clerics for the first time, insisting the Vatican take seriously reports of sexual abuse and the “sexual slavery” of nuns.
Sister Anupama Kelamangalath, one of the five nuns who protested outside Kerala’s high court, said they had sought to draw attention to church authorities who they say were misusing positions of power.
The sister, from the Jalandhar diocese in the state, said she was relieved and delighted at the charges. “We were able to achieve this despite stiff opposition from all sides. We had no one on our side to fight for us, but Christ.”
She insisted the protests were not against the church but aimed “at certain figures who misused the holy powers vested in them”, she added. “Other than truth as our weapon, we never had anything else on our side.”
She said repeated approaches to senior church officials were ignored: “When they realised that we wouldn’t back down, they had us transferred and then made false cases against our families,” she said. These included allegations they had made death threats against the accused bishop.
“We were then left with no option but to approach the police and register a case against the bishop. What else could we do?”
Police say they are looking into other cases of abuse of nuns and allegations that four Kerala priests blackmailed women during confession to force them to have sex.
In Kerala state, Christians – overwhelmingly Catholic – make up just over 18% of the population, according to the 2011 census. This is a significantly larger proportion than India as a whole, which is 80% Hindu, and also has a sizeable Muslim minority.

In fact I think the case for “dying with dignity” is made a little bit too eagerly these days. Not everyone wants to give in without a fight. Not everyone sees nausea and frailty as a price being beyond paying for a couple more years with our families and friends.
When it’s my time, I don’t want to give in. I want to fight for my life and I want death to have a bloody hard time taking me. I have too much to do, too much I want to see and too many books to read to just pack it all in. Others are free to make a different choice, but I want to get as much as I can out of my time, even if that means some hardship towards the end.
It’s strange in some ways, because I used to suffer terribly from depression, and did sadly think of suicide. Coming out of that has given me a certain perspective: that life can be painful, but that even the most wretched times have their own small joys.
And now I’ve made the decision to live instead of die - with all the work and pain and strife that has entailed - I suppose I feel too bloody minded to admit defeat on the matter. Maybe it’s just stubbornness, but to some extent I’ve needed that stubbornness and a blind will to survive in order to keep going. I don’t want to let go of it."

Liverpool controlled much of the quarter-final first leg with Naby Keïta and Roberto Firmino on the scoresheet in a dominant first-half display that threatened a repeat of last season’s 5-0 win in the last-16 stage . It never materialised and Klopp claimed the tie is far from over before next Wednesday’s return at Estádio do Dragão.
“In Porto we finished them off, tonight we didn’t,” the Liverpool manager said. “The game is still on, we have to go there and fight. Porto will try to strike back. It will be a tough game but that is what you expect in the quarter-finals of Champions League . There is still a lot to do, the atmosphere will be really tough and intense. This is the result we wanted before the game.”

Thank you for your feedback. The Porto striker Moussa Marega missed several good chances for a vital away goal but Klopp was content with the maturity his team displayed. He said: “You saw how physically strong the striker is, unbelievable. And I heard that he was a little bit ill before the game. If he’s not ill, it will be a really tough one in Portugal.

“Finding the 100% mix of control and being a threat constantly is difficult but we were close to that. We probably didn’t have as many chances as we wish in the second half but controlling happens in different ways. The best way is with the ball. When we lost it, we had to do a lot of work to get it back. 2-0 is a really, really good result. I would have bought it before the game and I will take it now. All good.”
Mohamed Salah escaped punishment for a bad challenge on the Porto captain, Danilo, late in the game despite the presence of VAR. “I don’t talk about referees or refereeing decisions,” said Sérgio Conceição, the Porto manager.

The Tibetan spiritual leader, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, lives in exile in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamshala.
Tenzin Taklha, his personal secretary, said the Dalai Lama “felt some discomfort and he was flown to Delhi for a check-up” on Tuesday.
“Doctors have diagnosed him with a chest infection and he is being treated for that. His condition is stable now. He will be treated for two, three days here.”

Chinese leader urges fresh push against 'separatist elements' in Tibet Read more
The Dalai Lama said last month it was possible that once he dies his incarnation could be found in India, and warned that any other successor named by China would not be respected.
China, which took control of Tibet in 1950, regards the Nobel peace laureate as a dangerous separatist and says its leaders have the right to approve the Dalai Lama’s successor, as a legacy inherited from China’s emperors.
But many Tibetans – whose tradition holds that the soul of a senior Buddhist monk is reincarnated in the body of a child on his death – suspect any Chinese role as a ploy to exert influence on the community.
