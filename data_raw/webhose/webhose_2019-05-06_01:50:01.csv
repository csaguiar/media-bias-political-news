As i said MacGyver (Maybe i didn't explain it well), when you usually see that type of error, you usually need a password to unlock that RAR file..

Oh looky here, seems Democrats have figured out they actually do need the evil, racist, bigoted, sexist, white man’s vote. Whoda thunk it? Democratic presidential candidates and strategists debate how to appeal to working-class white men who voted for President Trump in 2016. https://t.co/QdXwTdlCtl
— AP Politics (@AP_Politics) April 7, 2019
From the AP:
That’s left Democrats wondering whether the nominee should be someone who can cut deep into Trump’s base, picking off large numbers of working-class whites, whether it’s enough to win over affluent, college-educated, suburban men and whether the party is moving too far left to win them both.
“The white male vote is indispensable, it’s a part of any winning coalition,” said Democratic pollster Ronald Lester, who worked for Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. He noted that successful national Democrats perform well with white men, and that includes Barack Obama, whose strength among white men in the Rust Belt helped fuel his White House victories in 2008 and 2012.
Sorry white guys, they didn’t mean to treat you like the scourge of the Earth for the past couple of years … holy crap. Have you tried calling them racist? I hear that tests well. https://t.co/uNOi16pJ5G

People probably told him he was looking foolish. He still is looking foolish by saying unethical and improper conduct and not giving any examples of what he is refereeing to. Just like saying collusion with no evidence. Shitt for brains.

So now he is using words like “deeply unethical,” “improper,” and “immoral” as if calling the president names will justify his party’s past and present presidential harassment.
Yet most of us know that the Left always accuses everyone else of being what they are and of doing what they do. Translation: Schiff and his party are deeply unethical, improper and immoral. They are the leakers, liars, colluders and deceivers. I look forward to when Trump releases the deceptive FISA warrant applications so the American public can see exactly how this all started."
POLITICO Playbook: Mulvaney doesn’t have ‘much interest’ in seeing the Mueller report,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/04/07/mulvaney-doesnt-have-much-interest-in-seeing-the-mueller-report-421938,"“I don’t really have much interest in seeing it,"" acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said of special counsel Robert Mueller's final report. ""I wasn’t involved in it. I was over at OMB during that process. I don’t really have much interest.” | Alex Wong/Getty Images DRIVING THE DAY NEW … PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S WEEK AHEAD -- MONDAY: The president will have lunch with VP Mike Pence. He will also meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. TUESDAY: The president will have a bilateral meeting with Egypt President El Sisi. WEDNESDAY: Trump will travel to San Antonio and Houston. THURSDAY: The president and First Lady Melania Trump will meet with Korean President Moon Jae-in and his wife Kim Jung-sook. He will also meet with WWII veterans.
SUNDAY BEST -- BILL HEMMER spoke with ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MICK MULVANEY on FOX NEWS’ “FOX NEWS SUNDAY: HEMMER: “[The president] also threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries. Is that still a threat?” MULVANEY: “Absolutely, it’s for the same reason. This is his number one priority. Keep in mind, dealing with healthcare is nice, dealing with the economy is nice. The president’s first responsibility is to protect the integrity and safety of our nation, and we really do believe and I think again, most folks are starting to agree with us now, that the situation on the border is a national security crisis.”
-- ON TRUMP’S TAXES: HEMMER: “Do you believe Democrats will ever see the President’s tax returns?” MULVANEY: “Oh no, never, nor should they. Keep in mind that that’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway, which of course is what drive the Democrats crazy.”
-- ON THE MUELLER REPORT: HEMMER: “Do you want to see it?” MULVANEY: “I don’t really have much interest in seeing it. I wasn’t involved in it. I was over at OMB during that process. I don’t really have much interest.”
JAKE TAPPER spoke with HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN ADAM SCHIFF (D-CALIF.) on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION” about whether parts of the Mueller report should be redacted: SCHIFF: “Well, look, if there are classified portions of the report, if there’s the classified annex, for example, that may need to be close-hold, depending on whether that reveals sources and methods. There may even be some parts of that, though, that can be declassified in the public interest.”
-- SCHIFF on collusion: “Yes, there’s ample evidence of collusion in plain sight. But that is not the same thing as proof of a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, and that I would defer to Bob Mueller’s judgment. And I do. But I think what we’re talking about here is the difference between conduct that rises to the level of criminality and conduct that is deeply unethical, unpatriotic and corrupt that may not be criminal.”
-- TAPPER also spoke with National Economic Director LARRY KUDLOW about Trump’s possible Federal Reserve picks of Stephen Moore and Herman Cain. KUDLOW: “I mean, first of all, they’re both very smart people. Second of all, let’s take Mr. Herman Cain. Besides being a very successful entrepreneur, businessman, he was a board member of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, and actually was the chairman of the board of the Kansas City Federal Reserve. His time there spans, I think, about a decade.
“He is intimately acquainted with Federal Reserve operations and policy issues. So I think these criticisms are very unfair.”
SCOOP: ALEX ISENSTADT in Las Vegas: “Pro-Trump Republicans plan eight-figure play for the Jewish vote in 2020”: “Republicans are planning a multimillion-dollar offensive aimed at fracturing the Democratic Party’s decades-long stranglehold on the Jewish vote.
“Spearheading the push is the Republican Jewish Coalition, which receives substantial funding from casino mogul and GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. On Friday morning, the group’s board members — many of them prominent Republican Party donors — gathered in a conference room at Adelson’s Venetian resort, where they were briefed on plans for a $10 million-plus blitz geared toward attracting Jewish support for President Donald Trump. The investment, people familiar with the early discussions say, will far surpass what the group has spent in past presidential elections.
“With Democrats embroiled in a wrenching internal debate over anti-Semitism and support for Israel, Republicans are moving to capitalize with an aggressive campaign painting Trump — who himself has at times faced accusations of stoking anti-Semitism — as a fierce and unapologetic defender of the Jewish state.
“‘We’re at the intersection of a very unique moment in time where we have the most pro-Israel president ever in history in Donald Trump, and we also at the same time have the Democratic Party – because of the pressure of the progressive left – moving away from the traditional support for Israel that has existed going back to 1948,’ said Matt Brooks, who has served as RJC executive director for nearly three decades.” POLITICO

Good Sunday morning. THE VIRGINIA CAVALIERS will face the TEXAS TECH RED RAIDERS for the NCAA men’s basketball championship Monday at 9:20 p.m. EDT in Minneapolis. It will be broadcast on CBS. Virginia is an early one-point favorite in Vegas.
MORE SUNDAY BEST … CHUCK TODD spoke with SOUTH BEND MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG on NBC NEWS’ “MEET THE PRESS” about what makes him qualified to be president: BUTTIGEIG: “I would stack up my experience against anybody. I know it’s not as traditional I haven’t been marinating in Washington here for a very long time and I know I’m not part of that establishment but I would argue that being the mayor of a city of any size means that you have to deal with the kinds of issues that really hit Americans.”
-- BUTTIGIEG on the issues: GUN CONTROL: “We’ve already decided within the framework of the Second Amendment that we’re going to draw a line somewhere, right? ‘Shall not be infringed’ clearly doesn’t mean that you're entitled to a nuclear weapon. I mean somewhere in between a slingshot and a nuclear weapon we’re going to draw a line about what makes sense.”
… ON ABORTION: “This is a moral question that’s not going to be settled by science and so the best way for it to be settled in practice is by the person that actually faces the choice and when a woman is facing this decision in her life, I think the – in terms of somebody besides her who can most be useful in that, the answer to that would be a doctor. Not a male government official imposing his interpretation of his religion.”
-- GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS spoke with JAY SEKULOW on ABC’S “THIS WEEK” -- via Matthew Choi: “President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, on Sunday dismissed House Democrats’ request for the president’s tax returns, charging the probe sets a precedent for using the IRS for political purposes. ‘What stops another party from doing the same thing?’ Sekulow said. …
“Sekulow dismissed any notion the request had any policy value and characterized it as weaponizing the president's personal finances. He also pointed out that several House Democrats have not made their taxes public and that it's illegal for Congress to disclose others' tax returns, including public officials, without their consent. ‘The president has not asked for Nancy Pelosi's tax returns,’ Sekulow said, referring the Democratic House speaker from California.” POLITICO
BUCKLE UP … THE NEXT TWO YEARS … AP’S LISA MASCARO: “Senate GOP game plan means more Trump nominees, fewer bills”: “Mitch McConnell says the Senate will be in the ‘personnel business’ this year. But the majority leader’s focus on confirming President Donald Trump’s nominees is coming at the expense of any big legislative priorities.
“Nearly 100 days into the new Congress, the drive to confirm is adding more conservatives to the courts and putting more Trump appointees in government offices. But Trump’s promises to replace the Affordable Care Act, invest in infrastructure or cut middle class taxes have been essentially shelved.
“The result is that the GOP-controlled Senate is on a very different path heading into the 2020 election than is the House, where the Democratic majority is churning out a long list of bills on ethics, gun violence and other topics that, while unlikely to become law, show voters their priorities.” AP
PELOSI INTERVIEW … WAPO’S PAUL KANE: “Pelosi outlines a path to victory for House Democrats in 2020 — and guarantees it”: “Barely three months into her second turn in charge, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already mapped out a plan to overwhelm Republicans in the 2020 elections.
“‘I’m going to have our races won by this November,’ the California Democrat said. Yes, the House speaker predicted that she will have locked down the majority a full year ahead of schedule, leaving the political battlefield to what she considers an intense presidential race all the way up to November 2020.
“It’s a remarkably bold guarantee for Pelosi, who will celebrate this new majority’s 100-day mark at a Democratic retreat next week outside Leesburg. Her caucus has had its share of growing pains in the first quarter of the year, with younger, more-liberal Democrats trying to push Pelosi’s leadership team as far to the left as possible.” WaPo
-- PELOSI made similar remarks about being focused on 2020 to us earlier this week at a Playbook Interview. Look for this to be a new rallying cry for the speaker to raise money and to energize the base.
MEANWHILE … THE WAITING GAME CONTINUES -- “Congress Waits as Barr Blacks Out Parts of Mueller Report,” by NYT’s Charlie Savage
WHAT’S ON PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S MIND -- @realDonaldTrump at 9:50 a.m.: “Looks like Bob Mueller’s team of 13 Trump Haters & Angry Democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the Fake News Media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt & dishonest Mainstream Media, they are a Joke!”
FROM 30,000 FEET -- “Threats From Trump Often Fall Short,” by NYT’s Michael Tackett and Linda Qiu: “For President Trump, a threat is frequently his first impulse. He is forceful, declarative and speaks with unvarnished conviction. He has made the theme of promises made, promises kept the anthem of his re-election effort. But his threats often remain just that. The most recent example was when Mr. Trump backed down from a vow to close the border with Mexico, instead saying he would give one of the United States’ most essential trading partners a year to deal with the migrant crisis. ...
“Here is a look at some of Mr. Trump’s more high-profile threats[:] Closing the border with Mexico ... A bullhorn to Russia ... Telling General Motors to reopen a plant, or else (he would cut subsidies) ... Threats against the media ... Trying to overturn a constitutional right ... California on his mind ... A veiled warning to James B. Comey.” NYT
HMM … WAPO’S HEATHER LONG: “Trump administration nearly doubles H-2B guest visa program, which brings many Mexican workers”: “The Homeland Security and Labor departments plan to grant an additional 30,000 H-2B visas this summer on top of the 33,000 they had already planned to give out, the agencies confirmed.
“The H-2B visa allows foreign workers to come to the United States legally and work for several months at companies such as landscapers, amusement parks or hotels. About 80 percent of these visas went to people from Mexico and Central America last year, government data shows.” WaPo
-- “U.S. says reuniting separated families laborious process,” by AP’s Elliot Spagat in San Diego: “The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year, a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody.
“The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47,000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1, 2017 and June 25, 2018 — the day before U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families. The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation — for example, children under 5.” AP
ABOUT LAST NIGHT … “Trump to Jewish Republicans: Democrats pushing ‘extreme, anti-Semitic agenda,’” by Gabby Orr in Washington and Alex Isenstadt in Las Vegas: “Speaking before a crowd of influential GOP donors and Jewish Republicans, President Donald Trump on Saturday accused Democrats of mistreating Israel and allowing the ‘scourge of anti-Semitism to take root’ in their party. ‘Democrats are advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history,’ Trump said.
“‘If implemented… the Democrats’ radical agenda could very well leave Israel out there all by yourselves.’ In remarks at an annual conference hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, which endorsed Trump in 2016 and has spoken glowingly of his administration during his first two years in office, the president riled up the crowd by tearing down his political opponents one-by-one.” POLITICO
TOP TWEETS -- WAPO’S FELICIA SONOMEZ (@feliciasonmez): “‘Special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota. Oh, I forgot. She doesn’t like Israel. I forgot. I’m so sorry.’ Trump to RJC crowd, singling out Omar one day after a man was arrested for threatening to kill her and calling her a ‘terrorist.’”
… AP’S ZEKE MILLER (@ZekeJMiller): “Trump was greeted at the steps of Air Force One by Steve Wynn, former RNC finance chair who resigned after sexual harassment allegations.”
2020 WATCH -- WAPO’S CHELSEA JANE in West Hollywood: “‘It got real gay real quick’: Pete Buttigieg’s rise electrifies the gay community, but he could face a rocky road”: “Pete Buttigieg was sitting in the back of a black SUV with a couple of staffers, sipping a still-steeping cup of tea to ease the fatigue from his suddenly frenetic schedule, when he looked out the window and interrupted himself.
“‘Man,’ said Buttigieg, taking in the rainbow-hued signs and colorfully dressed passersby that signaled he had entered West Hollywood, Los Angeles’s de facto gay neighborhood. ‘It got real gay real quick out there.’
“Few Democratic presidential candidates could assess their surroundings so bluntly without seeming painfully out of line. But Buttigieg is not like any other Democratic presidential candidate — in part, if not exclusively, because he is gay.” WaPo
-- ELENA SCHNEIDER and MAGGIE SEVERNS: “Gillibrand leans on female donor groups she built over last decade”: “In her first years in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand traveled to major cities across the country to start female-centric donor circles to elevate women in politics, harkening back to her own political awakening as a donor in a male-dominated space.
“Now, the New York Democrat is returning to those groups — some of which now contribute over $1 million to candidates per election — and asking them to help make her the first female president of the United States.” POLITICO
A
-- JAMES ARKIN: “Former Auburn football coach running for Alabama Senate seat”: “Former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville is running for Senate in Alabama as a Republican, he announced Saturday. … Tuberville is joining the race to run against Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won a special election in 2017 and is running for a full term next year.
“Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne is already in the race, and several other Republicans are considering jumping into the primary to challenge Jones, who is viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat on the ballot next year.
“Sean Spicer, President Donald Trump’s former White House communications director, is expected to assist Tuberville with the campaign, according to sources familiar with the budding operation, though a formal role hasn’t been determined yet.” POLITICO
TRUMP’S SUNDAY -- There is nothing on the president’s public schedule today.

MEANWHILE IN ISRAEL ... “Netanyahu vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected,” by AP’s Karin Laub in Jerusalem: “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Saturday to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re-elected, a dramatic policy shift apparently aimed at rallying his nationalist base in the final stretch of the tight race.
“Netanyahu has promoted Jewish settlement expansion in his four terms as prime minister, but until now refrained from presenting a detailed vision for the West Bank, seen by the Palestinians as the heartland of a future state. An Israeli annexation of large parts of the West Bank is bound to snuff out any last flicker of hope for an Israeli-Palestinian deal on the terms of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in 1967.” AP
-- THIS IS A BIG DEAL: This is essentially throwing the two-state solution in the dustbin.
WHAT WALL STREET IS READING -- “How regulators, Republicans and big banks fought for a big increase in lucrative but risky corporate loans,” by WaPo’s Damian Paletta: “Actions by federal regulators and Republicans in Congress over the past two years have paved the way for banks and other financial companies to issue more than $1 trillion in risky corporate loans, sparking fears that Washington and Wall Street are repeating the mistakes made before the financial crisis. The moves undercut policies put in place by banking regulators six years ago that aimed to prevent high-risk lending from once again damaging the economy.
“Now, regulators and even White House officials are struggling to comprehend the scope and potential dangers of the massive pool of credits, known as leveraged loans, they helped create. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and other financial companies have originated these loans to hundreds of cash-strapped companies, many of which could be unable to repay if the economy slows or interest rates rise.” WaPo
BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “Survivors of Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle fear they have been forgotten,” by WaPo’s Patricia Sullivan and Joel Achenbach in Mexico Beach, Fla.: “The stretch of the Florida Panhandle east of Panama City is known as the Forgotten Coast, because it’s so rural and undeveloped — a remnant of a wild, pre-Disney, pre-air-conditioned Florida. ... Government agencies have cleared the roads and utilities have restored power, water and communications, but thousands of people are still desperate for permanent housing, competing not only with one another for the scarce supply of rental units, but with construction workers who have come into the area.
“Many residents are living in damaged homes or trailers unfit for human habitation. Some live in tents. Homeowners are frustrated by stingy insurance companies and bewildering government paperwork, and they’re wary of shady contractors. ... Residents here wonder if their fellow Americans understand their ongoing struggle. Charitable donations flowing into the area have been modest. The American Red Cross calculated that designated donations for Hurricane Michael victims totaled $35 million through the end of March.” WaPo
VALLEY TALK -- “Scheme to Swap Fake iPhones Adds Up to $900,000 Loss for Apple, Prosecutors Say,” by NYT’s Rick Rojas: “The con was simple: Send a fake iPhone to Apple claiming that the device would not turn on and that it was under warranty, and not long after, a genuine replacement arrived in the mail. It was a scheme that federal prosecutors said two college students in Oregon repeated on such a scale that it amounted to nearly $900,000 in losses for Apple as they sent in hundreds of counterfeit phones. The two students, identified as Quan Jiang and Yangyang Zhou, would then ship the iPhones overseas where they would be sold for hundreds of dollars, and in return, they would get a cut of the profit.” NYT
