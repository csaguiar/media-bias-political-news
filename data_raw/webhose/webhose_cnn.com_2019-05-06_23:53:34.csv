(CNN) In a move better befitting an episode of ""Game of Thrones"" than the management of our government, White House senior adviser Stephen Miller is reportedly ushering a "" wholesale decapitation "" of the Department of Homeland Security's leadership.
Elliot Williams This week started with the ouster of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Her having presided over the Trump administration's too-sinister-to-be-true practice of deterring people from coming to the country by separating them from their toddlers clearly was not enough for President Trump and Miller. Her sacking also comes days after the withdrawal of the nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, citing a need to go in a ""tougher direction."" More firings are on the way. Their fate is an object lesson in why we need to get immigration out of DHS and reset how we think and talk about immigration policy in America. Ironically, despite the DHS' role in immigration policy, the agency's mandate goes far beyond immigration. Before using even the word ""immigration,"" Nielsen's resignation letter references ""enemies and adversaries,"" ""cyberspace"" and ""emerging threats from new technologies."" (This is striking, given that even a quick glance at the DHS website could lead most people to wonder whether DHS actually does anything other than immigration.) JUST WATCHED Secret Service head ousted as DHS shakeup continues
Secret Service head ousted as DHS shakeup continues 02:24 All this highlights the enormous problems with how the United States government approaches immigration. By housing most of the agencies that deal with immigration in DHS, the US government wrongly suggests that immigration is exclusively a function of securing the homeland, of keeping the public safe. The President has capitalized on this, spending a tremendous amount of political energy on making immigration about crime and threat. Regardless of the merits of Trump's approach, we have a huge problem with how we approach immigration. Read More For starters, there is no reason that immigration as a government function could not be reconceived and housed in a new standalone Cabinet department. Quick civics lesson: The Constitution lays out very few exclusive powers to the federal government. A number of the jobs it identifies -- ""to raise and support Armies"" and ""to regulate Commerce"" to name two -- are, at least today, overseen by Cabinet secretaries who report directly to the President. None of this is required; in setting up the Departments of Defense and Commerce, Congress made policy choices reflecting how important each of these issues is to our success or failure as a country. Kirstjen Nielsen had the toughest job in the government Congress could do the same when it comes to immigration. Right now, DHS is a behemoth that is impossible for any one person to manage effectively. It was formed in a rush to reform government after 9/11 and resulted in the merger of 22 agencies (among them ICE, which I helped lead for more than four years in the Obama administration) -- overseen by over 100 congressional committees -- that had little to do with each other beyond sharing a loose nexus to public safety. As a result, the secretary of Homeland Security is now responsible for overseeing everything from airport screening to helping Americans recover from tornadoes. This structure benefits nobody. For starters, today, what would happen in the event of another major natural disaster or -- heaven forbid -- major terror attack? The leadership of DHS would certainly have to shift its energy and resources away from addressing immigration crises that aren't going anywhere any time soon. Even under the best of circumstances, nobody should be in the position of having to manage one entity with such a diffuse mandate. Moreover, putting so much on the DHS head's plate only leaves more room for immigration hardliners like Miller to swoop in, dictate our immigration policy , and force us deeper into believing that immigrants represent as grave a threat to the United States as cyberattackers do. JUST WATCHED Ex-ICE head: Trump had 'single dumbest idea I've ever heard'
Ex-ICE head: Trump had 'single dumbest idea I've ever heard' 01:45 Ironically, even the President seems to recognize that we need to reconceive how we approach immigration. His latest solution -- creating a position of ""border czar"" to coordinate government efforts -- necessarily implies that our immigration system could use more tailored leadership. Of course, his proposal is more likely to score him political points than actually fix anything; he has proposed two immigration hard-liners who would further entrench the notion that immigrants make us less safe. But something needs to change. Based on how the system is set up, Nielsen could never have succeeded. She served a President who benefits from instability. Any number of his major actions on immigration -- declaring a national emergency based on border security; threatening to close the border to all traffic from the south; manufacturing support for a border wall we largely don't need -- all fuel a political narrative that we ought to be scared, and that the President can live true to his campaign promise that ""[he] alone can fix it."" No DHS secretary, short of one committed to ending all immigrant border crossings, would ever have satisfied the President. I'm certain that incoming acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, a former colleague of whom I am fond, will not either. When the structure of our government treats immigrants as a threat, government personnel are going to keep being fired for failing to stop all immigration. And immigrants will continue to be vilified. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

It can't happen overnight, but it is time for a major reset. Congress has the power to hold hearings and restructure the system. That process should take into account every aspect of immigration -- its impacts on all labor sectors, on foreign relations, and on our identity as a welcoming nation just to name a few -- and not just on how much immigrants should frighten us."
Obama's 'circular firing squad' remarks may not persuade 2020 Democrats,us.cnn.com,Nayyera Haq,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/obamas-circular-firing-squad-remarks-may-not-persuade-2020-democrats-haq/index.html,"Nayyera Haq is a host on SiriusXM Progress and CEO of an international communications firm.

(CNN) In Berlin, the city famous for once dividing itself in two with a wall, former President Barack Obama tackled the issue of division in politics and his worries for the Democratic Party's future: ""Among progressives in the United States ... is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, 'Uh, I'm sorry, this is how it's going to be.'"" Obama argued, at an Obama Foundation event on Saturday, that party infighting usually leads to the weakening of a movement by ""creating what's called a 'circular firing squad' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.""
Nayyera Haq He's not wrong when it comes to the traditions of governing in a democracy, where, as he put it, you have ""to take into account people who don't agree with you."" Democrats, who represent the party of diversity, have historically been challenged when it came to herding cats in their coalition, even as the public discourse has been one of tolerance for a variety of ways to help working families. But the Democrats' Big Tent is teetering as the party sees its left flank publicly bucking leadership to primary their own seated members. The Twitter takedown — a harsh online reckoning meted out for those who stray from the performance of progressivism — has translated into a very real takedown in the field. The goalposts for campaigning have shifted since Obama's era, leaving the former President and his cohort grappling with a party that might not nominate him today. The purity test Obama references is not an easy points system to navigate. It is one in which your past behavior is always up for scrutiny and weathering the test of time is not a virtue. It's the same system that rallies feminists against both Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Sen. Al Franken, with the former gaining the Supreme Court because Republicans don't hold the same standards, and the latter resigning in disgrace because of criticism from his fellow Democrats. And now this scorecard is being used to ding two people close to Obama — his own former vice president, Joe Biden, who just can't seem to stop touching people and then cracking jokes about it ; and one of Obama's earliest supporters and current aenator, Kamala Harris, whose record as a prosecutor supporting ""three strikes"" laws has called into question her ability to confront racism in the criminal justice system. Read More Being the anti-Trump isn't enough for Democratic candidates The rise of the progressive left is just as much a reaction to Republicans as it is to Obama. The millennials who grew up under Obama don't see the election of a black man to the White House as earth-shattering, it is simply the reality of how they grew up. What millennials do see is crippling student loan debt that prevents them from becoming homeowners , a social safety net they pay into but may be bankrupted by the borrowing of older generations, and incarcerations for weed smoking but not for rape . This cohort has come of political age with the reality of being the first generation that possibly will not out-earn their parents and a wealth gap the likes of which our country hasn't seen since the 1920s. These progressives blame incrementalism — the willingness to compromise around the edges — for their current plight. They see in Obama a president who had the health care policy of Mitt Romney, the foreign policy of John McCain, and the rhetoric of Reagan and still could not get Republicans in Congress to work with him. The next president: the polar opposite of Trump? We can debate what the rise of the tea party has done to the norms of our democracy, but this generation is looking at Republicans as a model for success in achieving core policy objectives: seating judges across the board who will reject any social engineering, passing tax cuts that benefit corporations and the top 1% of the country, limiting women's abortion rights in dozens of states, and implementing draconian immigration policies. While this iteration of the Republican party has made no gains in battles for civility or kindness, it has won the war of changing the landscape of the country. It is no surprise then that progressives are looking to think like Democrats and play like Republicans when it comes to eliminating corporate welfare, changing gender norms, and correcting for systemic racism. This is not the era of the beer summit , where a Democratic leader can respond to a black intellectual elder getting arrested for trying to get into his own house with a diplomatic coming together of both sides. This is the era of ""both-sides-ing"" being The Problem. Lines have been drawn for the 2020 nomination and progressive voters are not looking for compromise; they are looking for the nominee who will take no prisoners. The challenge in following the tea party's example of gaining seats or a nomination is converting enough people to the cause to make governing viable without making millions of people miserable in the process. Tradition holds that an elected official is responsible for representing all of their constituents and governing accordingly; Trumpists have taken the easy way out and thrown those traditions of civil society out the window.

Progressives have an opportunity to be better — to be diplomats and not destroyers — but the work of peace-building and stabilization is much harder than tearing things (and people) down. By holding true to basic principles of equal opportunity and access; by accepting that people don't wake up woke but evolve; by bringing the passion for politics to new voters, Democrats have the opportunity to bring people along with them to implement progressive social change."
Pilots shouldn't have to battle their planes for control (opinion),us.cnn.com,Les Abend,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/opinions/pilots-shouldnt-have-to-battle-their-planes-for-control-abend/index.html,"Les Abend recently retired after 34 years as a Boeing 777 captain for American Airlines. He is a CNN aviation analyst and senior contributor to Flying magazine. are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) For those who remember the original 1973 movie ""Westworld, "" it can seem that the possibility of machines going rogue may be close to reality. Yul Brynner played the robot Gunslinger, who started shooting humans after being infected by some unknown computer virus and suffering a program breakdown.
Les Abend Could a version of such human vs. machine science fiction happen with today's highly technological, automated airplanes? No doubt, the continuing saga of Boeing's 737 Max tragedies has raised such a concern, as it continues to create angst for anyone about to climb aboard a commercial jetliner. After two crashes in five months claimed the lives of 346 people, Boeing acknowledged the role of the 737 Max MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), which automatically lowers the nose to prevent an aerodynamic stall. Boeing has grounded the 737 Max and is cutting the production rate on the plane as the company works to return it to flight. Read More But the nagging question remains: Can I trust that the airplane I am about to fly is not going to override its pilots? Indeed, in some ways the 737 Max seems to have experienced a Westworld-like situation -- although the flaw that overtook the planes was not a computer virus. According to the preliminary accident investigation report , it appears a design flaw contributed to the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March. Let me explain. The larger and more powerful engines of the 737 Max had to be mounted farther forward on the wings. At lower speeds, the airplane has a greater tendency to pitch the nose up when pilots step on the gas. A higher pitch of the nose could potentially lead to an aerodynamic stall, meaning the airplane would no longer have enough lift to fly. JUST WATCHED Foreman: Early report shows plane dove at nearly 600 mph Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Foreman: Early report shows plane dove at nearly 600 mph 01:29 To prevent the airplane from stalling, Boeing designed the MCAS, which pushes the nose down automatically without input from pilots. This system is only active when pilots are hand-flying the airplane. But if MCAS receives a bad signal from a faulty sensor that the airplane is stalling when it's not, the nose keeps pitching toward the ground, overriding the pilot's input to do otherwise. Unfortunately, it only takes one faulty sensor to activate the system, and that's a major problem. This is unprecedented for Boeing. I have flown this manufacturer's airplanes for over three decades; their systems (electrical, hydraulics, etc.) always have at least one additional backup in case of failure. And none of the systems take complete control away from pilots. We call it redundancy in the airline world. Now it appears that before the Ethiopian Airlines crash , the pilots tried to rectify the erroneous activation of the MCAS with a checklist procedure that Boeing had recommended to all airlines after investigators found that the Lion Air crash was caused by similar circumstances back in October. But the checklist procedure failed to save the airplane, a contention I made early in the field investigation . In my opinion, fixing this catastrophic flaw will require not only a software update to revise how MCAS reacts, but also a hardware update to correct the lack of redundancy when only one faulty sensor can cause such tragedy.

Former NTSB official on final actions of pilots before Boeing plane crashed 02:27 Getting back to the original question of whether pilots will henceforth have to battle modern-day airplanes and their automated systems for control: The answer should be a resounding no. Although manufacturers have different philosophies, airplanes are designed to work with pilots, not against them. That said, the systems have to be designed properly: If they fail, pilots always must have the capability to safely land the plane without the automation. For the past couple of decades, my colleagues have often discussed whether automation degrades basic pilot skills. To be sure, automation has become increasingly reliable, and pilots have grown increasingly dependent on automation features because they are incorporated into standard airline operations. After a long red-eye, for example, many older and more experienced pilots find it safer to use the autopilot for the approach rather than hand-flying the airplane all the way to touchdown on the runway. Additionally, aspiring airline pilots are training with flight schools at unprecedented rates , and students may be funneled quickly to major airlines. The training is intense and usually specific to modern-day, automated cockpit technology. It's a necessary part of the learning process, but it only affords a relatively short period to focus on basic flying skills. Once the pilot trainee reaches the minimum threshold qualifications required by the airline, she or he can work as a co-pilot on a regional jet, becoming more immersed in the world of cockpit automation.

Former analyst says Boeing mandate made him uncomfortable 01:43 It should be incumbent upon the airline to design training that allows pilots the opportunity to maintain proficiency in hands-on flying. Some airlines have already incorporated such training into their recurrent curriculums. For example, before I retired from my airline last year, my last three recurrent training sessions in the 777 simulator involved a scenario of taking off, flying a visual traffic pattern, and landing back on the runway with no automation aids, no auto throttles, and no autopilot -- similar to the practice I performed as a student pilot in small airplanes. Although seemingly simple, the scenario involves basic flying skills that every pilot should practice. Regardless, we have to maintain the highest standards in safety, but accept the fact humans design these machines. And humans make mistakes, whether they are pilots or aeroengineers. Let's allow the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing time to ensure that the 737 Max can be flown safely. In the meantime, rest assured that your pilots are not in a perpetual struggle of man versus machine."

"Children who live near major roads are more likely to have developmental delays, study says",us.cnn.com,Susan Scutti,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/highways-children-cognition-study/index.html,"(CNN) Highways often cause parents to worry about their children's physical safety, yet there may be other important concerns. Young children who live near a major roadway are twice as likely to score lower on tests of communications skills than those who live farther away, new research indicates.
""We know that living close to major roadways -- interstate highways or state highways -- is associated with high air pollution,"" said Sandie Ha , lead author of the study and an associate professor in the Department of Public Health at the University of California, Merced. Research has shown that children who lived near a major roadway at birth had lower nonverbal IQ, verbal IQ and visual motor abilities in mid-childhood compared to their peers living farther away. Because many children live near major roadways -- estimates suggest that 30% to 45% of people residing in large North American cities live within 0.3 miles of a highway or a major road -- Ha and her colleagues wanted to learn more about links to childhood development. Prenatal exposure to air pollution linked to autism risk, study says Their analysis included more than 5,000 children who underwent repeated screening with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire , an evaluation of five areas of development: fine motor skills, large motor skills, communication, personal social functioning and problem-solving ability. Along with measuring proximity to major interstate and state highways -- not local, neighborhood or rural roads -- the researchers estimated each child's exposure to ozone and fine inhalable particles (PM2.5), two pollutants produced by car traffic. Ozone can affect the lungs, causing the muscles in the airways to constrict. Fine inhalable particles , which are 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair, cause lung irritation and in some cases lead to respiratory and heart problems. Read More About 23% of the children (1,329 kids) failed any of the five domains tested by the questionnaire, the analysis showed. Psychosis in teens may be linked to an unlikely culprit: air pollution ""We found that living closer to a major roadway such as an interstate highway or a state highway is associated with almost two times the risk of having a communication delay by the time the baby is 3 years old,"" Ha said. ""Closer"" was defined as less than 500 meters (about 0.3 miles or half a kilometer), compared with those living more than a kilometer (or 0.6 miles) from a major roadway, she explained. ""We also found that exposure to high concentration of air pollution, especially ozone, during pregnancy as well as during early life is also associated with the risk of having any developmental delay,"" Ha said. The research, published Monday in the journal Environmental Research, did not show cause and effect. Prenatal exposures to elevated levels of PM2.5 led to a possible 3.2% higher risk of failing any developmental testing domain, while higher-than-usual ozone exposure led to a possible 1.7% higher risk of failing a domain. Slashing fossil fuel use could save millions of lives at risk due to air pollution, study says ""It seems that the postnatal exposure is even more important than the exposure during pregnancy,"" Ha said. Babies exposed to higher concentrations of ozone had about a 3.3% higher risk of failing any domain of the developmental screening at 8 months, a 17.7 % higher risk of overall screening failure at 24 months and a 7.6% higher risk of overall screening failure at 30 months. ""We are not sure why that's the case,"" she said. She and her co-authors speculate that once the baby is born, air pollution is no longer filtered through the mother's superior defense mechanisms. ""This study didn't specifically measure that, so we cannot say why, and I'm really interested in the why part,"" Ha added. What remains to be answered is: How does air traffic pollution produce developmental delays? More research is needed, she said. Because the study was conducted in upstate New York, which has relatively low air pollution, Ha wonders whether the effects would be stronger if the same research were conducted in areas of the country with higher pollution levels, such as central California. Due to wildfires, California now has the most polluted cities in the world Breda Cullen, a lecturer in the Institute of Health and Wellbeing at the University of Glasgow, said the strengths of the study include the large number of participants and the use of different types of exposure data (both proximity to a major road and measures of pollutants). However, Cullen, who was not involved in the research, added that the authors did not account for all of the sociodemographic factors that may influence child development. ""Had they been able to take these into account, the strength of the association between road proximity and child development is likely to have reduced,"" she wrote in an email. Because pollution exposures for most kids are, at worst, not far from average, the measurements used by the researchers more or less inflate the appearance of a small risk increase, she explained: ""Even the tiny risk increases they report would only be observed in participants at the most extreme end of the exposure spectrum."" In her own research, Cullen has found that higher exposure to outdoor particulate matter and nitrogen oxide gases was associated with very small reductions in performance on tests of reaction time and memory among middle-age and older adults.
Traffic intensity in cities means pollution there may be similar in ways to pollution found near a major road outside the ciy. Still there are differences, Cullen said: ""They are not interchangeable, however, because cities tend to have many other sources of air pollution in addition to road traffic."" Other sources of pollution include waste incineration and tobacco smoke. Ultimately, the increases in risk reported in the new study are ""extremely small,"" Cullen said. Even so, Ha said, ""given that the proportion of people exposed to this risk factor is large, it is very important to do something about it."""

He said he hopes there are people around the President telling him ""that's not going to be politically palatable in the United States."" He added, ""it's just frankly un-American."" CNN's Jake Tapper reported earlier on Monday that the President has been pushing to reinstate broader family separation policies. Read More Trump wanted families separated at the border even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers, according to multiple sources. The President thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming to the border, and wanted families separated even if they were apprehended within the US. Now-ousted Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tried to explain to Trump they could not bring the policy back because of court challenges, sources told CNN. White House staffers tried to explain it would be an unmitigated PR disaster. ""He just wants to separate families,"" a senior administration official told CNN."
May to ask Merkel and Macron for Brexit extension - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Nadine Schmidt, Saskya Vandoorne",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/uk/uk-brexit-bill-theresa-may-intl-gbr/index.html,"(CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, as the UK leader prepares to request another Brexit extension from the European Union.
EU leaders will meet Wednesday to discuss May's request to move the Brexit deadline, which is set for Friday, April 12. UK lawmakers finally approved a Brexit bill late Monday after weeks of failing to reach agreement on May's proposals or any of the alternative models of leaving the EU. The bill , which received royal assent and is now law, aims to block a no-deal Brexit, whereby the UK crashes out of the EU without any transition arrangements in place.

""We are committed to finding a way through in order to ensure we can leave the EU and deliver on the referendum. That will require the parties to work at pace in order to address outstanding issues -- and so ministers and their shadow counterparts will be holding talks (Tuesday),"" a spokesman for 10 Downing Street said. With May seeking another extension, the UK government has started laying groundwork to enable it to participate in European Parliament elections next month , should it still find itself in the EU by the time the vote takes place. The move signals a possibility that Brexit could be delayed beyond the May 23 election date -- almost three years after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the EU."
Allison Mack pleads guilty to charges relating to sex trafficking case,us.cnn.com,Sandra Gonzalez,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/entertainment/allison-mack-guilty-plea/index.html,"(CNN) Actress Allison Mack has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and racketeering relating to her alleged role in a sex trafficking case.
John Marzulli, Public Information Officer for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York confirmed Mack's plea, which was entered Monday. As part of her guilty plea, Mack admitted to state law extortion and forced labor. Attorneys for Mack did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mack was arrested in April 2018 and charged for her alleged involvement with an organization called Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ium), a group that claimed to be a self-help program but was, in reality, a pyramid scheme in which some recruits were exploited ""both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants' benefit,"" according to U.S. attorney Richard P. Donoghue. Read More Mack is accused of recruiting women to join what she told them was a female mentorship group when, in fact, it was an organization created and led by Nxivm's founder, Keith Raniere, also known within the group as Vanguard. Last year, Mack, best known for her role as Clark Kent's clever confidant Chloe on CW's ""Smallville,"" was indicted on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy, according to a statement released by the Justice Department. She pleaded not guilty at the time. Officials said Mack, 36, was the co-creator of a program within Nxivm, which was targeted toward actors. What happened to Allison Mack? Mack's charges stemmed from what officials said were activities that took place as part of a secret society within Nxivm called ""DOS,"" in which women recruited and groomed others under false pretenses to be sexual partners for Raniere, according to an indictment. Several women, whose identities were withheld in court papers, claim they were blackmailed into complying and told DOS had compromising information about them. Raniere was the sole male in DOS and the leader. He has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and forced labor charges. Until women recruited others, they were called ""slaves."" Those who successfully recruited were called ""masters."" The indictment released last year claimed many so-called slaves were branded on their pelvic areas using a cauterizing pen with a symbol which, unbeknownst to them, incorporated Raniere's initials. Mack was released on a $5 million bond days after her arrest last year. Marzulli and Mack's attorneys did not respond to CNN's questions regarding whether Mack's plea was entered as part of a deal with prosecutors. Mack faces a maximum of 40 years in prison -- 20 years on each count. She is set to be sentenced on September 11, 2019."

On Monday AMC announced a forthcoming new series in the zombie-infested universe, set to debut in 2020. The still untitled series will begin production on a ten-episode season this summer in Virginia, the network said. ""We're thrilled that the Dead will keep walking into a new corner of the post-apocalyptic world, a corner that will present stories and characters unlike any that The Walking Dead has dramatized thus far, and that is bound to excite one of the most passionate fanbases in television,"" said David Madden, president of programming for AMC Networks and AMC Studios.

Though both the original and the spin-off series have dwindled in ratings since their peaks, the addition of a new shows to the franchise indicates AMC still sees more life zombies. This new story, from Scott M. Gimple and Matt Negrete, who will serve as showrunner, will feature two young female protagonists and ""focus on the first generation to come-of-age in the apocalypse as we know it,"" according to a release.

'Fosse/Verdon' choreographs FX's latest look at old Hollywood,us.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/entertainment/fosse-verdon-review/index.html,"(CNN) If concept and casting are half the battle, ""Fosse/Verdon"" earns a curtain call before the overture. Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams play director Bob Fosse and star Gwen Verdon, whose tumultuous relationship and partnership provides another delicious window into what amounts to an FX niche chronicling the big personalities of old Hollywood.
The allure of the subject matter is surely helpful, since this handsomely produced eight-part series -- which counts Lin-Manuel Miranda and daughter Nicole Fosse among its many producers -- gets off to a slow start, choreographing the story out of sequence, in a manner that's initially as disorienting as some of those scenes in ""All That Jazz."" Stick with it, though, and this limited series provides not only a fascinating snapshot of its time but of the unique qualities of the central duo's relationship, with Fosse wooing Verdon, cheating on her and divorcing her, but never losing his reliance upon her as a creative muse and confidant. The depth of that interaction proves vital, since Fosse alone represents a virtual cliché in terms of a tortured artist -- someone who can't sit through the premiere of ""Cabaret,"" his breakthrough film, muttering, ""All I see is the s**t I should have fixed."" Through quick-cut flashbacks, there are glimpses of Fosse as a performer, someone who dreamed of becoming Fred Astaire. He instead became a choreographer and director, meeting Verdon while devising her routines for ""Damn Yankees,"" after she won her first Tony Award. Read More Both were with other people at the time, a foreshadowing of things to come. In a way, though, ""Fosse/Verdon"" doesn't really begin to find its footing until the second and third episodes, proceeding to provide glimpses of their early lives, hardships and sacrifices that provide significant context. Until then, students of the era can simply enjoy the parade of stellar characters that pass through their orbit, in what feels like a fitting follow-up to FX's ""Feud: Bette and Joan."" Like that Hollywood yarn, this one is a virtual master class of name-dropping. The playbill includes writers Paddy Chayefsky (Norbert Leo Butz) and Neil Simon (Nate Corddry) along with Simon's wife Joan (Aya Cash), all of whom marvel at how Fosse can't seem to enjoy his success. There is also the spectacle of Fosse brazenly bedding actresses who are working for him, luring them to his place with transparent invitations to come watch a rough cut of his TV special. Those who balk risk losing roles, a demonstration of the way the casting couch openly operated during his heyday. Both Fosse and Verdon were titans on their own, but they clearly needed each other, even if they frequently appeared to be ""in competition,"" as one of their friends observes. In terms of the performances, it's a somewhat easier lift for Rockwell, a master of playing unlikable characters with roguish qualities, than Williams, who wrestles with Verdon's distinctive voice -- an element that serves as a bit of a distraction before settling into a deeper portrait. One device employed in ""Fosse/Verdon"" involves chyrons that refer to how much time -- years, days -- is ""left,"" without identifying specifically to what the chyron refers. It's a way of signaling, as the narrative flits about, the time the two had, while the greatest virtue in this limited series involves shining a spotlight on what they accomplished with it. ""Fosse/Verdon"" premieres April 9 at 10 p.m. on FX."

Israeli elections pit Netanyahu against Benny Gantz of the new Blue and White. - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Andrew Carey, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/middleeast/israel-elections-explainer-intl/index.html,"Jerusalem (CNN) Israelis are voting in a closely watched general election on Tuesday, seen here as a referendum on Benjamin Netanyahu.
On March 31, Netanyahu marked ten uninterrupted years as Israel's Prime Minister, in addition to the three years he led the country in the 1990s, and there is little doubt that he's won a place in the A-list of world leaders; for a man leading a country of fewer than nine million people , his clout and recognition are a remarkable achievement. But at home he has become a highly polarizing figure, inspiring devotion and revulsion in equal measure. Netanyahu has fought this election in the face of looming indictments for bribery and breach of trust offences. The Attorney General has called him for one final hearing before he decides whether or not to bring charges. Unbowed, Netanyahu has denied the charges and sought to turn these criminal investigations to his advantage, portraying them as a witch-hunt, led by a left-wing media elite. Trump backs Netanyahu, but will voters? Your guide to Israel's elections As CNN discovered when it visited a stronghold of his party Likud, in the desert town of Beersheva several weeks ago, that message resonates strongly with many blue-collar Israelis. The local Likud organizer in the town compared Netanyahu to Moses, saying, ""The more they go after him, the stronger he becomes."" Another key component of Netanyahu's campaign has been exploiting his status as a world statesman, with close ties to both the President of the United States and the President of Russia, both of whom have been quite ready to do him favors in recent weeks. On a visit to Washington, Donald Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in defiance of overwhelming international consensus. This on top of earlier Trump decisions to switch the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal. Read More Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu votes on Tuesday. Just days before the election, on a visit to Moscow, Netanyahu was able to personally thank Vladimir Putin for Russia's key role in locating the body of an Israeli soldier who had been missing in Lebanon for nearly 37 years. Even Netanyahu's critics have been forced to acknowledge that the Israeli leader's relationship with Putin has been remarkably fruitful, allowing the Israeli military considerable freedom to operate against Iranian targets in Syria, which Netanyahu always cites as Israel's number one security consideration. The election was called in December, ostensibly after the government gave up on efforts to get a new military draft law through Parliament. It seems clear that Netanyahu believed the timing was right—sending voters to polls before any indictments were brought against him, and with a message he could sell to the electorate. Speaking to his Likud lawmakers on the day the election was called he said the outgoing government had ""outstanding achievements"" on which to campaign. Benny Gantz and his wife, Revital, cast thier ballot at a polling station in Rosh Ha'ayin. At first facing a diverse array of opponents, Netanyahu saw his challenge crystalize after a dramatic announcement in February, which saw three former army chiefs come together with a former TV news anchor-turned-politician to create the Blue and White party. The name was simple but significant. Blue and White are the colors of the Israeli flag. The message was equally simple: Blue and White had been created to reclaim the state of Israel from Prime Minister Netanyahu. The man who would lead that campaign and present himself as the anti-Netanyahu candidate was Benny Gantz, a former head of the army, who had held that position under Netanyahu, fighting two wars in Gaza during his tenure. How Israel's political debate moved from peace talks to annexation Gantz's entry into the political arena had been widely anticipated, and, indeed, hoped for in many quarters. Blue and White's polling numbers quickly surged, turning it into a two-horse race. The campaign was hard and personal. After it emerged that Iran had allegedly hacked Gantz's phone, Netanyahu questioned whether he could be trusted to keep the country safe if he couldn't look after his phone. Netanyahu loyalists also suggested Gantz had abandoned a dying soldier after an attack many years ago in the West Bank town of Nablus. Blue and White rejected the slur, Gantz was also cleared by an IDF inquiry. For his part, the Prime Minister announced he intended to sue Gantz and his key ally, Moshe Ya'alon, after the latter suggested Netanyahu could be guilty of treason in connection with an investigation into military procurement. As the election entered its final days, most polls showed Gantz with a slim lead over his rival. But the same polls suggested that Netanyahu's route to building a successful coalition would be more straightforward, due to the large number of other right-wing parties projected to win seats. Indeed, the projected success of several hard-right parties could be a key outcome of this election. Israel's election is a race to the right Netanyahu's final campaign move involved a series of major TV interviews in which he chose to push the issue of annexation of the West Bank. If re-elected, Netanyahu told one interviewer, ""I am going to apply Israeli sovereignty to the settlements. And I don't differentiate between the settlement blocs and the isolated settlements,"" a reference to three areas of the West Bank where most Israeli settlements are located, known as the blocs, and other, smaller settlements scattered across the territory. Any such move would be highly controversial. The international community regards the West Bank as occupied Palestinian land and remains committed to the eventual establishment there of a Palestinian state. Gantz called Netanyahu's remarks 'irresponsible' electioneering and said that as Prime Minister he would not make any unilateral moves in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

Shoppers can then grab a coffee or snack at one of Habitat's restaurants while their goods are scanned and packed. When the groceries are ready, they get a notification on their app and then head to a pickup area where a small robot retrieves a locker containing their bags. Shoppers can also order groceries at the store online and have them delivered to their homes. Amazon's grocery plans go way beyond Whole Foods ""We use phones to track, we use tech to make shopping easier, we use as much data as possible to make [our] inventory smarter,"" Honestbee co-founder Joel Sng said. ""To be honest, any store should be doing that."" Read More Honestbee is the latest tech company to try to upend the traditional retail experience , especially in food and groceries. It's facing increasing competition from Amazon ( AMZN ) in Singapore, and Alibaba-owned e-commerce platform Lazada across Southeast Asia. They're all competing for Asia's growing online grocery sales, which are set to hit $176 billion by 2022, up a whopping 194% since 2017, according to market research firm IGD. Habitat could help grow Honestbee's brand and attract new users, according to Shirley Zhu, a Singapore-based analyst with IGD. Zhu said Habitat has drawn comparisons to Alibaba's Hema stores in China, known as Fresh Hippo in English. Hema is also cashless and shoppers can scan and pay for goods with their phones, or they can order groceries online and have them delivered. ""If you look at Hema's success, it has relied on consumers understanding [the retail concept], and the ability to acquire new customers at low cost,"" she said. Habitat's cashless, automated checkout. More than 400,000 people visited the Habitat store in Singapore in its first three months, according to Sng. About 85% of them bought something and ""a good portion continue to make transactions today,"" he said. ""It also reactivated old customers that might have forgotten about us,"" he added. Honestbee plans to open a second Habitat store outside of Singapore by the end of the year, though Sng declined to say where. Alibaba's Lazada has also reportedly been experimenting with physical stores . The company has a strong grocery distribution network throughout Southeast Asia, and it has support from Alibaba's network of businesses and affiliates. Singapore gets its first 'zero energy' new building ""For Honestbee and Habitat, the direct competition will be Alibaba's Lazada,"" Zhu said. ""Habitat is a newcomer in the space, and if they compete with online players and supermarkets, it's going to be a really tough battle for them,"" she added. Honestbee operates in eight countries across Asia. Its online shopping app usually relies on partnerships with local grocery chains and 20,000 part-time employees to fulfill orders. The startup secured $15 million in 2015 from a handful of investors, among them Silicon Valley venture capitalist Formation 8, and some former Facebook ( FB ) and YouTube executives. The company declined to comment on how much money it has raised since then, and wouldn't disclose its current valuation."
The law or the President: The Trump appointees' dilemma - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Stephen Collinson,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-kirstjen-nielsen-immigration/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sooner or later, many of the President's subordinates face the same dilemma.
They can respect the law or they can work for Donald Trump. It's often just not possible to do both. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen became the latest Cabinet member to pay the price for not letting Trump do what he wants -- and on the issue he cares about more than any other -- when she was forced to resign on Sunday. It was a case of the Trump revolution eating one of its own, since Nielsen, an immigration hardliner, was seen as insufficiently doctrinaire despite becoming the face of the zero-tolerance immigration policy that led to child separations and caused outrage last year. But CNN reporting makes clear that Nielsen also lost her job because she ultimately came to believe that Trump's wilder impulses on immigration -- an issue that he sees as critical to his reelection in 2020 -- threatened America's security and may have run contrary to the law. Read More Nielsen is not the first senior Cabinet official to lose their career after coming up against Trump's vision of his own authority -- or his instinct to elevate largely unaccountable appointees, such as domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller or his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. In their own ways, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former FBI Director James Comey and even former Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- the spiritual father of much of the administration's immigration policy -- suffered a similar fate. Unlike the President, these public servants eventually concluded that the Constitution, the rule of law and the norms of democratic governance rendered some of Trump's behavior unacceptable. Nielsen's departure, which was accompanied by a White House sweep against her department that also accounted for the director of the Secret Service, sends a signal that Trump is ready to do whatever it takes to stem the crisis on the US-Mexico border, which is threatening to expose his vows to stem the flows of migrants from Central America as hollow. That will be welcome news for Trump's supporters, who relish his bypassing of the Washington establishment and overwhelmingly back his hard line on immigration and warnings that the US is under siege by an invading tide of criminals. But the President's desire to honor the faith of his base on immigration eventually made Nielsen's position untenable. Crossing legal lines Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants CNN's Jake Tapper reported on a series of clashes leading up to Nielsen's ouster on Sunday that reveal a President demanding obeisance to his orders, even if they cross legal lines. A ""ranting and raving"" Trump demanded the closure of the US-Mexico border at El Paso,Texas, in late March, despite being told by Nielsen it was a dangerous idea, according to an attendee at a White House meeting. Trump has also been pushing to reinstate and escalate the separations of undocumented migrant parents and children at the border, despite the practice being outlawed by the courts and causing bipartisan and international outrage. The newly purged Department of Homeland Security may well embark on a policy that has been discussed for months that would give migrants at the border a tough decision to make: Remain united as a family in detention or agree to be separated while the parents go through the immigration court process, a senior administration official told CNN's Jim Acosta. The President also told border agents last week not to let any more asylum seekers into the country, forcing officials to quietly countermand his instructions after he had left the room, Tapper reported. CNN also reported Monday that Trump is regretting his climb down on a vow to slam shut the southern border -- despite being warned that it could trigger an economic disaster for many Americans. As the final days of Nielsen's tenure were unfolding, it was Miller, perhaps the only top political figure to the right of Trump on immigration, who engineered a sweep to topple the top leadership in Nielsen's department. Miller is now in charge of all immigration and border-related issues, according to CNN's Abby Phillip. His rise is just one front in a widening war between Trump's inner circle and the infrastructure of permanent government that the President has vowed to disrupt. Trump has in recent months removed irritating checks on his power from the Defense Department and the Justice Department. Defense Secretary James Mattis left after being surprised by Trump's shock announcement of a Syria troop withdrawal, after being seen as an ""adult in the room"" for much of the first two years of the President's term. Trump's rhetorical assault on the Federal Reserve is now being stiffened with an attempt to put true believers, such as Stephen Moore and Herman Cain on its board, raising doubts about the independence of the world's most powerful central bank. On Tuesday, another key figure in Trump's power shuffle will face scrutiny on Capitol Hill. Democratic lawmakers are likely to question Attorney General William Barr over claims that he was appointed solely because he had written a memo to the Justice Department arguing that special counsel Robert Mueller's obstruction case was legally flawed. In office, and once Mueller ended his investigation last month, Barr wrote to Congress to say the special counsel had not reached a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice -- but that Barr and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had decided there was not sufficient evidence to support such a claim. Barr has yet to release the full report so that members of Congress can make up their own minds. 'Acting' secretaries bolster Trump's power How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen Elsewhere in Trump's government, a Cabinet stocked with acting secretaries in key positions -- who in many cases lack relevant experience, authority or an independent power base -- seem ill prepared to resist the President. ""I sort of like 'acting,'"" Trump told reporters earlier this year, not hiding the attraction of the departure of Cabinet heavyweights. ""It gives me more flexibility."" The turmoil in the administration appears to be about more than Trump's effort to consolidate maximum power for himself. Nielsen's departure, like that of other prominent figures from the Cabinet, also appeared to have been driven by a desire to eradicate any voices that the President does not want to hear. One of the benefits enjoyed by the global dictators Trump admires so much is they do not have to put up with dissent. In the democratic context of the US government, the President now appears to be trying to create a similar echo chamber for himself. Chilling words with an authoritarian lineage such as staff ""purge"" and ""unhinged"" are now being uttered by officials who have spoken to CNN to describe Trump's attitude toward the government and his current mood. According to multiple reports, Nielsen was frequently put in the position of trying to explain to the President that his radical urges on immigration were dangerous, impossible or unlawful. In addition to CNN's reporting, The New York Times wrote that Trump used to call Nielsen in the mornings to demand actions that were ""clearly illegal,"" such as halting all asylum claims. Nielsen is now among other former Trump appointees who discovered that the President's radical beliefs and vision of how to wield his power come up against legal or ethical constraints. Tillerson, for instance, said last year that he often had to stop Trump from trampling boundaries. ""So often, the President would say, 'Here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it,'"" Tillerson told former CBS anchor Bob Schieffer. ""And I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law. It violates treaty,'"" Tillerson said. Comey testified to Congress that he felt uncomfortable when Trump tried to establish a ""patronage relationship"" with him in violation of the invisible wall between the presidency and the Justice Department and asked him to go easy on his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The President frequently railed against Sessions because Sessions followed his legal obligations and recused himself from the Russia investigation. And Kelly said his job often involved explaining to Trump the limits of his authority under the law. But the President never ordered him to do anything illegal, Kelly told the Los Angeles Times in an interview."
"Uber didn't do enough to warn women about series of rapes by fake Uber drivers in LA, lawsuit alleges - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Sara O'Brien,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/uber-fake-driver-scheme-lawsuit/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Nine people were sexually assaulted by ""fake Uber drivers"" between September 2016 and February 2018 in Los Angeles, a new lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit is being brought by three of the individuals, all listed as Jane Does, who claim they were raped by individuals who posed as Uber drivers to pick up passengers. It was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday. The Jane Does are accusing Uber of negligence, arguing the company failed to warn them and other customers about fake drivers targeting women who were drinking in the area, despite being allegedly warned by law enforcement, according to the complaint. The suit comes more than a week after University of South Carolina student Samantha Josephson was kidnapped and killed when she got into a vehicle she mistakenly thought was the Uber she ordered. According to the complaint, law enforcement warned Uber on at least five occasions of assaults by fake Uber drivers within a section of Los Angeles where several popular nightclubs are located. The lawsuit claims the warnings came from the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and took place before the first Jane Doe was allegedly raped on June 18, 2017. Read More The LAPD declined to comment to CNN Business, and the LASD could not be reached for comment. F. Edie Mermelstein, who is representing the plaintiffs, also declined to comment. Stressed out and at risk: Inside Uber's special investigations unit Uber told CNN Business it had not yet seen a copy of the lawsuit and so could not comment on it specifically, but an Uber spokesperson said in a statement, ""We have been working with local law enforcement, including the LAPD, to educate the public about how to avoid fake rideshare drivers for several years. In 2017, we launched a national campaign to remind riders to make sure they get in the right car by checking the information, like the license plate and car make and model, shown in the app. These important reminders have been part of our safety tips, and our law enforcement team regularly discusses this issue with agencies across the country."" The lawsuit claims Uber has ""egregiously chosen to hide and minimize"" its safety problems, which often concern ""young, intoxicated female passengers, the very demographic targeted by Uber's safety marketing campaigns."" The new lawsuit alleges that Uber makes it easy for sexual predators to obtain ""print at home"" Uber labels to deceive passengers. Uber offers a printable version of the Uber logo for drivers who want to print one themselves and place it in their window — no login is required to download the file. The lawsuit also claims the company has not adequately warned passengers of the dangers of fake Uber drivers, including the recent murder of Josephson in South Carolina. In the aftermath of Josephson's death, there's been a flurry of attention to safety features built into the Uber app that customers can rely on to double-check the name, pictures and license plates of vehicles before they get in. These measures are inadequate, the Jane Does allege in the lawsuit. ""Uber Defendants fail to take into consideration that the customer they market to are typically inebriated causing enhanced difficulty in using this 'matching system,'"" the suit reads. The company could do more to help inebriated passengers verify who their drivers are, the lawsuit alleges. Uber, which is expected to go public later this year, has ""placed profits over safety by deliberately failing to implement any warning system regarding this sexual assault scheme so as to rapidly expand its profits and not deter any potential users,"" the lawsuit says. A CNN investigation, published and aired in April 2018, found 103 Uber drivers in the US who were accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in the four years prior. CNN's analysis was the result of an in-depth review of police reports, federal court records and county court databases for 20 major US cities. CNN investigation: 103 Uber drivers accused of sexual assault or abuse For more than a year, CNN has been pushing Uber to reveal its data on allegations of sexual abuse and assault on its platform. Uber, which vowed to release a safety transparency report following the CNN investigation, has said the numbers will not be ready until sometime in 2019. After CNN began asking questions about sexual assaults, Uber announced increased safety measures including a partnership with RapidSOS. It added an emergency button in the Uber app that sends a rider's location and relevant information to a police agency when pressed. Uber also revamped its background check policy, and now conducts annual checks on drivers. Following CNN's investigation, Uber announced it would do away with a policy that previously forced individuals with sexual assault complaints into arbitration and made them sign non-disclosure agreements."
Burger King NZ removes 'ignorant' chopsticks ad,edition.cnn.com,Julia Hollingsworth,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/nz-burger-king-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Burger King in New Zealand has removed an advertisement showing diners eating burgers with oversized chopsticks after a social media backlash.

On Tuesday, there was no sign of it on Burger King New Zealand's Instagram, Twitter or Facebook pages -- although the burger was still on the menu on the company's website. A Burger King spokeswoman told CNN that the company had asked its franchisee in New Zealand to remove the ad immediately.

Justine Ruszczyk killing: Opening statements Tuesday for former Minneapolis officer,edition.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/minneapolis-police-noor-shooting-trial/index.html,"(CNN) Opening statements are scheduled to be given Tuesday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer accused of fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk, an Australian-born woman killed a month before her wedding.
Mohamed Noor, a 33-year-old Somali American, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the 2017 shooting that led to protests in the city and the resignation of the Minneapolis police chief. Jury selection began a week ago. A jury of 10 men and 2 women was seated Monday morning, CNN affiliate WCCO reported . There are four alternates, two men and two women. Authorities said Ruszczyk called 911 on July 15, 2017, and reported a possible sexual assault in an alley behind her house. Officers Matthew Harrity and Noor were dispatched to the scene and arrived at 11:37 p.m., according to a criminal complaint. At 11:40 p.m., Ruszczyk was shot in the abdomen and died minutes later at the scene. Harrity told investigators he heard a noise and was startled by a glimpse of a person coming up to the car, the complaint states . Prosecutors said Noor, sitting in the passenger seat, pulled out his gun and shot across the vehicle to hit Ruszczyk, who was outside the driver's side door. Read More Former Minneapolis officer to stand trial in Justine Ruszczyk's death In announcing the charges, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Noor acted recklessly. ""In the short time between when Ms. Damond Ruszczyk approached the squad car and the time that he fired the fatal shot, there is no evidence that Officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat, or confirmed a threat that justified the decision to use deadly force,"" Freeman said . The officers were wearing body cameras but did not turn them on before the shooting, and the squad car camera did not capture the incident, investigators said. The Minneapolis Police Department has since updated its body camera policy to direct officers to turn on their body cameras upon being dispatched to a scene. As with many cases involving police shootings, the trial is likely to revolve less around who carried out the shooting than on whether it was a legally justified use of force. Harrity has identified Noor as the shooter, and testing of the bullet determined it was fired from Noor's gun, the complaint states. In general, officers on trial for shootings are rarely convicted, partly because jurors tend to give police the benefit of the doubt, experts say . A former East Pittsburgh police officer was recently found not guilty in the fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager. Ruszczyk had traveled from her native Australia to Minneapolis to live with her fiancé, and she was killed a month before her planned wedding. She had trained as a veterinarian but then became a spiritual healer, yoga and meditation instructor and life coach, she said on her web page. Shooting victim Justine Ruszczyk had planned to marry fiancé Don Damond in August. Noor came to the United States at a young age and became the first Somali American assigned to the Fifth Precinct, which covers Southwest Minneapolis. He joined the Minneapolis Police Department in March 2015 . He expressed condolences to Ruszczyk's family in a statement through his lawyer shortly after the shooting. ""He takes these events very seriously because, for him, being a police officer is a calling,"" the statement said. ""He joined the police force to serve the community and to protect the people he serves. Officer Noor is a caring person with a family he loves and he empathizes with the loss others are experiencing."""

They had been additionally sentenced to 2 years of further imprisonment below the Tanzanian Wildlife Protection Act, which they will convert to a positive equal to twice the worth of ivory. which they’re accused of smuggling. The authorities estimate this worth at $ 12.9 million.
The defendants have already appealed, the court docket stated.
The director of Tanzania's legal prosecution accused Yang of main a complicated provide chain between East Africa and China, utilizing his ties with the Chinese elite. and Tanzanian to maneuver ivory around the globe. Yang was arrested in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania 's largest metropolis, on September 28, 2015, after a manhunt lasting one 12 months.
After greater than three years of uncertainty and delays in the case, conservation organizations say the sentence sends a powerful message to traffickers.
""Government takes wildlife trafficking very seriously,"" stated Krissie Clark, government director of the PAMS Foundation, a non-profit group preventing wildlife crime and supporting the duty drive Tanzanian who stopped Yang.

Is the sultan of Brunei imposing Sharia law to clean up his family's image? - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Rebecca Wright,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/brunei-sultan-intl/index.html,"(CNN) For decades, he was known as a godfather of excess. The wealthiest man in the world for many years, the sultan of Brunei knew how to spend the vast riches that flowed from the oil deposits bestowed upon the tiny Southeast Asian nation he controls with absolute power.
But now, the 72-year-old sultan of the former British protectorate is in the spotlight for a very different reason as he comes under fire from governments and activists around the world for introducing the Sharia Penal Code, which includes punishments such as death by stoning for adultery or homosexuality, or amputation of limbs for theft. Critics say this move towards the most draconian form of Sharia law is a sign of the rising influence of conservative Islam across Southeast Asia -- and an indication that the aging monarch wants to leave a religious legacy that seeks to compensate for his family's controversies. ""The sultan is getting on in years now, and his family hasn't always had the cleanest of reputations,"" said Matthew Woolfe, the founder of human rights group The Brunei Project. ""Certainly, there are a lot of people talking about the hypocrisy of laws that the sultan and his government are implementing when his family, in the past, could have been seen as being in violation of these laws with some of their antics,"" said Woolfe. ""Some people see it as a way of cleaning up and perhaps creating his legacy."" Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah reviews a Chinese honor guard during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in September 2017. Read More During a rare public address to the nation last week, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah made a case for moving towards a more conservative form of Islam, telling his people that he wants to see ""Islamic teachings in this country grow stronger and more visible,"" adding that ""this system preserves and guarantees the rights of all the people regardless of their race and faith."" It's a message which seems at odds with the lifestyles the sultan and his brother Prince Jefri Bolkiah are alleged to have lived. During the 1980s and 1990s, they had a reputation for throwing lavish parties, going on multi-million-dollar spending sprees, and running a ""harem"" at their palace. They owned luxury hotels in London, Paris and New York. Jefri also famously owned a giant luxury yacht he named ""Tits"" and two smaller vessels called ""Nipple 1"" and ""Nipple 2."" Vanity Fair described the brothers as ""constant companions in hedonism."" A combination of pictures created in London on March 31, 2019, shows the facades of five of the nine Dorchester Collection hotels owned by Brunei: (top left to right) Hotel Meurice in Paris, The Dorchester in London, The Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles, (bottom left to right) The Hotel Plaza Athenee in Paris and The Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. ""The sultan of Brunei and his brother Prince Jefri were known for their harems, their excesses in terms of purchasing of cars, their sexual exploits,"" said Bridget Welsh, a Southeast Asia expert and associate professor of political science at John Cabot University. ""All of these women were coming into Brunei in the 1980s, so the image of them being the playboys was very prevalent."" Inside the 'harem' An American woman, Jillian Lauren, published an autobiographical book ""Some Girls: My Life in a Harem"" in which she alleged that she was recruited to be one of 40 women for Prince Jefri's harem when she was an 18-year-old aspiring actress in New York in the early 1990s. Lauren said she spent 18 months in the harem on and off -- and was Prince Jefri's ""second favorite"" mistress for a year. ""He's crazy, and decadent,"" Lauren told CNN in 2011, referring to Prince Jefri. ""At that time, it was attractive to me, his confidence and his charisma and his recklessness."" In 2015, she told a ""60 Minutes Australia"" documentary, ""The Playboy Sultan,"" that she had sex with Prince Jefri ""hundreds"" of times and also had a sexual encounter with the sultan himself. She says her book was banned in Brunei. ""I am a witness to the fact that the sultan was drinking, was committing adultery, was not exactly living on the straight and narrow,"" Lauren told CNN in May 2014. Lauren said she felt compelled to tell her story when she saw the announcement in 2013 that Brunei was planning to introduce Sharia law. ""It's maybe indicative of the way that a lot of people in power behave,"" Lauren said. ""Which is, it's one rule for them and another rule for the rest of the people, who don't have so much money and don't have so much power."" In response to CNN's request for comment regarding these claims, the Brunei government said in an email, ""we vehemently deny the allegations."" Miss California Shannon Marketic, center, reacts as she is crowned Miss USA 1992. Another alleged recruit to the harem, former Miss USA Shannon Marketic, tried to sue the sultan and Prince Jefri in a US court in 1998, alleging that she was subjected to demeaning treatment and 32 days of virtual imprisonment at the sultan's palace. Court documents show that Marketic said that 30 to 100 women would be in attendance at the sultan's palace at any one time; some of them understood they were recruited to perform sex acts, but others including Marketic believed they were hired to perform legitimate promotional work for a salary of around $3,000 per day. Britain's Prince Charles walks with the sultan of Brunei as they attend a high tea at the sultan's palace in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, in 2017. ""Palace staff told Plaintiffs to attend nightly parties and functions at discotheques where the Sultan, Jefri, and their male friends would allegedly select which women they would have sexual intercourse with,"" according to the court documents. The brothers denied the allegations, and the sultan said he had never even met Marketic, Brunei state media reported at the time. The US court eventually granted the brothers immunity from legal action, owing to their joint status as a foreign head of state. A life of excess At that time, it seemed that the brothers were untouchable. In 1996, the sultan threw the party to end all parties to mark his 50th birthday. Guests flew in from all over the world for the lavish two-week celebration, which included a banquet dinner for 3,000 people, a special concert by Michael Jackson in a purpose-built stadium, and a polo match with Britain's Prince Charles. The total price tag was an estimated $25 million -- small change for the sultan. Michael Jackson preforms before an estimated audience of 60,000 in Brunei on July 16, 1996. The party was the pinnacle of decades of decadence and mind-boggling spending by the royal family. But it also preceded the beginning of a very public and embarrassing falling out between the brothers. At the time, Prince Jefri was Brunei's finance minister and the chairman of the government-owned Brunei Investment Agency (BIA). But after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, his extravagant tastes were exposed with an audit of the BIA. The sultan accused the prince of embezzling nearly $16 billion from the royal treasury -- which he denied. Prince Jefri was stripped of his ministerial role and BIA position, and went into self-imposed exile where he tried to fight a legal battle brought by the sultan for the remaining assets of the BIA. Eventually, the case ended in an out-of-court settlement. The sultan of Brunei (left) with his brother Prince Jefri Bolkiah, pictured together after a polo match. In an effort to recoup some of the losses, a debtor auction took place in August 2001, where 10,000 of Prince Jefri's possessions went under the hammer over six days. The lots included a bronze-plated, eight-foot high Trojan horse which went for $1,470, gold-plated Jacuzzis, porcelain flamingo statues, and simulators for a Comanche helicopter, an Airbus jet and a Formula 1 racing car. Despite the losses the prince allegedly inflicted on the royal coffers, and with declining oil reserves and a faltering economy in Brunei, the sultan still commands a personal fortune of $20 billion, Forbes estimates . The sultan's life is one filled with hyperbole. He was the world's richest man for many years -- before Bill Gates shot past him in the 1990s. His palace -- Istana Nurul Iman -- in the Brunei capital Bandar Seri Begawan, is the biggest private residence in the world , with 1,788 rooms, 257 bathrooms, and air-conditioned stables for 200 polo ponies. The sultan and his family also own thousands of luxury cars -- including F1 supercars, rare Lamborghinis and around 500 Rolls Royces, the largest private collection of the luxury British auto in the world . Michael Sheehan, a broker who owns and operates the website Ferraris Online, wrote in 2011 about his visit to the compound which housed some of the car collection in an article republished by Gizmodo, describing it as a ""massive example of wretched automotive excess."" The 2,500 cars Sheehan estimates he saw, included Bentleys, Aston Martins and Ferraris, many of which were ""poster children for deferred maintenance,"" left to rot in the heat and rain. ""Their lifestyle is literally inconceivable for the vast majority of humanity,"" said Michael Auslin, a fellow in contemporary Asia at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. ""It's lavish, beyond belief. Take everything you can imagine in the lifestyles of the rich and famous and multiply it."" Britain's Queen Elizabeth II meets the sultan of Brunei at Buckingham Palace in 2017. The new generation of the Brunei royal family also appears to have taken up the tradition of living in excessive luxury. The sultan has had three wives -- his first cousin, an air hostess, and a TV anchor -- with whom he has a total of 12 children. Several of the royal offspring have had extravagant wedding ceremonies in Brunei, including Prince Abdul Malik, the third-born son of the sultan, who was married in 2015. Forbes described it as ""a royal wedding to beat all royal weddings,"" with more than a week of celebrations including a main ceremony that saw the couple dressed in ""extravagant"" matching outfits draped in jewels, with the bride holding a bouquet made of gems and precious metals instead of flowers. Brunei's Prince Abdul Malik, the second son of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, ties the knot with IT instructor Dayangku Raabi'atul 'Adawiyyah Pengiran Haji Bolkiah, 22, in a ceremony in April 2015. Another of the sultan's sons, Prince Abdul Mateen, is an Instagram star with more than a million followers who watch him play polo and spend time on yachts, private jets and in world-class hotels. And Prince Azim, the sultan's second-born son, is well known for hosting extravagant parties with celebrity guests including Pamela Anderson, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. Notably, the latter two are both winners of the ""Ally Award,"" which honors those who support the LGBT community. Jared Murillo, Prince Azim of Brunei and Pamela Anderson attend the launch of her exclusive Coco De Mer collection at Morton's on December 5, 2017, in London. Since Brunei's new Shariah penal code was announced, several A-list celebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres have started a protest campaign, leading a boycott on luxury hotels around the world owned by the Brunei government. Insulated from criticism For most of the estimated 450,000 Bruneians -- 79% of whom are Muslim -- the wealth and spending habits of the royal family is something they have to accept without question. The sultan is essentially a one-man government -- the ""Supreme Executive Authority"" with titles including prime minister, defense minister, finance minister, and foreign affairs minister. The media is tightly controlled; Brunei is ranked as one of the worst countries in the world in the annual press freedom index, coming in at 153 out of 180 -- which places it below Russia and Myanmar. Criticism against the family or government is illegal and can result in a jail term for sedition. Portraits of Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and Queen Saleha are seen beside a slogan (partially cutoff) in Bahasa Melayu that reads ""Obedience to Allah, loyalty to the king, love for the country"" in Bandar Seri Begawan on October 4, 2017. Many Bruneians are also willing to turn a blind eye to the excesses inside the palace, experts say, as they are also benefiting from the nation's oil riches. There is no personal income tax, there is subsidized housing, free education and health care, and of course, low fuel and electricity costs. Per capita, Brunei is the fourth wealthiest country in the world, according to Forbes in 2017. ""They're probably fairly well insulated from criticism, as the Bruneians are living better than almost anyone else in Asia,"" said Michael Auslin of the Hoover Institution. ""Here you're talking about oil wealth that has been spread throughout society, the majority are benefiting."" Some observers say that the sultan wants to consolidate that support by increasing his grip on power. Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah (center) returns after blessing to the royal couple Princess Hajah Hafizah Sururul Bolkiah and her groom Pengiran Haji Muhammad Ruzaini (left) at the end of the sitting-in-state on royal dais ceremony at Istana Nurul Iman in Brunei's capital Bandar Seri Begawan on September 23, 2012. The new Sharia laws are part of a ""deeper rationale of controlling the state"" in order to ""legitimize the exploitation of resources which he and his family have benefited from,"" said Bridget Welsh, of John Cabot University. In the sultan's national televised address on Wednesday, he reiterated Brunei's Islamic identity multiple times during the speech. ""As a small nation, we always prioritize our prayers to Allah,"" the sultan said. ""This is driven by our national philosophy of Malay, Islamic, Monarchy (MIB) that has run here since many hundreds of years ago."""
Zhang hearing exposes Secret Service weaknesses at Mar-a-Lago - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/secret-service-mar-a-lago-zhang/index.html,"Zhang hearing exposes Secret Service weaknesses at Mar-a-Lago By Katelyn Polantz, CNN Updated 7:02 PM EDT, Mon April 08, 2019
West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) The Chinese national Yujing Zhang's hearing in a Florida federal courthouse Monday afternoon highlighted missteps by the Secret Service at virtually the same time news broke that the Secret Service director was being fired.
In all, it amounted to a bumpy afternoon for the agency that protects the President.
As word spread Monday that Secret Service director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles was leaving, a Secret Service agent took the stand to testify about the woman who had allegedly gained unauthorized access to President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club on March 30 and could be engaged in a spying operation.
Zhang faces two criminal charges, for lying and for entering the restricted grounds while Trump was there. She has not entered a plea and is being held in a Florida jail.
The hour of court testimony Monday from agent Samuel Ivanovich, guided by Zhang's defense attorney Robert Adler, revealed just how serious the security breach around the President that day had been.
Adler, through his questioning, prompted Ivanovich to admit the following details about the Secret Service's process with Zhang and at the private club.
Malware began downloading automatically
The Secret Service had confiscated a thumb drive (and several other electronics) from Zhang that she had carried into Mar-a-Lago. When an agent went to run an analysis on the drive, inserting it into a computer, it immediately began downloading a file. The Secret Service had called it ""malicious malware."" Woman accused of illegal entry to Mar-a-Lago had numerous electronic devices, thousands in cash
It was ""very out of the ordinary"" -- an authorized download they had never seen before, Ivanovich testified. The agent looking at the drive immediately stopped analyzing it and shut down his computer when he realized what was happening.
In a statement, a law enforcement official speaking on background said that anytime the agency does a forensic analysis on an electronic device, it is done in a controlled environment and on a stand-alone computer, not a Secret Service network computer. Those protocols were followed in this case, the official said.
No video surveillance at Secret Service entry checkpoint
Audio and video surveillance at Mar-a-Lago didn't catch Zhang's entrance to the club -- because those surveillance devices weren't used by the Secret Service at the entry checkpoint. They did check two passports she carried, though. Even 7-Eleven convenience stores have video cameras, the defense attorney pointed out.
Did not record audio during interview
When the Secret Service questioned Zhang at the agency's office after removing her from Mar-a-Lago, the agency videotaped her interview. But unbeknown to the agent who led the questioning, the office didn't record audio of the interview. The room where she was interviewed didn't have that capability. Audio recording capability, the agent had thought, was a standard practice in Secret Service offices.
Mar-a-Lago staff determines who gets in
The Secret Service appeared to rely on Mar-a-Lago staff to determine whether people should be admitted through the security perimeter into the club when the President was there, allowing for the issue of whether Zhang was related to a club member to arise, according to Ivanovich's testimony. It's up to a ""host committee"" to decide who accesses a site that's under Secret Service restrictions, the agent said.
The President was not on the club grounds during the time Zhang allegedly attempted to enter.
No protocol for flagging multiple phones
The agency also didn't have a protocol to flag the amount or types of electronics Zhang carried with her -- even though one had malware that even an agent performing an analysis on the device found to be unusual. ""We don't deny someone for having so many cell phones. That's not a direct violation of our restricted access,"" Ivanovich told the judge.
Zhang had four phones and other devices -- plus she left several more, including a radio signal detector, in her hotel room nearby. Trump is removing US Secret Service director
Language barrier
Zhang was clearly a Chinese national, with two Chinese passports, her first language Mandarin. But Ivanovich and others in the Secret Service took hours to bring in an available agent who spoke Mandarin and could help translate during her interview.
The Secret Service spoke with her -- and she answered them -- in English during more than four hours of questions, Ivanovich said. Her facility with reading English and responses led them to believe she had no trouble with the language. But language, the Secret Service had said, had led to the confusion over her relation to a Mar-a-Lago member.
Once the Mandarin-speaking agent was involved, he would speak with her to give her ""further understanding"" in the interview, Ivanovich said. Zhang used a translator in court on Monday to listen to the proceedings, but answered questions from the judge in English.
The breach has led Democrats in Congress to ask for more information about security at Mar-a-Lago. The criminal complaint filed by prosecutors and the Secret Service against Zhang last week highlighted how a Mar-a-Lago beach club manager erroneously thought Zhang was related to a member. The President, whose family business owns the club, has called Zhang's entrance onto the property a fluke and said he wasn't concerned. CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this report. "
Leaders of Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement found guilty for role in protests,rss.cnn.com,Eric Cheung and James Griffiths,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/L4XprLV3AD4/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) A Hong Kong court has found three prominent activists guilty for leading mass pro-democracy protests that brought parts of the city to a standstill in 2014.
Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming were among nine defendants found guilty of a range of public nuisance offenses on Tuesday. Lawmaker Tanya Chan was also found guilty of ""incitement to commit public nuisance."" Sentencing will take place later, with the defendants facing up to seven years in prison on each charge. Tai, along with Chan and Chu, was the mastermind of Occupy Central with Love and Peace, a proposed civil disobedience action calling for free elections. The action evolved -- amid tear gas and outrage -- into the much larger Umbrella Movement, featuring more than 100,000 protesters over 79 days. Tai has long said that he would be willing to go to prison, pointing to sentences already served by younger opposition figures such as Joshua Wong.

May to ask Merkel and Macron for Brexit extension,rss.cnn.com,"Nadine Schmidt, Saskya Vandoorne",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/v6_UQTNvGD4/index.html,"(CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, as the UK leader prepares to request another Brexit extension from the European Union.
EU leaders will meet Wednesday to discuss May's request to move the Brexit deadline, which is set for Friday, April 12. UK lawmakers finally approved a Brexit bill late Monday after weeks of failing to reach agreement on May's proposals or any of the alternative models of leaving the EU.

""We are committed to finding a way through in order to ensure we can leave the EU and deliver on the referendum. That will require the parties to work at pace in order to address outstanding issues -- and so ministers and their shadow counterparts will be holding talks (Tuesday),"" a spokesman for 10 Downing Street said. With May seeking another extension, the UK government has started laying groundwork to enable it to participate in European Parliament elections next month , should it still find itself in the EU by the time the vote takes place. The move signals a possibility that Brexit could be delayed beyond the May 23 election date -- almost three years after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the EU."
Honestbee: Alibaba's online groceries rival from Singapore,rss.cnn.com,Sherisse Pham,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/lyH3a-lm2Lg/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Online grocery startup Honestbee is betting a brick-and-mortar store will help it compete against tech giant Alibaba ( BABA ) .
Singapore-based Honestbee, best known for its grocery app, has opened a massive cashless store called Habitat that offers a mix of online and offline shopping. Habitat users scan an app on their phones to enter the store. To check out, they push their carts through a gate into a secure area behind a panel. Shoppers can then grab a coffee or snack at one of Habitat's restaurants while their goods are scanned and packed. When the groceries are ready, they get a notification on their app and then head to a pickup area where a small robot retrieves a locker containing their bags. Shoppers can also order groceries at the store online and have them delivered to their homes. Amazon's grocery plans go way beyond Whole Foods ""We use phones to track, we use tech to make shopping easier, we use as much data as possible to make [our] inventory smarter,"" Honestbee co-founder Joel Sng said. ""To be honest, any store should be doing that."" Read More Honestbee is the latest tech company to try to upend the traditional retail experience , especially in food and groceries. It's facing increasing competition from Amazon ( AMZN ) in Singapore, and Alibaba-owned e-commerce platform Lazada across Southeast Asia. They're all competing for Asia's growing online grocery sales, which are set to hit $176 billion by 2022, up a whopping 194% since 2017, according to market research firm IGD. Habitat could help grow Honestbee's brand and attract new users, according to Shirley Zhu, a Singapore-based analyst with IGD. Zhu said Habitat has drawn comparisons to Alibaba's Hema stores in China, known as Fresh Hippo in English. Hema is also cashless and shoppers can scan and pay for goods with their phones, or they can order groceries online and have them delivered. ""If you look at Hema's success, it has relied on consumers understanding [the retail concept], and the ability to acquire new customers at low cost,"" she said. Habitat's cashless, automated checkout. More than 400,000 people visited the Habitat store in Singapore in its first three months, according to Sng. About 85% of them bought something and ""a good portion continue to make transactions today,"" he said. ""It also reactivated old customers that might have forgotten about us,"" he added. Honestbee plans to open a second Habitat store outside of Singapore by the end of the year, though Sng declined to say where. Alibaba's Lazada has also reportedly been experimenting with physical stores . The company has a strong grocery distribution network throughout Southeast Asia, and it has support from Alibaba's network of businesses and affiliates. Singapore gets its first 'zero energy' new building ""For Honestbee and Habitat, the direct competition will be Alibaba's Lazada,"" Zhu said. ""Habitat is a newcomer in the space, and if they compete with online players and supermarkets, it's going to be a really tough battle for them,"" she added. Honestbee operates in eight countries across Asia. Its online shopping app usually relies on partnerships with local grocery chains and 20,000 part-time employees to fulfill orders. The startup secured $15 million in 2015 from a handful of investors, among them Silicon Valley venture capitalist Formation 8, and some former Facebook ( FB ) and YouTube executives. The company declined to comment on how much money it has raised since then, and wouldn't disclose its current valuation."

His first two head coaching opportunities came at the junior college level with Fort Scott Community College in Kansas and Seminole State College in Oklahoma. ""When you talk about team of destiny, I just think they're really, really good,"" Beard said of Virginia to CBS after the loss. ""The poise, and they just find ways to win. I just want to congratulate them, their program. It's just an honor to compete with them on this biggest stage, on Monday night. I have nothing but respect for their program. In terms of my guys, I've never been more proud in coaching. This is real life. We'll bounce back. I'm just so proud of those guys."" On Monday, Francis had 17 points off the bench to lead Texas Tech. Sophomores Jarrett Culver and Davide Moretti each had 15. This was the first meeting between the two men's basketball programs.

Missing this year were the well-known established blue bloods: This is the first Final Four since 1987 that didn't have Duke, North Carolina, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisville or UCLA."

Walmart is doubling down on robot janitors. Here's why,edition.cnn.com,Nathaniel Meyersohn,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/walmart-robots-retail-jobs/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Walmart wants store workers to help out customers instead of mopping up floors and unloading boxes in backrooms. So it's increasingly turning to robots to fill those tasks.
The world's largest retailer announced Tuesday that it is adding thousands of new robots to its stores. By next February, it expects to have autonomous floor scrubbers in 1,860 of its more than 4,700 US stores. Walmart will also have robots that scan shelf inventory at 350 stores. And there will be bots at 1,700 stores that automatically scan boxes as they come off delivery trucks and sort them by department onto conveyer belts. Walmart says these ""smart assistants"" will reduce the amount of time workers spend on ""repeatable, predictable and manual"" tasks in stores and allow them to switch to selling merchandise to shoppers and other customer service roles. ""The overall trend we're seeing is that automating certain tasks gives associates more time to do work they find fulfilling and to interact with our customers,"" CEO Doug McMillon said last year of the new technology in stores. Walmart will deploy 920-pound autonomous floor scrubbers in 1,860 of its stores by next year. The retailer believes that bringing on bots will lift sales and make stores more efficient. Walmart also says bots limit worker turnover. That's because it's hard to consistently find workers to unload trucks and keep up stores overnight. Read More Walmart has been testing out this technology in hundreds of stores over the past year. Its expansion plan means that the innovations have been effective for Walmart so far. It also signals that robots will play a key role in the retailer's store strategy going forward. Big stores and new functions McMillon often cites Walmart's ( WMT ) vast store network as its biggest advantage over rivals, including Amazon ( AMZN ) . Walmart is within 10 miles of 90% of the US population. But its 178,000 square-foot supercenters are expensive to operate, especially as more shoppers buy online. Walmart invested more than $2 billion last year to remodel stores around the country and equip them to handle customers' online purchases for in-store pickup. For example, Walmart said Tuesday that it would bring 16-foot-tall pickup towers — automated vending machines that quickly fetch customers' online orders — to 900 new stores this year. Retail's Amazon antidote: Buy online, pickup in store Walmart is adding robots to help it manage rising costs, including for store labor. Unemployment is at its lowest level in decades , and Walmart and other retailers have increased wages and benefits to attract and keep workers. ""There is a labor shortage in retail,"" said Kirthi Kalyanam , director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University. ""It will not be easy for Walmart to add labor to perform these functions. So a high level of automation is required."" Other retailers and grocery chains are bringing on robots in their stores to reduce costs and assist workers, too. Giant Food Stores is placing ""Marty,"" a tall, gray robot with googly eyes , in all of its 172 grocery stores. The bot roams around stores looking for spills. Robot janitors and shelf scanners Walmart's 920-pound self-driving floor scrubbers , called the ""Auto-C,"" use automated technology to navigate custom routes around the store and mop up the floors. The machine relies on sensors to scan for people and aisles. Walmart tested it at 360 stores before deciding to roll it out to an additional 1,500 locations. ""It relieves associates of a job that, quite frankly, is unpopular,"" Mark Ibbotson, head of Walmart's US central operations and real estate, said last year. Walmart also has been running an experiment at 50 stores with ""Auto-S,"" a shelf-scanning robot . The bot travels around aisles and identifies which items are low or out of stock and makes sure that prices and product labels are accurate. That information is important to help Walmart squeeze out sales. That bot will soon be in 300 more stores. Walmart's shelf-scanning robot moves around aisles and identifies which items are low or out of stock. And Walmart experimented with a bot in around 500 stores that unloads boxes off delivery trucks and automatically scans and sorts the items by department. Walmart says the unloader saves time and has reduced worker turnover in the labor-intensive back areas of the store. So it's bringing it to 1,200 new stores. ""We're seeing increases in sales and reductions in turnover in what had been a very difficult job to fill,"" CEO McMillon said last year. Walmart says all three robots will soon share data with each other to get products to the shelves more quickly and ensure aisles are clean and fully stocked. The future of retail work Although Walmart maintains that the bots allow workers to engage more with customers, labor advocates worry that automating manual tasks will trigger layoffs in retail . Walmart has said that it will reduce the hours it assigns workers to unloading boxes and mopping the floors. That will lead to some employee attrition over time, Walmart said. ""As we evolve, there are certain activities, certain jobs that'll go away,"" Walmart US CFO Michael Dastugue said at an analyst conference last month. But Walmart expects to use some of the hours it saves because of the robots to assign workers to newly created roles, such as selecting customers' grocery-pickup and delivery orders. Dastugue said that technology will force employees to be flexible and ""be able to handle change."" ""We may need them to do them one activity in the morning and a different activity in the afternoon,"" he said."
New UK divorce law aims to end blame game - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Jack Guy, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/uk/no-fault-divorce-uk-scli-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) UK divorce laws will change to allow couples to separate without apportioning blame in order to ""reduce family conflict,"" the Ministry of Justice announced Tuesday.
Family justice professionals expressed strong support for reform during a public consultation, according to a government press release, and the existing 50-year-old laws will now be updated with new legislation to be introduced to UK Parliament. Experts say current rules can make conflict worse, reduce the chances of reconciliation, and damage children who are stuck in the middle, according to the release. ""Hostility and conflict between parents leave their mark on children and can damage their life chances,"" said Justice Secretary David Gauke. ""While we will always uphold the institution of marriage, it cannot be right that our outdated law creates or increases conflict between divorcing couples."" Read More MacKenzie Bezos will keep 25% of the Bezos' Amazon stock. Jeff Bezos keeps the voting power The existing law obliges couples to show that their marriage is irretrievable and demands evidence of ""unreasonable behavior"" or years of separation. This is the case even when a couple has mutually decided to split up. Gauke called the current system an ""unnecessary blame game"" and vowed to end it for good, according to the release. A new law could replace the evidence requirement with a statement of irretrievable breakdown, remove the ability of one partner to contest a divorce, and introduce the possibility of a joint application for divorce. ""This much-needed change to the law is good news for divorcing couples and particularly for any children involved,"" said Aidan Jones, CEO of relationship support charity Relate. ""The outdated fault-based divorce system led parting couples to apportion blame, often resulting in increased animosity and making it harder for ex-partners to develop positive relationships as co-parents."" Brought into line with the US A new UK law would bring the country into line with the US, where you can file for a no-fault divorce in every state . Of the 50 US states, 17 exclusively allow no-fault divorces, according to legal solutions provider LegalZoom. In the 33 remaining states, you can file for a no-fault divorce or choose to apportion blame for a variety of reasons, which vary from state to state. California became the first state to offer no-fault divorces in 1970, while New York was the last to do so in 2010."
Q: Am I a bad parent if I clean up after my kids? - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Elissa Strauss, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/clean-up-bad-parenting-strauss/index.html,"Am I a Bad Parent? is a CNN Parenting parenthood advice column. Send us your confidential questions about any worrisome parenting behaviors you're having, and we'll help you work through the problem -- and the guilt.
(CNN) Am I a bad parent if I do the majority of the cleaning up after my kids?
-- Rather Do It Myself Dear Rather Do It Myself, So much of parenting requires risk analysis. On one hand, we have the future well-being of our children to consider. If we don't teach them to clean up after themselves, they might grow up to be messy and entitled brats. Read More On the other hand, we have the current well-being of us, the parents, to take into account. We are living in the age of burnout. Many of us lack the bandwidth -- emotional and temporal -- to get our children to clean up their Hot Wheels on a regular basis. There's so much to squeeze into a day (jobs need to be worked, dishes need to be cleaned, stories need to be read, etc). Is it really so wrong to cut the tedious child-led clean-up session out of the daily schedule? Answering your questions about potentially bad parenting behavior. We will help you work through the guilt.
The short answer is, absolutely not. With few exceptions, there's no single activity that can make or break our children's characters. Maybe your kids don't clean up their toys, but they do other chores like feeding the dog or setting the table. There are oh so many ways to instill a sense of responsibility in our children. If you aren't doing any of them, or if your kid loses it when you make any request, then you have a bigger problem than that pile of toys or whatever it is you are quickly cleaning up. The tricky part is striking the balance between teaching our kids these lessons and not turning into frazzled lunatics ourselves in the process. Carla Naumburg, author of the upcoming "" How to Stop Losing Your Sh*t With Your Kids ,"" said parents need to remember that ""it is not their job to teach their children everything."" Q: Am I a bad parent if I'm on my phone in front of my kids? ""We parents expect ourselves to be the teacher, the coach, the therapist, the cook, the jailor, the judge. Everything! Parents need to trust that other people in their kids' lives are teaching their kids, too,"" she said, adding that it's fairly common for children to have to clean up after themselves in school. Daniel Siegel, a child psychologist and co-author of "" The Whole-Brain Child "" and other parenting books, encourages a quality-over-quantity approach to teaching children responsibility. He wants parents to put their energy into something they have the bandwidth to do and then stick with it. ""Your child is looking to you for regularity, routines and predictability, though not rigidity. They want a structure that has flexibility to it,"" Siegel said, adding that parents should think hard about which responsibility lessons feel necessary to them. Some issues, like teaching a child not to play with knives, are obviously urgent. Other issues, like a child who doesn't finish his Cheerios every morning, are obviously trivial. It's the ones in the middle, which might include getting your child to clean up after themselves, that can be most challenging to figure out how to handle. ""You have to decide, what's the deal?"" he said. ""If you come to the conclusion that teaching your children to clean up after themselves is important to you, then you have to make the time to do it. If you don't, let it go."" Naumburg said she sees a lot of parents getting too ambitious with their lessons and then feeling overwhelmed as a result. For example, when she wanted her daughters to learn to cook, she didn't start with a big, elaborate recipe. Instead, she let them open a bag of frozen broccoli and dump it in a pot. The judgmental mom is little more than a stereotype ""The truth is, kids learn grit and resilience in small moments, too,"" she said. If you decide that teaching your kids to clean up their toys is important to you, remember that it's OK to start small. Maybe at the beginning, it's just the dolls in the hallway or the Legos on the table. Maybe they are in charge of putting away 10 things or cleaning up for three minutes -- something I often do with my children -- and then you do the rest. A toy-free bedroom or living room every night might be too much, too soon. Remember, mess is a subjective concept. Where one person sees "" Grey Gardens ,"" another might see Marie Kondo. Considering that you wrote about cleaning up, I suspect that you, like me, fall into the clutter-phobe category. Try -- and I know it's hard -- to accept a little more chaos. If your children's toys aren't posing a hazard, then maybe a few of them camping out on the carpet overnight isn't such a bad thing. Or if your children give cleaning up a shot but have a different definition of clean than you do, try to be encouraging anyway -- especially if it means an easier daily routine and a less-exhausted parent hitting the pillow every night. Another thing to remember: Our attitudes about messiness tend to be gendered. Women experience more pressure, internal and external, to have their houses look orderly. A recent Pew Research Center study found that teenage girls, ages 15 to 17, spend over twice as much time cleaning up and preparing food as boys the same age do. I'm not mentioning this because I believe that we should abandon cleaning up altogether just because the patriarchy made it a women's job. Living in filth is not my idea of women's liberation. Join the conversation on CNN Parenting's Facebook page See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Parenting on Facebook .
Instead, I want parents to make sure that the sons out there are being held to the same tidiness standards as the daughters. Also, dads should be equally involved in getting kids to clean up as moms. This way, the next generation won't see tidying up as exclusively a women's concern. Ultimately, cleaning up after your kids doesn't make you a bad parent. It's the failing to teach them responsibility, or only teaching the girls responsibility, that will get you in trouble. Pick the chores that work for you and your kids and stop worrying about the thing or things that don't. You're probably too tired for all that."

It houses a 16th-century globe, an original copy of the Bill of Rights and a Honus Wagner baseball card largely considered to be one of the rarest in the world. 9. Working in a library used to be considered too intense for women At the end of the 19th century, library work was considered to be too overwhelming for women, and in 1900, the Brooklyn Public Library Association proposed building ""a seaside rest home for those who had broken down in library service."" Melvil Dewey, who invented the Dewey Decimal System, also believed women would have a hard time working in libraries because of their supposed poor health. Thankfully, these ideas began to disappear around the 1920s. "
How the Israeli political debate went from peace negotiations to annexation,www.cnn.com,Good King News,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/06/middleeast/israel-elections-benjamin-netanyahu/index.html/,"How the Israeli political debate went from peace negotiations to annexation By 4 Share
""It's not going to happen,"" mentioned Netanyahu to a stone-faced Obama, ""and the time has come to tell the Palestinians that this will not happen."" It's apparent that we cannot ask Israel to negotiate with a authorities backed by the Palestinian model of al-Qaeda, we cannot return to the 1967 traces as a result of these traces are indefensible. ""
The commercial was for Likud, the social gathering of the prime minister. And the message was easy: Netanyahu will defend all who need it to resume talks on the creation of a Palestinian state.
Once upon a time, such equivocation to the Israeli-Palestinian battle would have triggered a severe debate between the events in Israel. Indeed, for many years, battle has been the principal fault line in Israeli politics. Just as the Green Line separated Israel from the West Bank, the approaching battle was separating from left to proper throughout the Israeli political spectrum. The left was extra prepared to negotiate and make concessions in a peace course of, whereas the proper took a harder method. For a couple of days, the battle with the militant Palestinian group Hamas was at the high of the agenda, after a rocket fired from Gaza hit a home north of Tel Aviv, injuring seven folks, together with three youngsters. Israel responded with air strikes , additionally injuring Palestinians, and a severe escalation appeared potential. But a couple of days later, there was speak of a truce in Gaza and a rest of Israeli restrictions on the two million inhabitants of the enclave.
Any enchancment in Gaza's circumstances can be welcomed by nearly everybody. But we’re far from what the decision of the battle was like. In the 1990s, the Oslo peace accords offered for last standing negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which might lead to the creation of a Palestinian state. It is an concept that Western diplomats stationed in Jerusalem and Ramallah are nonetheless holding out very dearly, however fewer and fewer folks appear to be giving him a variety of possibilities.
Netanyahu's principal rival on this election, former chief of employees Benny Gantz of the blue-and-white social gathering, has solely made obscure references to the battle. He advocated a coverage of ""separation"" from the Palestinians, with out subscribing to the concept of ​​a two-state resolution. Gantz has tried to place himself as a centrist in Israeli politics – and thus to interact totally in any peace course of with the Palestinians, he dangers shedding potential political companions, which Gantz will not be conscious of. not prepared to do for the second.
The ""Deal of the Century"" Trump administration, which can come out shortly after the elections on April 9, might be ready behind the scenes. Trump's group, led by international coverage novice and son-in-law Jared Kushner, mentioned the peace plan would resolve all the last standing points in the Israeli-Palestinian battle, together with safety, refugees, refugees and refugees. borders and Jerusalem. He additionally mentioned that may require troublesome concessions on either side. The Palestinian Authority has already categorically rejected any plans introduced by the Trump administration on account of the Jerusalem president's recognition of the Israeli capital and the Israeli authorities. transfer from the American Embassy in Tel Aviv .
Although Netanyahu for his half mentioned that he wouldn’t prejudge the plan and would wait to see its content material, his potential companions in the right-wing coalition have already achieved it for him. Two of them – the Union of Right-wing events and the new Right – categorically rejected any proposal demanding concessions to the Palestinians.
In reality, if Netanyahu succeeds in profitable the elections, it’s possible that the events he’s courting, reasonably than searching for to defeat the peace negotiations, will attempt to transfer issues in the wrong way, pushing the annexation of some, or all, of the West Bank. The far proper events imagine that Trump gave them the openness they needed, when he acknowledged Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights , upsetting a long time of American international coverage. For these events, and even for Prime Minister Netanyahu, this announcement units a precedent: the territory taken by pressure by a defensive warfare could be legally preserved.
If this precedent may very well be utilized to the Golan Heights – captured from Syria in 1967 – it might additionally work in the West Bank, as the partisans of annexation imagine. The West Bank was captured throughout the similar warfare in Jordan, which had occupied the territory since 1948.
Naftali Bennett, the radical chief of the New Right social gathering, appeared to be aiming for the prize after Trump's announcement in the Golan, calling on Netanyahu to formally surrender a keynote speech in 2009 wherein he accredited a two-state resolution. .
""We name on Prime Minister Netanyahu tonight to announce that his settlement for the institution of Palestine in the Bar-Ilan speech is null and void,"" Bennett mentioned.
And Netanyahu himself, in a tv interview this weekend, mentioned that he supposed to lengthen Israeli sovereignty to all Israeli settlements in the West Bank when he was reelected , suggesting a complete annexation of the territory. In one other interview a day earlier, he informed Trump that he didn’t need to see a single Israeli settler evacuated from the West Bank – his inhabitants exceeds 400,000 – as a part of any peace effort.
Gantz, Netanyahu's principal opponent, referred to as the remarks irresponsible and requested why the prime minister had chosen to communicate now of annexation.
""We ought to ask ourselves how annexation has stayed in Netanyahu's again pocket for 13 years and has not come out but,"" Gantz said. ""I believe the announcement of a strategic and historic resolution [like this] in the midst of an election marketing campaign will not be severe and is irresponsible "".
When elected, Gantz mentioned his authorities wouldn’t take unilateral motion in the Israeli-Palestinian battle and that any annexation to the West Bank can be the results of negotiations and never a place to begin.
While Netanyahu's critics accuse him of operating a determined marketing campaign towards a tense venture on Tuesday, the tilting of the discourse – from the peace course of to annexation – exhibits simply how a lot politics Israel has developed over the previous couple of a long time. Share this:"
Will another 'bomb cyclone' hit the central US this week?,www.cnn.com,"Jennifer Gray, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/bomb-cyclone-blizzard-midwest-plains-wxc/index.html,"Will another 'bomb cyclone' hit the central US this week? CNN 24 mins ago By Jennifer Gray, CNN © CNN Weather While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter isn't over until it's over.
The potential is there for a "" bomb cyclone "" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system.
This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less, two.
Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters.
Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week.
Things begin to unravel Tuesday
This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard-like conditions to the Plains on Wednesday.
Winter storm watches are already posted for parts of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota.
Arctic air will dive south, bringing frigid temperatures and possible blizzard conditions for portions of the Rockies, Plains and even Great Lakes.
Up to 18 inches of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-50 mph in the Dakotas, along with white-out conditions.
Thursday the bottom drops out
Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop 40 degrees in just 12 hours.
Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow. Ten inches of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis.
© Provided by Cable News Network, Inc. While an April snowstorm seems like a punch in the gut, April snowstorms do happen. Just last year, the Twin Cities experienced their top April snowstorm with 15.8 inches of snow April 13-16, 2018.
Air travel will be drastically slowed, and road travel will be treacherous.
The snow is not the only hazard from the storm.
In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska.
On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee.
Tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds are likely with some of the storms.
The storm will exacerbate flooding concerns through the Midwest
Additional flooding in the Plains by the weekend is likely.
We've already seen significant flooding along the Red River because of melting snow. Now with additional rain and snowmelt, more flooding will be expected.
In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, the James and Elm rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding.
Any additional rain and snow will cause these rivers to rise even higher. There's also the threat of ice jam flooding through the weekend.
Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry and stay.

As Theresa May brings her one-day tour of European capitals to an end, we're finishing our live coverage for Tuesday.
Aside from clocking up more air miles, the prime minister will be hoping she's laid some groundwork with the two biggest players in the room at Wednesday's all-important EU summit.
We'll be back to cover the twists and turns on Wednesday, when European leaders discuss another delay to Brexit. 4 min ago May and Macron conclude talks in Paris MARTIN BUREAU/AFP/Getty Images
Theresa May has wrapped up her meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Downing Street has confirmed.
“Following the Prime Minister’s letter to Donald Tusk last week, the leaders discussed the UK’s request for an extension of Article 50 to June 30th, with the option to bring this forward if a deal is ratified earlier,"" a spokesman for May said.
He added that May ""updated President Macron on the ongoing talks with the Opposition to agree a way forward that respects the result of the 2016 referendum.
“They also discussed upcoming European Parliamentary elections with the PM saying that the government was working very hard to avoid the need for the UK to take part.”
While May will be keen to push for an extension until her proposed date of June 30, all signs from Brussels are pointing to a much longer delay, which Britain could bring to an early end if it passes the Withdrawal Agreement. 18 min ago End date for Brexit extension left blank in EU summit draft conclusions From CNN's Erin McLaughlin in Brussels
CNN has seen a leaked copy of the EU’s draft conclusions from Wednesday’s summit, which are in line with Donald Tusk’s letter urging the EU to consider a long and flexible extension.
The draft, which will be the basis of discussions at tomorrow's meeting, leaves the length of the proposed extension to be decided at the meeting. A spokesman for French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that an extension of up to a year would be “too long.”
The document also includes wording intended to ensure Britain would not interfere with the EU's objectives while it was still a member -- a concern prompted by some hardline Brexiteers in Theresa May's Conservative Party. 56 min ago Tusk urges leaders to consider long, flexible extension FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP/Getty Images
EU leaders should consider a long but flexible delay to Brexit, Donald Tusk , the President of the EU Council, has said in his invitation letter to the attendees at Wednesday's summit.
""I trust that we will continue to do our utmost"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit, Tusk writes. But he reflected Europe's pessimism about the prospect of Theresa May passing her Withdrawal Agreement through the House of Commons -- and said a long delay was therefore the best course. ""Our experience so far, as well as the deep divisions within the House of Commons, give us little reason to believe that the ratification process can be completed by the end of June ,"" Tusk writes. ""In reality, granting such an extension would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits, creating new cliff-edge dates.""
""This is why I believe we should also discuss an alternative, longer extension ,"" he adds. May has formally requested a delay until June 30, but Tusk appears to be resistant to this timing. He adds that a ""flexible extension,"" which could be terminated when May passes a deal, is an option -- but reiterates that the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.
Tusk also appeared to push back against the apparent wishes of France and other states to strip back Britain's powers while they remained in the EU.
""The UK would have to maintain its sincere cooperation also during this crucial period, in a manner that reflects its situation as a departing member state,"" he writes. ""We should remember, however, that the United Kingdom will remain a member state with full rights and obligations . And, in any event, the UK can revoke Article 50 at any time , as stated by the European Court of Justice.""
He concludes with an amicable call to the 27 remaining EU leaders. ""Whatever course of action is taken, it must not be influenced by negative emotions,"" Tusk writes. ""We should treat the UK with the highest respect, as we want to remain friends and close partners, and as we will still need to agree on our future relations. Neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process."" 1 hr 27 min ago May arrives for meeting with Macron Macron and May greet each other in Paris on Tuesday.

Theresa May has arrived in Paris and been greeted by Emmanuel Macron, the second European leader she's stopped in on during her whistle-stop tour of Europe.
Macron is expected to prove a more difficult adversary than Angela Merkel, whom May met in Berlin earlier. The French President has so far proven unsympathetic to Britain's requests for Brexit extensions, and he'll be expected to play a similar role in Wednesday's summit.
The President's spokesman signaled that France would back a delay -- but not without conditions.
""One year would be too long,"" the spokesman said. He also made clear that France would want Britain's powers in the EU to be severely limited during an extension period, to ensure pro-Brexit lawmakers in Brussels cannot wreck havoc with the bloc's plans. 1 hr 37 min ago MPs back May's extension request -- but plenty of Conservatives rebel

The vote passed by 420 votes to 110 in the House of Commons. But the number of ""no"" voters -- most of whom were Conservatives -- is notable, and reflects the sizable opposition from hardliners within May's own party to her plan to delay Brexit again.
While the anticipated approval is a boost for May, the actual end-date of the extension will be decided by European leaders at Wednesday's summit. 1 hr 45 min ago Conservative backbencher urges Europe to refuse delay Dan Kitwood/Getty Images
A Conservative backbencher has made an extraordinary appeal to Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, urging the European leaders to undermine Theresa May's government by rejecting her request for another Brexit extension.
""Please, put us out of our misery now, as this House and this Government appear incapable of doing,"" Tim Loughton said during a debate in the House of Commons. ""At tomorrow's EU Council, please vote against any further extensions to Article 50 and oblige the UK to leave the EU on Friday on WTO terms.""
""You previously said you would only honor any application for an extension if there was a credible reason so to do. That credible reason does not not exist,"" he added.
His plea won't go down well with his party's leader. If fulfilled, it would send the UK crashing out of the EU on Friday -- and could spell the end of Theresa May's time in power.
Loughton also echoed threats made by Brexiteers including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said the UK should be ""as difficult as possible"" if it stayed in the EU for an extended period of time.
""If the EU elections go ahead, it is highly likely the UK will elect an army of Nigel Farage mini-me's, who I am afraid will wreak havoc with the European Parliament and wreck your calculations about the balance of power within the EU,"" he said.
Several leaders, including Macron, are clearly keen to guard against such a prospect. An Élysée spokesperson earlier indicated that Britain may see some of its powers stripped if it were granted a length delay. 2 hr 2 min ago No more cross-party Brexit talks before Brussels summit Environment Secretary Michael Gove leaves the Cabinet Office after talks with Labour.

Another round of ""constructive"" cross-party Brexit negotiations has come to a close with still no sign of a breakthrough.
Labour and Downing Street said talks will continue after the European Council summit on Wednesday -- making it all but certain that Theresa May will arrive at the emergency meeting without any concrete cross-party plan.
""We've had really constructive discussions today and covered a number of issues in great detail,"" Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said after leaving the talks at the Cabinet Office. ""There's not really been any fundamental shift or a change in position of the deal itself. But we're hopeful that progress will be made,"" she added.
""Constructive"" has becoming something of a buzzword when it comes to describing the Brexit discussions -- and it's usually followed by an admission that the two sides remain some way apart.
Environment Secretary Michael Gove was singing from the same hymn sheet after leaving Tuesday's conversations, calling the conversations -- wait for it -- ""constructive,"" before adding: ""There are number of issues where we differ, but we are anxious to ensure that we can carry on with this process.""
A Downing Street spokesperson added: ""We remain completely committed to delivering on Brexit, with both sides working hard to agreeing a way forward, appreciating the urgency in order to avoid European elections.""
The lack of an agreement isn't helpful for May, who would have preferred to present other EU leaders with a done deal. But the fact that everyone is sounding positive makes it harder for the EU to deny the request for a Brexit delay. The question, it seems, will be for how long, and with what conditions. 3 hr 12 min ago BREAKING: One-year Brexit extension ""too long"" for France LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP/Getty Images
France considers a one-year extension to Brexit to be ""too long,"" a spokesman for Emmanuel Macron has said, ahead of the French President's meeting with Theresa May on Tuesday.
A delay until March 31, 2019 was floated during last month's EU Council summit, but was ultimately not pursued -- and France appears set to block such a plan were it to be raised again.
The spokesman reiterated that the Withdrawal Agreement between May and the EU cannot be revisited, and also said Britain would need to accept ""strict conditions"" if it is to receive a lengthy Brexit delay.
He raised concerns over whether the UK would interfere in the running of the EU during an extension period. ""The EU must keep functioning and any Brexit delay must preserve the functioning of the EU,"" he said.
""It’s logical that when you’re a member looking to leave you can’t build with the others,"" the spokesman went on, adding that it would ""make sense"" for Britain to be excluded from the process of setting the EU budget or choosing the next President of the European Commission.
Those conditions would placate fears stoked by hardline Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who tweeted last week that Britain ""should be as difficult as possible"" within the bloc if granted a long delay.
""In the event of a long extension the (remaining) 27 could demand reviews to look at whether the UK is honoring its commitments not to block the EU’s decision-making,"" the Élysée spokesman said. ""We don’t want to bet on the functioning of the EU. We can’t say to ourselves 'everything will be fine' (if) that’s not the case. It’s not about being nice or not nice. There’s a difference between a leaving member state and a member state. We can’t risk the European Union,"" he added.
Those tough words indicate that Macron will again prove a holdout in Europe's discussions over a second Brexit extension. The French leader seemed more willing than most to allow Britain to crash out with no deal in March.
But Macron's spokesman was keen to push back on the idea that he is being unfair to Theresa May.
""France being portrayed as a bad cop is not correct. We are looking for solutions but we need to stay firm,"" the spokesman said. Search"
Royal baby name: What will it be?,edition.cnn.com,Lauren Said-Moorhouse,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/uk/royal-baby-name-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) Britain's Duke and Duchess of Sussex are now proud parents to a baby boy. But one mystery still remains: What name will they bestow upon him?
A giddy Prince Harry spoke to the media shortly after the birth of his son on Monday, telling reporters that the royal couple were ""still thinking about names."" ""The baby's a little bit overdue so we've had a little bit of time to think about it, that's the next bit,"" said a delighted Harry during an interview in the royal mews of Windsor Castle. Harry, Duke of Sussex, speaks to members of the media at Windsor Castle following the birth of his son on Monday. What's in a name? Like any new parents, Meghan and Harry will undoubtedly have been considering baby names for some time and may have already decided on their favorites. Read More There aren't any royal rules for choosing names but the British Royal Family likes to honor those who came before them. Bookmakers have Arthur and Edward, as well as Philip (a nod to Harry's grandfather), among their top choices for a newborn son. Meghan's mother Doria Ragland is pictured with Harry's father, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla in May 2018. ""They will most likely honor the grandparents within the middle names of the child,"" explains Wendy Bosberry-Scott, spokeswoman for the etiquette experts Debrett's . ""For a boy, the names Arthur, George, Albert, David and Charles are favorites within the senior royals."" We can also count on Baby Sussex being given a fair few names. Queen Elizabeth II bestowed four names on each of her four children. Current heir apparent Prince Charles's full name is in fact Charles Philip Arthur George. Meanwhile new father Prince Harry's full name is Henry Charles Albert David. Harry's brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, has continued the tradition of multiple names with all three of his children. Will Baby Sussex be a prince? Baby Sussex will become the seventh in line to throne, but that doesn't automatically make the new addition to the royal family a prince. Harry's great, great, great grandfather King George V restricted use of the titles Prince and Princess to certain senior members of the Royal Family. However, the Queen could step in to overrule that decree -- as she did with William and Catherine's younger children, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. ""If the Queen had not issued a Letters Patent in 2012, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would now be styled as the children of a Duke,"" Bosberry-Scott says. ""The 2012 Letters Patent was a reflection of the then-upcoming changes to the Succession to the Crown Act, which in 2013 ended the system of male primogeniture, and meant that Princess Charlotte kept her place in the line of succession when her younger brother was born."" Bosberry-Scott says the baby boy will most likely use his father's second peerage title, Earl of Dumbarton. Conversely, Harry and Meghan may choose to pass on titles altogether, as Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Zara Phillips did with her daughters Mia Grace and Lena Elizabeth. Bosberry-Scott says declining a title is not unheard of. ""There have been occasions when a title has been declined, such as when the Honorable Angus Ogilvy -- the younger son of the 12th Earl of Airlie -- married Princess Alexandra in 1963. He was offered an Earldom but declined."" When will we find out the name? Traditionally, the first to know of a royal birth is the reigning monarch. As well as Queen Elizabeth II, British Prime Minister Theresa May and the Governor General of each Commonwealth nation will be informed, along with the rest of the royals and Meghan's family in the United States. Ultimately, Bosberry-Scott says the baby's name will be announced ""when Buckingham Palace decides to release it."" ""Traditionally the official announcement of the birth is placed on an easel just inside the gates of Buckingham Palace, but today social media is also used."" The official notice of the birth of a baby boy to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is put on display outside Buckingham Palace on Monday. On Monday afternoon, a framed bulletin announcing the birth was placed in the forecourt of the Queen's London residence sans name. And so the wait continues."
How to find your max heart rate for exercise,edition.cnn.com,"Angela Spence, The Conversation",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/max-heart-rate-partner/index.html,"You have your runners on, your FitBit is charged, but now what?
When you exercise, your heart and breathing rates increase, delivering greater quantities of oxygen from the lungs to the blood, then to exercising muscles. Determining an optimal heart rate for exercise depends on your exercise goal, age, and current fitness level. Heart rate and exercise intensity share a direct, linear relationship: the more intense the exercise, the higher the heart rate. Not exercising worse for your health than smoking, diabetes and heart disease, study reveals When you exercise at the highest possible intensity, your heart will reach maximal heart rate (HRmax), the fastest rate it is capable of beating. Read More But exercising at a maximal heart rate (HRmax) for every exercise session will not produce efficient fitness results. These high intensities can rarely be sustained, negating the potential benefit of the exercise. Exercise makes your heart more efficient Typical resting heart rate can vary quite substantially between people and even within an individual. Around 60-80 beats per minute (BPM) for adults is common. Heart rate can be easily be measured with devices like FitBits and Apple Watches, although they have their limitations. Improving your aerobic fitness reduces your resting heart rate, as the heart becomes more efficient with each beat. An athlete's resting heart rate, for instance, is typically around 40 BPM. How you can make time for moving In fact, evidence suggests that long-term exercise training increases the size of the heart , specifically the left ventricle , a phenomenon known as ""Athlete's Heart"". A bigger heart means more blood can be pumped with each beat, and fewer beats per minute are required to maintain blood flow around the body. This is a beneficial physiological adaptation allowing athletes to exercise at higher intensities for longer. How to calculate your maximal heart rate There is substantial variation in HRmax. The only true method of determining HRmax is to conduct a maximal exercise test. But HRmax can be estimated using formulas based on age. Why exercise won't make you lose weight The authors of a 2001 study proposed the following revised equation for estimating maximal heart rate: HRMax = 208 - (0.7 x Age) This means a 45-year-old would have a predicted HRmax of 177 BPM. Indeed, our genetics can influence actual maximal heart rates from their predicted value. However, HRmax is not a major determinant of exercise or athletic performance. Far more important is our physiological efficiency. Why stretching is still important for exercise and dieting When assessing heart rate, it's also important to take into account the effects of emotions such as excitement or fear, stimulants like caffeine, and circulating hormones like adrenaline, all of which can increase heart rate. Is exercising at maximal heart rates unsafe? In short, the answer is no. For most adults, the risk of not doing enough exercise is far greater than that of doing excessive endurance exercise. The health benefits of regular exercise are well established, although emerging evidence suggests excessive exercise may not provide extra cardiovascular health benefits. 7 health problems exercise can fix Likewise, there's a higher chance a sedentary person will experience an acute cardiac event, like a heart attack, during exercise when they're unaccustomed to high-intensity exercise , or they have a pre-existing heart condition. The maximal risk is 0.3 to 2.7 events per 10,000 person-hours. With a third of Australians not meeting the WHO recommended guidelines of accumulating 150 minutes of exercise per week, encouraging regular physical activity continues to be a pervasive public health message. In terms of assessing risk, an exercise pre-screening assessment with an ESSA-qualified exercise specialist will be able to assess and mitigate the risk of exercise participation. Exercise intensity: what happens when we go 'all out' Muscle cells require two key ingredients to function: fuel (glucose) and oxygen. Muscles rely heavily on blood vessels to deliver the necessary nutrients and oxygen around the body, and also to remove by-products such as carbon dioxide. The more muscles used in exercise, the more blood is distributed towards the active tissues. Bad heart? Time to hit the gym When the intensity of the exercise is particularly high, the muscles start to produce another by-product called lactate. Cells can also use lactate as a fuel although if production rate exceeds metabolism, lactate starts to accumulate and can interfere with cellular function. The point at which this by-product starts to accumulate is termed the ""lactate threshold"". Exercise is medicine, and doctors are starting to prescribe it Any exercise intensity that can be comfortably sustained is usually below this threshold, and will have an accompanying heart rate. As it is much easier to measure heart rate than lactate production, heart rate can be used as a surrogate measure of exercise intensity. What is the best exercise for heart rate? While interval-style exercise training is a popular choice for people who are time-poor, the intermittent nature of the exercise means heart rate will fluctuate, providing not much more benefit than traditional steady-state exercise. From a scientific perspective, athletes typically use heart-rate ranges to train at specific intensities during aerobic exercise, like cycling or long-distance running. Exercising at certain intensities are known to elicit adaptive responses from the body, for example, exercising at or below the lactate threshold. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
These intensities are called training zones and are expressed relative to HRmax. For instance, a light aerobic training session would be prescribed below 75% HRmax, while training at threshold (around 95% HRmax) will induce physiological change. Overall, some exercise is better than no exercise for your cardiovascular health. Accumulating 150 minutes of exercise per week is the minimum requirement for health benefit. Exercising at your maximal heart rate is not necessary to achieve these benefits. Athletes can use training zones, relative to HRmax, to achieve optimal adaptation and enhance endurance performance."
US threatens EU with tariffs over Airbus subsidies,edition.cnn.com,"Daniel Shane, CNN Business",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/us-eu-tariffs-airbus/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) The United States is threatening to impose tariffs on European goods worth billions of dollars, intensifying a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies.
The United States Trade Representative proposed levies on hundreds of categories of exports on Tuesday in retaliation for the European Union allegedly providing subsidies to Airbus ( EADSF ) . The goods range from Airbus jets and their components to European staples like wine, cheese and frozen fish. These exports are worth about $11 billion every year to European countries, roughly equal to the damage the United States believes the subsidies inflicts on Boeing ( BA ) and the US economy. Boeing is in crisis, but it is doing just fine in its race with Airbus ""When the EU ends these harmful subsidies, the additional US duties imposed in response can be lifted,"" US Trade Representative Lighthizer said in the statement. Read More The proposed tariffs are subject to public consultation in the United States and arbitration at the World Trade Organization, which is expected to deliver its findings in the summer. The dispute dates back to 2004, when EU authorities said Boeing received $19 billion in unfair subsidies from federal and state governments between 1989 and 2006. The US government filed a similar claim that year over European subsidies to Airbus. The World Trade Organization has handed down favorable rulings to both sides, underscoring the complexity of the dispute. The trade watchdog said last month that the United States had failed to stop giving Boeing illegal tax subsidies in Washington State, but cleared it of other allegations. It issued a similar ruling last year in the case brought by the United States over Airbus. It said Europe had breached some rules on subsidies, but dismissed other allegations. The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products! The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 9, 2019 The tariff threat issued by the United States on Tuesday risks further escalation. ""Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the EU to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft,"" Lighthizer said. A spokesperson for the European Commission said Tuesday that the bloc could soon launch its own retaliation tied to the Boeing case. ""The EU remains open for discussions with the US, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome,"" the spokesperson added. Airbus lands a massive deal with China as Boeing battles its 737 Max crisis American threats to hit the European Union with tariffs come amid rising trade tensions between the bloc and President Donald Trump's White House. Trump is considering whether to impose tariffs of up to 25% on European vehicle imports, a threat that has unnerved automakers in the industrial powerhouse of Germany. The US has already imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. The European Union retaliated with tariffs on more than $3 billion worth of American exports in June. The levies hit products such as motorcycles, orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, cigarettes and denim. The trading relationship between the two sides is worth more than $1 trillion annually, but Europe exports significantly more goods to the United States than the other way around. EU economies are already under pressure and new tariffs could further dent growth. The European Commission in February slashed its growth forecast for the bloc this year to just 1.5%. It cited ""increased uncertainty regarding trade policies"" as one reason for the downgrade."

The whole sci-fi scene is captured -- red martian terrain rearing up towards the star-drenched heavens, and an explorer made tiny by the power of the landscape. Behind the lens, photographer Albert Dros checks the shot and declares himself satisfied by shouting out a single word that has become his catchphrase. ""Epic!"" It's a word Dros will repeat many more times during a week-long road trip through the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan, of which the night shoots in ""Mars Canyon"" are a highlight. Small, remote and sparsely populated, Kyrgyzstan is a seemingly undiscovered world of breathtaking scenery that, thanks to recently relaxed visa rules, could easily be the next big thing in adventure travel . Wild magic Kyrgyzstan is home to a staggering diversity of landscapes. Courtesy Albert Dros Dros, a Dutch landscape photographer whose gorgeous images regularly crop up in the pages of National Geographic, first encountered the former Soviet nation's wild magic in 2018 when visiting his Kyrgyz girlfriend's family. Like many people, he had to look it up on a map first, and then brush off concerns about his safety visiting a ""stan."" Arriving in the capital Bishkek, he found a safe, welcoming country with diverse scenery that called out to his cameras. Beautiful Issyk-Kul is the world's second-largest saline lake. Barry Neild/CNN ""You have mountains like Europe, then on a two-hour drive you have something completely different,"" he says. ""Canyons and shapes that remind me of Utah and then, another two hours away, a beautiful valley that reminded me of the Himalayas."" Vowing to come back, he hit Google Earth to plan his next trip, scouting unusual topography to explore either on foot, with his Sony A7RIII camera, or from overhead, using his DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone. He zeroed in on an area of the Tien Shan mountains in eastern Kyrgyzstan that runs down to the southern shoreline of Issyk-Kul, a huge saline lake filled by melting snow from the country's high altitude frontiers with China and Kazakhstan. Related content The family of four who work, travel and live out of backpacks To help him out, Dros contacted Visit Karakol , a local tour company run by Timur Akbashev, who he met on his first trip. Akbashev, with young assistant Ibraim Almazbekov, brings the essential off-road vehicle to the road trip, plus a passion for exploring uncharted areas. And so, in early 2019, with the sun shining and patches of winter snow still on the ground, Dros, Akbashev and Almazbekov set off from the city of Karakol -- home to a small ski resort -- and begin their odyssey westwards. Waiting for perfection Dros visited ""Fairytale Canyon"" where rock structures resemble the Great Wall of China. Barry Neild/CNN Day one covers familiar ground for the Visit Karakol team, with stops at Broken Heart Rock, a well-known landmark and Skaza (Fairytale) Canyon, an extraordinary terrain of colorful weather-eroded rocks that, in one place, resembles the Great Wall of China.

After a few more hours of post-dawn shuteye, the team hits the road again, passing through Kaji-Say, a small town where the collapse of nearby Soviet-backed mining and uranium processing industries has clearly taken its toll.

He jokes with Akbashev that they should build their own tollbooth at the entrance and start charging. Few tourists have visited this hidden spot. Courtesy Albert Dros The new place names may, as Dros hopes, catch on via his considerable Instagram following, particularly as they weren't previously called anything. ""Kyrgyz people aren't bothered by names,"" Akbashev shrugs. ""There are so many places and mountains without any. Maybe under Soviet times they had names like Lenin Peak or Stalin Peak, but now, no."" Back to The Iceberg Over the next few days, the road trip visits more ""epic"" scenery spots, with highlights including the frozen, creaking waters of Orto-Tokoy reservoir and the more well-trodden highlands above the Boom Gorge, where sizzling power lines dangle from huge pylons. Dros pilots his drone in the highlands above Boom Gorge. Barry Neild/CNN Sometimes it's just a roadside spot where horses graze against a backdrop of mountain storm clouds. And in between, there are stops in comfortable small hotels and guesthouses, where hearty, delicious meals of dumplings and stews cooked by local families are accompanied by black tea, bread and homemade jams. But Dros the perfectionist is drawn back to ""The Iceberg."" Despite his epic night shot, he didn't capture it with the Milky Way in the background and the oversight begins to gnaw at him. ""What if someone else comes along and takes that shot?"" he wonders. ""The Iceberg"" plus Milky Way. Courtesy Albert Dros So, another sleepless night sees the crew reassemble in the darkness beneath the slab, Dros choreographing lights and Akbashev scrambling back up to his perch. As the constellations slide into view, the Dutchman captures the moment. And is he satisfied now? Almost. On the drive back to the hotel, a pink glow begins to build in the rearview mirror as soft daylight breaks over the snowcapped mountains. ""Ahhh, I just had a thought,"" he says ruefully. ""I should've flown the drone to capture the sunrise. You can't have everything."" "
Mnuchin vs. Democrats: 5 things to watch - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Donna Borak,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/mnuchin-house-hearings-what-to-watch/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will face House lawmakers in back-to-back hearings Tuesday, his first appearance since Democrats formally requested President Donald Trump's tax returns.
Democratic lawmakers can be expected to grill Trump's finance chief, who oversees the Internal Revenue Service, about whether he will comply with requests to hand over the commander in chief's personal tax returns, as well as about Trump's recent announcement of conservative commentator Stephen Moore and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain as picks for the Federal Reserve. Here's what to watch for when Mnuchin testifies before a House Appropriations subcommittee at 10 a.m. and the House Financial Services Committee at 2 p.m.: Trump's tax returns With a Wednesday deadline for the Trump administration to respond to a request from House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal for Trump's tax returns, Mnuchin will most certainly be asked about his position on the obscure law cited by the Massachusetts Democrat -- or whether he plans to intervene and block their release. Read More Trump has already made clear that he has no plans to make this fight easy. On Friday, his lawyers sent a letter to the Department of Treasury's general counsel dismissing the request as a politically motivated pursuit. ""The idea that you can use the IRS as a political weapon is incorrect as a matter of statutory law and constitutionally,"" Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. ""We should not be in a situation where individual private tax returns are used for political purpose."" Last month, Mnuchin told House lawmakers he would obey the law if he received a written request from Congress to turn over Trump's tax returns. He also sidestepped the issue by suggesting the decision would ultimately fall to the IRS commissioner, the country's federal tax collector. ""I will consult with the legal department within Treasury, and I will comply with the law, "" Mnuchin said then when asked if he would release the returns. Ethics issues Last week, Mnuchin became the third Trump Cabinet official cited for failure to comply with ethics rules in their financial disclosures, according to a federal government ethics watchdog. The Office of Government Ethics declined to certify the secretary's 2018 filing for neglecting to disclose that ethics officials within the Treasury Department had advised him that selling his stake in a film production company to his now-wife, Louise Linton, would not create a conflict of interest. The treasury secretary agreed to revise his federal ethics agreement and recuse himself from government matters that could impact the film production company, StormChaser Productions. Mnuchin told the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing last month that department ethics officials had informed him he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Linton. Mnuchin sold his film and real estate businesses in 2017 for at least $15 million as part of a string of divestments upon becoming Trump's treasury chief. The Federal Reserve The treasury secretary may again be called upon to act as the President's explainer-in-chief when it comes to his views on the Federal Reserve. Trump's plans to nominate Moore and Cain, both close political allies, have fed criticism that the President is trying to exert too much influence over the world's most powerful central bank for his own political purposes. In recent weeks, Trump has revived his barrage of criticism over the Fed's interest rate policy, going so far as to urge the central bank to cut rates in order to skyrocket the economy. ""They really slowed us,"" Trump told reporters Friday on his way to California to visit the US southern border with Mexico. ""I personally think the Fed should drop rates."" The President argued that if the Fed cut interest rates ""you would see a rocket ship."" But even so ""we're doing very well."" Trump's top economic advisers, including the National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, have defended the President's decision to express his views publicly. ""It's our point of view,"" said Kudlow, speaking at a breakfast roundtable last week hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. ""The Fed is independent and we're not trying to compromise that."" The treasury secretary has previously backed the President's prerogative to speak his mind on the Fed's policies, while trying to avoid the appearance of interfering in the US central bank. Trump's tariffs While a "" granddaddy"" trade deal with China has yet to take final shape, the President's repeated threats to close the US border have introduced a new twist in a separate trade deal with the nation's northern and southern neighbors, Canada and Mexico. On Friday, Trump said he would be inclined to override his pending United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement by imposing a 25% tariff on cars made in Mexico if the country doesn't help stem the flow of undocumented immigrants. The comments have come as Trump's economic advisers have been pushing Congress to ratify the trade deal they negotiated after the President decided he wanted to tear up the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump suggested that his tariff threat could ""supersede USMCA,"" potentially undermining the ratification of the trade deal, which he has lauded as replacing one of the worst deals he's ever seen , referring to NAFTA. Over the weekend, Kudlow suggested that the President wouldn't necessarily make good on his threat, describing it as more as a ""warning"" that should be heeded . Lawmakers could seek further explanation from Mnuchin, who has been leading trade negotiations with China alongside US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, on what the President may have in mind. Housing Mnuchin may be pressed on the Trump administration's plans to overhaul the nation's housing finance system , now that the President is calling on federal agencies to address the issue more a decade after the US government seized the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Last month, Trump directed the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop legislative and regulatory plans to revamp the two companies, both still under the government's control since the 2008 financial crisis. The President's directive, laid out in a memo, calls for ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie and improving the federal government's oversight of them. It remains unclear, however, what else will be included in a draft plan beyond preserving a 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Details of those plans may still be in the works, but Mnuchin could offer some clues on what the Trump administration may have in mind, including widening participation of the private sector."
"In one Louisiana parish, congregants wait for answers after 3 of their churches burned to the ground - CNN",us.cnn.com,"Christina Maxouris, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/tuesday-black-church-fires/index.html,"(CNN) Fires that consumed three historically black Louisiana churches in 10 days are believed to have been intentionally set, a local elected official said Tuesday.
The official did not provide specifics about the ongoing investigation but told CNN some pastors in the heart of south-central Louisiana's Cajun and Creole country are sleeping in their churches as a precaution against additional fires. It is still unclear who is responsible for the fires and will likely take investigators time to sift through what evidence remains to determine if the blazes are connected. As they do, residents and worshippers in St. Landry Parish, where all three fires occurred, are withholding judgment about what may have caused them, even as officials say they contained ""suspicious elements"" and the episodes evoke recollections of past acts of hate against black churches. ""I feel our district was being targeted because all three of the churches were in our district,"" Pastor Freddie Jack, the Seventh District Missionary Baptist Association president, told CNN's Don Lemon on Monday. Read More ""At first we thought it might have been an electrical problem, but then when the second church ... burning occurred I realized it was our sister church. ... Then two days later the third occurred so at least (to) me, (it) made me think that we're being targeted."" St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre burned on March 26, followed by Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2 and two days later, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in the same town. Officials are also investigating a fourth, smaller fire on March 31 at the predominantly white Vivian United Pentecostal Church in Caddo Parish, more than 200 miles north of St. Landry. The blaze was intentionally set. St. Landry Parish is nearly 42% black. Opelousas is 75% black. The city's mayor, Julius Alsandor, called the church burnings ""hideous."" ""The relevance and the impact on the people in the surrounding communities and especially the congregation of each of these churches, it's hurtful and there may be some fear that is being exhibited by those who are a part of the three churches,"" he said. Hurt, fear and confusion -- that's all the congregants are left with for now. ""We don't know why, we don't know when, we don't know who,"" the Rev. Gerald Toussaint of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church told CNN affiliate KATC. ""We will let the authorities handle that, but we just know a higher power and a higher authority who can bring this thing to fruition."" 'More questions than answers' In an appeal for the public's help, Gov. John Bel Edwards said he has directed the state fire marshal as well as local and federal authorities to ""aggressively investigative"" the fires. ""Churches are sacred places, and no one should fear for their safety in their house of worship,"" he said. ""And no one should be concerned that their house of worship would be destroyed."" ""Right now, there are more questions than answers, but hopefully the investigation will yield information we can share with the public in short order,"" the governor said in his State of the State address, according to CNN affiliate KTBS. The FBI and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting in the investigations. And as they look for answers, congregants wait. ""Something is not right, something isn't right, but God has the last word,"" Ethel Thomas, a member of Mount Pleasant, told KATC. ""We're going to keep on keeping on."" Thomas told the news station , ""It was heartbreaking, I wanted to cry, but I say I'll hold it in . ""I had cried so much already when they called to let me know that our church was burned. I didn't know what else to do, I just said, 'Lord you're in control.' "" NAACP labels the fires ""domestic terrorism' State Fire Marshal H. ""Butch"" Browning said in a statement there is ""clearly something happening"" in the community. ""We believe these three fires are suspicious,"" Browning said. ""We are falling short of talking about what caused the fires, falling short of saying they are related, however cognizant that there is a problem and no coincidence that there are three fires."" The NAACP labeled the fires ""domestic terrorism,"" adding the ""spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country."" The American Civil Liberties Union called the events ""deeply disturbing."" But Jack said it's just too early for conclusions. ""I can't say for one reason or another that the actual burning was a racist act or a hate crime until we can determine who caused them, who's behind them. I don't think that we can rightfully or truthfully say it was either or,"" he told Lemon. ""We need the facts before we can generate thought that's concerning what it was."" And the facts may take a while, because most of the evidence is likely gone. ""Investigating a fire is a very lengthy process,"" Browning said. ""It's one of the most complicated and unconventional crime scenes you'll ever enter because most of the evidence is burned away."" ""The problem with arson investigations is the same as bomb investigations: The evidence gets destroyed."" CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano said. ""That's going to be the issue. You've got to go back and piece this together when a lot of the evidence would have been burned up in the fire."" Authorities are reviewing a long list of clues. ""Similar type of accelerant, any type of incendiary device that could have possibly been planted there, and then link in the houses, what things could be found at what crime scene that could be linked to another, find out if there's a pattern and if there's somebody here who's a serial arsonist,"" Gagliano said. About 100 federal, state and local investigators are on the case, Louisiana Fire Marshal's Office spokeswoman Ashley Rodrigue said. Florida has sent seven people to help out the fire marshal's office. 'These houses of faith have historically been the targets of violence' Church burnings were a common occurrence in the Jim Crow era. And fires at black churches -- especially those in the South -- immediately bring to mind such racist attacks. ""For decades, African-American churches have served as the epicenter of survival and a symbol of hope for many in the African-American community,"" NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said. ""As a consequence, these houses of faith have historically been the targets of violence."" Why are black church fires associated with acts of hate? Several black churches in the South were burned in 2015 shortly after the mass murder of nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, though it is unclear if those fires were racially motivated. According to the latest data from the National Fire Protection Association, fires within religious and funeral properties have been on the decline for decades. Between 2007 and 2011, 16% were ruled intentional , according to the association."
Justine Ruszczyk killing: Opening statements Tuesday for former Minneapolis officer - CNN,us.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/minneapolis-police-noor-shooting-trial/index.html,"(CNN) Opening statements are scheduled to be given Tuesday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer accused of fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk, an Australian-born woman killed a month before her wedding.
Mohamed Noor, a 33-year-old Somali American, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the 2017 shooting that led to protests in the city and the resignation of the Minneapolis police chief. Jury selection began a week ago. A jury of 10 men and 2 women was seated Monday morning, CNN affiliate WCCO reported . There are four alternates, two men and two women. Authorities said Ruszczyk called 911 on July 15, 2017, and reported a possible sexual assault in an alley behind her house. Officers Matthew Harrity and Noor were dispatched to the scene and arrived in a squad SUV at 11:37 p.m., according to a criminal complaint. At 11:40 p.m., Ruszczyk was shot in the abdomen and died minutes later at the scene. Harrity told investigators he heard a noise and was startled by a glimpse of a person coming up to the officers' SUV, the complaint states . Prosecutors said Noor, sitting in the passenger seat, pulled out his gun and shot across the vehicle to hit Ruszczyk, who was outside the driver's side door. Read More Former Minneapolis officer to stand trial in Justine Ruszczyk's death In announcing the charges, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Noor acted recklessly. ""In the short time between when Ms. Damond Ruszczyk approached the squad car and the time that he fired the fatal shot, there is no evidence that Officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat, or confirmed a threat that justified the decision to use deadly force,"" Freeman said . The officers were wearing body cameras but did not turn them on before the shooting, and the squad car camera did not capture the incident, investigators said. The Minneapolis Police Department has since updated its body camera policy to direct officers to turn on their body cameras upon being dispatched to a scene. As with many cases involving police shootings, the trial is likely to revolve less around who carried out the shooting than on whether it was a legally justified use of force. Harrity has identified Noor as the shooter, and testing of the bullet determined it was fired from Noor's gun, the complaint states. In general, officers on trial for shootings are rarely convicted, partly because jurors tend to give police the benefit of the doubt, experts say . A former East Pittsburgh police officer was recently found not guilty in the fatal shooting of an unarmed teenager. Ruszczyk had traveled from her native Australia to Minneapolis to live with her fiancé, and she was killed a month before her planned wedding. She had trained as a veterinarian but then became a spiritual healer, yoga and meditation instructor and life coach, she said on her web page. Shooting victim Justine Ruszczyk had planned to marry fiancé Don Damond in August 2017. Noor came to the United States at a young age and became the first Somali American assigned to the Fifth Precinct, which covers Southwest Minneapolis. He joined the Minneapolis Police Department in March 2015 . He expressed condolences to Ruszczyk's family in a statement through his lawyer shortly after the shooting. ""He takes these events very seriously because, for him, being a police officer is a calling,"" the statement said. ""He joined the police force to serve the community and to protect the people he serves. Officer Noor is a caring person with a family he loves and he empathizes with the loss others are experiencing."""
Barr faces Congress for first time since end of Mueller investigation - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/william-barr-hearing-congress-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday he expects to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report ""within a week,"" but he does not plan to provide Congress with an unredacted version of the report, setting the stage for a showdown with congressional Democrats.
Barr told a House subcommittee Tuesday that the redactions process was going ""very well,"" and he would use color-coded categories and explain the rationale for the redactions that are made from Mueller's nearly 400-page report. But he said he would not accede to Democrats' demands that he provide the full, unredacted report to Congress, arguing that he cannot legally release grand jury material and that he did not plan to ask a court to release it. ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr said. Barr's comments Tuesday come ahead of a brewing clash between Congress and the Trump administration over the Mueller report, as Democrats are indeed prepared to go to court in an effort to obtain the unredacted Mueller report and the special counsel's underlying evidence. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have already authorized a subpoena for the full Mueller report and the underlying evidence, though House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said Tuesday he is waiting to see what Barr releases before moving forward on the subpoena. ""I presume we're going to get the redacted report within a week. When we do so, if we don't get everything, we will issue a subpoena and go to court,"" the New York Democrat told reporters Tuesday. Read More Barr has said four types of information would be redacted from the report he submits: grand jury material, classified information, material tied to ongoing investigation, and information that could harm ""peripheral third parties."" Barr told the House Appropriations subcommittee, where he was appearing Tuesday to testify on the budget, that he was willing to work with Nadler to provide some additional information to the committee beyond the redacted report. But he stopped well short of pledging to provide the full report as Democrats have demanded. In particular, Barr rebuffed Democratic arguments that he could provide grand jury material to Congress. ""Until someone shows me a provision"" permitting the release of grand jury material, Barr said, ""Congress doesn't get"" that material. After Barr's testimony, Nadler said in response that the courts have ""given the Congress the grand jury information when requested in many, many different instances."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also weighed in to object to Barr's proposed redactions. ""We all understand that redacting is important to protect sources and methods -- beyond that he has no business redacting,"" the California Democrat said. ""And we will have that discussion."" The fight is likely to wind up in court, which Barr alluded to on Tuesday. ""The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court,"" he said in response to Democratic questioning. Barr defends four-page summary Democrats pressed Barr on his decision to release a four-page summary of Mueller's conclusions, particularly in light of reports that some on Mueller's team have told others they were unsatisfied with how Barr characterized the investigation. Barr said that Mueller was given the opportunity to review the summary Barr released last month detailing the Mueller's conclusions, and the special counsel declined to do so. Barr said he suspected that members of Mueller's team wanted more from him, but he explained that he wasn't trying to summarize the full report with his four-page letter, which stated Mueller's investigation did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's team and Russia, and that Mueller reached no conclusion on the question of obstruction of justice. ""I suspect that they probably wanted more put out,"" Barr said. ""In my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize, because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also, would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once."" Barr said the White House did not review his letter, but he declined to answer questions about whether the White House has been briefed on the report. ""I've already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week,"" Barr said. ""And I'm not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it."" Barr's answers did not appear to satisfy Democrats, who repeatedly urged Barr to release the full report and fully explain any redactions that Barr decided to make. ""I think it would strike a serious blow to our system, and yes, to our democracy, if that report is not fully seen,"" said New York Rep. Jose Serrano, the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Justice Subcommittee holding Tuesday's hearing. ""We're not here today to be in a confrontational situation with you. We want to help you do the job, and you need to help us do ours."" In one week, 4 major Trump-policy spins and flips House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey told Barr that his handling of Mueller's report was ""unacceptable"" and the summary he released ""raises more questions than it answers."" ""I look forward to reviewing the Mueller report myself, and I know my constituents do as well,"" Lowey said. ""I understand that portions of it must be redacted as a matter of law, but my hope is that you will stop there and bring transparency to this process as soon as possible."" Lawmakers mull next steps While the Judiciary Committee is leading congressional efforts to obtain the full Mueller report, Serrano and Lowey said after the hearing that the Appropriations Committee could also play a role in pressuring the Justice Department, given their control of the DOJ budget. Serrano told reporters it was ""too important"" not to do everything to try to force its release. Republican lawmakers in the hearing mostly avoided talking about Mueller, although several raised comments from Democrats stating there was evidence of collusion between Trump's team and Russia. Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama, the top Republican on the subcommittee, chided Democrats by lamenting that ""so many of the questions here this morning have gone toward a grassy knoll conspiracy theory regarding the Mueller report."" While Mueller questions dominated Wednesday's hearing, lawmakers did press Barr on a number of other topics, including the administration's lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act , the immigration policy on family separations, hate crimes and cybersecurity issues with China. Barr is scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on May 1 and May 2 for hearings before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees specifically to answer questions about the Mueller investigation. Barr is also testifying before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday, where he's likely to face similar questions ahead of the Mueller report's release. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."
The Trump appointees' dilemma - the law or the President? - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Stephen Collinson,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-kirstjen-nielsen-immigration/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sooner or later, many of the President's subordinates face the same dilemma.
They can respect the law or they can work for Donald Trump. It's often just not possible to do both. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen became the latest Cabinet member to pay the price for not letting Trump do what he wants -- and on the issue he cares about more than any other -- when she was forced to resign on Sunday. It was a case of the Trump revolution eating one of its own, since Nielsen, an immigration hardliner, was seen as insufficiently doctrinaire despite becoming the face of the zero-tolerance immigration policy that led to child separations and caused outrage last year. But CNN reporting makes clear that Nielsen also lost her job because she ultimately came to believe that Trump's wilder impulses on immigration -- an issue that he sees as critical to his reelection in 2020 -- threatened America's security and may have run contrary to the law. Read More Nielsen is not the first senior Cabinet official to lose their career after coming up against Trump's vision of his own authority -- or his instinct to elevate largely unaccountable appointees, such as domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller or his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. In their own ways, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former FBI Director James Comey and even former Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- the spiritual father of much of the administration's immigration policy -- suffered a similar fate. Unlike the President, these public servants eventually concluded that the Constitution, the rule of law and the norms of democratic governance rendered some of Trump's behavior unacceptable. Nielsen's departure, which was accompanied by a White House sweep against her department that also accounted for the director of the Secret Service, sends a signal that Trump is ready to do whatever it takes to stem the crisis on the US-Mexico border, which is threatening to expose his vows to stem the flows of migrants from Central America as hollow. That will be welcome news for Trump's supporters, who relish his bypassing of the Washington establishment and overwhelmingly back his hard line on immigration and warnings that the US is under siege by an invading tide of criminals. But the President's desire to honor the faith of his base on immigration eventually made Nielsen's position untenable. Crossing legal lines Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants CNN's Jake Tapper reported on a series of clashes leading up to Nielsen's ouster on Sunday that reveal a President demanding obeisance to his orders, even if they cross legal lines. A ""ranting and raving"" Trump demanded the closure of the US-Mexico border at El Paso,Texas, in late March, despite being told by Nielsen it was a dangerous idea, according to an attendee at a White House meeting. Trump has also been pushing to reinstate and escalate the separations of undocumented migrant parents and children at the border, despite the practice being outlawed by the courts and causing bipartisan and international outrage. The newly purged Department of Homeland Security may well embark on a policy that has been discussed for months that would give migrants at the border a tough decision to make: Remain united as a family in detention or agree to be separated while the parents go through the immigration court process, a senior administration official told CNN's Jim Acosta. The President also told border agents last week not to let any more asylum seekers into the country, forcing officials to quietly countermand his instructions after he had left the room, Tapper reported. CNN also reported Monday that Trump is regretting his climb down on a vow to slam shut the southern border -- despite being warned that it could trigger an economic disaster for many Americans. As the final days of Nielsen's tenure were unfolding, it was Miller, perhaps the only top political figure to the right of Trump on immigration, who engineered a sweep to topple the top leadership in Nielsen's department. Miller is now in charge of all immigration and border-related issues, according to CNN's Abby Phillip. His rise is just one front in a widening war between Trump's inner circle and the infrastructure of permanent government that the President has vowed to disrupt. Trump has in recent months removed irritating checks on his power from the Defense Department and the Justice Department. Defense Secretary James Mattis left after being surprised by Trump's shock announcement of a Syria troop withdrawal, after being seen as an ""adult in the room"" for much of the first two years of the President's term. Trump's rhetorical assault on the Federal Reserve is now being stiffened with an attempt to put true believers, such as Stephen Moore and Herman Cain on its board, raising doubts about the independence of the world's most powerful central bank. On Tuesday, another key figure in Trump's power shuffle will face scrutiny on Capitol Hill. Democratic lawmakers are likely to question Attorney General William Barr over claims that he was appointed solely because he had written a memo to the Justice Department arguing that special counsel Robert Mueller's obstruction case was legally flawed. In office, and once Mueller ended his investigation last month, Barr wrote to Congress to say the special counsel had not reached a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice -- but that Barr and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had decided there was not sufficient evidence to support such a claim. Barr has yet to release the full report so that members of Congress can make up their own minds. 'Acting' secretaries bolster Trump's power How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen Elsewhere in Trump's government, a Cabinet stocked with acting secretaries in key positions -- who in many cases lack relevant experience, authority or an independent power base -- seem ill prepared to resist the President. ""I sort of like 'acting,'"" Trump told reporters earlier this year, not hiding the attraction of the departure of Cabinet heavyweights. ""It gives me more flexibility."" The turmoil in the administration appears to be about more than Trump's effort to consolidate maximum power for himself. Nielsen's departure, like that of other prominent figures from the Cabinet, also appeared to have been driven by a desire to eradicate any voices that the President does not want to hear. One of the benefits enjoyed by the global dictators Trump admires so much is they do not have to put up with dissent. In the democratic context of the US government, the President now appears to be trying to create a similar echo chamber for himself. Chilling words with an authoritarian lineage such as staff ""purge"" and ""unhinged"" are now being uttered by officials who have spoken to CNN to describe Trump's attitude toward the government and his current mood. According to multiple reports, Nielsen was frequently put in the position of trying to explain to the President that his radical urges on immigration were dangerous, impossible or unlawful. In addition to CNN's reporting, The New York Times wrote that Trump used to call Nielsen in the mornings to demand actions that were ""clearly illegal,"" such as halting all asylum claims. Nielsen is now among other former Trump appointees who discovered that the President's radical beliefs and vision of how to wield his power come up against legal or ethical constraints. Tillerson, for instance, said last year that he often had to stop Trump from trampling boundaries. ""So often, the President would say, 'Here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it,'"" Tillerson told former CBS anchor Bob Schieffer. ""And I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law. It violates treaty,'"" Tillerson said. Comey testified to Congress that he felt uncomfortable when Trump tried to establish a ""patronage relationship"" with him in violation of the invisible wall between the presidency and the Justice Department and asked him to go easy on his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The President frequently railed against Sessions because Sessions followed his legal obligations and recused himself from the Russia investigation. And Kelly said his job often involved explaining to Trump the limits of his authority under the law. But the President never ordered him to do anything illegal, Kelly told the Los Angeles Times in an interview."

Biden 2020 candidacy would confront Democrats with their past - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Ronald Brownstein,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/joe-biden-democratic-party-2020-past-race-culture/index.html,"(CNN) The Democratic Party of 2020 will face a reckoning with the Democratic Party of 50 years ago with former Vice President Joe Biden set to announce Thursday that he's a candidate for president.
When Biden, who's now 76, was first elected to the Senate from Delaware in 1972, Democrats relied on an electoral coalition that revolved primarily around working-class white voters, many of them conservative on cultural issues, particularly those involving race. With those voters in sight, Biden was one of many generally liberal Democrats during that era who took nuanced, or even openly conservative, positions on racially infused issues, including school busing and crime. Biden now will force Democrats to decide whether those earlier views are still acceptable in a party that has moved left since then on all racially related issues, in response both to shifting attitudes in the country and the increasing diversity of its voters. ""His career is really a microcosm of the changes in the Democratic Party over the past half-century, all in one person,"" says Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and longtime Democratic policy analyst. The Democratic electorate is older, more moderate and less educated than you think The electoral landscape that confronted Democrats of Biden's generation is almost unimaginable for today's younger party activists. Read More Biden, a lawyer, began his political career in 1970 by winning a seat on the county council of New Castle, Delaware, which included Wilmington, the state's largest city. Two years later, he won election to the US Senate, just weeks before his 30th birthday. He served in the Senate for the next 36 years, until he joined President Barack Obama as his vice president in 2009. Over that period, the country -- and the Democratic coalition -- experienced enormous demographic change. In the 1976 election, when Democrat Jimmy Carter won the presidency, whites without college degrees composed 70% of all voters, according to an analysis of census data by the nonpartisan States of Change project. Minority voters -- almost all of them African-American -- made up only about 11% of voters then, with college-educated whites providing the remaining 19%. Even as late as 1992, when President Bill Clinton was first elected, those blue-collar whites still represented about 60% of all voters, with college whites composing about 25% and minorities the remaining 15%. According to the States of Change calculations, working-class white voters cast a majority of the votes in every presidential election until 2008 (when they represented 48% of the voters). African-American voters were already reliable Democrats by the 1970s, having moved decisively toward the party after the passage of the landmark civil rights laws in the 1960s. But white-collar whites in that period still leaned heavily toward the Republican Party: During the three presidential elections of the 1980s, Presidents Ronald Reagan and then George H.W. Bush carried college-educated whites by at least 20 percentage points each time. The result that Democrats in almost every state -- and certainly in presidential elections -- relied on an electoral coalition centered primarily on whites without college degrees and secondarily on African-Americans. In 1980, for instance, fully 60% of Carter's votes in his losing race against Reagan came from working-class whites, according to calculations by longtime Democratic elections analyst Ruy Teixeira, one of the founders of the States of Change project. ""That's a world that is gone, and it is easy for people to forget how different things were back then, both in terms of voting behavior and relative size of the groups,"" says Teixeira, co-author of ""America's Forgotten Majority,"" a 2000 book about the white working class. By 2016, blue-collar whites, in stark contrast, accounted for slightly less than 30% of the votes that Hillary Clinton won. That was partly because the group continued its long-term decline as a share of the total vote (reaching 44% by the States of Change calculations), but also because it broke so decisively toward Donald Trump. Minorities, including growing populations of Hispanics and Asian-Americans, provided about 40% of Clinton's votes, while whites with college degrees, among whom Democrats have gained strength steadily since the 1990s, contributed the remaining 30% or so. Younger Democrats reared in a political world where the party mobilized that latter coalition have little experience with the choices the party faced in the 1970s and 1980s. The principal electoral challenge facing Democrats during the first decades of Biden's career was crafting an agenda and message that could unite working-class whites and African-Americans. ""It was the central issue,"" said Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg, who became nationally known from his studies of white working-class alienation from the Democratic Party in Macomb County, Michigan, after the 1984 election. ""Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, were seen as very responsive to African-American voters in their time, yet they were also candidates who stretched to reach white working-class voters. You could not contemplate being successful and sustainable as a national party through Bill Clinton without making an imperative of (attracting) very strong support with both those groups."" Tensions in appealing to coalition Issues relating to racial equity were always the most vulnerable link in this chain. The Democratic reliance on white working-class voters in those years meant that their coalition included a significant number of whites who held conservative positions on race-related issues and even many with antagonistic views toward African-Americans. In the University of Michigan's National Election Studies , a comprehensive post-election survey, at least 70% of self-identified Democrats opposed busing to achieve school integration in 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984. Even as late as 1994, in polling by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, fully 59% of all white Democrats, and 63% of white Democrats without college degrees, rejected discrimination as the principal cause of inequality and said instead that ""Blacks who can't get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition."" In Pew's most recent polling, just 25% of all white Democrats, and 33% of them without college degrees, endorsed that view. The party ""had a significant number of very conservative, racially conservative, probably racist, Democrats in their coalition,"" said Greenberg. ""There was no other way to imagine it. That was your electorate. That was your state, that was your citizenry."" Delaware, a state with a large blue-collar white population, embodied the tensions in the Democratic coalition. In 1970, the year Biden first held elected office there, census figures showed that 84% of the state was white, and just 14% of white adults held college degrees. For Biden, like most northern Democrats in those years, there was no path to electoral success that did not include a competitive performance among non-college white voters: If he allowed his deficit with them to grow too large, there were simply not enough other voters to overcome it. With that electoral challenge as the backdrop, Biden followed a careful path on race-related issues throughout his long Senate career. Civil rights groups generally considered him an ally and praised his record on housing rights, voting rights, the passage of the Violence Against Women Act and his work as Judiciary Committee chair to win Senate ratification in 1994 for an international conventional on ending racial discrimination, fully 28 years after the US signed it. Joe Biden's handling of Anita Hill hearing re-emerges with latest controversy But Biden also regularly frustrated civil rights activists. He ""was a mixed bag,"" said one leading civil rights lobbyist during those years, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about Biden's record. ""He was certainly in the Democratic Party mainstream but he was to the right of center on some of the social justice issues of the times. He was always a supporter of voting rights; he was always a supporter of housing. He wasn't John Stennis"" -- the segregationist Democratic senator from Mississippi -- ""he wasn't a conservative Democrat or Republican. But he did have some issues where he was right of center. I think Joe has evolved. I don't think there was any question about that."" When Biden enters the contest, the most volatile racial issue he'll confront is likely the one that intersects with gender: his handling of Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment against Republican Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. But two other policies that embody shifting Democratic sentiment will also provoke extensive debate. One was Biden's prominent role in the 1970s promoting legislation to limit the use of school busing to combat racial segregation. He wasn't alone in that: Dozens of House Democrats, for instance, routinely voted for legislation to limit busing. But as historian Jason Sokol chronicled in his 2014 book ""All Eyes Are Upon Us, Race and Politics from Boston to Brooklyn,"" Biden was a leader in Senate efforts against busing, working arm in arm with archconservatives such as Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina well into the 1980s. ""What Biden did is he made anti-busing more politically respectable,"" said Sokol, an associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. Although busing was usually the only practical means to achieve school integration, Sokol says, ""Biden claimed he was pro-integration but anti-busing, which was disingenuous, but that was the position a lot of (Democrats) were looking for."" Choices defensible at the time? Two decades later, Biden was a principal author of the crime bill that passed under Bill Clinton. A complex balancing act between liberal and conservative priorities, the bill provoked withering criticism at the time from conservatives, but in recent years it has faced unmitigated hostility from liberals and civil rights advocates who see it as a wellspring of mass incarceration. Many centrist Democrats say Biden's choices on these issues are defensible on substantive grounds. When Congress passed and Clinton signed the crime bill, for instance, the violent crime rate was nearly double its level today, according to FBI figures, and most African-American mayors and members of Congress supported the legislation. And busing was always deeply controversial, with polls showing whites overwhelmingly opposed and even African-Americans closely divided over the policy. ""Could opposition to busing be defended in the context of the times?"" asked Galston, who served as Walter Mondale's issues director in the 1984 presidential campaign and Clinton's deputy domestic policy adviser. ""Yes, definitely. Because it was a policy which was typically, though not invariably, judicially enforced that lacked public authorization or buy-in, and that rested on certain premises about what equal educational opportunity amounted to that were eminently questionable."" The larger issue is not whether Biden can muster explanations for each of the positions he took on racially tinged debates decades ago. The real question may be whether a party that has moved to a very different consensus on those issues is better served by a nominee who ever held those views, whatever the justification, or one whose agenda and message have always reflected its modern racial perspective. Joe Biden's long path to woke 2020 Teixeira says it would be a mistake for Democrats to ""write off"" older white politicians -- and by implication older white voters -- from Biden's generation. ""It is just off to take people out of their historical context and judge them by the same norms we have today. It doesn't help to understand who they are and what they did when they did it,"" he says. ""Politicians say stuff not just because that's what they believe at the time, it's because they are embedded in a certain political context in which they are trying to put together 50+1 (of the vote). And they have to be sensitive to the views of their constituency."" Steve Phillips, author of the 2016 book ""Brown Is the New White"" and an advocate for increased Democratic focus on mobilizing nonwhite voters, doesn't entirely disagree. But he worries that Biden remains too focused on mollifying the blue-collar white voters whose conservative racial views shaped his formative political years. ""He obviously said very troubling, outright disqualifying things, particularly during the busing days, given where the party and the country is at today,"" said Phillips, who is supporting Cory Booker in 2020. ""But you need to allow the potential for him to have grown and evolved. The concern is that the premise of his candidacy is his capacity to win over those conservative white working-class voters who still hold those views. That's what is going to be the difficult needle to thread. Does he think his personality alone will attract them or will it be the issue set?"" On the other hand, even some veteran civil rights leaders frustrated with aspects of Biden's record still consider him the party's strongest potential nominee in 2020, precisely because he seems the best suited to win back the three Rust Belt states that Trump dislodged from the ""blue wall"" in 2016: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Early polling has found a stark generational divide in attitudes toward Biden, with the former vice president generating much more support among older Democratic voters than younger ones. When he joins the field, the debate over his posture on race -- which encapsulates the often wrenching evolution of the Democratic Party itself through his career -- seems likely to harden that divide. Biden's candidacy may measure the tolerance of younger Democrats for the choices that their elders made to navigate a very different demographic and political era."
"Democrats are older, more moderate and less educated than you think - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Analysis by Harry Enten,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democratic-party-voters-analysis/index.html,"(CNN) Listening to Joe Biden, you might come away with the sense that he is out of touch with the Democratic Party's electorate, which many believe is younger, further left and better educated than it used to be. Indeed, the party's voters may be all of these things.
But, as HuffPost's Kevin Robillard wrote , the former vice president seems to be making a bet that there are still plenty of older, more moderate and less educated Democrats who can help him win the nomination. That might not be a bad bet. Democratic Party voters are older than younger There's a case to be made that Democrats are younger than they were at the beginning of the decade. Those younger than the age of 40, for example, made up 6 more points of the Democratic vote in the 2018 midterm than they did in the 2010 midterm, according to a Catalist (a Democratic firm) estimate of the national voter file . The exit polls illustrate a similar trend. A Biden 2020 candidacy would confront Democratic Party with its past Read More But even if Democrats are younger than they once were, Millennials and Generation Z voters (roughly those younger than 40) are still very much the minority of Democrats. They made up just about 29% of all Democratic voters in the 2018 midterm, per Catalist. In fact even when you add in those 40 to 49 years old, you still only account for about 44% of Democratic voters in 2018. In other words, the AARP demographic (age 50 and older) were the majority (56%) of 2018 Democratic voters, per Catalist. And in case you were wondering, those ages 65 and older (27%) made up about double the percentage of Democrats who were younger than 30 (14%). The exit polls can differ slightly on the exact level each age group makes up of the electorate, though all sources agree that a majority of Democratic voters are age 45 and older. That's a big deal when age was the No. 1 predictor of vote choice in the 2016 primary and continues to be a primary driver of vote choice in early 2020 polling . A candidate who is receiving the bulk of their support from older voters -- like, for example, a Biden -- is in a considerably better position than a candidate who does best with younger voters. It's how Hillary Clinton won last time, despite Bernie Sanders swamping her among younger voters. Democratic Party voters are more moderate than very liberal Whether it be the exit polls, Gallup or the Pew Research Center , there's no doubt Democrats are more liberal than they once were. In the exit polls, for example, the percentage of Democratic voters who identify as liberal rose by double-digits between the Democratic midterm blowouts of 2006 and 2018. Still, moderates and conservatives make up about 50% of all Democrats. In the 2018 midterms, the exit polls found that moderates and conservatives made up 54% of those who voted Democratic. Pew similarly put moderate and conservative Democrats as 54% of all self-identified Democrats and independents who lean Democratic voters in 2018. Gallup's 2018 figures had moderates as 47% of all adults who self-identified as Democrats. And while liberals make up about 50% of Democrats, many of them are only ""somewhat liberal."" In a Quinnipiac University poll taken last month, people who identified as ""very liberal"" were only 19% of all Democrats and independents who leaned Democratic. Very liberals made up the same 19% of those who said they were voting Democratic in Suffolk University's final 2018 pre-election poll . The 2016 primary exit polls discovered that about 25% of Democratic primary voters called themselves very liberal. Put another way: the moderate/conservative wing of the Democratic Party likely still makes up at least 2 times as much of the party's voters than the very liberal flank. Again, this is probably good news for Biden, given that his support in the last Quinnipiac University poll among moderate and conservative Democrats (37%) was more than double his support from very liberal Democrats (14%). It further suggests that Democrats who run far to the left may be misreading where the electorate is. Democratic Party voters are more likely to be working class Democratic voters are more likely to have a college education than they used to. Catalist, Pew and Gallup all show a trend toward Democrats being more educated than they used to be. Despite this growing education, however, Democratic voters are still more likely to lack a college degree. According to Catalist, about 59% of voters who cast a ballot for the Democrats in 2018 didn't have a college degree. Gallup and Pew have the percentage of self-identified without a college degree well into the 60s. The exit polls, which historically have painted a better educated electorate than other sources, found about 55% of 2018 Democratic voters lacking a college degree. Even among white Democrats, there are still many voters who have no college degree. Among whites, Catalist calculates the percentage of 2018 Democratic voters without a college degree at about 54%, compared to 46% who had a college degree. Gallup and Pew have the percentage of self-identified Democrats without a college degree in the high 50s among whites. The exit poll had them as a slight minority at 48% of voters who went for the Democrats in 2018. As the Washington Post's David Byler put it , ""Democrats should stop chasing Trump's base. They have their own white working-class voters."" When you broaden it out to look at all Democratic voters, all the sources I could find have whites with a college degree as less than a third of all Democrats. Most have them at less than 30%. Currently, there doesn't seem to be a large education divide in Democratic primary polling. A candidate who is able to tap into the large working class vote within the party, however, will have a big time advantage. All together, a Democratic candidate of the old, moderate and working class stands a better shot of winning the primary than one of the young, left and college educated."

Immigration Kirstjen Nielsen was just the beginning. Donald Trump is cleaning house at Homeland Security . A day after Nielsen was dropped as secretary of Homeland Security, Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles was given the boot. And word is at least two other senior leaders will soon be shown the door, too. One official described all this to CNN as "" a near-systematic purge ."" Many say this is the handiwork of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who has been nourishing the President's inclinations to take ever more hardline stands on immigration. So, Trump is now sweeping Homeland Security of those deemed not tough enough on the issue. We're also now getting more info on what led to Nielsen's ouster. She rebuffed Trump's order to shut down the border crossing at El Paso, Texas, and bring back the family separations policy for migrants. When Nielsen told the President closing the border crossing would only end legal trade and travel (and that migrants would just go between ports), Trump told her, ""I don't care."" And last week, during his visit to the border at Calexico, California, the President told border agents not to let migrants in, two sources told CNN. After Trump left the room, the agents' bosses told them essentially to disregard it, because doing what Trump ordered would be breaking the law. CNN's Stephen Collinson said it's a dilemma many in the administration end up having to deal with: ""They can respect the law or they can work for Donald Trump. It's often just not possible to do both."" JUST WATCHED Admin source likens firings to 'purge' of national security officials Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

New UK divorce law aims to end blame game,us.cnn.com,"Jack Guy, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/uk/no-fault-divorce-uk-scli-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) UK divorce laws will change to allow couples to separate without apportioning blame in order to ""reduce family conflict,"" the Ministry of Justice announced Tuesday.

Experts say current rules can make conflict worse, reduce the chances of reconciliation, and damage children who are stuck in the middle, according to the release.

A new law could replace the evidence requirement with a statement of irretrievable breakdown, remove the ability of one partner to contest a divorce, and introduce the possibility of a joint application for divorce. ""This much-needed change to the law is good news for divorcing couples and particularly for any children involved,"" said Aidan Jones, CEO of relationship support charity Relate.

Is the sultan of Brunei imposing Sharia law to clean up his family's image?,us.cnn.com,Rebecca Wright,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/brunei-sultan-intl/index.html,"(CNN) For decades, he was known as a godfather of excess. The wealthiest man in the world for many years, the sultan of Brunei knew how to spend the vast riches that flowed from the oil deposits bestowed upon the tiny Southeast Asian nation he controls with absolute power.
But now, the 72-year-old sultan of the former British protectorate is in the spotlight for a very different reason as he comes under fire from governments and activists around the world for introducing the Sharia Penal Code, which includes punishments such as death by stoning for adultery or homosexuality, or amputation of limbs for theft. Critics say this move towards the most draconian form of Sharia law is a sign of the rising influence of conservative Islam across Southeast Asia -- and an indication that the aging monarch wants to leave a religious legacy that seeks to compensate for his family's controversies. ""The sultan is getting on in years now, and his family hasn't always had the cleanest of reputations,"" said Matthew Woolfe, the founder of human rights group The Brunei Project. ""Certainly, there are a lot of people talking about the hypocrisy of laws that the sultan and his government are implementing when his family, in the past, could have been seen as being in violation of these laws with some of their antics,"" said Woolfe. ""Some people see it as a way of cleaning up and perhaps creating his legacy.""

It's a message which seems at odds with the lifestyles the sultan and his brother Prince Jefri Bolkiah are alleged to have lived. During the 1980s and 1990s, they had a reputation for throwing lavish parties, going on multi-million-dollar spending sprees, and running a ""harem"" at their palace. They owned luxury hotels in London, Paris and New York. Jefri also famously owned a giant luxury yacht he named ""Tits"" and two smaller vessels called ""Nipple 1"" and ""Nipple 2.""

""The sultan of Brunei and his brother Prince Jefri were known for their harems, their excesses in terms of purchasing of cars, their sexual exploits,"" said Bridget Welsh, a Southeast Asia expert and associate professor of political science at John Cabot University. ""All of these women were coming into Brunei in the 1980s, so the image of them being the playboys was very prevalent."" Inside the 'harem' An American woman, Jillian Lauren, published an autobiographical book ""Some Girls: My Life in a Harem"" in which she alleged that she was recruited to be one of 40 women for Prince Jefri's harem when she was an 18-year-old aspiring actress in New York in the early 1990s. Lauren said she spent 18 months in the harem on and off -- and was Prince Jefri's ""second favorite"" mistress for a year. ""He's crazy, and decadent,"" Lauren told CNN in 2011, referring to Prince Jefri. ""At that time, it was attractive to me, his confidence and his charisma and his recklessness."" In 2015, she told a ""60 Minutes Australia"" documentary, ""The Playboy Sultan,"" that she had sex with Prince Jefri ""hundreds"" of times and also had a sexual encounter with the sultan himself. She says her book was banned in Brunei. ""I am a witness to the fact that the sultan was drinking, was committing adultery, was not exactly living on the straight and narrow,"" Lauren told CNN in May 2014. Lauren said she felt compelled to tell her story when she saw the announcement in 2013 that Brunei was planning to introduce Sharia law. ""It's maybe indicative of the way that a lot of people in power behave,"" Lauren said. ""Which is, it's one rule for them and another rule for the rest of the people, who don't have so much money and don't have so much power."" In response to CNN's request for comment regarding these claims, the Brunei government said in an email, ""we vehemently deny the allegations."" Miss California Shannon Marketic, center, reacts as she is crowned Miss USA 1992. Another alleged recruit to the harem, former Miss USA Shannon Marketic, tried to sue the sultan and Prince Jefri in a US court in 1998, alleging that she was subjected to demeaning treatment and 32 days of virtual imprisonment at the sultan's palace. Court documents show that Marketic said that 30 to 100 women would be in attendance at the sultan's palace at any one time; some of them understood they were recruited to perform sex acts, but others including Marketic believed they were hired to perform legitimate promotional work for a salary of around $3,000 per day. Britain's Prince Charles walks with the sultan of Brunei as they attend a high tea at the sultan's palace in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, in 2017. ""Palace staff told Plaintiffs to attend nightly parties and functions at discotheques where the Sultan, Jefri, and their male friends would allegedly select which women they would have sexual intercourse with,"" according to the court documents. The brothers denied the allegations, and the sultan said he had never even met Marketic, Brunei state media reported at the time. The US court eventually granted the brothers immunity from legal action, owing to their joint status as a foreign head of state. A life of excess At that time, it seemed that the brothers were untouchable. In 1996, the sultan threw the party to end all parties to mark his 50th birthday. Guests flew in from all over the world for the lavish two-week celebration, which included a banquet dinner for 3,000 people, a special concert by Michael Jackson in a purpose-built stadium, and a polo match with Britain's Prince Charles. The total price tag was an estimated $25 million -- small change for the sultan. Michael Jackson preforms before an estimated audience of 60,000 in Brunei on July 16, 1996. The party was the pinnacle of decades of decadence and mind-boggling spending by the royal family. But it also preceded the beginning of a very public and embarrassing falling out between the brothers. At the time, Prince Jefri was Brunei's finance minister and the chairman of the government-owned Brunei Investment Agency (BIA). But after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, his extravagant tastes were exposed with an audit of the BIA. The sultan accused the prince of embezzling nearly $16 billion from the royal treasury -- which he denied. Prince Jefri was stripped of his ministerial role and BIA position, and went into self-imposed exile where he tried to fight a legal battle brought by the sultan for the remaining assets of the BIA. Eventually, the case ended in an out-of-court settlement. The sultan of Brunei (left) with his brother Prince Jefri Bolkiah, pictured together after a polo match. In an effort to recoup some of the losses, a debtor auction took place in August 2001, where 10,000 of Prince Jefri's possessions went under the hammer over six days. The lots included a bronze-plated, eight-foot high Trojan horse which went for $1,470, gold-plated Jacuzzis, porcelain flamingo statues, and simulators for a Comanche helicopter, an Airbus jet and a Formula 1 racing car. Despite the losses the prince allegedly inflicted on the royal coffers, and with declining oil reserves and a faltering economy in Brunei, the sultan still commands a personal fortune of $20 billion, Forbes estimates . The sultan's life is one filled with hyperbole. He was the world's richest man for many years -- before Bill Gates shot past him in the 1990s. His palace -- Istana Nurul Iman -- in the Brunei capital Bandar Seri Begawan, is the biggest private residence in the world , with 1,788 rooms, 257 bathrooms, and air-conditioned stables for 200 polo ponies. The sultan and his family also own thousands of luxury cars -- including F1 supercars, rare Lamborghinis and around 500 Rolls Royces, the largest private collection of the luxury British auto in the world . Michael Sheehan, a broker who owns and operates the website Ferraris Online, wrote in 2011 about his visit to the compound which housed some of the car collection in an article republished by Gizmodo, describing it as a ""massive example of wretched automotive excess."" The 2,500 cars Sheehan estimates he saw, included Bentleys, Aston Martins and Ferraris, many of which were ""poster children for deferred maintenance,"" left to rot in the heat and rain. ""Their lifestyle is literally inconceivable for the vast majority of humanity,"" said Michael Auslin, a fellow in contemporary Asia at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. ""It's lavish, beyond belief. Take everything you can imagine in the lifestyles of the rich and famous and multiply it."" Britain's Queen Elizabeth II meets the sultan of Brunei at Buckingham Palace in 2017. The new generation of the Brunei royal family also appears to have taken up the tradition of living in excessive luxury. The sultan has had three wives -- his first cousin, an air hostess, and a TV anchor -- with whom he has a total of 12 children. Several of the royal offspring have had extravagant wedding ceremonies in Brunei, including Prince Abdul Malik, the third-born son of the sultan, who was married in 2015. Forbes described it as ""a royal wedding to beat all royal weddings,"" with more than a week of celebrations including a main ceremony that saw the couple dressed in ""extravagant"" matching outfits draped in jewels, with the bride holding a bouquet made of gems and precious metals instead of flowers. Brunei's Prince Abdul Malik, the second son of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, ties the knot with IT instructor Dayangku Raabi'atul 'Adawiyyah Pengiran Haji Bolkiah, 22, in a ceremony in April 2015. Another of the sultan's sons, Prince Abdul Mateen, is an Instagram star with more than a million followers who watch him play polo and spend time on yachts, private jets and in world-class hotels. And Prince Azim, the sultan's second-born son, is well known for hosting extravagant parties with celebrity guests including Pamela Anderson, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. Notably, the latter two are both winners of the ""Ally Award,"" which honors those who support the LGBT community. Jared Murillo, Prince Azim of Brunei and Pamela Anderson attend the launch of her exclusive Coco De Mer collection at Morton's on December 5, 2017, in London. Since Brunei's new Shariah penal code was announced, several A-list celebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres have started a protest campaign, leading a boycott on luxury hotels around the world owned by the Brunei government. Insulated from criticism For most of the estimated 450,000 Bruneians -- 79% of whom are Muslim -- the wealth and spending habits of the royal family is something they have to accept without question. The sultan is essentially a one-man government -- the ""Supreme Executive Authority"" with titles including prime minister, defense minister, finance minister, and foreign affairs minister. The media is tightly controlled; Brunei is ranked as one of the worst countries in the world in the annual press freedom index, coming in at 153 out of 180 -- which places it below Russia and Myanmar. Criticism against the family or government is illegal and can result in a jail term for sedition. Portraits of Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and Queen Saleha are seen beside a slogan (partially cutoff) in Bahasa Melayu that reads ""Obedience to Allah, loyalty to the king, love for the country"" in Bandar Seri Begawan on October 4, 2017. Many Bruneians are also willing to turn a blind eye to the excesses inside the palace, experts say, as they are also benefiting from the nation's oil riches. There is no personal income tax, there is subsidized housing, free education and health care, and of course, low fuel and electricity costs. Per capita, Brunei is the fourth wealthiest country in the world, according to Forbes in 2017. ""They're probably fairly well insulated from criticism, as the Bruneians are living better than almost anyone else in Asia,"" said Michael Auslin of the Hoover Institution. ""Here you're talking about oil wealth that has been spread throughout society, the majority are benefiting."" Some observers say that the sultan wants to consolidate that support by increasing his grip on power. Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah (center) returns after blessing to the royal couple Princess Hajah Hafizah Sururul Bolkiah and her groom Pengiran Haji Muhammad Ruzaini (left) at the end of the sitting-in-state on royal dais ceremony at Istana Nurul Iman in Brunei's capital Bandar Seri Begawan on September 23, 2012. The new Sharia laws are part of a ""deeper rationale of controlling the state"" in order to ""legitimize the exploitation of resources which he and his family have benefited from,"" said Bridget Welsh, of John Cabot University. In the sultan's national televised address on Wednesday, he reiterated Brunei's Islamic identity multiple times during the speech. ""As a small nation, we always prioritize our prayers to Allah,"" the sultan said. ""This is driven by our national philosophy of Malay, Islamic, Monarchy (MIB) that has run here since many hundreds of years ago."""
Hong Kong': Umbrella Movement activists found guilty for role in protests,us.cnn.com,Eric Cheung and James Griffiths,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/asia/hong-kong-occupy-umbrella-protests-trial-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) A Hong Kong court has found three prominent activists guilty for leading mass pro-democracy protests that brought parts of the city to a standstill in 2014 .

Lawmaker Tanya Chan was also found guilty of ""incitement to commit public nuisance."" Sentencing will take place later, with the defendants facing up to seven years in prison on each charge.

US threatens EU with tariffs over Airbus subsidies,us.cnn.com,"Daniel Shane, CNN Business",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/us-eu-tariffs-airbus/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) The United States is threatening to impose tariffs on European goods worth billions of dollars, intensifying a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies.
The United States Trade Representative proposed levies on hundreds of categories of exports on Tuesday in retaliation for the European Union allegedly providing subsidies to Airbus ( EADSF ) . The goods range from Airbus jets and their components to European staples like wine, cheese and frozen fish. These exports are worth about $11 billion every year to European countries, roughly equal to the damage the United States believes the subsidies inflicts on Boeing ( BA ) and the US economy. Boeing is in crisis, but it is doing just fine in its race with Airbus ""When the EU ends these harmful subsidies, the additional US duties imposed in response can be lifted,"" US Trade Representative Lighthizer said in the statement. Read More The proposed tariffs are subject to public consultation in the United States and arbitration at the World Trade Organization, which is expected to deliver its findings in the summer. The dispute dates back to 2004, when EU authorities said Boeing received $19 billion in unfair subsidies from federal and state governments between 1989 and 2006. The US government filed a similar claim that year over European subsidies to Airbus. The World Trade Organization has handed down favorable rulings to both sides, underscoring the complexity of the dispute. The trade watchdog said last month that the United States had failed to stop giving Boeing illegal tax subsidies in Washington State, but cleared it of other allegations. It issued a similar ruling last year in the case brought by the United States over Airbus. It said Europe had breached some rules on subsidies, but dismissed other allegations. The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products! The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 9, 2019 The tariff threat issued by the United States on Tuesday risks further escalation. ""Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the EU to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft,"" Lighthizer said. A spokesperson for the European Commission said Tuesday that the bloc could soon launch its own retaliation tied to the Boeing case. ""The EU remains open for discussions with the US, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome,"" the spokesperson added. Airbus lands a massive deal with China as Boeing battles its 737 Max crisis American threats to hit the European Union with tariffs come amid rising trade tensions between the bloc and President Donald Trump's White House. Trump is considering whether to impose tariffs of up to 25% on European vehicle imports, a threat that has unnerved automakers in the industrial powerhouse of Germany. The US has already imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. The European Union retaliated with tariffs on more than $3 billion worth of American exports in June. The levies hit products such as motorcycles, orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, cigarettes and denim. The trading relationship between the two sides is worth more than $1 trillion annually, but Europe exports significantly more goods to the United States than the other way around. EU economies are already under pressure and new tariffs could further dent growth. The European Commission in February slashed its growth forecast for the bloc this year to just 1.5%. It cited ""increased uncertainty regarding trade policies"" as one reason for the downgrade."
"Uber didn't do enough to warn women about series of rapes by fake Uber drivers in LA, lawsuit alleges",us.cnn.com,Sara O'Brien,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/uber-fake-driver-scheme-lawsuit/index.html," Nine people were sexually assaulted by ""fake Uber drivers"" between September 2016 and February 2018 in Los Angeles, a new lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit is being brought by three of the individuals, all listed as Jane Does, who claim they were raped by individuals who posed as Uber drivers to pick up passengers. It was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday. The Jane Does are accusing Uber of negligence, arguing the company failed to warn them and other customers about fake drivers targeting women who were drinking in the area, despite being allegedly warned by law enforcement, according to the complaint. The suit comes more than a week after University of South Carolina student Samantha Josephson was kidnapped and killed when she got into a vehicle she mistakenly thought was the Uber she ordered. According to the complaint, law enforcement warned Uber on at least five occasions of assaults by fake Uber drivers within a section of Los Angeles where several popular nightclubs are located. The lawsuit claims the warnings came from the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and took place before the first Jane Doe was allegedly raped on June 18, 2017. Read More The LAPD declined to comment to CNN Business, and the LASD could not be reached for comment. F. Edie Mermelstein, who is representing the plaintiffs, also declined to comment. Stressed out and at risk: Inside Uber's special investigations unit Uber told CNN Business it had not yet seen a copy of the lawsuit and so could not comment on it specifically, but an Uber spokesperson said in a statement, ""We have been working with local law enforcement, including the LAPD, to educate the public about how to avoid fake rideshare drivers for several years. In 2017, we launched a national campaign to remind riders to make sure they get in the right car by checking the information, like the license plate and car make and model, shown in the app. These important reminders have been part of our safety tips, and our law enforcement team regularly discusses this issue with agencies across the country."" The lawsuit claims Uber has ""egregiously chosen to hide and minimize"" its safety problems, which often concern ""young, intoxicated female passengers, the very demographic targeted by Uber's safety marketing campaigns."" The new lawsuit alleges that Uber makes it easy for sexual predators to obtain ""print at home"" Uber labels to deceive passengers. Uber offers a printable version of the Uber logo for drivers who want to print one themselves and place it in their window — no login is required to download the file. The lawsuit also claims the company has not adequately warned passengers of the dangers of fake Uber drivers, including the recent murder of Josephson in South Carolina. In the aftermath of Josephson's death, there's been a flurry of attention to safety features built into the Uber app that customers can rely on to double-check the name, pictures and license plates of vehicles before they get in. These measures are inadequate, the Jane Does allege in the lawsuit. ""Uber Defendants fail to take into consideration that the customer they market to are typically inebriated causing enhanced difficulty in using this 'matching system,'"" the suit reads. The company could do more to help inebriated passengers verify who their drivers are, the lawsuit alleges. Uber, which is expected to go public later this year, has ""placed profits over safety by deliberately failing to implement any warning system regarding this sexual assault scheme so as to rapidly expand its profits and not deter any potential users,"" the lawsuit says. A CNN investigation, published and aired in April 2018, found 103 Uber drivers in the US who were accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in the four years prior. CNN's analysis was the result of an in-depth review of police reports, federal court records and county court databases for 20 major US cities. CNN investigation: 103 Uber drivers accused of sexual assault or abuse For more than a year, CNN has been pushing Uber to reveal its data on allegations of sexual abuse and assault on its platform. Uber, which vowed to release a safety transparency report following the CNN investigation, has said the numbers will not be ready until sometime in 2019. After CNN began asking questions about sexual assaults, Uber announced increased safety measures including a partnership with RapidSOS. It added an emergency button in the Uber app that sends a rider's location and relevant information to a police agency when pressed. Uber also revamped its background check policy, and now conducts annual checks on drivers. Following CNN's investigation, Uber announced it would do away with a policy that previously forced individuals with sexual assault complaints into arbitration and made them sign non-disclosure agreements."

The anti-Facebook: Inside Pinterest's slow and quiet rise,us.cnn.com,Seth Fiegerman,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/pinterest-slow-rise/index.html," The team at Pinterest was nervous.
For most of its early history, the digital scrapbooking service had grown unimaginably fast. Millions flocked to it in 2011 and 2012, despite minimal coverage in the tech press. Pinterest grew so quickly that its small team of engineers raced to keep the site up and running, fixing outages on street corners, at coffee shops and, in at least one case, on a paddle boat. It was the kind of momentum that felt like destiny. ""We'd come to Silicon Valley — the California Gold Rush — hoping to hit something big,"" said Marty Weiner, a member of Pinterest's founding team. ""This, I felt like I've hit this thing. This could be the thing that lets me retire."" ""This is going to be the new Facebook. A billion users,"" thought Ryan Probasco, an early engineer at Pinterest. But by 2013, the stampede of new users started to slow noticeably. Pinterest set up war rooms where employees spent hours poring over data to understand the cause of the slowdown and what they could do to address it. Even today, people who worked at Pinterest during that period seem to have a different answer for why growth began to lag: the rise of Instagram, the struggle to attract men, or maybe just the limits of the word-of-mouth marketing that had worked in its first years. Read More Mark Zuckerberg had a different opinion. In Pinterest's early days, when the service was still growing at a fast clip, the Facebook CEO told one of his employees that he thought Pinterest was interesting, but ""niche,"" according to a source with knowledge of the conversation. To Zuckerberg, niche meant it would end up with 200 million to 300 million users. So far, he's right. (Facebook declined to comment for this story.) Ryan Probasco, an early Pinterest employee, remembers thinking, ""This is going to be the new Facebook. A billion users."" Then the company was hit by a noticeable slowdown in new users. Pinterest could have attempted to prove Zuckerberg wrong by racing to roll out new features and supplementary services, or perhaps spending large sums to acquire buzzy startups and new users. Instead, Pinterest's leadership chose to move slower and more deliberately in stark contrast to Facebook's move fast and break things mantra, according to interviews with nearly a dozen former Pinterest employees and people close to the company, many of whom spoke with CNN Business on condition of anonymity. Remarkably, it has put Pinterest's brand in a stronger position today, but not entirely for reasons the company could have predicted. Pinterest has its moment For years, Silicon Valley lionized companies that grew fast and asked for forgiveness instead of permission. Now the industry is facing a moment of reckoning over how these same companies are run. Facebook ( FB ) , the benchmark for success with billions of users and a hugely profitable business, is now under fire for an inability to adequately protect its massive platform. Uber became the most valuable US startup, only to be upended by its own brash culture and growth-at-all-costs ethos. It has since steadied itself, but only after a dramatic executive upheaval, including the ouster of co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick. And a number of so-called unicorns, including Uber, Lyft ( LYFT ) and WeWork, are either going public or advancing toward that goal with unprecedented losses of nearly $1 billion or more a year, which have raised concerns among industry watchers. Against this backdrop, Pinterest is expected to make its Wall Street debut on the New York Stock Exchange this month. The reception to Pinterest's public offering could signal how much investor appetite there really is for a technology company that follows a more cautious playbook. Pinterest files to go public. Its not-so-secret weapon: Moms Pinterest resisted throwing money at its problems, debated product tweaks extensively and did not rush to copy features that helped larger competitors achieve viral growth, employees said. Fond of touting itself as an anti-social media platform , Pinterest never introduced live-streaming or standalone messaging apps, nor did it become a primary hub for news. These features attracted press and users for other companies, but were also later abused by bad actors. ""The company is not flashy and doesn't try to generate a lot of buzz or press for every little thing it does,"" said Kamran Ansari, former head of corporate development at Pinterest. ""It doesn't get some of the notoriety, but I think the term that comes to mind is: built to last."" Pinterest's goal, he added, was ""building a meaningful business that's going to be sustainable."" ""It never had its media moment. It was sandwiched between Twitter's hyper-growth, and then almost immediately after came Instagram and Snapchat.""
Andrew Lipsman, analyst with eMarketer
At times, however, this culture resulted in product tweaks being debated to death, bordering on indecision. Pinterest underinvested in certain key products, like its advertising technology, which may have jeopardized its initial traction with marketers. And it was overshadowed in the press by newer, flashier platforms like Snapchat. In the words of one former Pinterest employee, moving slower was both a ""virtue"" and something that likely ""destroyed value"" for the company. Pinterest declined to comment on this story. The company's IPO prospectus, filed in March, hints at the tensions of this strategy. Pinterest generated more than $750 million in revenue for 2018 — an increase of 60% from the prior year — while shrinking its losses to $63 million, which practically rounds up to profitability compared to Uber's $1.8 billion loss in the same year. In fact, Pinterest was in the black in the fourth quarter. But its audience size and engagement remain well behind many of the companies it cites as competitors. Pinterest has more than 250 million monthly users, barely a tenth of Facebook's user base and precisely what Zuckerberg predicted years earlier. Unlike Facebook, Snapchat ( SNAP ) and Twitter ( TWTR ) , Pinterest chose not to disclose its number of daily active users and said that it does ""not anticipate that most of our users"" will use the service on a daily basis. The smaller audience is both a boon and a burden. It could hurt Pinterest on Wall Street, where investors have hammered Twitter and Snapchat for user growth that falls far below the lofty standards set by Facebook. But being smaller also gives Pinterest the luxury of being more thoughtful in its approach to protecting the platform. ""The scale makes a huge difference,"" said Kate Klonick, a law professor at Yale who researches the technology sector and is close to members of Pinterest's content moderation team. ""They don't have the type of scrutiny on them that Facebook does."" A Pinterest banner hangs on the facade of the New York Stock Exchange during the morning rush in February 2018. Pinterest is expected to go public later this month. Today, Pinterest's CMO is pitching the service as ""one of the truly positive corners of the Internet."" That reputation was burnished in February by its bold attempt to combat vaccine misinformation on its platform. Pinterest blocked searches on the platform related to vaccinations in order to curb the spread of anti-vaxx content. Other social media sites have since stumbled to tackle the problem . The perception of Pinterest as a safe haven could help the company as it goes public. Marketers and users are eagerly searching for a less toxic alternative to the Facebook-Google duopoly that dominates digital media. ""This is a case where you're going to have people rooting for it,"" said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at eMarketer who tracks Pinterest. Klonick likens the Pinterest story to The Tortoise and The Hare. ""They kind of crept along. They just kept going. Maybe they'll eventually win the race, or provide a different model [for success]."" An under-the-radar success story From the start, Pinterest was a service built by and for people outside the Bay Area bubble. Ben Silbermann, the co-founder and CEO, grew up in Iowa, raised by parents who were doctors, with visions of becoming a doctor himself. When he did take a job in San Francisco, it wasn't a technical role but rather handling customer support issues at Google ( GOOGL ) . In 2010, Silbermann launched Pinterest with two co-founders, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra. After a slow first few months, Pinterest took off — not with the usual tastemakers and early adopters, but with a demographic often ignored by the tech industry: women. Specifically, women in flyover states, looking to bookmark recipes and items to purchase. This dynamic hasn't really changed in nine years. In its filing to go public, Pinterest said that two-thirds of its user base today are women. More than that, it claimed its audience includes ""eight out of 10 moms"" in the US. Silbermann held meetup events, personally took customer calls and visited Apple stores to ""change all the computers to say Pinterest,"" according to one talk he gave. But he resisted press interviews in the early days. Most colleagues describe Silbermann with the same mix of words: thoughtful, modest, shy. ""Almost frustratingly humble,"" said Sahil Lavignia, an early Pinterest employee. Ben Silbermann, the chief executive of Pinterest, in San Francisco in August 2018. Silbermann's press aversion, combined with the service's appeal outside Silicon Valley, limited early media coverage of Pinterest despite its rapid growth. In early 2012, ComScore declared Pinterest had hit the 10 million monthly user milestone in the US faster than any independent website ever. ""It never had its media moment,"" said Lipsman, who was previously SVP of marketing and insights at Comscore. ""It was sandwiched between Twitter's hyper-growth, and then almost immediately after came Instagram and Snapchat. Just as Pinterest had its chance to shine, it was competing for attention with other key players."" One former employee said they felt Snapchat's success was the most ""heartbreaking"" to watch. It launched after Pinterest and ""took away all the new shiny object"" fascination with the latter. Even now, with Pinterest set to have its moment on Wall Street, the employee noted how difficult it is for brands to ""get cool again."" The Pinterest playbook: Move slow and debate things In 2016, the year Snapchat's parent company began prepping for an IPO and Instagram rocketed to 500 million monthly users under Facebook's ownership, the Pinterest team had a drawn out back-and-forth over the word ""save."" True to its name, the company offered a ""Pin it"" button to encourage users to add items to their Pinterest boards. Tests showed changing it to the more intuitive ""save"" label would boost user engagement, especially outside the US, but some questioned whether it would be at odds with the Pinterest brand. ""Save"" won out , but only after a debate that one former employee said ""took a long time to get through."" The process was emblematic of the pros and cons of a company taking a more thoughtful approach to building up its audience and revenue. Under Silbermann's leadership, Pinterest was careful not to rush to make changes simply to juice growth. He pushed for ""more research and discussion before jumping into a particular strategy,"" Ansari said. In the process, he built a distinct brand, but frustrated some employees by, they say, taking too long. Scott Belsky, an early Pinterest investor, said Silbermann explained his thinking by referencing his experience growing up in a family of doctors, in which you are expected to study for years before ever getting a chance to operate. ""He always thought about applying what he was exposed to in the world of medicine,"" Belsky said. ""Getting something right regardless of how much time it takes, as opposed to constantly moving fast and breaking things."" Kamran Ansari, Pinterest's former head of corporate development, says the company focused on ""building a meaningful business that's going to be sustainable."" Each year, Silbermann would ""proclaim a theme"" for the team to focus on, Belsky said. One year might be monetization, the next might be going international. ""It was his way of pacing the company ... and getting all [the] energy to get something right,"" Belsky said. But Pinterest didn't always get its pacing right. The team initially underestimated just how much they'd need to invest to build an advertising product that could compete with the sophisticated standards set by Facebook and Google, according to two former employees. ""They just didn't have enough engineers working on the product,"" one former employee said. This may have made Pinterest's road to going public even longer. ""A bully in the market"" Pinterest lists several competitors in its IPO prospectus, ranging from predictable names like Facebook and Snapchat to shopping services like Amazon and lifestyle verticals like Allrecipes. But its most dangerous competitor may be the service Pinterest mentioned parenthetically alongside Facebook: Instagram. Both services launched in 2010. Both focused on visual content and satisfy our appetite for foodporn and home decor ideas. But unlike Pinterest, Instagram was inherently viral. It tapped into existing friend networks, attracted celebrities and influencers, and benefited from Facebook's backing. ""They were always two months ahead of us on the growth curve,"" said Weiner, the early Pinterest employee. Another former employee said Pinterest's team viewed Instagram as the ""biggest threat."" Pinterest founder Ben Silbermann on creating the anti-social media platform With Facebook's backing, Instagram topped 1 billion monthly active users in 2018, dwarfing Pinterest. It is increasingly stepping on Pinterest's toes — not unlike it did in the months before and after Snapchat's parent company went public. Last month, Instagram made it easier to shop within the app, two weeks after Pinterest added more shopping features. Instagram is also said to be testing public ""Collections,"" similar to Pinterest's core feature. Instagram rolled out the option to save posts in private collections in 2017. ""The biggest competitor to Pinterest isn't Amazon. It's Instagram,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. ""All Instagram has to do is add like features. They are kind of a bully in the market."" Even with that threat, some insiders still believe Pinterest can be a service used by everyone. ""I think we have to admit it's a little slower getting there,"" said Probasco. ""But I think the mission is massive: the idea that we can connect everybody to the things they love and help them discover new things they love. It's a human need."""
Walmart is doubling down on robot janitors. Here's why,us.cnn.com,Nathaniel Meyersohn,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/walmart-robots-retail-jobs/index.html," Walmart wants store workers to help out customers instead of mopping up floors and unloading boxes in backrooms. So it's increasingly turning to robots to fill those tasks.
The world's largest retailer announced Tuesday that it is adding thousands of new robots to its stores. By next February, it expects to have autonomous floor scrubbers in 1,860 of its more than 4,700 US stores. Walmart will also have robots that scan shelf inventory at 350 stores. And there will be bots at 1,700 stores that automatically scan boxes as they come off delivery trucks and sort them by department onto conveyer belts. Walmart says these ""smart assistants"" will reduce the amount of time workers spend on ""repeatable, predictable and manual"" tasks in stores and allow them to switch to selling merchandise to shoppers and other customer service roles. ""The overall trend we're seeing is that automating certain tasks gives associates more time to do work they find fulfilling and to interact with our customers,"" CEO Doug McMillon said last year of the new technology in stores. Walmart will deploy 920-pound autonomous floor scrubbers in 1,860 of its stores by next year. The retailer believes that bringing on bots will lift sales and make stores more efficient. Walmart also says bots limit worker turnover. That's because it's hard to consistently find workers to unload trucks and keep up stores overnight. Read More Walmart has been testing out this technology in hundreds of stores over the past year. Its expansion plan means that the innovations have been effective for Walmart so far. It also signals that robots will play a key role in the retailer's store strategy going forward. Big stores and new functions McMillon often cites Walmart's ( WMT ) vast store network as its biggest advantage over rivals, including Amazon ( AMZN ) . Walmart is within 10 miles of 90% of the US population. But its 178,000 square-foot supercenters are expensive to operate, especially as more shoppers buy online. Walmart invested more than $2 billion last year to remodel stores around the country and equip them to handle customers' online purchases for in-store pickup. For example, Walmart said Tuesday that it would bring 16-foot-tall pickup towers — automated vending machines that quickly fetch customers' online orders — to 900 new stores this year. Retail's Amazon antidote: Buy online, pickup in store Walmart is adding robots to help it manage rising costs, including for store labor. Unemployment is at its lowest level in decades , and Walmart and other retailers have increased wages and benefits to attract and keep workers. ""There is a labor shortage in retail,"" said Kirthi Kalyanam , director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara University. ""It will not be easy for Walmart to add labor to perform these functions. So a high level of automation is required."" Other retailers and grocery chains are bringing on robots in their stores to reduce costs and assist workers, too. Giant Food Stores is placing ""Marty,"" a tall, gray robot with googly eyes , in all of its 172 grocery stores. The bot roams around stores looking for spills. Robot janitors and shelf scanners Walmart's 920-pound self-driving floor scrubbers , called the ""Auto-C,"" use automated technology to navigate custom routes around the store and mop up the floors. The machine relies on sensors to scan for people and aisles. Walmart tested it at 360 stores before deciding to roll it out to an additional 1,500 locations. ""It relieves associates of a job that, quite frankly, is unpopular,"" Mark Ibbotson, head of Walmart's US central operations and real estate, said last year. Walmart also has been running an experiment at 50 stores with ""Auto-S,"" a shelf-scanning robot . The bot travels around aisles and identifies which items are low or out of stock and makes sure that prices and product labels are accurate. That information is important to help Walmart squeeze out sales. That bot will soon be in 300 more stores. Walmart's shelf-scanning robot moves around aisles and identifies which items are low or out of stock. And Walmart experimented with a bot in around 500 stores that unloads boxes off delivery trucks and automatically scans and sorts the items by department. Walmart says the unloader saves time and has reduced worker turnover in the labor-intensive back areas of the store. So it's bringing it to 1,200 new stores. ""We're seeing increases in sales and reductions in turnover in what had been a very difficult job to fill,"" CEO McMillon said last year. Walmart says all three robots will soon share data with each other to get products to the shelves more quickly and ensure aisles are clean and fully stocked. The future of retail work Although Walmart maintains that the bots allow workers to engage more with customers, labor advocates worry that automating manual tasks will trigger layoffs in retail . Walmart has said that it will reduce the hours it assigns workers to unloading boxes and mopping the floors. That will lead to some employee attrition over time, Walmart said. ""As we evolve, there are certain activities, certain jobs that'll go away,"" Walmart US CFO Michael Dastugue said at an analyst conference last month. But Walmart expects to use some of the hours it saves because of the robots to assign workers to newly created roles, such as selecting customers' grocery-pickup and delivery orders. Dastugue said that technology will force employees to be flexible and ""be able to handle change."" ""We may need them to do them one activity in the morning and a different activity in the afternoon,"" he said."
Carlos Ghosn video: Former Nissan boss says he's the victim of a conspiracy - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Kaori Enjoji, CNN Business",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/carlos-ghosn-video-nissan/index.html,"Tokyo (CNN Business) Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has again professed his innocence in a new video and accused executives at the Japanese carmaker of conspiring to remove him from power.
""This is about a plot, this is about conspiracy, this is about backstabbing,"" Ghosn said in the seven-minute video, which was recorded before he was arrested last week in Japan for a fourth time . Ghosn, who once led a global autos alliance that consisted of Renault ( RNLSY ) , Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, claimed in the video that fears over a merger had prompted a revolt at Nissan and led to his ouster. Carlos Ghosn arrested again but vows he 'will not be broken' Neither Ghosn nor his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, offered a response to the latest allegations of financial misconduct that prompted the auto executive's arrest and return to jail. Nissan declined to comment on the video, but a spokesperson for the company said an ""internal investigation has uncovered substantial evidence of blatantly unethical conduct"" by Ghosn. Read More ""The company's focus remains on addressing weaknesses in governance that failed to prevent this misconduct,"" the spokesperson added. Japanese prosecutors accused Ghosn last week of siphoning off $5 million in payments made by Nissan ( NSANF ) to a dealer that he controlled. Ghosn is awaiting trial on separate charges that he understated his income for years and abused his position by transferring personal investment losses to Nissan. He has denied those charges. ""Unless Ghosn can offer evidence showing he did not steal from Nissan, his position is untenable,"" said Stephen Givens, who has been practicing law in Japan for more than 30 years. ""If the facts are as suggested, this is devastating for Ghosn,"" added Givens. Carlos Ghosn professes his innocence in a new video. Hironaka told reporters that he would file a special appeal to Japan's Supreme Court on Wednesday, arguing that there was no reason for Ghosn's rearrest. Ghosn is now back at the Tokyo jail where he was held for 108 days until he posted $9 million bail in March. Prosecutors can hold Ghosn until April 24, after which they must indict or release him. His arrest and detention has led to scrutiny of Japan's judicial system, which allows suspects to be questioned without a lawyer. Prosecutors in Japan also boast an extremely high conviction rate. Carlos Ghosn's lawyer tried to keep his release low profile. It backfired bigtime Hironaka criticized the treatment of Ghosn on Tuesday, saying the morning raid that preceded his latest arrest was ""inhumane."" Lawyers, including former public prosecutors, say that complaints of human rights abuse will do little to aid Ghosn's defense when his trial begins later this year. Renault unveiled new allegations against Ghosn last week, claiming that expenses incurred by its former CEO and chairman involved ""questionable and concealed practices"" that violated its ethics rules. The French carmaker also announced Ghosn's resignation from its board. Asked Tuesday whether Ghosn had any regrets about the nearly 20 years he spent leading Nissan, Hironaka said: ""He's saying it is a conspiracy. He doesn't think there is anything to regret."" Nissan cut its last remaining ties with Ghosn on Monday when shareholders voted to oust him from the board."
The anti-Facebook: Inside Pinterest's slow and quiet rise - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Seth Fiegerman,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/pinterest-slow-rise/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The team at Pinterest was nervous.
For most of its early history, the digital scrapbooking service had grown unimaginably fast. Millions flocked to it in 2011 and 2012, despite minimal coverage in the tech press. Pinterest grew so quickly that its small team of engineers raced to keep the site up and running, fixing outages on street corners, at coffee shops and, in at least one case, on a paddle boat. It was the kind of momentum that felt like destiny. ""We'd come to Silicon Valley — the California Gold Rush — hoping to hit something big,"" said Marty Weiner, a member of Pinterest's founding team. ""This, I felt like I've hit this thing. This could be the thing that lets me retire."" ""This is going to be the new Facebook. A billion users,"" thought Ryan Probasco, an early engineer at Pinterest. But by 2013, the stampede of new users started to slow noticeably. Pinterest set up war rooms where employees spent hours poring over data to understand the cause of the slowdown and what they could do to address it. Even today, people who worked at Pinterest during that period seem to have a different answer for why growth began to lag: the rise of Instagram, the struggle to attract men, or maybe just the limits of the word-of-mouth marketing that had worked in its first years. Read More Mark Zuckerberg had a different opinion. In Pinterest's early days, when the service was still growing at a fast clip, the Facebook CEO told one of his employees that he thought Pinterest was interesting, but ""niche,"" according to a source with knowledge of the conversation. To Zuckerberg, niche meant it would end up with 200 million to 300 million users. So far, he's right. (Facebook declined to comment for this story.) Ryan Probasco, an early Pinterest employee, remembers thinking, ""This is going to be the new Facebook. A billion users."" Then the company was hit by a noticeable slowdown in new users. Pinterest could have attempted to prove Zuckerberg wrong by racing to roll out new features and supplementary services, or perhaps spending large sums to acquire buzzy startups and new users. Instead, Pinterest's leadership chose to move slower and more deliberately in stark contrast to Facebook's move fast and break things mantra, according to interviews with nearly a dozen former Pinterest employees and people close to the company, many of whom spoke with CNN Business on condition of anonymity. Remarkably, it has put Pinterest's brand in a stronger position today, but not entirely for reasons the company could have predicted. Pinterest has its moment For years, Silicon Valley lionized companies that grew fast and asked for forgiveness instead of permission. Now the industry is facing a moment of reckoning over how these same companies are run. Facebook ( FB ) , the benchmark for success with billions of users and a hugely profitable business, is now under fire for an inability to adequately protect its massive platform. Uber became the most valuable US startup, only to be upended by its own brash culture and growth-at-all-costs ethos. It has since steadied itself, but only after a dramatic executive upheaval, including the ouster of co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick. And a number of so-called unicorns, including Uber, Lyft ( LYFT ) and WeWork, are either going public or advancing toward that goal with unprecedented losses of nearly $1 billion or more a year, which have raised concerns among industry watchers. Against this backdrop, Pinterest is expected to make its Wall Street debut on the New York Stock Exchange this month. The reception to Pinterest's public offering could signal how much investor appetite there really is for a technology company that follows a more cautious playbook. Pinterest files to go public. Its not-so-secret weapon: Moms Pinterest resisted throwing money at its problems, debated product tweaks extensively and did not rush to copy features that helped larger competitors achieve viral growth, employees said. Fond of touting itself as an anti-social media platform , Pinterest never introduced live-streaming or standalone messaging apps, nor did it become a primary hub for news. These features attracted press and users for other companies, but were also later abused by bad actors. ""The company is not flashy and doesn't try to generate a lot of buzz or press for every little thing it does,"" said Kamran Ansari, former head of corporate development at Pinterest. ""It doesn't get some of the notoriety, but I think the term that comes to mind is: built to last."" Pinterest's goal, he added, was ""building a meaningful business that's going to be sustainable."" ""It never had its media moment. It was sandwiched between Twitter's hyper-growth, and then almost immediately after came Instagram and Snapchat.""
Andrew Lipsman, analyst with eMarketer
At times, however, this culture resulted in product tweaks being debated to death, bordering on indecision. Pinterest underinvested in certain key products, like its advertising technology, which may have jeopardized its initial traction with marketers. And it was overshadowed in the press by newer, flashier platforms like Snapchat. In the words of one former Pinterest employee, moving slower was both a ""virtue"" and something that likely ""destroyed value"" for the company. Pinterest declined to comment on this story. The company's IPO prospectus, filed in March, hints at the tensions of this strategy. Pinterest generated more than $750 million in revenue for 2018 — an increase of 60% from the prior year — while shrinking its losses to $63 million, which practically rounds up to profitability compared to Uber's $1.8 billion loss in the same year. In fact, Pinterest was in the black in the fourth quarter. But its audience size and engagement remain well behind many of the companies it cites as competitors. Pinterest has more than 250 million monthly users, barely a tenth of Facebook's user base and precisely what Zuckerberg predicted years earlier. Unlike Facebook, Snapchat ( SNAP ) and Twitter ( TWTR ) , Pinterest chose not to disclose its number of daily active users and said that it does ""not anticipate that most of our users"" will use the service on a daily basis. The smaller audience is both a boon and a burden. It could hurt Pinterest on Wall Street, where investors have hammered Twitter and Snapchat for user growth that falls far below the lofty standards set by Facebook. But being smaller also gives Pinterest the luxury of being more thoughtful in its approach to protecting the platform. ""The scale makes a huge difference,"" said Kate Klonick, a law professor at Yale who researches the technology sector and is close to members of Pinterest's content moderation team. ""They don't have the type of scrutiny on them that Facebook does."" A Pinterest banner hangs on the facade of the New York Stock Exchange during the morning rush in February 2018. Pinterest is expected to go public later this month. Today, Pinterest's CMO is pitching the service as ""one of the truly positive corners of the Internet."" That reputation was burnished in February by its bold attempt to combat vaccine misinformation on its platform. Pinterest blocked searches on the platform related to vaccinations in order to curb the spread of anti-vaxx content. Other social media sites have since stumbled to tackle the problem . The perception of Pinterest as a safe haven could help the company as it goes public. Marketers and users are eagerly searching for a less toxic alternative to the Facebook-Google duopoly that dominates digital media. ""This is a case where you're going to have people rooting for it,"" said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at eMarketer who tracks Pinterest. Klonick likens the Pinterest story to The Tortoise and The Hare. ""They kind of crept along. They just kept going. Maybe they'll eventually win the race, or provide a different model [for success]."" An under-the-radar success story From the start, Pinterest was a service built by and for people outside the Bay Area bubble. Ben Silbermann, the co-founder and CEO, grew up in Iowa, raised by parents who were doctors, with visions of becoming a doctor himself. When he did take a job in San Francisco, it wasn't a technical role but rather handling customer support issues at Google ( GOOGL ) . In 2010, Silbermann launched Pinterest with two co-founders, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra. After a slow first few months, Pinterest took off — not with the usual tastemakers and early adopters, but with a demographic often ignored by the tech industry: women. Specifically, women in flyover states, looking to bookmark recipes and items to purchase. This dynamic hasn't really changed in nine years. In its filing to go public, Pinterest said that two-thirds of its user base today are women. More than that, it claimed its audience includes ""eight out of 10 moms"" in the US. Silbermann held meetup events, personally took customer calls and visited Apple stores to ""change all the computers to say Pinterest,"" according to one talk he gave. But he resisted press interviews in the early days. Most colleagues describe Silbermann with the same mix of words: thoughtful, modest, shy. ""Almost frustratingly humble,"" said Sahil Lavignia, an early Pinterest employee. Ben Silbermann, the chief executive of Pinterest, in San Francisco in August 2018. Silbermann's press aversion, combined with the service's appeal outside Silicon Valley, limited early media coverage of Pinterest despite its rapid growth. In early 2012, ComScore declared Pinterest had hit the 10 million monthly user milestone in the US faster than any independent website ever. ""It never had its media moment,"" said Lipsman, who was previously SVP of marketing and insights at Comscore. ""It was sandwiched between Twitter's hyper-growth, and then almost immediately after came Instagram and Snapchat. Just as Pinterest had its chance to shine, it was competing for attention with other key players."" One former employee said they felt Snapchat's success was the most ""heartbreaking"" to watch. It launched after Pinterest and ""took away all the new shiny object"" fascination with the latter. Even now, with Pinterest set to have its moment on Wall Street, the employee noted how difficult it is for brands to ""get cool again."" The Pinterest playbook: Move slow and debate things In 2016, the year Snapchat's parent company began prepping for an IPO and Instagram rocketed to 500 million monthly users under Facebook's ownership, the Pinterest team had a drawn out back-and-forth over the word ""save."" True to its name, the company offered a ""Pin it"" button to encourage users to add items to their Pinterest boards. Tests showed changing it to the more intuitive ""save"" label would boost user engagement, especially outside the US, but some questioned whether it would be at odds with the Pinterest brand. ""Save"" won out , but only after a debate that one former employee said ""took a long time to get through."" The process was emblematic of the pros and cons of a company taking a more thoughtful approach to building up its audience and revenue. Under Silbermann's leadership, Pinterest was careful not to rush to make changes simply to juice growth. He pushed for ""more research and discussion before jumping into a particular strategy,"" Ansari said.

How to find your max heart rate for exercise,us.cnn.com,"Angela Spence, The Conversation",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/max-heart-rate-partner/index.html,"You have your runners on, your FitBit is charged, but now what?
When you exercise, your heart and breathing rates increase, delivering greater quantities of oxygen from the lungs to the blood, then to exercising muscles. Determining an optimal heart rate for exercise depends on your exercise goal, age, and current fitness level. Heart rate and exercise intensity share a direct, linear relationship: the more intense the exercise, the higher the heart rate. Not exercising worse for your health than smoking, diabetes and heart disease, study reveals When you exercise at the highest possible intensity, your heart will reach maximal heart rate (HRmax), the fastest rate it is capable of beating. Read More But exercising at a maximal heart rate (HRmax) for every exercise session will not produce efficient fitness results. These high intensities can rarely be sustained, negating the potential benefit of the exercise. Exercise makes your heart more efficient Typical resting heart rate can vary quite substantially between people and even within an individual. Around 60-80 beats per minute (BPM) for adults is common. Heart rate can be easily be measured with devices like FitBits and Apple Watches, although they have their limitations. Improving your aerobic fitness reduces your resting heart rate, as the heart becomes more efficient with each beat. An athlete's resting heart rate, for instance, is typically around 40 BPM. How you can make time for moving In fact, evidence suggests that long-term exercise training increases the size of the heart , specifically the left ventricle , a phenomenon known as ""Athlete's Heart"". A bigger heart means more blood can be pumped with each beat, and fewer beats per minute are required to maintain blood flow around the body. This is a beneficial physiological adaptation allowing athletes to exercise at higher intensities for longer. How to calculate your maximal heart rate There is substantial variation in HRmax. The only true method of determining HRmax is to conduct a maximal exercise test. But HRmax can be estimated using formulas based on age. Why exercise won't make you lose weight The authors of a 2001 study proposed the following revised equation for estimating maximal heart rate: HRMax = 208 - (0.7 x Age) This means a 45-year-old would have a predicted HRmax of 177 BPM. Indeed, our genetics can influence actual maximal heart rates from their predicted value. However, HRmax is not a major determinant of exercise or athletic performance. Far more important is our physiological efficiency. Why stretching is still important for exercise and dieting When assessing heart rate, it's also important to take into account the effects of emotions such as excitement or fear, stimulants like caffeine, and circulating hormones like adrenaline, all of which can increase heart rate. Is exercising at maximal heart rates unsafe? In short, the answer is no. For most adults, the risk of not doing enough exercise is far greater than that of doing excessive endurance exercise. The health benefits of regular exercise are well established, although emerging evidence suggests excessive exercise may not provide extra cardiovascular health benefits. 7 health problems exercise can fix Likewise, there's a higher chance a sedentary person will experience an acute cardiac event, like a heart attack, during exercise when they're unaccustomed to high-intensity exercise , or they have a pre-existing heart condition. The maximal risk is 0.3 to 2.7 events per 10,000 person-hours. With a third of Australians not meeting the WHO recommended guidelines of accumulating 150 minutes of exercise per week, encouraging regular physical activity continues to be a pervasive public health message. In terms of assessing risk, an exercise pre-screening assessment with an ESSA-qualified exercise specialist will be able to assess and mitigate the risk of exercise participation. Exercise intensity: what happens when we go 'all out' Muscle cells require two key ingredients to function: fuel (glucose) and oxygen. Muscles rely heavily on blood vessels to deliver the necessary nutrients and oxygen around the body, and also to remove by-products such as carbon dioxide. The more muscles used in exercise, the more blood is distributed towards the active tissues. Bad heart? Time to hit the gym When the intensity of the exercise is particularly high, the muscles start to produce another by-product called lactate. Cells can also use lactate as a fuel although if production rate exceeds metabolism, lactate starts to accumulate and can interfere with cellular function. The point at which this by-product starts to accumulate is termed the ""lactate threshold"". Exercise is medicine, and doctors are starting to prescribe it Any exercise intensity that can be comfortably sustained is usually below this threshold, and will have an accompanying heart rate. As it is much easier to measure heart rate than lactate production, heart rate can be used as a surrogate measure of exercise intensity. What is the best exercise for heart rate? While interval-style exercise training is a popular choice for people who are time-poor, the intermittent nature of the exercise means heart rate will fluctuate, providing not much more benefit than traditional steady-state exercise. From a scientific perspective, athletes typically use heart-rate ranges to train at specific intensities during aerobic exercise, like cycling or long-distance running. Exercising at certain intensities are known to elicit adaptive responses from the body, for example, exercising at or below the lactate threshold. Get
These intensities are called training zones and are expressed relative to HRmax. For instance, a light aerobic training session would be prescribed below 75% HRmax, while training at threshold (around 95% HRmax) will induce physiological change. Overall, some exercise is better than no exercise for your cardiovascular health. Accumulating 150 minutes of exercise per week is the minimum requirement for health benefit. Exercising at your maximal heart rate is not necessary to achieve these benefits. Athletes can use training zones, relative to HRmax, to achieve optimal adaptation and enhance endurance performance."

If we don't teach them to clean up after themselves, they might grow up to be messy and entitled brats. Read More On the other hand, we have the current well-being of us, the parents, to take into account. We are living in the age of burnout. Many of us lack the bandwidth -- emotional and temporal -- to get our children to clean up their Hot Wheels on a regular basis. There's so much to squeeze into a day (jobs need to be worked, dishes need to be cleaned, stories need to be read, etc). Is it really so wrong to cut the tedious child-led clean-up session out of the daily schedule? Answering your questions about potentially bad parenting behavior. We will help you work through the guilt.
The short answer is, absolutely not. With few exceptions, there's no single activity that can make or break our children's characters. Maybe your kids don't clean up their toys, but they do other chores like feeding the dog or setting the table. There are oh so many ways to instill a sense of responsibility in our children. If you aren't doing any of them, or if your kid loses it when you make any request, then you have a bigger problem than that pile of toys or whatever it is you are quickly cleaning up. The tricky part is striking the balance between teaching our kids these lessons and not turning into frazzled lunatics ourselves in the process. Carla Naumburg, author of the upcoming "" How to Stop Losing Your Sh*t With Your Kids ,"" said parents need to remember that ""it is not their job to teach their children everything."" Q: Am I a bad parent if I'm on my phone in front of my kids? ""We parents expect ourselves to be the teacher, the coach, the therapist, the cook, the jailor, the judge. Everything! Parents need to trust that other people in their kids' lives are teaching their kids, too,"" she said, adding that it's fairly common for children to have to clean up after themselves in school. Daniel Siegel, a child psychologist and co-author of "" The Whole-Brain Child "" and other parenting books, encourages a quality-over-quantity approach to teaching children responsibility. He wants parents to put their energy into something they have the bandwidth to do and then stick with it. ""Your child is looking to you for regularity, routines and predictability, though not rigidity. They want a structure that has flexibility to it,"" Siegel said, adding that parents should think hard about which responsibility lessons feel necessary to them. Some issues, like teaching a child not to play with knives, are obviously urgent. Other issues, like a child who doesn't finish his Cheerios every morning, are obviously trivial. It's the ones in the middle, which might include getting your child to clean up after themselves, that can be most challenging to figure out how to handle. ""You have to decide, what's the deal?"" he said. ""If you come to the conclusion that teaching your children to clean up after themselves is important to you, then you have to make the time to do it. If you don't, let it go."" Naumburg said she sees a lot of parents getting too ambitious with their lessons and then feeling overwhelmed as a result. For example, when she wanted her daughters to learn to cook, she didn't start with a big, elaborate recipe. Instead, she let them open a bag of frozen broccoli and dump it in a pot. The judgmental mom is little more than a stereotype ""The truth is, kids learn grit and resilience in small moments, too,"" she said. If you decide that teaching your kids to clean up their toys is important to you, remember that it's OK to start small. Maybe at the beginning, it's just the dolls in the hallway or the Legos on the table. Maybe they are in charge of putting away 10 things or cleaning up for three minutes -- something I often do with my children -- and then you do the rest. A toy-free bedroom or living room every night might be too much, too soon. Remember, mess is a subjective concept. Where one person sees "" Grey Gardens ,"" another might see Marie Kondo. Considering that you wrote about cleaning up, I suspect that you, like me, fall into the clutter-phobe category. Try -- and I know it's hard -- to accept a little more chaos. If your children's toys aren't posing a hazard, then maybe a few of them camping out on the carpet overnight isn't such a bad thing. Or if your children give cleaning up a shot but have a different definition of clean than you do, try to be encouraging anyway -- especially if it means an easier daily routine and a less-exhausted parent hitting the pillow every night. Another thing to remember: Our attitudes about messiness tend to be gendered. Women experience more pressure, internal and external, to have their houses look orderly. A recent Pew Research Center study found that teenage girls, ages 15 to 17, spend over twice as much time cleaning up and preparing food as boys the same age do. I'm not mentioning this because I believe that we should abandon cleaning up altogether just because the patriarchy made it a women's job. Living in filth is not my idea of women's liberation.

Instead, I want parents to make sure that the sons out there are being held to the same tidiness standards as the daughters. Also, dads should be equally involved in getting kids to clean up as moms. This way, the next generation won't see tidying up as exclusively a women's concern. Ultimately, cleaning up after your kids doesn't make you a bad parent. It's the failing to teach them responsibility, or only teaching the girls responsibility, that will get you in trouble. Pick the chores that work for you and your kids and stop worrying about the thing or things that don't. You're probably too tired for all that."
Combating child sex trafficking in the United States - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Brooke Axtell, for CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/brooke-axtell-child-sex-trafficking-us/index.html,"Brooke Axtell is the founder of She is Rising , a healing community for survivors of gender violence and sex trafficking. She is the author of "" Beautiful Justice: Reclaiming My Worth After Sex Trafficking and Sexual Abuse ."" This article is based on an excerpt from the book. The opinions expressed are solely those of the author.
(CNN) When I speak on sex trafficking in the United States, I meet many people who believe this crime only impacts children from other countries, who are smuggled across our borders. The truth is approximately 83% of sex trafficking victims in the United States are US citizens .
Brooke Axtell According to a 2016 study by the University of Texas , approximately 79,000 children are victims of sex trafficking in Texas alone. The majority of these children experienced abuse prior to trafficking. Homeless, runaway and foster care youth were identified as being most vulnerable to exploitation. Through my years as an advocate, the majority of survivors I've supported were American girls who were trafficked by someone who posed as a caretaker or potential boyfriend. Instead of being kidnapped, they were subjected to emotional manipulation, physical violence and psychological coercion. This pattern is confirmed by the National Human Trafficking Hotline , which identified an offer of dating or partnership as a top recruitment strategy of sex traffickers. Creating justice Read More In my new memoir "" Beautiful Justice: Reclaiming My Worth After Human Trafficking and Sexual Abuse ,"" I share the story of two American teen girls who were coerced into sex trafficking by a man who offered to help them when they were on the streets. Their story is a common one for sexually exploited youth. Yet their resilience and bravery is extraordinary. Sex trafficking: The new American slavery In 2016, the prosecuting attorney for the Texas Attorney General's office asked me to support these two courageous survivors as they testified at a federal trial in Austin, Texas. On their first day at court, I met the girls, who were 15 and 17 at the time. The younger one, Lily, was outspoken and sassy. The older one, Kayce (not their real names), was more melancholy and reserved, with gentle, blue eyes. We waited at the courthouse for several days before they were allowed to testify. More from the CNN Freedom Project The wait was excruciating for them. They knew the man who trafficked them across several states was in the courtroom, trying to convince the judge and jury that the girls ""wanted to work"" for him when he drugged them and forced them to have sex with up to 10 buyers a day. As the defense tried to blame the girls and minimize the role of their pimp, I was in a side room trying to help them stay grounded. I told them I was a survivor of sex trafficking as well and they could ask me any questions they wanted about my recovery. They both wanted to know what happened to me and how I got out. ""I was seven and trafficked by my nanny while my mom was in the hospital. It ended when she finally came home."" ""What happened to him?"" Lily asked. ""I don't know. He left. I was too young to understand what happened to me."" ""So you never got justice?"" ""No. I had to create my own justice."" When her turn came to testify, Lily said, ""Where am I going to look? I don't want to look at him."" Canada's stolen daughters: Sex traffickers target indigenous Canadians ""I'm going to sit right in front of the witness stand, and if you start to feel overwhelmed you can just look up at me,"" I said. As we walked toward the courtroom, Lily turned to me and said, ""Brooke, I am doing this for myself, but I am also doing this for you, because you never got any justice."" ""You are so brave,"" I said, smiling, with tears in my eyes. Read: What is modern slavery? Both Lily and Kayce were articulate and courageous on the stand. They spoke clearly about their experience, even when the defense attorney tried to lead them away from the truth. As a result of their testimony and the skilful strategy of the prosecuting attorney, their primary trafficker was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. Protecting our children We need to teach children the red flags for abusive relationships to protect them from the most common tactics traffickers use. Here are a few common red flags that I have witnessed in both dating violence and traffickers posing as boyfriends. Grooming: This is the period of time when the abuser is ""selling the dream."" It is the honeymoon phase. The abuser quickly makes promises about what he can give the young woman to fulfill her needs and desires. The sex trafficking survivor who wants to end 'The Game' He will identify what is missing in her life financially and emotionally and then pledge his support. Instead of slowly getting to know the victim, he will immediately start talking about the future and may suggest living together right away. Read: Indian girls sold to sex tourists for sham marriages It is different from healthy giving in that it happens very quickly and creates a dependency on the abuser. Isolation: The abuser positions himself as being the only one who can provide for the victim's material or emotional needs. He does everything he can to distance his victim from any support she may have. This includes criticizing anyone she cares about and trying to turn her against her own family and friends. Control: He will try to establish control over her life: where she can go, who she can communicate with and what she is allowed to do. If she doesn't comply she will be punished physically or emotionally. In the beginning, this may show up as jealousy. A trafficker will eventually demand that she ""work"" in the sex trade to take care of their ""family."" This is often framed as something she has to do to ""help."" If she refuses, she will experience emotional and/or physical abuse, including threats against her loved ones. Old mark of slavery is being used on sex trafficking victims Other red flags for abusive relationships, in general, that also show up in sex trafficking are: - Untreated mental health and addiction issues in the abuser. - Anger that is disproportionate to a situation (small frustrations quickly escalate to rage). - A psychology of entitlement (an expectation that they should always have their way). - Speaking about past partners or other women, in general, in derogatory terms. I advocate for dating violence prevention education highlighting the connection between partner abuse and sex trafficking. In addition to schools, we need to target teen drug and alcohol treatment centers, foster care programs, and homeless youth shelters, so vulnerable and at-risk children know how to spot a potential abuser and find safety. In order to protect our children, we need to let go of cultural myths about who is trafficked and how it happens. We cannot end child sex trafficking in the US unless we know what are looking for."
Louisiana church fires: Congregants want to know who burned 3 of their churches to the ground - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Christina Maxouris, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/tuesday-black-church-fires/index.html,"(CNN) Fires that consumed three historically black Louisiana churches in 10 days are believed to have been intentionally set, a local elected official said Tuesday.
The official did not provide specifics about the ongoing investigation but told CNN some pastors in the heart of south-central Louisiana's Cajun and Creole country are sleeping in their churches as a precaution against additional fires. It is still unclear who is responsible for the fires and will likely take investigators time to sift through what evidence remains to determine if the blazes are connected. As they do, residents and worshippers in St. Landry Parish, where all three fires occurred, are withholding judgment about what may have caused them, even as officials say they contained ""suspicious elements"" and the episodes evoke recollections of past acts of hate against black churches. ""I feel our district was being targeted because all three of the churches were in our district,"" Pastor Freddie Jack, the Seventh District Missionary Baptist Association president, told CNN's Don Lemon on Monday. Read More ""At first we thought it might have been an electrical problem, but then when the second church ... burning occurred I realized it was our sister church. ... Then two days later the third occurred so at least (to) me, (it) made me think that we're being targeted."" St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre burned on March 26, followed by Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2 and two days later, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in the same town. Officials are also investigating a fourth, smaller fire on March 31 at the predominantly white Vivian United Pentecostal Church in Caddo Parish, more than 200 miles north of St. Landry. The blaze was intentionally set. St. Landry Parish is nearly 42% black. Opelousas is 75% black. The city's mayor, Julius Alsandor, called the church burnings ""hideous."" ""The relevance and the impact on the people in the surrounding communities and especially the congregation of each of these churches, it's hurtful and there may be some fear that is being exhibited by those who are a part of the three churches,"" he said. Hurt, fear and confusion -- that's all the congregants are left with for now. ""We don't know why, we don't know when, we don't know who,"" the Rev. Gerald Toussaint of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church told CNN affiliate KATC. ""We will let the authorities handle that, but we just know a higher power and a higher authority who can bring this thing to fruition."" 'More questions than answers' In an appeal for the public's help, Gov. John Bel Edwards said he has directed the state fire marshal as well as local and federal authorities to ""aggressively investigative"" the fires. ""Churches are sacred places, and no one should fear for their safety in their house of worship,"" he said. ""And no one should be concerned that their house of worship would be destroyed."" ""Right now, there are more questions than answers, but hopefully the investigation will yield information we can share with the public in short order,"" the governor said in his State of the State address, according to CNN affiliate KTBS. The FBI and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting in the investigations. And as they look for answers, congregants wait. ""Something is not right, something isn't right, but God has the last word,"" Ethel Thomas, a member of Mount Pleasant, told KATC. ""We're going to keep on keeping on."" Thomas told the news station , ""It was heartbreaking, I wanted to cry, but I say I'll hold it in . ""I had cried so much already when they called to let me know that our church was burned. I didn't know what else to do, I just said, 'Lord you're in control.' "" NAACP labels the fires ""domestic terrorism' State Fire Marshal H. ""Butch"" Browning said in a statement there is ""clearly something happening"" in the community. ""We believe these three fires are suspicious,"" Browning said. ""We are falling short of talking about what caused the fires, falling short of saying they are related, however cognizant that there is a problem and no coincidence that there are three fires."" The NAACP labeled the fires ""domestic terrorism,"" adding the ""spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country."" The American Civil Liberties Union called the events ""deeply disturbing."" But Jack said it's just too early for conclusions. ""I can't say for one reason or another that the actual burning was a racist act or a hate crime until we can determine who caused them, who's behind them. I don't think that we can rightfully or truthfully say it was either or,"" he told Lemon. ""We need the facts before we can generate thought that's concerning what it was."" And the facts may take a while, because most of the evidence is likely gone. ""Investigating a fire is a very lengthy process,"" Browning said. ""It's one of the most complicated and unconventional crime scenes you'll ever enter because most of the evidence is burned away."" ""The problem with arson investigations is the same as bomb investigations: The evidence gets destroyed."" CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano said. ""That's going to be the issue. You've got to go back and piece this together when a lot of the evidence would have been burned up in the fire."" Authorities are reviewing a long list of clues. ""Similar type of accelerant, any type of incendiary device that could have possibly been planted there, and then link in the houses, what things could be found at what crime scene that could be linked to another, find out if there's a pattern and if there's somebody here who's a serial arsonist,"" Gagliano said. About 100 federal, state and local investigators are on the case, Louisiana Fire Marshal's Office spokeswoman Ashley Rodrigue said. Florida has sent seven people to help out the fire marshal's office. 'These houses of faith have historically been the targets of violence' Church burnings were a common occurrence in the Jim Crow era. And fires at black churches -- especially those in the South -- immediately bring to mind such racist attacks. ""For decades, African-American churches have served as the epicenter of survival and a symbol of hope for many in the African-American community,"" NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said. ""As a consequence, these houses of faith have historically been the targets of violence."" Why are black church fires associated with acts of hate? Several black churches in the South were burned in 2015 shortly after the mass murder of nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, though it is unclear if those fires were racially motivated. According to the latest data from the National Fire Protection Association, fires within religious and funeral properties have been on the decline for decades. Between 2007 and 2011, 16% were ruled intentional , according to the association."
EU-China summit: Why tensions between Europe and China are rising - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Charles Riley,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/eu-china-summit/index.html,"London (CNN Business) An annual summit between the European Union and China threatens to expose deep cracks in the foundation of one of the world's most important trading relationships.
The leaders of Europe's largest countries are increasingly wary of the brand of economic nationalism practiced by China, and are responding with new barriers designed to blunt Beijing's influence. The messages emanating from European capitals have not been subtle. In March, the European Commission said that China can no longer be considered a developing country and labeled it a ""systemic rival."" French President Emmanuel Macron went further, accusing China late last month of trying to divide the bloc and declaring that ""the period of European naiveté is over."" ""I think the Chinese have been surprised by how quickly the mood in Europe has turned,"" said Erik Brattberg, director of the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. EU leader Juncker criticizes uneven relations with China days after Xi visit A key test of the relationship between China and its largest trading partner will come Tuesday, when Chinese Premier Li Keqiang meets EU officials in Brussels for an annual summit . Trade in goods between the European Union and China was worth roughly €575 billion ($650 billion) in 2017. Read More Three sticking points loom large: Restrictions on Chinese investment in Europe, rules that shut European companies out of China and concerns over the security of telecoms gear made by China's Huawei. Chinese investment in Europe Chinese foreign direct investment in the European Union dropped for a second consecutive year in 2018 to €17.3 billion ($19.5 billion), according to the Rhodium Group. It peaked at €37.2 billion ($42 billion) in 2016. The slump came as some of the biggest EU economies updated their rules on company takeovers and subjected investment from China to increased scrutiny. At least one deal has been blocked and others have faced delays. The European Union has since launched its own framework to screen state-supported foreign investment, especially in sensitive areas such as technology and critical infrastructure. ""There is a growing perception in Europe that investment from Chinese state-owned or state-controlled companies is strategically targeted at certain sectors and not motivated by a compelling business case,"" said Brattberg. European companies in China China also faces accusations of failing to level the playing field for European companies doing business there. ""China has increasingly become a strategic competitor for the EU while failing to reciprocate market access,"" the European Commission wrote last month in a strategic outlook on China. ""China preserves its domestic markets for its champions."" China's factories are now defying the economic slowdown EU officials have accused Beijing of shielding its companies from competition through licensing and investment restrictions, subsidizing state-owned companies heavily and selectively enforcing intellectual property protections. The European Commission has used the fintech and online payments industry as an example. Chinese companies in those industries are expanding in Europe, but European competitors are not allowed to do business in China. ""Given the magnitude of our trade and investment links, it is important to develop a more balanced and reciprocal economic relationship,"" the Commission wrote in March. The Huawei problem The European Union has come under intense US pressure to ban Huawei equipment from 5G networks following accusations that products made by the Chinese company pose a security risk. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations, and called on the Trump administration to provide evidence to back up its claims. Former top US generals issue 'grave' warning to ban Chinese tech The European Commission has made clear that EU member states are responsible for making their own security decisions, but it has also asked them to complete 5G risk assessments by the end of June. Countries will also complete a security review by the end of 2019 that will include steps to safeguard 5G at the EU level. A blanket ban on Huawei equipment appears unlikely, but targeted actions could also anger Beijing. ""This issue has major implications not only for Europe's relationship with China, but also for Europe's relationship with the United States,"" said Brattberg."
"Democrats are older, more moderate and less educated than you think - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Harry Enten,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democratic-party-voters-analysis/index.html,"(CNN) Listening to Joe Biden, you might come away with the sense that he is out of touch with the Democratic Party's electorate, which many believe is younger, further left and better educated than it used to be. Indeed, the party's voters may be all of these things.
But, as HuffPost's Kevin Robillard wrote , the former vice president seems to be making a bet that there are still plenty of older, more moderate and less educated Democrats who can help him win the nomination. That might not be a bad bet. Democratic Party voters are older than younger There's a case to be made that Democrats are younger than they were at the beginning of the decade. Those younger than the age of 40, for example, made up 6 more points of the Democratic vote in the 2018 midterm than they did in the 2010 midterm, according to a Catalist (a Democratic firm) estimate of the national voter file . The exit polls illustrate a similar trend. A Biden 2020 candidacy would confront Democratic Party with its past Read More But even if Democrats are younger than they once were, Millennials and Generation Z voters (roughly those younger than 40) are still very much the minority of Democrats. They made up just about 29% of all Democratic voters in the 2018 midterm, per Catalist. In fact even when you add in those 40 to 49 years old, you still only account for about 44% of Democratic voters in 2018. In other words, the AARP demographic (age 50 and older) were the majority (56%) of 2018 Democratic voters, per Catalist. And in case you were wondering, those ages 65 and older (27%) made up about double the percentage of Democrats who were younger than 30 (14%). The exit polls can differ slightly on the exact level each age group makes up of the electorate, though all sources agree that a majority of Democratic voters are age 45 and older. That's a big deal when age was the No. 1 predictor of vote choice in the 2016 primary and continues to be a primary driver of vote choice in early 2020 polling . A candidate who is receiving the bulk of their support from older voters -- like, for example, a Biden -- is in a considerably better position than a candidate who does best with younger voters. It's how Hillary Clinton won last time, despite Bernie Sanders swamping her among younger voters. Democratic Party voters are more moderate than very liberal Whether it be the exit polls, Gallup or the Pew Research Center , there's no doubt Democrats are more liberal than they once were. In the exit polls, for example, the percentage of Democratic voters who identify as liberal rose by double-digits between the Democratic midterm blowouts of 2006 and 2018. Still, moderates and conservatives make up about 50% of all Democrats. In the 2018 midterms, the exit polls found that moderates and conservatives made up 54% of those who voted Democratic. Pew similarly put moderate and conservative Democrats as 54% of all self-identified Democrats and independents who lean Democratic voters in 2018. Gallup's 2018 figures had moderates as 47% of all adults who self-identified as Democrats. And while liberals make up about 50% of Democrats, many of them are only ""somewhat liberal."" In a Quinnipiac University poll taken last month, people who identified as ""very liberal"" were only 19% of all Democrats and independents who leaned Democratic. Very liberals made up the same 19% of those who said they were voting Democratic in Suffolk University's final 2018 pre-election poll . The 2016 primary exit polls discovered that about 25% of Democratic primary voters called themselves very liberal. Put another way: the moderate/conservative wing of the Democratic Party likely still makes up at least 2 times as much of the party's voters than the very liberal flank. Again, this is probably good news for Biden, given that his support in the last Quinnipiac University poll among moderate and conservative Democrats (37%) was more than double his support from very liberal Democrats (14%). It further suggests that Democrats who run far to the left may be misreading where the electorate is. Democratic Party voters are more likely to be working class Democratic voters are more likely to have a college education than they used to. Catalist, Pew and Gallup all show a trend toward Democrats being more educated than they used to be. Despite this growing education, however, Democratic voters are still more likely to lack a college degree. According to Catalist, about 59% of voters who cast a ballot for the Democrats in 2018 didn't have a college degree. Gallup and Pew have the percentage of self-identified without a college degree well into the 60s. The exit polls, which historically have painted a better educated electorate than other sources, found about 55% of 2018 Democratic voters lacking a college degree. Even among white Democrats, there are still many voters who have no college degree. Among whites, Catalist calculates the percentage of 2018 Democratic voters without a college degree at about 54%, compared to 46% who had a college degree. Gallup and Pew have the percentage of self-identified Democrats without a college degree in the high 50s among whites. The exit poll had them as a slight minority at 48% of voters who went for the Democrats in 2018. As the Washington Post's David Byler put it , ""Democrats should stop chasing Trump's base. They have their own white working-class voters."" When you broaden it out to look at all Democratic voters, all the sources I could find have whites with a college degree as less than a third of all Democrats. Most have them at less than 30%. Currently, there doesn't seem to be a large education divide in Democratic primary polling. A candidate who is able to tap into the large working class vote within the party, however, will have a big time advantage. All together, a Democratic candidate of the old, moderate and working class stands a better shot of winning the primary than one of the young, left and college educated."
Mnuchin vs. Democrats: 5 things to watch - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Donna Borak,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/mnuchin-house-hearings-what-to-watch/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will face House lawmakers in back-to-back hearings Tuesday, his first appearance since Democrats formally requested President Donald Trump's tax returns.
Democratic lawmakers can be expected to grill Trump's finance chief, who oversees the Internal Revenue Service, about whether he will comply with requests to hand over the commander in chief's personal tax returns, as well as about Trump's recent announcement of conservative commentator Stephen Moore and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain as picks for the Federal Reserve. Here's what to watch for when Mnuchin testifies before a House Appropriations subcommittee at 10 a.m. and the House Financial Services Committee at 2 p.m.: Trump's tax returns With a Wednesday deadline for the Trump administration to respond to a request from House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal for Trump's tax returns, Mnuchin will most certainly be asked about his position on the obscure law cited by the Massachusetts Democrat -- or whether he plans to intervene and block their release. Read More Trump has already made clear that he has no plans to make this fight easy. On Friday, his lawyers sent a letter to the Department of Treasury's general counsel dismissing the request as a politically motivated pursuit. ""The idea that you can use the IRS as a political weapon is incorrect as a matter of statutory law and constitutionally,"" Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. ""We should not be in a situation where individual private tax returns are used for political purpose."" Last month, Mnuchin told House lawmakers he would obey the law if he received a written request from Congress to turn over Trump's tax returns. He also sidestepped the issue by suggesting the decision would ultimately fall to the IRS commissioner, the country's federal tax collector. ""I will consult with the legal department within Treasury, and I will comply with the law, "" Mnuchin said then when asked if he would release the returns. Ethics issues Last week, Mnuchin became the third Trump Cabinet official cited for failure to comply with ethics rules in their financial disclosures, according to a federal government ethics watchdog. The Office of Government Ethics declined to certify the secretary's 2018 filing for neglecting to disclose that ethics officials within the Treasury Department had advised him that selling his stake in a film production company to his now-wife, Louise Linton, would not create a conflict of interest. The treasury secretary agreed to revise his federal ethics agreement and recuse himself from government matters that could impact the film production company, StormChaser Productions. Mnuchin told the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing last month that department ethics officials had informed him he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Linton. Mnuchin sold his film and real estate businesses in 2017 for at least $15 million as part of a string of divestments upon becoming Trump's treasury chief. The Federal Reserve The treasury secretary may again be called upon to act as the President's explainer-in-chief when it comes to his views on the Federal Reserve. Trump's plans to nominate Moore and Cain, both close political allies, have fed criticism that the President is trying to exert too much influence over the world's most powerful central bank for his own political purposes. In recent weeks, Trump has revived his barrage of criticism over the Fed's interest rate policy, going so far as to urge the central bank to cut rates in order to skyrocket the economy. ""They really slowed us,"" Trump told reporters Friday on his way to California to visit the US southern border with Mexico. ""I personally think the Fed should drop rates."" The President argued that if the Fed cut interest rates ""you would see a rocket ship."" But even so ""we're doing very well."" Trump's top economic advisers, including the National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, have defended the President's decision to express his views publicly. ""It's our point of view,"" said Kudlow, speaking at a breakfast roundtable last week hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. ""The Fed is independent and we're not trying to compromise that."" The treasury secretary has previously backed the President's prerogative to speak his mind on the Fed's policies, while trying to avoid the appearance of interfering in the US central bank. Trump's tariffs While a "" granddaddy"" trade deal with China has yet to take final shape, the President's repeated threats to close the US border have introduced a new twist in a separate trade deal with the nation's northern and southern neighbors, Canada and Mexico. On Friday, Trump said he would be inclined to override his pending United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement by imposing a 25% tariff on cars made in Mexico if the country doesn't help stem the flow of undocumented immigrants. The comments have come as Trump's economic advisers have been pushing Congress to ratify the trade deal they negotiated after the President decided he wanted to tear up the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump suggested that his tariff threat could ""supersede USMCA,"" potentially undermining the ratification of the trade deal, which he has lauded as replacing one of the worst deals he's ever seen , referring to NAFTA. Over the weekend, Kudlow suggested that the President wouldn't necessarily make good on his threat, describing it as more as a ""warning"" that should be heeded . Lawmakers could seek further explanation from Mnuchin, who has been leading trade negotiations with China alongside US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, on what the President may have in mind. Housing Mnuchin may be pressed on the Trump administration's plans to overhaul the nation's housing finance system , now that the President is calling on federal agencies to address the issue more a decade after the US government seized the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Last month, Trump directed the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop legislative and regulatory plans to revamp the two companies, both still under the government's control since the 2008 financial crisis. The President's directive, laid out in a memo, calls for ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie and improving the federal government's oversight of them. It remains unclear, however, what else will be included in a draft plan beyond preserving a 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Details of those plans may still be in the works, but Mnuchin could offer some clues on what the Trump administration may have in mind, including widening participation of the private sector."
Barr faces Congress for first time since end of Mueller investigation - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/william-barr-hearing-congress-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday he expects to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report ""within a week,"" but he does not plan to provide Congress with an unredacted version of the report, setting the stage for a showdown with congressional Democrats.
Barr told a House subcommittee Tuesday that the redactions process was going ""very well,"" and he would use color-coded categories and explain the rationale for the redactions that are made from Mueller's nearly 400-page report. But he said he would not accede to Democrats' demands that he provide the full, unredacted report to Congress, arguing that he cannot legally release grand jury material and that he did not plan to ask a court to release it. ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr said. Barr's comments Tuesday come ahead of a brewing clash between Congress and the Trump administration over the Mueller report, as Democrats are indeed prepared to go to court in an effort to obtain the unredacted Mueller report and the special counsel's underlying evidence. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have already authorized a subpoena for the full Mueller report and the underlying evidence, though House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said Tuesday he is waiting to see what Barr releases before moving forward on the subpoena. ""I presume we're going to get the redacted report within a week. When we do so, if we don't get everything, we will issue a subpoena and go to court,"" the New York Democrat told reporters Tuesday. Read More Barr has said four types of information would be redacted from the report he submits: grand jury material, classified information, material tied to ongoing investigation, and information that could harm ""peripheral third parties."" Barr told the House Appropriations subcommittee, where he was appearing Tuesday to testify on the budget, that he was willing to work with Nadler to provide some additional information to the committee beyond the redacted report. But he stopped well short of pledging to provide the full report as Democrats have demanded. In particular, Barr rebuffed Democratic arguments that he could provide grand jury material to Congress. ""Until someone shows me a provision"" permitting the release of grand jury material, Barr said, ""Congress doesn't get"" that material. After Barr's testimony, Nadler said in response that the courts have ""given the Congress the grand jury information when requested in many, many different instances."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also weighed in to object to Barr's proposed redactions. ""We all understand that redacting is important to protect sources and methods -- beyond that he has no business redacting,"" the California Democrat said. ""And we will have that discussion."" The fight is likely to wind up in court, which Barr alluded to on Tuesday. ""The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court,"" he said in response to Democratic questioning. Barr defends four-page summary Democrats pressed Barr on his decision to release a four-page summary of Mueller's conclusions, particularly in light of reports that some on Mueller's team have told others they were unsatisfied with how Barr characterized the investigation. Barr said that Mueller was given the opportunity to review the summary Barr released last month detailing the Mueller's conclusions, and the special counsel declined to do so. Barr said he suspected that members of Mueller's team wanted more from him, but he explained that he wasn't trying to summarize the full report with his four-page letter, which stated Mueller's investigation did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's team and Russia, and that Mueller reached no conclusion on the question of obstruction of justice. ""I suspect that they probably wanted more put out,"" Barr said. ""In my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize, because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also, would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once."" Barr said the White House did not review his letter, but he declined to answer questions about whether the White House has been briefed on the report. ""I've already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week,"" Barr said. ""And I'm not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it."" Barr's answers did not appear to satisfy Democrats, who repeatedly urged Barr to release the full report and fully explain any redactions that Barr decided to make. ""I think it would strike a serious blow to our system, and yes, to our democracy, if that report is not fully seen,"" said New York Rep. Jose Serrano, the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Justice Subcommittee holding Tuesday's hearing. ""We're not here today to be in a confrontational situation with you. We want to help you do the job, and you need to help us do ours."" In one week, 4 major Trump-policy spins and flips House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey told Barr that his handling of Mueller's report was ""unacceptable"" and the summary he released ""raises more questions than it answers."" ""I look forward to reviewing the Mueller report myself, and I know my constituents do as well,"" Lowey said. ""I understand that portions of it must be redacted as a matter of law, but my hope is that you will stop there and bring transparency to this process as soon as possible."" Lawmakers mull next steps While the Judiciary Committee is leading congressional efforts to obtain the full Mueller report, Serrano and Lowey said after the hearing that the Appropriations Committee could also play a role in pressuring the Justice Department, given their control of the DOJ budget. Serrano told reporters it was ""too important"" not to do everything to try to force its release. Republican lawmakers in the hearing mostly avoided talking about Mueller, although several raised comments from Democrats stating there was evidence of collusion between Trump's team and Russia. Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama, the top Republican on the subcommittee, chided Democrats by lamenting that ""so many of the questions here this morning have gone toward a grassy knoll conspiracy theory regarding the Mueller report."" While Mueller questions dominated Wednesday's hearing, lawmakers did press Barr on a number of other topics, including the administration's lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act , the immigration policy on family separations, hate crimes and cybersecurity issues with China. Barr is scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on May 1 and May 2 for hearings before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees specifically to answer questions about the Mueller investigation. Barr is also testifying before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday, where he's likely to face similar questions ahead of the Mueller report's release. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."
Biden 2020 candidacy would confront Democrats with their past - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Ronald Brownstein,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/joe-biden-democratic-party-2020-past-race-culture/index.html,"(CNN) The Democratic Party of 2020 will face a reckoning with the Democratic Party of 50 years ago with former Vice President Joe Biden announcing Thursday that he's a candidate for president.
When Biden, who's now 76, was first elected to the Senate from Delaware in 1972, Democrats relied on an electoral coalition that revolved primarily around working-class white voters, many of them conservative on cultural issues, particularly those involving race. With those voters in sight, Biden was one of many generally liberal Democrats during that era who took nuanced, or even openly conservative, positions on racially infused issues, including school busing and crime. Biden now will force Democrats to decide whether those earlier views are still acceptable in a party that has moved left since then on all racially related issues, in response both to shifting attitudes in the country and the increasing diversity of its voters. ""His career is really a microcosm of the changes in the Democratic Party over the past half-century, all in one person,"" says Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and longtime Democratic policy analyst. The Democratic electorate is older, more moderate and less educated than you think The electoral landscape that confronted Democrats of Biden's generation is almost unimaginable for today's younger party activists. Read More Biden, a lawyer, began his political career in 1970 by winning a seat on the county council of New Castle, Delaware, which included Wilmington, the state's largest city. Two years later, he won election to the US Senate, just weeks before his 30th birthday. He served in the Senate for the next 36 years, until he joined President Barack Obama as his vice president in 2009. Over that period, the country -- and the Democratic coalition -- experienced enormous demographic change. In the 1976 election, when Democrat Jimmy Carter won the presidency, whites without college degrees composed 70% of all voters, according to an analysis of census data by the nonpartisan States of Change project. Minority voters -- almost all of them African-American -- made up only about 11% of voters then, with college-educated whites providing the remaining 19%. Even as late as 1992, when President Bill Clinton was first elected, those blue-collar whites still represented about 60% of all voters, with college whites composing about 25% and minorities the remaining 15%. According to the States of Change calculations, working-class white voters cast a majority of the votes in every presidential election until 2008 (when they represented 48% of the voters). African-American voters were already reliable Democrats by the 1970s, having moved decisively toward the party after the passage of the landmark civil rights laws in the 1960s. But white-collar whites in that period still leaned heavily toward the Republican Party: During the three presidential elections of the 1980s, Presidents Ronald Reagan and then George H.W. Bush carried college-educated whites by at least 20 percentage points each time. The result that Democrats in almost every state -- and certainly in presidential elections -- relied on an electoral coalition centered primarily on whites without college degrees and secondarily on African-Americans. In 1980, for instance, fully 60% of Carter's votes in his losing race against Reagan came from working-class whites, according to calculations by longtime Democratic elections analyst Ruy Teixeira, one of the founders of the States of Change project. ""That's a world that is gone, and it is easy for people to forget how different things were back then, both in terms of voting behavior and relative size of the groups,"" says Teixeira, co-author of ""America's Forgotten Majority,"" a 2000 book about the white working class. By 2016, blue-collar whites, in stark contrast, accounted for slightly less than 30% of the votes that Hillary Clinton won. That was partly because the group continued its long-term decline as a share of the total vote (reaching 44% by the States of Change calculations), but also because it broke so decisively toward Donald Trump. Minorities, including growing populations of Hispanics and Asian-Americans, provided about 40% of Clinton's votes, while whites with college degrees, among whom Democrats have gained strength steadily since the 1990s, contributed the remaining 30% or so. Younger Democrats reared in a political world where the party mobilized that latter coalition have little experience with the choices the party faced in the 1970s and 1980s. The principal electoral challenge facing Democrats during the first decades of Biden's career was crafting an agenda and message that could unite working-class whites and African-Americans. ""It was the central issue,"" said Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg, who became nationally known from his studies of white working-class alienation from the Democratic Party in Macomb County, Michigan, after the 1984 election. ""Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, were seen as very responsive to African-American voters in their time, yet they were also candidates who stretched to reach white working-class voters. You could not contemplate being successful and sustainable as a national party through Bill Clinton without making an imperative of (attracting) very strong support with both those groups."" Tensions in appealing to coalition Issues relating to racial equity were always the most vulnerable link in this chain. The Democratic reliance on white working-class voters in those years meant that their coalition included a significant number of whites who held conservative positions on race-related issues and even many with antagonistic views toward African-Americans. In the University of Michigan's National Election Studies , a comprehensive post-election survey, at least 70% of self-identified Democrats opposed busing to achieve school integration in 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984. Even as late as 1994, in polling by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, fully 59% of all white Democrats, and 63% of white Democrats without college degrees, rejected discrimination as the principal cause of inequality and said instead that ""Blacks who can't get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition."" In Pew's most recent polling, just 25% of all white Democrats, and 33% of them without college degrees, endorsed that view. The party ""had a significant number of very conservative, racially conservative, probably racist, Democrats in their coalition,"" said Greenberg. ""There was no other way to imagine it. That was your electorate. That was your state, that was your citizenry."" Delaware, a state with a large blue-collar white population, embodied the tensions in the Democratic coalition. In 1970, the year Biden first held elected office there, census figures showed that 84% of the state was white, and just 14% of white adults held college degrees. For Biden, like most northern Democrats in those years, there was no path to electoral success that did not include a competitive performance among non-college white voters: If he allowed his deficit with them to grow too large, there were simply not enough other voters to overcome it. With that electoral challenge as the backdrop, Biden followed a careful path on race-related issues throughout his long Senate career. Civil rights groups generally considered him an ally and praised his record on housing rights, voting rights, the passage of the Violence Against Women Act and his work as Judiciary Committee chair to win Senate ratification in 1994 for an international conventional on ending racial discrimination, fully 28 years after the US signed it. Joe Biden's handling of Anita Hill hearing re-emerges with latest controversy But Biden also regularly frustrated civil rights activists. He ""was a mixed bag,"" said one leading civil rights lobbyist during those years, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about Biden's record. ""He was certainly in the Democratic Party mainstream but he was to the right of center on some of the social justice issues of the times. He was always a supporter of voting rights; he was always a supporter of housing. He wasn't John Stennis"" -- the segregationist Democratic senator from Mississippi -- ""he wasn't a conservative Democrat or Republican. But he did have some issues where he was right of center. I think Joe has evolved. I don't think there was any question about that."" As Biden enters the contest, the most volatile racial issue he'll confront is likely the one that intersects with gender: his handling of Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment against Republican Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. But two other policies that embody shifting Democratic sentiment will also provoke extensive debate. One was Biden's prominent role in the 1970s promoting legislation to limit the use of school busing to combat racial segregation. He wasn't alone in that: Dozens of House Democrats, for instance, routinely voted for legislation to limit busing. But as historian Jason Sokol chronicled in his 2014 book ""All Eyes Are Upon Us, Race and Politics from Boston to Brooklyn,"" Biden was a leader in Senate efforts against busing, working arm in arm with archconservatives such as Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina well into the 1980s. ""What Biden did is he made anti-busing more politically respectable,"" said Sokol, an associate professor of history at the University of New Hampshire. Although busing was usually the only practical means to achieve school integration, Sokol says, ""Biden claimed he was pro-integration but anti-busing, which was disingenuous, but that was the position a lot of (Democrats) were looking for."" Choices defensible at the time? Two decades later, Biden was a principal author of the crime bill that passed under Bill Clinton. A complex balancing act between liberal and conservative priorities, the bill provoked withering criticism at the time from conservatives, but in recent years it has faced unmitigated hostility from liberals and civil rights advocates who see it as a wellspring of mass incarceration. Many centrist Democrats say Biden's choices on these issues are defensible on substantive grounds. When Congress passed and Clinton signed the crime bill, for instance, the violent crime rate was nearly double its level today, according to FBI figures, and most African-American mayors and members of Congress supported the legislation. And busing was always deeply controversial, with polls showing whites overwhelmingly opposed and even African-Americans closely divided over the policy. ""Could opposition to busing be defended in the context of the times?"" asked Galston, who served as Walter Mondale's issues director in the 1984 presidential campaign and Clinton's deputy domestic policy adviser. ""Yes, definitely. Because it was a policy which was typically, though not invariably, judicially enforced that lacked public authorization or buy-in, and that rested on certain premises about what equal educational opportunity amounted to that were eminently questionable."" The larger issue is not whether Biden can muster explanations for each of the positions he took on racially tinged debates decades ago. The real question may be whether a party that has moved to a very different consensus on those issues is better served by a nominee who ever held those views, whatever the justification, or one whose agenda and message have always reflected its modern racial perspective. Joe Biden's long path to woke 2020 Teixeira says it would be a mistake for Democrats to ""write off"" older white politicians -- and by implication older white voters -- from Biden's generation. ""It is just off to take people out of their historical context and judge them by the same norms we have today. It doesn't help to understand who they are and what they did when they did it,"" he says. ""Politicians say stuff not just because that's what they believe at the time, it's because they are embedded in a certain political context in which they are trying to put together 50+1 (of the vote). And they have to be sensitive to the views of their constituency."" Steve Phillips, author of the 2016 book ""Brown Is the New White"" and an advocate for increased Democratic focus on mobilizing nonwhite voters, doesn't entirely disagree. But he worries that Biden remains too focused on mollifying the blue-collar white voters whose conservative racial views shaped his formative political years. ""He obviously said very troubling, outright disqualifying things, particularly during the busing days, given where the party and the country is at today,"" said Phillips, who is supporting Cory Booker in 2020. ""But you need to allow the potential for him to have grown and evolved. The concern is that the premise of his candidacy is his capacity to win over those conservative white working-class voters who still hold those views. That's what is going to be the difficult needle to thread. Does he think his personality alone will attract them or will it be the issue set?"" On the other hand, even some veteran civil rights leaders frustrated with aspects of Biden's record still consider him the party's strongest potential nominee in 2020, precisely because he seems the best suited to win back the three Rust Belt states that Trump dislodged from the ""blue wall"" in 2016: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Early polling has found a stark generational divide in attitudes toward Biden, with the former vice president generating much more support among older Democratic voters than younger ones. As he joins the field, the debate over his posture on race -- which encapsulates the often wrenching evolution of the Democratic Party itself through his career -- seems likely to harden that divide. Biden's candidacy may measure the tolerance of younger Democrats for the choices that their elders made to navigate a very different demographic and political era."

Immigration Kirstjen Nielsen was just the beginning. Donald Trump is cleaning house at Homeland Security . A day after Nielsen was dropped as secretary of Homeland Security, Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles was given the boot. And word is at least two other senior leaders will soon be shown the door, too. One official described all this to CNN as "" a near-systematic purge ."" Many say this is the handiwork of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who has been nourishing the President's inclinations to take ever more hardline stands on immigration. So, Trump is now sweeping Homeland Security of those deemed not tough enough on the issue. We're also now getting more info on what led to Nielsen's ouster. She rebuffed Trump's order to shut down the border crossing at El Paso, Texas, and bring back the family separations policy for migrants. When Nielsen told the President closing the border crossing would only end legal trade and travel (and that migrants would just go between ports), Trump told her, ""I don't care."" And last week, during his visit to the border at Calexico, California, the President told border agents not to let migrants in, two sources told CNN. After Trump left the room, the agents' bosses told them essentially to disregard it, because doing what Trump ordered would be breaking the law. CNN's Stephen Collinson said it's a dilemma many in the administration end up having to deal with: ""They can respect the law or they can work for Donald Trump. It's often just not possible to do both."" JUST WATCHED Admin source likens firings to 'purge' of national security officials Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Twitter goes after spam with an obvious fix,edition.cnn.com,"Jordan Valinsky, CNN Business",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/twitter-limit-followers/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) To fight spam, Twitter is dramatically reducing the number of accounts users can follow each day.
The social network announced Monday that people can now only follow 400 accounts per day, down from the previous limit of 1,000. Twitter ( TWTR ) said that the change was made to cut down on spammers. ""Don't worry, you'll be just fine,"" Twitter told users in a tweet . Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, explained in several tweets that the number 400 was picked because it's a ""reasonable limit that allows people to follow the accounts they're interested in each day while stopping the most spam."" Twitter prohibits churning, the act of following and unfollowing the same account so a user can grow the number of his or her followers. Read More ""We found that nearly half of all accounts who made more than 400 follows per day were churning,"" Roth tweeted. ""That amounted to more than 20 million follows each day, and a high rate of blocks and spam reports — a clear signal that inorganic follows are super annoying."" ""Every choice we make about our rules, limits, and spam-fighting systems has to work for hundreds of millions of people around the world, many of whom use Twitter in very different ways,"" Roth wrote. It's the latest step Twitter has taken to stamp out spam. Last year, Twitter limited the amount of coordinated posts users could make across multiple accounts. It stopped people from posting identical or substantially similar content across multiple accounts at once and stopped accounts from being allowed to ""like"" or ""retweet"" or follow other users from multiple accounts at once. Twitter also tweaked its search using ""behavioral signals"" to push down more tweets that ""distort and detract"" from conversations and searches . The company also has deleted automated accounts that violate its rules, by spreading false information and engaging in other suspicious activity."
Bernie Sanders to unveil new Medicare for all bill as the party rallies around Obamacare - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Gregory Krieg,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/sanders-medicare-for-all-bill-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to introduce his new ""Medicare for All"" bill Wednesday morning, a move that will again push health care policy to the front burner of the Democratic presidential primary.
The new legislation's big-name co-sponsors include four of Sanders' fellow 2020 Democratic contenders -- Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand -- all of whom also signed onto an earlier version Sanders put out in 2017. Your cheat sheet to all the 2020 Democrats' 'Medicare for All' plans By unveiling his proposal now, Sanders is effectively doubling down on his signature policy idea and betting that his calls to eliminate private medical insurers will be a winning one with Democratic voters, even as the party rallies around Obamacare amid an escalating court battle instigated by Republicans and backed by President Donald Trump. But the move could light a match to a simmering debate within the Democratic Party, pitting Sanders against other candidates, including some of the Senate bill's co-sponsors, over the best path toward universal coverage. It is a fight Sanders appears to welcome. During the early stages of the 2020 campaign, he has relentlessly attacked private insurers, arguing that their presence is a malign influence on the whole of American health care -- a step, both rhetorically and on the policy front, that his opponents have so far refused to match. Warren, Harris and Booker have all signaled their willingness to consider compromise plans that allow private insurers a role to play in any new or revamped system. They're up against moderates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has said she is not in favor of Medicare for All, and Sen. Michael Bennet, who is planning to enter the race soon -- neither of whom are expected to join their more liberal colleagues. Read More The new legislation will update Sanders' 2017 bill, adding provisions to broaden its scope and potentially offer new details on Sanders' plans to pay for a program that could virtually wipe out the private insurance industry. More than 150 million Americans are currently covered by private insurance through their employers and tens of millions more through Medicare Advantage. Millions more buy coverage via the Affordable Care Act's exchanges. Sanders, despite backing other less ambitious bills in the past, has ramped up his attacks on the industry, which he and many of his supporters view as greedy and the root of the problem Medicare for All is designed to fix. ""Today, we say to the private insurance companies -- we say that whether you like it or not, the United States will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right,"" Sanders said at a rally in Los Angeles last month. ""The goal of health care is to provide quality care to all, not to have insurance companies make billions of dollars a year off our sickness."" A recent calculation by Axios found that top health care executives brought in more than $1 billion combined last year -- a fact that Sanders, using similar numbers, has frequently cited on the stump as evidence of a ""dysfunctional"" system. Under Medicare for All, everyone would be insured by a plan run by the federal government. It would cover all medically necessary care, including vision and dental. Private insurers could remain in business, but could only provide benefits -- such as elective surgery -- not covered by the federal plan. The main sticking point: the cost, which would be largely borne by taxpayers. Estimates of the 2017 plan run as high as $32 trillion over 10 years. Sanders' team argues that many people would still come out ahead because they wouldn't have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-pays. The Trump administration's decision in March to back a lawsuit that would strike down Obamacare triggered a unified round of backlash from Democrats, but it also highlighted the party's internal divisions, with moderates preferring to shore up the landmark health reform law and reverse many of the steps Trump and congressional Republicans have taken to undermine it. But Sanders has long held that simply patching Obamacare or creating a buy-in to public programs would not solve the underlying problems. ""As long as you have private insurance companies as a part of that equation, you're going to have a system that is not purely interested in making people healthy and doing it in the most cost-effective way possible,"" a Sanders aide told CNN after the Trump administration announced its new position, suggesting that the renewed public focus on the issue could be a boon to Sanders' campaign. ""I don't know what it says about other candidates,"" the aide said, ""but I think that it plays to his strengths as a candidate because he has a very clear message about health care and about the need to guarantee health care to every American as a right, not a privilege."" Support for Sanders' bill, which won 16 co-sponsors in 2017 after attracting none only a few years earlier, was framed by many on the left as a signal of the party's move left on healthcare and, in the context of a primary fight many have spent two years gaming out, his lead role in driving the debate. In speeches during the early phase of this second presidential campaign, Sanders has frequently reminded supporters that single-payer health care, an idea deemed ""too radical"" by the political establishment, has moved to the mainstream in the wake of his 2016 campaign. Democratic candidates in 2020, like Warren, Booker and Harris -- among many others -- have almost uniformly endorsed a broad expansion of government-run health insurance. But they are less inclined to package it with a call to topple the private sector insurers. Asked at a CNN town hall last month if there could be a role to play for those companies going forward, Warren didn't hesitate. ""There could,"" she told CNN's Jake Tapper . ""Or there could be a temporary role. Even Bernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's -- look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure that we land this in a way that doesn't do any harm. Everybody has got to stay covered. It's critical."" Booker, too, has been clear that private insurers would likely have a place even if can Democrats pass big-ticket health care expansion. ""Even countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care,"" he said soon after announcing his candidacy. Harris at a CNN town hall in January rattled off the complications that await many patients, including those with coverage, and said was ready to ""eliminate all of that."" But she has since offered a more nuanced position, in support of Medicare for All but with a continued openness to more incremental reforms and expansions."
Honestbee: Alibaba's online groceries rival from Singapore,us.cnn.com,Sherisse Pham,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/honestbee-new-retail-innovate-singapore/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Online grocery startup Honestbee is betting a brick-and-mortar store will help it compete against tech giant Alibaba ( BABA ) .
Singapore-based Honestbee, best known for its grocery app, has opened a massive cashless store called Habitat that offers a mix of online and offline shopping. Habitat users scan an app on their phones to enter the store. To check out, they push their carts through a gate into a secure area behind a panel. Shoppers can then grab a coffee or snack at one of Habitat's restaurants while their goods are scanned and packed. When the groceries are ready, they get a notification on their app and then head to a pickup area where a small robot retrieves a locker containing their bags. Shoppers can also order groceries at the store online and have them delivered to their homes. Amazon's grocery plans go way beyond Whole Foods ""We use phones to track, we use tech to make shopping easier, we use as much data as possible to make [our] inventory smarter,"" Honestbee co-founder Joel Sng said. ""To be honest, any store should be doing that."" Read More Honestbee is the latest tech company to try to upend the traditional retail experience , especially in food and groceries. It's facing increasing competition from Amazon ( AMZN ) in Singapore, and Alibaba-owned e-commerce platform Lazada across Southeast Asia. They're all competing for Asia's growing online grocery sales, which are set to hit $176 billion by 2022, up a whopping 194% since 2017, according to market research firm IGD. Habitat could help grow Honestbee's brand and attract new users, according to Shirley Zhu, a Singapore-based analyst with IGD. Zhu said Habitat has drawn comparisons to Alibaba's Hema stores in China, known as Fresh Hippo in English. Hema is also cashless and shoppers can scan and pay for goods with their phones, or they can order groceries online and have them delivered. ""If you look at Hema's success, it has relied on consumers understanding [the retail concept], and the ability to acquire new customers at low cost,"" she said. Habitat's cashless, automated checkout. More than 400,000 people visited the Habitat store in Singapore in its first three months, according to Sng. About 85% of them bought something and ""a good portion continue to make transactions today,"" he said. ""It also reactivated old customers that might have forgotten about us,"" he added. Honestbee plans to open a second Habitat store outside of Singapore by the end of the year, though Sng declined to say where. Alibaba's Lazada has also reportedly been experimenting with physical stores . The company has a strong grocery distribution network throughout Southeast Asia, and it has support from Alibaba's network of businesses and affiliates. Singapore gets its first 'zero energy' new building ""For Honestbee and Habitat, the direct competition will be Alibaba's Lazada,"" Zhu said. ""Habitat is a newcomer in the space, and if they compete with online players and supermarkets, it's going to be a really tough battle for them,"" she added. Honestbee operates in eight countries across Asia. Its online shopping app usually relies on partnerships with local grocery chains and 20,000 part-time employees to fulfill orders. The startup secured $15 million in 2015 from a handful of investors, among them Silicon Valley venture capitalist Formation 8, and some former Facebook ( FB ) and YouTube executives. The company declined to comment on how much money it has raised since then, and wouldn't disclose its current valuation."

""What a virgin experience it's been!"" says the former Springboks hero. Habana has spent his final day here racing kids, getting tackled and throwing a ball around as part of sevens series sponsor HSBC's Try Rugby initiative. Alongside the Hong Kong Rugby Union, the scheme is designed to get the game on more school curriculums here and encourage more children to play the game. Over the last few years, Try Rugby has introduced some 20- to 30,000 kids to the sport, according to Habana.

Ireland men also win their qualifier, an emotional moment for a national side that spent years in the sevens wilderness. The action is often jaw-slackeningly frenetic. Habana never had the chance to play here, but there is a hint of jealousy. Yet as the South African mentions the South Stand there, you may get a flash of recognition -- isn't that the crazy, packed-out stand, with everyone in costume? Is it noisy? You don't know the half of it. 'Bucket list' As he is asked whether he's seen anything like this before, a smile darts across athletics icon Michael Johnson's face. ""I follow the sevens and I've been to Dubai before, but no, this is my first time at the Hong Kong Sevens.""

When Habana says visiting Hong Kong ""has been pretty high on the bucket list for some time"" he mentions the South Stand in the same breath (him, O'Driscoll and Gregan all downed pints on front of that raucous crowd, naturally). By 9.30am on the Saturday of the sevens, the South Stand is full. No more room. But the queue to get in -- should anyone wish to opt out of the party in there -- has already formed. At 10am, we talk with 'Brad', who won't reveal his real name, but is identifiable by the Where's Wally costume he has on. There are a few other Wallys peppered through the line. It's Brad's first time. He is prepared to be at the back, just to say he's been in there. He is optimistic the wait won't be long. But some of his mates were preparing for this South Stand visit at 6.30am. For the teams that get knocked out of the tournament, in either the main event or the qualifiers, the initial instinct for many is to head towards that stand. When Ireland win their qualifier, many zero in on the section as quickly as possible. Second division? The Little Magician, Serevi, is here, trying to coach the Russian men's team back into the Sevens World Series. Arguably the greatest sevens player of all time, Serevi knows a thing or two about the game.

Hide Caption 9 of 9 He is right; Hong Kong often feels like the engine for sevens. Yet, if you are hunting a place at the top of the sport for a full season, as Serevi's Russia hope to be, there is only one option. Hong Kong hosts the only stand-alone qualifying event. You can plan a whole season around one event that decides your fate for the next term. Many want a second division of the Sevens World Series. Including World Rugby vice-chairman and chairman of sevens, Gus Pichot. ""The biggest objective for the next cycle is to have a second competition, and we are working very hard for that,"" says Pichot on the second day of competition. ""Where it is going to be held is still under discussion and it is part of a broader discussion but we decided in the Executive Committee (ExCo) strategic plan that part of the resources, money, is there to cover the expansion of the circuit for a second tier. ""I don't like to call it a second tier but it would be a different tournament that will provide access to other countries that don't play regularly and they have a sevens program."" As World Rugby prepare for key strategic meetings in Dublin, many hope that the lesser visited sevens nations get their shot as host. Going green In the Laureus box, Johnson smiles again when he says that clearly he would like the USA men to win this event. After all, the Eagles have shaken up the established order this season, leading the table in a season where the top four automatically qualify for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. As you can tell from the accounts of those above, new experiences have become a bit of a theme. Fitting, then, that at this event we see innovative light-up rugby posts that turn green when a conversion, penalty kick or even drop-goal is successful. The Hong Kong union want to go greener still, with revelers encouraged to purchase reusable pint mugs, rather than collecting and then chucking away plastic tumblers. They want to significantly reduce waste. And yet, some things here never change. Newbies and first-time fans may not know exactly how it will feel, but they know they are in for a good time. And everyone knows that Fiji come to play. In the final there are offloads over the head, yellow cards dished out and mighty runs from players like Aminiasi Tuimaba. After their 21-7 over France, Fiji coach Gareth Baber dedicates the victory to the victims of the atrocities in New Zealand in March, in which 50 people perished and 50 more were injured. During the game the Flying Fijians are just as classy. They are just seven points behind USA in the standings and with three legs left to play, the rest of the season should be just as energetic as a sing along to Queen."
Carlos Ghosn video: Former Nissan boss says he's the victim of a conspiracy,us.cnn.com,"Kaori Enjoji, CNN Business",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/carlos-ghosn-video-nissan/index.html,"Tokyo (CNN Business) Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has again professed his innocence in a new video and accused executives at the Japanese carmaker of conspiring to remove him from power.
""This is about a plot, this is about conspiracy, this is about backstabbing,"" Ghosn said in the seven-minute video, which was recorded before he was arrested last week in Japan for a fourth time . Ghosn, who once led a global autos alliance that consisted of Renault ( RNLSY ) , Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, claimed in the video that fears over a merger had prompted a revolt at Nissan and led to his ouster. Carlos Ghosn arrested again but vows he 'will not be broken' Neither Ghosn nor his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, offered a response to the latest allegations of financial misconduct that prompted the auto executive's arrest and return to jail. Nissan declined to comment on the video. Read More Japanese prosecutors accused Ghosn last week of siphoning off $5 million in payments made by Nissan ( NSANF ) to a dealer that he controlled. Ghosn is awaiting trial on separate charges that he understated his income for years and abused his position by transferring personal investment losses to Nissan. He has denied those charges. ""Unless Ghosn can offer evidence showing he did not steal from Nissan, his position is untenable,"" said Stephen Givens, who has been practicing law in Japan for more than 30 years. ""If the facts are as suggested, this is devastating for Ghosn,"" added Givens. Carlos Ghosn professes his innocence in a new video. Hironaka told reporters that he would file a special appeal to Japan's Supreme Court on Wednesday, arguing that there was no reason for Ghosn's rearrest. Ghosn is now back at the Tokyo jail where he was held for 108 days until he posted $9 million bail in March. Prosecutors can hold Ghosn until April 24, after which they must indict or release him. His arrest and detention has led to scrutiny of Japan's judicial system, which allows suspects to be questioned without a lawyer. Prosecutors in Japan also boast an extremely high conviction rate. Carlos Ghosn's lawyer tried to keep his release low profile. It backfired bigtime Hironaka criticized the treatment of Ghosn on Tuesday, saying the morning raid that preceded his latest arrest was ""inhumane."" Lawyers, including former public prosecutors, say that complaints of human rights abuse will do little to aid Ghosn's defense when his trial begins later this year. Renault unveiled new allegations against Ghosn last week, claiming that expenses incurred by its former CEO and chairman involved ""questionable and concealed practices"" that violated its ethics rules. The French carmaker also announced Ghosn's resignation from its board. Asked Tuesday whether Ghosn had any regrets about the nearly 20 years he spent leading Nissan, Hironaka said: ""He's saying it is a conspiracy. He doesn't think there is anything to regret."" Nissan cut its last remaining ties with Ghosn on Monday when shareholders voted to oust him from the board."
Twitter goes after spam with an obvious fix,us.cnn.com,"Jordan Valinsky, CNN Business",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/twitter-limit-followers/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) To fight spam, Twitter is dramatically reducing the number of accounts users can follow each day.
The social network announced Monday that people can now only follow 400 accounts per day, down from the previous limit of 1,000. Twitter ( TWTR ) said that the change was made to cut down on spammers. ""Don't worry, you'll be just fine,"" Twitter told users in a tweet . Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, explained in several tweets that the number 400 was picked because it's a ""reasonable limit that allows people to follow the accounts they're interested in each day while stopping the most spam."" Twitter prohibits churning, the act of following and unfollowing the same account so a user can grow the number of his or her followers. Read More ""We found that nearly half of all accounts who made more than 400 follows per day were churning,"" Roth tweeted. ""That amounted to more than 20 million follows each day, and a high rate of blocks and spam reports — a clear signal that inorganic follows are super annoying."" ""Every choice we make about our rules, limits, and spam-fighting systems has to work for hundreds of millions of people around the world, many of whom use Twitter in very different ways,"" Roth wrote. It's the latest step Twitter has taken to stamp out spam. Last year, Twitter limited the amount of coordinated posts users could make across multiple accounts. It stopped people from posting identical or substantially similar content across multiple accounts at once and stopped accounts from being allowed to ""like"" or ""retweet"" or follow other users from multiple accounts at once. Twitter also tweaked its search using ""behavioral signals"" to push down more tweets that ""distort and detract"" from conversations and searches . The company also has deleted automated accounts that violate its rules, by spreading false information and engaging in other suspicious activity."
EU-China summit: Why tensions between Europe and China are rising,us.cnn.com,Charles Riley,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/eu-china-summit/index.html,"London (CNN Business) An annual summit between the European Union and China threatens to expose deep cracks in the foundation of one of the world's most important trading relationships.
The leaders of Europe's largest countries are increasingly wary of the brand of economic nationalism practiced by China, and are responding with new barriers designed to blunt Beijing's influence. The messages emanating from European capitals have not been subtle. In March, the European Commission said that China can no longer be considered a developing country and labeled it a ""systemic rival."" French President Emmanuel Macron went further, accusing China late last month of trying to divide the bloc and declaring that ""the period of European naiveté is over."" ""I think the Chinese have been surprised by how quickly the mood in Europe has turned,"" said Erik Brattberg, director of the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. EU leader Juncker criticizes uneven relations with China days after Xi visit A key test of the relationship between China and its largest trading partner will come Tuesday, when Chinese Premier Li Keqiang meets EU officials in Brussels for an annual summit . Trade in goods between the European Union and China was worth roughly €575 billion ($650 billion) in 2017. Read More Three sticking points loom large: Restrictions on Chinese investment in Europe, rules that shut European companies out of China and concerns over the security of telecoms gear made by China's Huawei. Chinese investment in Europe Chinese foreign direct investment in the European Union dropped for a second consecutive year in 2018 to €17.3 billion ($19.5 billion), according to the Rhodium Group. It peaked at €37.2 billion ($42 billion) in 2016. The slump came as some of the biggest EU economies updated their rules on company takeovers and subjected investment from China to increased scrutiny. At least one deal has been blocked and others have faced delays. The European Union has since launched its own framework to screen state-supported foreign investment, especially in sensitive areas such as technology and critical infrastructure. ""There is a growing perception in Europe that investment from Chinese state-owned or state-controlled companies is strategically targeted at certain sectors and not motivated by a compelling business case,"" said Brattberg. European companies in China China also faces accusations of failing to level the playing field for European companies doing business there. ""China has increasingly become a strategic competitor for the EU while failing to reciprocate market access,"" the European Commission wrote last month in a strategic outlook on China. ""China preserves its domestic markets for its champions."" China's factories are now defying the economic slowdown EU officials have accused Beijing of shielding its companies from competition through licensing and investment restrictions, subsidizing state-owned companies heavily and selectively enforcing intellectual property protections. The European Commission has used the fintech and online payments industry as an example. Chinese companies in those industries are expanding in Europe, but European competitors are not allowed to do business in China. ""Given the magnitude of our trade and investment links, it is important to develop a more balanced and reciprocal economic relationship,"" the Commission wrote in March. The Huawei problem The European Union has come under intense US pressure to ban Huawei equipment from 5G networks following accusations that products made by the Chinese company pose a security risk. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations, and called on the Trump administration to provide evidence to back up its claims. Former top US generals issue 'grave' warning to ban Chinese tech The European Commission has made clear that EU member states are responsible for making their own security decisions, but it has also asked them to complete 5G risk assessments by the end of June. Countries will also complete a security review by the end of 2019 that will include steps to safeguard 5G at the EU level. A blanket ban on Huawei equipment appears unlikely, but targeted actions could also anger Beijing.

Bernie Sanders to unveil new Medicare for all bill as the party rallies around Obamacare - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Gregory Krieg,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/sanders-medicare-for-all-bill-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to introduce his new ""Medicare for All"" bill Wednesday morning, a move that will again push health care policy to the front burner of the Democratic presidential primary.
The new legislation's big-name co-sponsors include four of Sanders' fellow 2020 Democratic contenders -- Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand -- all of whom also signed onto an earlier version Sanders put out in 2017. Your cheat sheet to all the 2020 Democrats' 'Medicare for All' plans By unveiling his proposal now, Sanders is effectively doubling down on his signature policy idea and betting that his calls to eliminate private medical insurers will be a winning one with Democratic voters, even as the party rallies around Obamacare amid an escalating court battle instigated by Republicans and backed by President Donald Trump. But the move could light a match to a simmering debate within the Democratic Party, pitting Sanders against other candidates, including some of the Senate bill's co-sponsors, over the best path toward universal coverage. It is a fight Sanders appears to welcome. During the early stages of the 2020 campaign, he has relentlessly attacked private insurers, arguing that their presence is a malign influence on the whole of American health care -- a step, both rhetorically and on the policy front, that his opponents have so far refused to match. Warren, Harris and Booker have all signaled their willingness to consider compromise plans that allow private insurers a role to play in any new or revamped system. They're up against moderates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has said she is not in favor of Medicare for All, and Sen. Michael Bennet, who is planning to enter the race soon -- neither of whom are expected to join their more liberal colleagues. Read More The new legislation will update Sanders' 2017 bill, adding provisions to broaden its scope and potentially offer new details on Sanders' plans to pay for a program that could virtually wipe out the private insurance industry. More than 150 million Americans are currently covered by private insurance through their employers and tens of millions more through Medicare Advantage. Millions more buy coverage via the Affordable Care Act's exchanges. Sanders, despite backing other less ambitious bills in the past, has ramped up his attacks on the industry, which he and many of his supporters view as greedy and the root of the problem Medicare for All is designed to fix. ""Today, we say to the private insurance companies -- we say that whether you like it or not, the United States will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right,"" Sanders said at a rally in Los Angeles last month. ""The goal of health care is to provide quality care to all, not to have insurance companies make billions of dollars a year off our sickness."" A recent calculation by Axios found that top health care executives brought in more than $1 billion combined last year -- a fact that Sanders, using similar numbers, has frequently cited on the stump as evidence of a ""dysfunctional"" system. Under Medicare for All, everyone would be insured by a plan run by the federal government. It would cover all medically necessary care, including vision and dental. Private insurers could remain in business, but could only provide benefits -- such as elective surgery -- not covered by the federal plan. The main sticking point: the cost, which would be largely borne by taxpayers. Estimates of the 2017 plan run as high as $32 trillion over 10 years. Sanders' team argues that many people would still come out ahead because they wouldn't have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-pays. The Trump administration's decision in March to back a lawsuit that would strike down Obamacare triggered a unified round of backlash from Democrats, but it also highlighted the party's internal divisions, with moderates preferring to shore up the landmark health reform law and reverse many of the steps Trump and congressional Republicans have taken to undermine it. But Sanders has long held that simply patching Obamacare or creating a buy-in to public programs would not solve the underlying problems. ""As long as you have private insurance companies as a part of that equation, you're going to have a system that is not purely interested in making people healthy and doing it in the most cost-effective way possible,"" a Sanders aide told CNN after the Trump administration announced its new position, suggesting that the renewed public focus on the issue could be a boon to Sanders' campaign. ""I don't know what it says about other candidates,"" the aide said, ""but I think that it plays to his strengths as a candidate because he has a very clear message about health care and about the need to guarantee health care to every American as a right, not a privilege."" Support for Sanders' bill, which won 16 co-sponsors in 2017 after attracting none only a few years earlier, was framed by many on the left as a signal of the party's move left on healthcare and, in the context of a primary fight many have spent two years gaming out, his lead role in driving the debate. In speeches during the early phase of this second presidential campaign, Sanders has frequently reminded supporters that single-payer health care, an idea deemed ""too radical"" by the political establishment, has moved to the mainstream in the wake of his 2016 campaign. Democratic candidates in 2020, like Warren, Booker and Harris -- among many others -- have almost uniformly endorsed a broad expansion of government-run health insurance. But they are less inclined to package it with a call to topple the private sector insurers. Asked at a CNN town hall last month if there could be a role to play for those companies going forward, Warren didn't hesitate. ""There could,"" she told CNN's Jake Tapper . ""Or there could be a temporary role. Even Bernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's -- look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure that we land this in a way that doesn't do any harm. Everybody has got to stay covered. It's critical."" Booker, too, has been clear that private insurers would likely have a place even if Democrats can pass big-ticket health care expansion. ""Even countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care,"" he said soon after announcing his candidacy. Harris at a CNN town hall in January rattled off the complications that await many patients, including those with coverage, and said was ready to ""eliminate all of that."" But she has since offered a more nuanced position, in support of Medicare for All but with a continued openness to more incremental reforms and expansions."

Federal prosecutors pick up Trump's slack on this key issue (Opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Jennifer Rodgers,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/homegrown-terrorism-threat-rodgers/index.html,"Jennifer Rodgers is a CNN legal analyst, a lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own; view more opinion articles at CNN.
(CNN) The threat of homegrown terrorism, including white supremacist terrorism, appears to be on the rise . Headlines are full of recent terrorist attacks carried out by people with white supremacist views; they include the Tree of Life synagogue killer, the Coast Guard lieutenant charged with plotting a major attack on politicians and news anchors perceived to be left-leaning (he has pleaded not guilty ), the New Zealand mosque killer, and the mail bomber Cesar Sayoc.
Jennifer Rodgers In 2017, federal law enforcement officials, in an intelligence bulletin, acknowledged the persistent threat white supremacist terrorism presented, but the Trump administration seems to have ignored the findings. President Donald Trump for his part refuses to acknowledge that white nationalism in this mold is a rising terror threat, preferring to downplay these men as lone attackers with mental illnesses who have nothing to do with him and his divisive rhetoric. Recently, echoing the 2017 findings, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that white supremacy is a ""persistent, pervasive threat."" Despite expert analysis, though, we may be moving in the wrong direction: it was recently reported that the Department of Homeland Security has disbanded an intelligence and analysis unit dedicated to the threat of homegrown violent extremists, though DHS claimed it was more of a reorganization. Read More Cesar Sayocs can be found almost anywhere in America. Presidents should take heed This is why it is so important for federal prosecutors handling these cases to forge ahead and continue their vital work, as the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York did in the Cesar Sayoc case. For a number of days last October, the nation was gripped by the news that pipe bombs had been mailed to the homes and offices of numerous people (and a news organization -- CNN) having something notable in common: all had been repeatedly disparaged and attacked by President Donald Trump. We were riveted again when the FBI made an arrest in the case: Sayoc, a Florida man who apparently built the pipe bombs in a white van plastered with pro-Trump propaganda. On March 21, this case was resolved when Sayoc pled guilty in Manhattan federal court to a superseding information charging 65 counts, covering all of the 16 pipe bombs he sent to victims around the country. Sayoc will be sentenced in September. The sentencing guidelines range agreed to by Sayoc and prosecutors, which the judge must consider but is not bound by, is life imprisonment. And one of Sayoc's counts of conviction carries a mandatory minimum of 10 years imprisonment to be served consecutive to whatever sentence is imposed on the other counts. What to expect in the case against pipe bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc Practically speaking, this means that Sayoc will serve between 10 years and the rest of his life in prison. While we won't know until the fall what Sayoc's sentence is, securing this plea was a good move by prosecutors for a number of reasons. Prosecutors simply don't have enough time to take all of their cases to trial. Reduced charges are offered to people like Sayoc because a plea offers benefits for both parties: Sayoc escaped the possibility of conviction on more counts with mandatory minimum sentences, and prosecutors got a certain result without having to use precious resources on a trial. This will allow Southern District prosecutors to focus on other matters, including the upcoming death penalty-eligible terrorism trial of Sayfullo Saipov for allegedly using his van to murder eight people on the West Side Highway in October 2017. He pleaded not guilty, but has offered to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. JUST WATCHED Hate propaganda reaching historic levels, ADL says Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Hate propaganda reaching historic levels, ADL says 02:22 Guilty pleas also benefit the public by providing finality. Unlike a conviction at trial, after which defendants may -- and often do -- continue to profess their innocence, Sayoc's guilty plea required him to admit that he has committed the charged crimes, under oath and in public. Although he later sent a letter to the judge saying that the pipe bombs were meant to intimidate -- not hurt anyone -- the public can rest assured that Sayoc is guilty, and the plea obtained ensures that he will be sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Even in cases with strong evidence like this one, trials carry elements of uncertainty, and terrorism trials can be uniquely challenging and draining of prosecutorial resources. Given the nature of the charges, issues of security are paramount. Terrorism trials also generate a great deal of publicity, which can affect other trial participants, including witnesses' willingness to testify, and jurors' willingness to serve. Jurors may see press reports, which can endanger a guilty verdict on appeal, despite the warnings judges give to avoid them. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Finally, trials in terror cases are usually complicated procedurally and complicated in terms of the evidence presented. In the Sayoc case, government lawyers indicated that at trial they might have needed experts in multiple areas , including explosives, forensic chemistry, and DNA and fingerprint analysis. Of course, we should be able to rely on our President, our intelligence communities, and our investigative agencies to take these threats seriously and act accordingly. Hopefully they do. But at least Sayoc's guilty plea is a sign that the criminal justice system part of our government is working to deter those who would wish to follow in Sayoc's footsteps."
Democratic socialism is the scenic route to serfdom - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Jeffrey Miron and Ryan Bourne,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/democratic-socialism-is-the-scenic-route-to-serfdom-miron-bourne/index.html,"Jeffrey Miron is director of economic studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, and the director of graduate and undergraduate studies in the department of economics at Harvard University. Ryan Bourne occupies the R. Evan Scharf Chair in economics at the Cato Institute. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own; view more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) In his 1944 book ""The Road to Serfdom,"" Nobel prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek argued that socialist economic planning resulted not just in accumulating losses of economic efficiency but ""the very destruction of freedom itself.""
Ryan Bourne Jeffrey Miron History was kind to Hayek's worldview. The United Kingdom , Sweden , and India tested socialistic planning without sustained repression. But people in the Soviet Union, Venezuela, Cambodia and Cuba were not so lucky. Natural experiments between socialism and capitalism in East Germany and West Germany, North Korea and South Korea, and Hong Kong and China, bore out the link between economic liberty and personal freedom. Upon reunification , for example, GDP per capita in East Germany was one-third of the West German level, and the latter did not require the East's Stasi or emigration restrictions. In criticizing socialism as it existed in the 1930s and 1940s, though, Hayek meant a government that owned and operated the means of production, controlled prices, and planned where and how production took place. Economists since have broadly agreed this type of ""planned"" economy is flawed, albeit recognizing every country has socialistic programs. In 2019, ""socialism"" is enjoying something of a revival in American politics. A Gallup Poll last year suggested Democrat voters now think more positively of socialism than capitalism. Sen. Bernie Sanders has self-described as a ""democratic socialist"" since the 1960s, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a card-carrying member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Democrats should restore capitalism's promise, not abandon it for socialism Interestingly, these modern socialists do not rhetorically echo their predecessors' definition. ""To me, socialism doesn't mean state ownership of everything,"" Bernie Sanders has said , ""...it means creating a nation ... in which all human beings have a decent standard of living."" Read More Lest we think socialism merely a lofty aspiration, Bhaskar Sunkara , editor of Jacobin magazine, recently claimed the key plank of socialism today is an expansive welfare state entrenching certain economic activities -- such as health care and child care -- as social rights. Social democracies, such as Sweden, have been held up by Ocasio-Cortez as her vision for the future . Superficially, this seems good news. If the ""socialism"" label now describes social democracy -- capitalist economies with highly redistributive welfare states -- then the ""red scare"" is overplayed. We need not worry about Hayek's highway to Havana, but can debate taking the street to Stockholm. Some liberals even endorse a grand bargain with ""socialists"": more social welfare in exchange for a lightly regulated economy with a well-designed tax system, to generate high levels of income to redistribute. What 2020 Dems can't afford to ignore about Bernie Alas, this sanguine view is delusional. Today's socialists, while jettisoning the desire for direct government ownership, would put us on a path to Hayek's destination, albeit via the scenic route. Their vision implies far more intrusive government than the social democratic rhetoric suggests. Sunkara, for example, has called for converting shareholder firms into worker-owned cooperatives ( something Sanders supports ). This ""market socialism"" saw Yugoslavia's economy run into the same stagnation and inefficiency as the centrally planned variant elsewhere. For a start, the problem that cooperatives have in raising capital will require national or regional investment banks to provide funds , thus government would be picking winners and allocating resources. Far from letting markets rip, the Green New Deal , or GND, advocates placing the economy on a war footing to reach a net zero carbon target within 30 years, including overhauling the transport sector and converting all buildings to make them energy efficient. This is the antithesis of market-led decision-making. The GND's social goals do not end with fiscal transfers, either. A jobs guarantee paying a family wage would see the federal government become the world's largest employer , placing workers into its favored environmental, infrastructure and caring sectors. The GND also demands emboldened labor unions, strengthened labor market regulation, and beefed up trade rules to protect domestic workers and manufacturing. Elsewhere, socialists have extolled ""free"" college , breaking up financial institutions , and a $15 minimum wage . Far from a broad-based, pro-growth tax system to deliver the revenues for this agenda, modern socialists range from favoring direct money printing (aka Modern Monetary Theory, a view dismissed as nonsense by every reputable economist across the spectrum ) to endorsing extraordinarily high, distortionary tax rates on the rich. In fact, some want punitive tax rates to reduce inequality, even if this raises less revenue. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Where today's socialists want more generous social protections through guaranteed health care, child care, and other benefits-in-kind, the distinction between government ownership and financing will be illusory in practice. Once government covers the costs of a service, it sets limits on how much it pays as the major consumer, creating de facto price controls. Governments attach conditions to their spending, too, defining who can work in an industry or the standards producers must meet. These regulations create shortages in high-cost areas, necessitating subsidized provision to meet demand. Before long the industry is effectively nationalized through regulation. Hayek's key observation was that intervention creates problems that encourage further corrective intervention, eroding freedom along the way. Today's socialists might not demand eliminating private property, nor be calling for gulags to enforce their vision. But, combined, their proposed regulatory, spending, and taxing onslaught would severely restrict freedom and undermine prosperity, just like the socialist experiments of old."

Wells Fargo unloads retirement-plan unit for $1.2 billion - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/investing/wells-fargo-selling-retirement-principal/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Wells Fargo is saying goodbye to its retirement-plan business as the bank continues to grapple with penalties, legal fees and a backlash over its scandals.
Principal Financial ( PFG ) signed a $1.2 billion deal on Tuesday to acquire Wells Fargo's ( WFC ) institutional retirement and trust business. The unit serves 7.5 million retirement customers across the United States, offering 401(k), pension, employee stock ownership and other services used by employers. Wells Fargo said the deal reflects its goal of focusing resources on areas it can grow and maximizing opportunities within wealth, brokerage and asset management. The Wells Fargo business had $827 billion in assets under administration at the end of the year. The decision to exit the retirement-plan business also comes as Wells Fargo deals with reputational problems , legal costs and unprecedented sanctions . Read More Wells Fargo's CEO is out. Here's how the bank can end its crisis The Federal Reserve, citing ""widespread consumer abuses,"" imposed an asset cap on Wells Fargo in early 2018 that prevents the bank from growing its business. Principal Financial expressed confidence that the retirement-plan business it's acquiring isn't stained by the deep cultural troubles uncovered at Wells Fargo. ""To the best of our knowledge, there weren't problems in this part of the organization,"" Principal CEO Dan Houston told CNN Business. Houston said Principal conducted ""extensive"" due diligence over the past six months examining the business and its employees. ""We feel very good about that,"" Houston said. Last month, Wells Fargo announced the abrupt departure of CEO Tim Sloan , a three-decade veteran of the bank and its troubled culture. Wells Fargo's board of directors promised to hire an outsider. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, Wells Fargo's leading shareholder, urged the board not to hire a Wall Street executive because that would only inflame the bank's political problems. For the Des Moines, Iowa, based Principal, the Wells Fargo deal will double the size of its US retirement business and strengthen its foothold among mid-size employers. More than two-thirds of the accounts are from employers with plans ranging between $10 million and $1 billion. ""We're excited. This is a real win-win for our customers and shareholders,"" Houston said. The price tag on the deal could rise to $1.35 billion two years after closing if certain revenue targets are hit. The Wells Fargo retirement businesses are served by 2,500 employees, including US workers in Charlotte, Minneapolis and Waco, Texas, as well as overseas in the Philippines and India. Principal signaled it plans to keep most of those workers in place after the deal closes. That is expected to occur in the third quarter if regulators approve it.

Lloyd's of London is finally banning drinking and drugs - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Michelle Toh,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/lloyds-of-london-drinking-ban/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) London's centuries-old insurance company is finally banning drugs and drunks.
Lloyd's of London said Tuesday that it will bar people believed to be drunk or on drugs from its premises. And anyone who attempts to enter its building while under the influence will have his or her security pass confiscated. It's not the first time that Lloyd's has cracked down on daytime drinking. In 2017, the insurance market banned its employees from drinking during work hours, saying the policy would ""remove ambiguity about what's acceptable."" But that rule has largely been ignored, according to Bloomberg. It was also limited to Lloyd's employees, and did not apply to the huge number of brokers employed by other companies that work in the Lloyd's market. The gender pay gap is getting worse at half of UK companies Read More ""We banned drinking during the working day and we believe the people who work for us have embraced that ban,"" a Lloyd's spokesperson said Tuesday. ""The insurance culture is changing, though the marketplace as a whole has more work to do."" The new policy has been implemented following the publication of a Bloomberg report that cataloged rampant sexual harassment at the insurance market, which it described as ""the most archaic corner left in global finance."" Bloomberg reported that much of the harassment of women was fueled by a culture where heavy drinking during work hours remained acceptable long after most London workplaces did away with lunch drinks. A doorman stands outside the Lloyd's building in London in 2017. Lloyd's, which got its start 330 years ago, outlined a plan last month to address complaints of sexual harassment, saying it would conduct a survey to examine the culture and ""identify the scale and scope of the issue."" It also said it would offer employees a confidential place to report inappropriate behavior, and vowed that anyone found to have committed misconduct would face penalties and possibly be banned from entering Lloyd's. ""The update to rules for accessing Lloyd's premises is just one part of our wider action plan to stamp out inappropriate behavior in the Lloyd's market,"" a spokesperson told CNN Business on Tuesday. ""We are serious about delivering on our commitment to change the culture for the better, ensuring Lloyd's is a safe and inclusive environment for all our members,' the spokesperson added. The interior of Lloyd's of London photographed in 2016. Barbara Schönhofer, founder of the Insurance Supper Club, a networking group for women in the sector, said the move was a step in the right direction. ""In an attempt to try and reduce harassment of all forms in the work place we need to identify the behaviors that cause them,"" she said. ""It has become apparent that alcohol is a leading cause, but not the only [cause] that is driving these behaviors so I can only support Lloyd's of London in this new code of conduct."""
IMF: Trade is dragging down global economic growth - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lydia DePillis,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/economy/world-economic-outlook/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The world economy is still slowing, the International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday, but a pickup is on the horizon — growth is expected to recover next year unless ""policy missteps"" get in the way.
The organization, which monitors emerging risks and lends to countries in distress, cut its growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3%, down from 3.5% in January's edition of the World Economic Outlook. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's executive director, said the global economy is in a ""delicate moment."" ""Only two years ago, 75% of the global economy experienced an upswing,"" Lagarde said, according to the text of a speech she's due to give at the US Chamber of Commerce. ""For this year, we expect 70% of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth."" The downward revision came in part from a sharp drop in global trade volumes in recent months following an artificial run-up in imports and exports in 2018 in advance of tariffs imposed by the United States. Adding Imposing further duties, the report said, could prevent the global economy from stabilizing. Read More ""The main priority is for countries to resolve trade disagreements cooperatively, without raising distortionary barriers that would further destabilize a slowing global economy,"" the report read. President Donald Trump has recently pulled back on his threat to impose auto tariffs on a handful of countries, but maintains that he may use tariffs as leverage to push Mexico to do more to keep Central American migrants from reaching America's southern border. National Economic Council chairman Larry Kudlow told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that further tariffs are far from a sure thing. ""He's just issuing a warning,"" Kudlow said, of Trump. ""If you know this president as I do, you better listen to him."" The authors of the IMF report did take heart in a move toward patience on behalf of central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, which signaled in March that it would hold off raising interest rates for the remainder of the year. The IMF stuck to its projection of 3.6% growth in 2020. Amid a global manufacturing malaise that seemed to be spreading to the United States, and a run of negative economic data, some analysts had begun talking about a return to rate cuts by the end of 2019, which Trump also called for last week. A robust employment report for US hiring in March, however, took the edge off those concerns. ""Last week's releases provide some reassurance that the world economy is not falling off a cliff, which had seemed a plausible, if relatively small, risk as recently as a month or so ago,"" wrote Capital Economics chief economist Neil Shearing in a note to clients on Monday. However, the IMF also signaled caution about the buildup of risky loans taken out by US companies as an area of concern. If interest rates were to rise suddenly, all that leverage could make for a much more severe downturn when the growth cycle comes to an end. -- CNN's Donna Borak contributed to this report."
"Whitening strip ingredient is harmful to deep layer of teeth, research says - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/whitening-strips-study/index.html,"(CNN) Hydrogen peroxide, the active ingredient in over-the-counter whitening strips, may be harmful to the layer under the enamel of teeth, according to research presented Tuesday at a scientific meeting.
Teeth are made up of three layers: the outer enamel, an underlying dentin layer and connective tissue that binds it to the gum. The middle layer, dentin, is rich in proteins, of which collagen is the most abundant. This affordable at-home teeth whitening kit is a game-changer Most studies on the safety of hydrogen peroxide have focused on enamel. The chemical is known to penetrate the enamel and reach the dentin, although in miniscule amounts, explained Dr. Edmond Hewlett, associate dean at the UCLA School of Dentistry and spokesman for the American Dental Association, who was not involved in the new study. Kelly Keenan, senior author of the study and associate professor of chemistry at Stockton University in New Jersey, said in a statement that she and her colleagues ""sought to further characterize what the hydrogen peroxide was doing to collagen."" Essentially, all whitening products in the United States contain hydrogen peroxide and/or carbamide peroxide, according to the American Dental Association. Read More Using entire teeth and artificial saliva, the researchers watched the collagen in dentin break down into smaller proteins when treated with hydrogen peroxide, according to the results, presented at the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology meeting . ""Our results show that treatment with hydrogen peroxide concentrations similar to those found in whitening strips is enough to make the original collagen protein disappear,"" Keenan said. Hewlett cautions against generalizing results obtained in extracted teeth, as they may not represent the same environment as a person's mouth. Because the research is in its early stages, it's unknown to what extent the dentin is damaged, what this would mean for patients and whether the damage is permanent, he said.

""The tooth-whitening products that the abstracts are talking about have been around for decades and used by millions and millions of people,"" he said. ""As far as the integrity of the tooth being damaged, that has not emerged."" The most common side effect that dentists see after the use of whitening strips is tooth sensitivity, which is transient and does not represent underlying damage of the tooth, he said. Hewlett recommends looking for products that have the American Dental Association seal of acceptance, which means they have been tested for safety and effectiveness by the organization."
Top Democrats request info on White House role in not defending ACA - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democrats-documents-white-house-aca/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Top House Democrats sent letters Monday to Trump administration officials requesting documents and other information about the White House's role in not defending the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.
The three letters are addressed to Attorney General William Barr, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Administrator Seema Verma of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They ask for the information to be provided by April 22. In the letter to Barr, the Democrats write, ""We write to express our concern regarding the troubling decision by the Department of Justice ... not to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act."" ""This refusal appears to be violating longstanding policies to defend and enforce Acts of Congress, will have a significant negative impact on the accessibility of health care for Americans, and appears to be driven by political considerations rather than considered legal arguments,"" the letter continues.

2020 candidate says his universal basic income plan would be a 'game changer' for Americans - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/andrew-yang-universal-basic-income/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang said Tuesday his idea to give Americans a universal basic income of $1,000 a month would be a ""game changer.""
Yang, who has centered his campaign around the policy proposal, told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" that the plan would spur economic growth and create new jobs to supplement ones lost to automation. ""If you get pushed out of a job by automation, how is $12,000 a year going to change your life?"" Berman asked. ""Well, I've looked at the numbers around the country and I've spent the last seven years helping create several thousand jobs in the Midwest and the South. And so $1,000 a month would be a game-changer for tens of millions of Americans,"" Yang replied, adding that a universal basic income would add jobs ""because of the economic activity."" ""It would make our labor force much more dynamic,"" he said. Andrew Yang raises $1.7 million for 2020 bid in first quarter Read More Yang, who believes automation is ""very much so"" a threat to the fabric of America, agreed that the plan would act as a sort of insurance plan against the threat of automation, saying it would give Americans ""a real path forward"" in a rapidly changing economy. ""The thing that excites me the most is you can see that it would improve people's health, nutrition. It would elevate graduation rates, it would improve people's mental health. But it would help people make transitions in a time of historic change,"" he said. Yang also said the effects of automation in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania were the reason why President Donald Trump was elected in 2016, but noted that companies that play a role in automating jobs -- such as Amazon -- should find ways to expand opportunities for Americans. ""We need to make it so that more people can share in the progress that's being driven by all of this innovation,"" he said."
Tottenham Hotspur vs. Manchester City: All English clash to test quadruple credentials of Pep Guardiola's team - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Matias Grez, for CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/football/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-uefa-champions-league/index.html,"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London (CNN) Son Heung-min may have struck a wonderful late winner to hand Tottenham a crucial first-leg victory over Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinal on Tuesday, but the gloss was taken off an otherwise perfect evening as the host lost Harry Kane to injury.
The home fans held their breathe as Kane, who has scored 24 goals this season, limped off down the tunnel after rolling his ankle awkwardly under a challenge from Fabian Delph, knowing just how important the England international is for their hopes of success this season. ""It's a worry for us,"" Tottenham manager Pochettino said after the game. ""We are going to miss him -- maybe for the rest of the season. ""We hope it is not a big issue but there is not too much time to recover. He twisted his ankle so we will see how it reacts in a few hours."" Worryingly for Spurs, Kane was forced to miss almost two months of action earlier in the season after sustaining ligament damage on the same ankle. Read More Harry Kane was forced off with injury in the second half. READ: How 'Little Seoul' fell in love with its favorite Son But if there can be a silver lining for Tottenham it's that Son seems to thrive in Kane's absence. In the five weeks the striker missed through injury at the start of 2019, the South Korean scored four goals in as many games. Upon Kane's return to the starting XI, Son had managed just one goal in seven games going into Tuesday's match. It then took him just 20 minutes from Kane hobbling off the score the winner. New home Before Tuesday's clash against Manchester City, Tottenham's long-serving defender Jan Vertonghen, now in his seventh year in north London, said the opportunity to move into a new stadium comes only ""once in a generation"" for players and fans. Though the move was intended to usher in a new era and help Spurs take its place at European football's top table, the Belgian urged supporters to be patient, reminding them the team ""need time to build history"" in its new $1.3 billion home. Had this first-leg been at Wembley -- the national stadium which, at times, made for an uncomfortable temporary home for Spurs -- few would have given Pochettino's side a chance against City. Tottenham had failed to beat Guardiola's team in its previous four meetings, losing three of those, and City was on an indomitable run of 22 wins from 23 matches. But Tuesday's game felt special. The fans sensed it, too, creating a deafening, near-constant noise in the lead-up to kick off -- and the players responded. Although last Wednesday's homecoming victory against Crystal Palace was an historic moment for the club -- ""a truly emotional evening,"" as manager Pochettino described it -- the match against City offered Spurs the opportunity to prove it could truly make this new house a home. Strange City XI Tottenham's attacking trio of Kane, Son and Dele Alli was rabid from the first whistle, not allowing City's defenders to rest for a moment. It was the latter who would create the first chance of the match, winning the ball back in midfield and playing it wide to Moussa Sissoko. Tottenham's 17,500-capacity south stand, modeled on Borussia Dortmund's famous 'Yellow Wall.' The Frenchman returned the pass, lofting the ball into the box for Alli to run onto. His connection was crisp but the ball fizzed over Ederson's crossbar. For all its experience at the top level, City appeared nervous. Much was made of its inability to deal with the pressure at Anfield at this same stage last season, finishing that match on the wrong end of a 3-0 humbling. Despite the cacophony of noise inside the stadium, you could almost hear the collective sound of 120,000 eyebrows being raised as Manchester City's lineup was announced. There was only a place on the bench for star midfielders Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sane, while Bernardo Silva -- arguably's City's best player this season -- was left out entirely. In came Riyad Mahrez, much maligned when called upon this season, and the lesser-spotted Delph, filling in for Benjamin Mendy at left back. But with 10 minutes on the clock, and with City having barely left its half, the visiting side was gifted a route into the match. In his first foray forward, Raheem Sterling jinked and weaved his way inside onto his right foot and struck at goal, only to be denied by a last-ditch block by Danny Rose. Referee Bjorn Kuipers initially pointed for a corner, before the video assistant referee advised him to view the pitch-side monitor for a potential stray hand from the English left back. The Dutch official needed to watch merely two replays to change his decision and award what was a clear penalty. Unable to watch the same replays Kuipers had, the Spurs supporters were incensed with the decision and the sound of 60,000 simultaneous boos rumbled through the stadium.

READ: Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's bizarre miss forces PSG to wait for Ligue 1 title Up stepped Sergio Aguero, faced not only by Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal but also the vast, imposing single-tier stand at the south end of the stadium. Modeled on the stand which houses Borussia Dortmund's famous 'Yellow Wall,' the 17,500 fans erupted as Lloris guessed the right way and palmed away Aguero's tame penalty. Rising Son It would prove to be City's only real chance in a match which, from then on, looked like Tottenham's to win. From Lloris' save, six white shirts broke forward and descended onto Ederson's goal. By the end of the move, City had desperately hauled 10 of its 11 players back into the box to defend, something which would become a running theme. The half-time whistle drew a deafening roar from the home fans, who sensed this night could be different. This was only the second time in their history that Tottenham had reached this stage of the Champions League, last time being comprehensively beaten by Real Madrid. READ: Bayern Munich thump Borussia Dortmund in Bundesliga, Barcelona close in on Liga title Having never previously reached the semifinals, Spurs felt it was its place for the taking. With barely 10 minutes left on the clock, Son feinted his way past Delph and drilled a low shot through Ederson in the City goal. If anyone thought the noise inside had the stadium had been raucous previously, the fans hit new decibels celebrating the South Korean's goal. ""As a team, we never give up,"" Son told BT Sport after the match. ""We fought for 90 minutes. We were more clinical than them and deserved to win. ""I like this stadium -- it's amazing to play here and I'm really, really grateful for the opportunity."" Though Pochettino and Co. will wait anxiously for the results of Kane's scan ahead of the second-leg in eight days time, Tottenham can, for tonight at least, celebrate a victory that makes this daunting stadium feel a little more like home.
