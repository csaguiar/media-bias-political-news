Any new referendum should now be on the question of what type of Brexit they want, and then for parliament to deliver what is decided. May's Soft Brexit, Corbyn's Customs Union, or Johnson's Hard Brexit. The EU has been quite strategic is creating a situation to get a new referendum to overturn Brexit. Quietly watching on the sidelines as May self destructed.
Labour's Watson comment that they have to support a second referendum or risk losing the election. Question is risk losing to whom? Labour still has a high approval rating. And apart from UKIP nothing comes close. LDP - only in London. And UKIP itself may not exist if electoral agency finds election funding anomalies. Change UK - going backwards. Corbyn is the only game in town unless the party officials blow it by intervening.
A second referendum on Brexit is a bad day for democracy because it tells the people who voted for Brexit the first time, that democracy does not work and that Deep State will manipulate the situation until they get the result the elite want. That voting is useless and only a violent uprising will bring about change."

Parkville murder: Melbourne reacts with horror as police hunt killer | Australia news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,msn.com,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/26/parkville-melbourne-reacts-with-horror-as-police-hunt-killer,"Victoria police said Herron, who had no fixed address, was killed in Royal Park on Friday night. Courtney Herron, a 25-year-old woman of no fixed address, has been identified as the victim of “a horrendous bashing” on Friday night that occurred before she was found dead in Royal Park in Parkville, Melbourne , Victoria police say.
The latest victim of violence directed at a young woman alone on Melbourne’s streets at night, Herron’s death has horrified Melbourne.
“Courtney had experienced issues with drugs and mental health,” Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper, who is leading the investigation into her murder, told reporters on Sunday. “And, as we are all aware, homelessness is often a factor that goes with those two challenges in life. As far as we’re aware, Courtney’s been couch surfing with friends and possibly rough sleeping as well.
“We do have a result from the post-mortem examination that revealed she died as a result of – a horrendous bashing – that’s the only way to describe it.”

Stamper said Herron had been initially attacked not far from where her body was found. He said there had been an effort to conceal her body behind a partially burned log.
It was not clear at this stage whether a weapon had been used, he said, adding that it was a particularly horrific attack. The post-mortem had so far indicated Herron had not been sexually assaulted, he said.
Members of the public have started to lay floral tributes at the site where Herron’s body was found, which is a short distance from Princes Park, where Eurydice Dixon’s body was found on 12 June last year. Aiia Maasarwe, 21, was killed on her walk home near La Trobe University on 15 January. Jaymes Todd, 19, has pleaded guilty to the murder and rape of Dixon and will return to court in August, while Codey Herrmann, 20, has been charged with attacking Maasarwe.
In April Natalina Angok’s body was found dumped in Melbourne’s Chinatown, allegedly killed by her one-time partner Christopher Allen, who has been charged.

The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said of Herron’s death: “This is a terrible tragedy.
“This is not about the way women behave, this is not about where women are at what hour.
“This is most likely about the behaviour of men.”
Stamper said Victoria police were “very focused on finding the perpetrator of this crime”.
He said it appeared likely Herron had been killed in the park. Her body was was found by dog walkers early on Saturday morning.
Stamper urged anyone that might have been in the area of Royal Park, particularly at Elliott Avenue and its intersection with Flemington Road – one of the major intersections in Melbourne – who saw anything suspicious on Friday night and Saturday morning to contact police.
Police are also speaking to people known to sleep rough in the park. Herron was wearing a black tracksuit, runners and a light brown sleeveless vest, and had long hair, Stamper said.
“We would appeal to anyone in the community, either people who knew Courtney, or didn’t, who may have information to assist us,” he said.
On 14 May, Herron had “contact” with police at St Albans. Police were working to fill in the gaps from that confirmed sighting.
“It’s really important we fill in the gaps of where she’s been, who she was associating with, of recent times,” Stamper said. “These are very key aspects of our investigation.”

Stamper said Herron had been identified overnight by forensic experts and police had been in touch with her family. He described Herron as being a Melbournian from the inner northern suburbs, whose relationship with her family had been fractured due to her mental health issues.
“Courtney had sporadic contact with her family,” he said. “Again, you know, it’s very much part of the challenge when there’s a child that suffered drug use, mental health issues, family relationships can be fragmented.
“We are dealing with a heart-broken family.”
For locals, the news has also been shocking.
Ned Thompson, who lives locally, left flowers at the Parkville scene to pay his respects.
“It’s just too close to home with Eurydice Dixon,” he told the Herald Sun. “I went to her memorial and I was really moved … This just has to stop.”

Another resident who lives nearby, Peter Chalmers, also spoke to the News Corp paper.
“It is pretty ghastly,” he said. “I walk here every day and often see young girls alone.
“There should be more lights because it’s dark at night.”
A card at the scene reads: “You deserved so much better. May you rest in everlasting peace.”
North Park tennis club head coach Gabriel Moise told the ABC it was “pretty scary” to learn of the discovery of Herron’s body.
“It’s very bad … it’s pretty confronting,” he said.
He said more lighting was needed in the area.
“It is fairly dark in the morning,” he said. “When I open up here [at the tennis courts] it’s pitch black.”

Now they've served the stiffest penalty ever meted out for fiddling with a cricket ball, they have won their places back.
Now, do you think any Australian players are going to ball tamper in the future? CA has put down a very clear standard; other national cricket organisations, not so much.
