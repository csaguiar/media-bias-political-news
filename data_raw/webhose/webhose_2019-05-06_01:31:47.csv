Nadler: 'There was in plain sight open collusion',thehill.com,Zack Budryk,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/437740-nadler-there-was-in-plain-sight-open-collusion,"Jared Corey Kushner The high price for supporting Bibi Netanyahu Speaker in waiting? Rapid rise of Hakeem Jeffries fuels talk Stephen Miller's influence rising amid changes at DHS MORE ’s 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian associates allegedly indicates “there was in plain sight open collusion with the Russians,” Nadler said on CBS’ “Face The Nation.”
Mueller last month concluded his investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow. He did not find evidence of cooperation between Trump's campaign and Russia, according to a four-page summary of his findings provided to Congress by Attorney General William Barr William Pelham Barr The Hill's 12:30 Report: Barr says there was 'spying' on Trump campaign Finally united, House Republicans refer ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen for perjury prosecution Fox News legal analyst: 'There must be some evidence' of criminal activity in Mueller report MORE .
Noting that Mueller also reportedly made no determination on obstruction of justice, Nadler called Barr “a biased person” who primary serves the interests of the White House.

The full Mueller report has yet to be released and Nadler said Barr should redact “none of” the Mueller report before delivering it to the Judiciary Committee. He expressed confidence that information would not leak to the public.
""The committee has a very good record of protecting information which it decides to protect,” he said.
He also addressed claims he opposed the release of similar findings by Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr in 1998 after his investigation of then-President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson Clinton Gillibrand: Hillary Clinton 'still a role model' but 'my views on her husband' are different Twitter disables video with 'Dark Knight' music Trump shared Warner Bros files copyright claim after Trump shares video with music from 'Dark Knight' MORE .
Calling the comparison “apples and oranges,” Nadler said his remarks on the Starr report concerned the release of grand jury information to the public rather than to Congress.
Nadler did not take a position on whether the full Mueller report could contain grounds for impeachment, saying “there could be grounds for impeachment, there could be grounds for other actions, there could be things the American people ought to know.”"

When pointing out bad results such as open boarders causing lowered wages for the poor blacks whom these leftists claim to love I swear they cannot hear...I really mean they cannot allow the truth to enter their minds as if I suddenly started speaking Swahili. I have tried for years to make converts and may have been successful a few times but too few.

I have argued endlessly with democrats who are white, black, and brown, and it is like head-butting a big tree. You can carefully take them down a path of logic, and they will agree with every step, but when they realize that they willingly walked to a dead end where they can't disagree, they become hostile. The embarrassment of being proven wrong is intolerable.
I think this illustrates the power of indoctrination and propaganda coupled with stolen prosperity (devalued dollar + punitive energy costs + punitive taxation + hostile and destructive government (D) policies). If that's not the problem then homo-sapiens are really two species.

Trump could fix the border problem even without Congress. But he is doing nothing. We have the most illegal immigrants ever this year and Trump repeatedly called for the most legal ones on top of that. Seriously? Might as well have a Democrat if the result is the destruction of America anyway.
Maybe remember why we put him there would help in 2020 because as things are now the entire far right has abandoned Trump. When you read the respective forums you see that a huge chunk of his voterbase is shilling for Andrew Yang just for the fun of it.
I remember the rigged polls in 2016 that were designed to discourage Trump voters and make them stay at home.
I have a feeling the same people are rigging the positive polls now in order to make Trump believe that ""getting the most legal immigrants ever"" and ""Making lsrael great again"" is something that will get him re-elected. The people behind the MSM have learned their lessons."

I think leftists know instinctively that if they recognize that they are wrong they will have to re-evaluate their entire reason for existence. If this is true, the motivation to be willfully ignorant might be abject fear. For example, can you imagine being a leftist woman who has aborted a child and suddenly someone comes along and proves beyond a shadow of doubt that her fetus really was a person and she is now provably the murderer of her own child. That would explain the anger fear and loathing exhibited by leftist ""feminists"" despite every year babies exiting the womb earlier and earlier in pregnancies and living.
As to switching parties, being a registered D allows me to express conservative values in conversation and when I see the steel shutters of willful ignorance come down I say ""...and I am a registered democrat..."" and sometimes the shutters raise up a bit.

Some may be just as bad. Ultimately homeschooling is likely the best option for most people in most places. Who knows your kid, and more importantly cares about your kid and his or her education, more than you do? There’s only one way to make sure your kids are learning the right things, and not the wrong things, and that’s to spend time with them and educate them yourself. Talk to them daily about the stuff they hear from other people or the media. Like I said it may take some sacrifices. Cut back on work hours between you and your spouse, cut back on other things you’d spend your money on if you both worked. It’ll be worth it in the end. Like I said, kids need their parents more than they need money.
Having gone to college myself, I would strongly encourage my own kids to go to a technical school or a trade school instead, or to start their own business. College funds started by parents when their kids are little might be better spent as seed money to start a new business, if the kid has an entrepreneurial spirit, or as a down payment on a house for their kid who chose to go into a trade. Everyone should consider college as only one of many possible paths to success, and not even a particularly good one. Going into debt for a college degree is pure insanity."

I can't train the grads I get now. Too many ID10T errors. Sit on their phones when theres work to do. So sad.

It is absolutely imperative that Trump get another 4 years. But he won’t if petty little crybabies find “reasons” to not support him. No Democrat is better, no RINO is better, so regardless of what Trump doesn’t do even if he said he would, he is the best for the job. Otherwise, this EO as well as the border wall, tax reductions, health care etc will all return to the hands of the global, fascist socialists.
This is not rocket science: every conservative must vote in which it is the duty of involved conservatives to motivate uninvolved conservatives.
If you can’t do all you can do, really do, then you lose your right to complain when Trump’s accomplishments are reversed. And they will be, immediately at their first opportunity."

Frankfurt school. Hmmm.
Hollywood. Banking. Media.

Globalist. European style socialist. Elitist.
All say the same thing and wonder why 2% of our population is overrepresented everywhere including our Supreme Court.
It is globalism. Just you know who they are."

So many brainwashed lefties wanted to see him they had to use the football stadium. It's astounding to me that back then and to this day we still have morons treating a political system responsible for 100 millions deaths as some kind of utopian ideal. These mo fos need their a*ses kicked in the worst way possible, seriously."

All the degradation comes from destroying family life."
