WalletHub CEO: Growing Credit Card Debt Is An Economic Warning Sign : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616207/wallethub-ceo-growing-credit-card-debt-is-an-economic-warning-sign,"NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub, about growing credit card debt and what it means for the economy.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
The U.S. economy is going strong with record low unemployment, but that's not the whole story. Many Americans got smaller tax refunds this year. Wage growth is stagnant. And credit card debt is on the rise.
ODYSSEAS PAPADIMITRIOU: There is a significant group of our society that is kind of left behind.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of the personal finance website WalletHub. We've heard about credit card debt being a problem for middle and working classes before, but it's now become an issue for the upper-middle class. Papadimitriou says they're in the sweet spot for this type of easy lending.
PAPADIMITRIOU: It is the consumer group that wants to take on some additional debt and also has the income and the assets to justify so.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: On top of that, recent numbers show that people approaching retirement age are also accruing larger amounts of credit card debt.
PAPADIMITRIOU: You know, they're away from retirement enough years to feel like, I will make up for it later on. Let me go and make this purchase. And then they end up later on in retirement with credit card debt.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Credit card debt is at its highest level since 2008. WalletHub is projecting that each U.S. household will have an average of $9,300 in credit card debt by the end of the year. And Papadimitriou believes it's hitting a breaking point.
PAPADIMITRIOU: We start defaulting. Credit card companies stop lending. More people get into trouble. Interest rates go up. Penalty fees go up. And you get into a vicious cycle...
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That could have larger repercussions.
PAPADIMITRIOU: ...Which is, obviously, negative for the economy as well with spending power going down.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: The level of credit card debt is one economic warning sign. But Papadimitriou worries that lawmakers and consumers aren't taking it seriously. He says it could take the threat of a recession to get them to act.
PAPADIMITRIOU: We'll be going into a recession the next couple of years. I think the question is, when? If that recession comes before the election, I think, absolutely, it's going to be a major political headwind, if you will. If it comes afterwards, it's going to benefit, I think, the current administration.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: His advice - just because you have credit available to you doesn't mean you should use it.

At least 130 people have been killed in coordinated bombings in Sri Lanka that targeted luxury hotels and churches, as people gathered for Easter services.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Sri Lankan authorities say at least 190 have been killed and hundreds more wounded in eight blasts across the country. The bombs targeted luxury hotels and churches as people gathered for Easter services. A curfew has now been imposed. Here to discuss the latest news is NPR's Lauren Frayer, who joins us from Mumbai.
Lauren, what are you hearing from Colombo?
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Yeah. So as - the curfew has been imposed, as you said. Monday and Tuesday have been declared government holidays. That means offices and schools will be closed. Security is tightening around the country. We're seeing SWAT teams with these massive guns putting up security cordons around the capital, Colombo. They're searching buildings, and we're just getting word of seven arrests - no word on who those people are. Also, social media is shut down. Authorities are taking no chances about the terrorists, you know, using the Internet to communicate.
These blasts, as you mentioned, hit churches when they were most packed, on Easter Sunday - Easter services. One church put out a notice on Facebook for relatives to come and rescue their loved ones in the debris. Local TV is showing footage of parishioners carrying out bodies of wounded people. Meanwhile, behind them, the church pews are smeared with blood, debris everywhere. The roof of one church was partially blown off.
And it's not just the churches. There are also five-star hotels that have been hit, windows blown out at one. And the foreign minister has just given us an update; at least 27 foreigners are among those killed.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we've been getting reaction. President Trump has tweeted his condolences. And there's reaction coming in from around the world on this Easter Sunday. Tell us what you've heard.
FRAYER: Right. So this footage is just so disturbing. And so people in other time zones are waking up to the horror of this and sending in these messages of shock and condemnation. President Trump, as you mentioned, tweeted heartfelt condolences. He said, quote, ""we stand ready to help"" - exclamation point. Also, messages are coming in from European leaders and the prime minister of New Zealand, which sadly just suffered attacks on some of its own places of worship - mosques - last month. Pope Francis spoke at St. Peter's Square in Rome. He said he wants to express his affectionate closeness to the Christian community in Sri Lanka and to the victims there.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Lauren, can you give us some background? There was a long civil war in Sri Lanka, which ended in 2009. What is the context for these attacks?
FRAYER: That's right. So what's sad is that Sri Lanka was just about to celebrate 10 years of peace - almost to the day - since that civil war ended. It was a bloody war; it lasted 26 years. Sri Lanka is a mostly Buddhist country - about 70 percent. It also has significant religious minorities - Hindus, Muslims and Christians.
And the war involved a separatist insurgency of ethnic minority Tamils. One of their groups was called the Tamil Tigers; you may remember that group. And they were fighting for independence from the Buddhist majority. The war was so bloody. Many tens of thousands of people were killed. And back then, blasts like this did happen pretty regularly at shopping malls, at temples, at tourist hotels. But this has not been the norm in Sri Lanka for a long, long while. And the prime minister says he worries that this - these attacks today are going to trigger instability.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Lauren Frayer.
Thank you so much.

Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images The pipe organ of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, one of the most famous in the world, was spared from the cathedral fire on April 15, but major restoration needs to be done on the instrument.
Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images Olivier Latry, one of the chief organists at Notre Dame Cathedral, was the last artist to record on the famous instrument before the catastrophic fire on April 15 that damaged the church and caused its spire to collapse. This pipe organ is the largest in France and dates back centuries. Though it was spared from the flames, it will still require extensive renovation.
Europe Notre Dame Cathedral Fire Extinguished; Spire Collapsed, Towers Still Standing Latry has been a chief organist at Notre Dame since 1985, and he played the organ to record his album, Bach to the Future, over the course of several late nights this past January, when the church was free of tourists and worshippers. On the day of the fire, Latry recalls getting SMS messages from friends that Notre Dame was burning and not believing it. For Latry, the shock still hasn't completely set in.
""We were just terrified, absolutely terrified,"" he says. ""This is probably the most famous organ in the world.""

Jean-Francois Badias/Courtesy of the artist The current instrument was built by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll during the 19th century, and some pipes, from previous organs, date back centuries. Latry says the organ pipes themselves — some 8,000 of them — were not severely damaged. The main issues may be fixing the water damage to the organ's wind chest from when firefighters put out the blaze.
""It's the box where it provides air on the pipes,"" he says. ""So we have to check all of those things. And, of course, the electric system. ... The organ has an electric system, which was installed in the last restoration, and as you know, electricity and water doesn't work together.""
The staff members of Notre Dame are still figuring out how they will make these repairs. They may have to take apart the organ — that's normally done by hoisting it up on a pulley attached to the roof, which is now gone."

NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks to former astronaut Ed Lu, who co-founded a planetary defense nonprofit, about a meteor that exploded with the energy of 10 atomic bombs over the Bering Sea.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
This is Lulu's log - star date April 21, 2019 - where we explore matters of space, the stars and the universe.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GARCIA-NAVARRO: A meteor exploded over the Bering Sea between Russia and Alaska at the end of last year with the energy of 10 atomic bombs. It happened with no warning whatsoever. And we only just learned of it. Former Astronaut Ed Lu keeps a close eye on objects that might collide with the earth. He's the executive director of B612, an organization that works to protect the Earth from asteroid impacts and other planetary defense issues. Thank you so much for joining us.
ED LU: Thank you.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So we only just learned of this meteor because NASA only just now put up the information on its website. That's pretty worrying, I must say.
LU: Well, actually, the incident was observed right away.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Right.
LU: It's just that it was observed not by NASA but originally by a network of sensors used to detect atomic bomb explosions or nuclear-weapons tests around the world.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Typically, how much notice do space agencies or observatories get about meteor or asteroid strikes?
LU: The typical notice for asteroid impacts on Earth is zero.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Zero.
LU: And that's because the vast majority of asteroids are still untracked. This particular asteroid was quite small. It was only about 30 feet across. And the vast, vast majority of asteroids that small are not tracked.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: This landed in the sea. But if it had landed somewhere else, on land, I mean, how much damage could it have caused, just to give us some perspective?
LU: To give an example of the kind of thing that can happen - just about six years ago, in 2013, we had an asteroid a little bit larger that exploded near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. And its shockwave blew out many, many thousands of windows in the Russian - in Chelyabinsk, collapsed, I think - I believe it was seven buildings and sent about 1,500 people to the hospital. And that explosion was luckily about 40 kilometers away from the city. So had that happened over the city, it could've been quite bad.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you were an astronaut. And now you've founded this organization keeping an eye out for life-destroying objects from space. What's the connection there? Why did you decide to found this organization after you went out into space?
LU: Well, the interesting thing about looking at the Earth and the moon from the vantage point of being out there in space for a long period of time is that you look at the craters on the moon. And you look at the Earth. And you look back and forth. And you realize that there are more craters - or there are more impacts on Earth than there have been on the moon. You just don't see the craters as much because we have an atmosphere. And we have water and continents and weather and so on that erase older craters. But the fact of the matter is that the earth does get hit more than the moon. And we do have the technology to both find and track these asteroids and to deflect them. And it felt to me and a number of my co-founders that that is something that we ought to do because we do know that the Earth has been hit in the past by very large asteroid impacts that have changed the evolution of life here on this planet. In fact, we humans today are here because an asteroid killed off all the dinosaurs.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what can be done to protect the planet? What would you like to see happen - briefly?
LU: Well, the first thing you have to do is simply mapping the locations of all the asteroids where they are and where they're going because that will tell you which, if any of these things, are a danger to the Earth. Once you know that an asteroid is going to hit the Earth, say, 10, 20, 30 years from now - and that's - that would be the goal, decades of advanced notice. You only need to give a tiny nudge to an asteroid to keep it from hitting the Earth. And in fact, NASA is about to do a test deflection on an asteroid that's coming nowhere near the Earth to show how you can simply run into it with a small spacecraft and that that is sufficient in most cases to give the tiny impulse you need to make an asteroid miss the Earth. If you have enough notice.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Former astronaut Ed Lu, executive director of B612, thank you so much.

New Campaign Would Allow Cryptocurrency Donations To Be Distributed To Venezuelans : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616224/new-campaign-would-allow-cryptocurrency-donations-to-be-distributed-to-venezuela,"A new humanitarian aid campaign is trying to enable Venezuelans to use cryptocurrency instead of cash. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with professor Steve Hanke, who is leading the campaign.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
How can you distribute humanitarian aid safely and efficiently, especially to places like Venezuela, where physical cargo, such as food aid and medical supplies, are stopped at the border and the national currency, the bolivar, suffers from devaluation and hyperinflation? Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, is leading a new campaign called Airdrop Venezuela. The campaign would allow cryptocurrency donations to be distributed to Venezuelans that they can use to purchase goods. Professor Hanke joins us now.
Welcome.
STEVE HANKE: Good to be with you.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So before we begin, we have to say that you served as an economic adviser to former Venezuelan president Rafael Caldera between 1995 and '96. And you're also part of the board of AirTM, an online currency exchange company whose existing platform you're using for this campaign. So tell us, how would it work? How many people receive these donations? And how will they be able to use it?
HANKE: Well, our objective is to have 100,000 people verified that would qualify to receive donations. Right now we're at 60,000. We've collected $272,000 to date, and the objective is to get to $1 million. So we'll have $1 million, and we'll have 100,000 Venezuelans receiving equal portions of that. And we'll probably be delivering in August.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. How does it work?
HANKE: You donate a cryptocurrency to the campaign, and that cryptocurrency goes to the AirTM platform and is distributed to wallets of the qualified Venezuelans.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: The wallets - you mean their phones.
HANKE: Their phones, yes.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Obviously, there are challenges to cryptocurrency. How would this practically work, though? Could people actually use this to buy the things that they need?
HANKE: Well, this is what most people probably will do - go to the AirTM platform and exchange the cryptocurrencies that they've received in their wallet for real money that they can use to buy things. And the real money would, in most cases, be U.S. dollars. When the currency in your country is literally melting in your hand and - knowing that, the key is getting people hard currency that they can actually use to purchase something. And so that was the general attraction. And the technology of using this Internet platform is just what the doctor ordered.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: AirTM's CEO Ruben Galindo told the Miami Herald he hopes he can work with opposition leader Juan Guaido in the future. So I guess the wider question is, are the intentions of the project purely humanitarian or also partly political?
HANKE: No, they're purely humanitarian at this point. And these are private - the private exchanges that are going on. And there's really no particular political motivation. It's just to help people to give them some purchasing power. The money comes from private donations.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And I guess my last question is if this works and this is effective, where do you see this headed?
HANKE: This will be a demonstration of how relief agencies all around the world can easily deliver aid and relief to people in need. You won't have to drive a pickup truck around filled with cash that you're giving away or filled with medicine or clothing or food. That's an inefficient and unsafe way to do things. You'll have a very safe way to do it. I think it will be the - a - really, a new thing.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Steve Hanke is a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University.
Thank you so much.
HANKE: Thank you.

NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Reverend Gerald Toussaint of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church. His church was one of three historically black churches that were burned down in arson attacks.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
A crowdfunding drive to raise money to rebuild three black Louisiana churches destroyed by fire has raised more than $2 million. The son of a local sheriff's deputy has been charged with arson and hate crimes in the case. For the pastors of these churches, this Holy Week has been a time for guiding their members through difficult times. Reverend Gerald Toussaint is pastor of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in St. Landry Parish. And he joins us now.
Good morning.
GERALD TOUSSAINT: Good morning.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Could I ask you to start by taking us back to April 4? Where were you when you heard the news?
TOUSSAINT: I was on my way to work. And my wife calls me. And she says, Mount Pleasant - they say - told me Mount Pleasant is on fire. I said, oh, no. So I turned around and went to the church. And it was on fire. It was almost gone.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That must have been hard, considering that your family has ties to these churches going back decades.
TOUSSAINT: Well, yeah. My daddy pastored for 21 years. And I've probably been there for 13 years.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: As we mentioned, there hasn't been a trial or conviction yet. But there's a long history in this country of attacks on black churches. As someone who knows your community well, did these fires come as a surprise?
TOUSSAINT: It came as a surprise to us because we didn't think - expect none of that going on around here because we're a community of people that stand together. And I don't know if it's really racial or spiritual - just after the black church, after the church in general. I really don't know. But I know that the way that the country has been going lately, people have been emboldened to do things they had never done before in a long - well, in a long time.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: This past week, as you know, the world's attention was captivated by the fire in Paris at Notre Dame. I understand it was after that that the money started flowing in to help your churches rebuild. How did it feel to see the sudden increase in support?
TOUSSAINT: I understand Notre Dame. And I - it's a hurtful thing to see any church anywhere be burned. But to my understanding, Notre Dame was an accident. Our church was intentional. Someone took time to set fire to three churches in St. Landry Parish. And for us to forget about it, to let it go - every church that's open in the name of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ is important because some reach a large crowd, but some reach a small community. And that's what our churches are. We still need to hear the word too.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Reverend, what do you think should happen now? I understand you and your congregation have talked about forgiveness for the alleged arsonist.
TOUSSAINT: Yeah. We got to forgive him. I feel for him because, oh, he's so young. He don't know nothing about the civil rights movement. He doesn't know nothing about lynching. He doesn't know nothing about racial violence. He don't know that. That young man is 21 years old. What does he know? - only what people feed him - hatred and envy and strife. And if you keep feeding people with that, then it's going to turn into a whole lot worse than three churches.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Easter Sunday is about resurrection, rebirth. What is next for your church?
TOUSSAINT: Rebuilding because that's what Jesus does. He rebuilds lives that have been torn apart. He rebuilds. And that's what we're going to do.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Reverend Gerald Toussaint, pastor of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in St. Landry Parish, La.
Thank you very much.
TOUSSAINT: God bless you. Have a Happy Easter. "

In 2017, five teens who vandalized an African American schoolhouse received an unusual punishment. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro asks Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Alex Rueda if the sentence worked.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
And now an update on a story - in 2017, five students who sprayed racist graffiti across an historic African-American schoolhouse in Virginia received an unusual punishment, reading 12 books then writing about the books over the course of the year. The titles included Maya Angelou's autobiographical ""I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings,"" T.C. Boyle's ""The Tortilla Curtain,"" dealing with immigration and xenophobia and Elie Wiesel's ""Night,"" about the horrors of the Holocaust.
Alex Rueda is the deputy commonwealth attorney who came up with the sentence, and she joins me now to discuss what happened next. Thank you.
ALEX RUEDA: My pleasure being here. Thanks for having me.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: We spoke when the sentence was first issued. And you told me then that you wanted the teens who spray-painted swastikas and lewd symbols and wrote white power on this historic African-American schoolhouse to learn about race and religion. Do you think that they've learned their lesson?
RUEDA: I sure hope so. I mean, I was able to read the essay from one of the students. And what he wrote, I thought was very, very powerful when he talked about how, even though he had been taught about Nazi symbols in school, it had never really made an impression upon him. And once he learned about it and was made to read about it and write about it and go to the Holocaust Museum, it made him feel really bad. And having learned about this, he was going to make sure that he would never make anybody feel this way again.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you think you can teach tolerance? I mean, do you think that there is a wider lesson here - because obviously, this is a subject of great debate across America right now.
RUEDA: I think that the only way to teach tolerance is for people to learn about other cultures. And sometimes, the only way to do that is to read about it. You know, that was the way that I learned about those things. I mean, when I first read Alan Paton's ""Cry, The Beloved Country,"" I knew nothing about South Africa. I didn't know anything about apartheid at the time. I remember weeping at my ignorance and at what people were going through. And so I'm hoping that that's what happened for them because that's what happened for me.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Some people listening to this might say that's all fine and well, having people read. But these kinds of crimes, these kinds of attacks on people's identity are being treated more leniently than other types of crimes. And are these students not getting off lightly?
RUEDA: But they weren't. They were, in fact, treated much harsher than they would have otherwise. The standard disposition for youth in our justice system who has no prior record would be to be put on probation for a year - like they were - and to do community service and write a letter of apology and pay restitution. They were not facing being put in detention - into juvenile detention because this was not a crime of, you know, violence against another person.
So what was imposed upon them was above and beyond what any probationer would have had to do on a first-offense charge, like what they were facing.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: In many ways, this was an experiment.
RUEDA: Yes.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you consider the experiment a success, and should it be replicated?
RUEDA: I do consider it a success because they did not get in trouble again. The essays that they wrote - at least the one that the defense attorney made available to us - the student wrote that he understood. So to me, it worked. And my hope, my dream, my goal would be that this is not an unusual disposition that causes people to write about it in the newspaper or for me to be interviewed. I would love for this to be a standard disposition all over the place.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Alex Rueda, the deputy commonwealth attorney for Virginia, thank you very much.
RUEDA: Oh, my pleasure.

Today the massive Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival wraps up in the desert near Indio, Calif. It's been six days of music spread out over two weekends - band after band on a big main stage and many smaller ones; and more so this year than previously, Latin music on those stages. Felix Contreras of NPR's Alt.Latino is with us this morning to tell us about the change in that dry, desert air.
Good morning, Felix.
FELIX CONTRERAS, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So let's start with this music festival, which is huge but not necessarily familiar to the average American.
CONTRERAS: Right. But Coachella is one of the biggest of the outdoor festivals. It attracts over 250,000 people. And there's so many people that the job of the music bookers is to appeal to as many people as possible. So there's always a mix of pop, rock, indie, hip-hop and R&B and, this year, more Latin acts, including many names that we've talked about here on the show before.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MI GENTE"")
J BALVIN: (Singing in Spanish).
CONTRERAS: Colombian urban star J Balvin was on the main stage this year. His Puerto Rican compadre Bad Bunny was also on the main stage. And an interesting new artist named Rosalia - she sort of mixes Spanish flamenco with an urban sound. Those are the three biggest names.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MALAMENTE - CAP.1: AUGURIO"")
ROSALIA: (Singing in Spanish).
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And who surprised you the most?
CONTRERAS: I think the fact that they have Rosalia on the main stage because the urban sound is so popular even to the point where this - just this week, Madonna released a song with Colombian star Maluma in sort of a reggaeton light that they pulled off. So reggaeton is the dominant sound right now in the urban thing. But Rosalia has this really fascinating mix of flamenco and just a touch of urban stuff. This is Rosalia with her track ""Malamente.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MALAMENTE - CAP.1: AUGURIO"")
ROSALIA: (Singing in Spanish).
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I love it.
CONTRERAS: Right?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what brought Latin artists to the fore this year? - just a change in tastes there at Coachella.
CONTRERAS: You know, I'd like to think that it's the Alt.Latino reporting calling people (laughter).
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Of course. Take credit for it.
CONTRERAS: But, you know, it's hard to resist. And when you're booking a show like this, it's really hard to resist this huge, massive social change in the acceptance and the popularity of Spanish-language music. It's actually become the mainstream.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So who else played at Coachella that we may want to hear from right now?
CONTRERAS: OK. So they were really big on Chileans this year for some reason.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Chileans, OK.
CONTRERAS: Yes. Yeah. They had Javiera Mena, Tomasa de Real and Mon Laferte, who we've played on the show. Now let's play Mon Laferte here this morning because I really like her music. But also, if people listening out there really like it, they can go to a really cool Tiny Desk Concert she did with Juanes here at NPR.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PA DONDE SE FUE"")
MON LAFERTE: (Singing in Spanish).
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I saw that Tiny Desk Concert with Juanes. She was fantastic.
CONTRERAS: Right?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, she was great. So J Balvin, Bad Bunny, Rosalia, they all have these distinct kind of contemporary sounds. Who else is out there who maybe played different sounding stuff?
CONTRERAS: OK. Check this out.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SUENA LA BANDA"")
LOS TUCANES DE TIJUANA: (Singing in Spanish).
CONTRERAS: (Laughter).
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Takes me right back to the Mexico.
CONTRERAS: This is Los Tucanes De Tijuana, a straight-ahead conjunto norteno band. And I just love the idea of 250,000 people boogieing to accordions and cowboy hats.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter).
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SUENA LA BANDA"")
LOS TUCANES DE TIJUANA: (Singing in Spanish).
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Me encanta. That's Felix Contreras of NPR Music's Alt.Latino. He hosts a weekly podcast about Latino arts and culture. And he is a big fan of accordions and cowboy hats.
Thanks, Felix.

Missed Connections: 1969 Humanitarian Trip To Africa,www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616280/missed-connections-1969-humanitarian-trip-to-africa,"In our latest ""Missed Connections,"" Helen Chapple, Saul Blair and Graham Hinton reunite to talk about how a humanitarian trip to Africa 50 years ago changed the trajectory of their lives.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
There are times when we can connect surprisingly deeply with a stranger and then never see them again - a missed connection. We've been trying to help some of you connect with the people you're trying to find. And today we take you back to the 1960s. Operation Crossroads Africa took student volunteers from North America to work on community projects in Africa for the summer. In 1969, Helen Chapple was one of those students. And she wrote us to reconnect her with the group that she went with. And she joins us now from Atlanta, Ga.
Hi.
HELEN CHAPPLE: Hi.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So, Helen, why did you want to find the people that you went with?
CHAPPLE: Well, it's always been a very influential and good memory for me. And it's 50 years this summer - which seems very, very hard to believe - since we were all together. And the experience, for me, really changed my life. I learned about race relations in a way that I couldn't have known before. I was radicalized. As I grew older and formulated myself more, I needed to find a population to advocate for. And I became an advocate for dying patients. And that's been my cause. And it's - I can tie it directly to that summer experience.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, take us back. Tell us what inspired you to join the program back then.
CHAPPLE: I had actually heard about it in high school. And then my boyfriend, the year before I went, spent the summer with Operation Crossroads Africa. And he liked it. So I - not to be bested, I felt that I needed to sign up.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And what did you do there? Tell me a little bit about the program.
CHAPPLE: We were in Kitwe, Zambia, at the Mindolo Ecumenical Foundation. And we built an open-air discussion hall with a kitchen.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And why?
CHAPPLE: It was a project that, I guess, they wanted to be done. But it turned out that Operation Crossroads Africa was very troubled that year. The tensions in the United States were brought with us to Africa. And we had a wonderful group experience, but ours was not typical.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, we looked at some of the written correspondence between leaders on the ground in Zambia and Operation Crossroads Africa administrators. It said that some of the people, instead of learning about Zambia, made Zambia a platform to air the racial problems in the United States.
CHAPPLE: Many of the groups had tremendous problems. One group sent their leader home, we learned. And one group, the blacks and the whites didn't get along, so they lived separately. But we were very, very lucky. We worked together well. We traveled together well. We were a force to be reckoned with.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: You mentioned that there were both African Americans and white Americans.
CHAPPLE: And Canadians as well.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So it was a mixed group.
CHAPPLE: Yes.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: How many were you?
CHAPPLE: There were 10.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. Well, we have to tell you that we did find Graham Hinton. He was one of the Canadians...
CHAPPLE: Really?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: ...On that trip. And he joins us now on the line from Ontario, Canada. Graham...
CHAPPLE: Oh, my goodness.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter) Do you remember Helen?
GRAHAM HINTON: Yes, I do - very well.
CHAPPLE: Oh."
Challenges Remain In Securing U.S. Elections By 2020,www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616259/challenges-remain-in-securing-u-s-elections-by-2020,"The redacted Mueller report confirmed that Russia tried to hack into U.S. election systems. Efforts to prevent a repeat for 2020 are heating up, but some big gaps remain.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
The Mueller report reaffirmed that Russian agents broke into computer systems tied to U.S. elections in 2016. There's no evidence that they changed any votes. But the possibility that future voting could be hacked has led to stepped-up efforts to secure elections by 2020. NPR's Pam Fessler has the details.
PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: On August 24 of last year, Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos knew that things had changed. His IT manager came to his office and told him that two IP addresses linked to the Russian Federation were trying to break into their computers.
JIM CONDOS: We immediately sent that down to the Department of Homeland Security and to the Center for Internet Security for review.
FESSLER: And federal authorities discovered similar incidents in other states.
CONDOS: Immediately, they were able to send out a message to all 50 states to alert them to this. And so that's the kind of - the sense that we had that the communication level had improved tremendously.
FESSLER: Certainly a far cry from 2016 when state and local election officials and federal authorities barely knew that each other existed. Since then, there's been a constant flow of communications, cybersecurity training and equipment upgrades to protect against another attack. In Illinois, where Russians successfully broke into the state voter registration database and stole the information of half a million voters, the state has hired what are called cyber navigators to help county election offices strengthen their defenses.
MATT DIETRICH: We do not want one of those 108 local election authorities to be a weak link that gets targeted and gets hacked into.
FESSLER: Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the state election board, says that could undermine public confidence in an entire election.
DIETRICH: They only have to get into one system to say they're in all of them.
FESSLER: Which keeps a lot of election officials up at night - David Stafford is supervisor of elections in Escambia County, Fla., a state that appears to be a special target for Russia. The Mueller report said the FBI believes that hackers gained access to one county computer system, which hadn't been publicly known before.
DAVID STAFFORD: But I don't think anybody is resting on their laurels and thinking that, OK we've licked this. And so now we can move on to the next issue. I think that it's all hands on deck.
FESSLER: Stafford notes that Florida has purchased what are called Albert sensors for each county, which allow their computer systems to be constantly monitored for signs of an attack. Other states are spending millions of dollars provided by Congress last year on new voting equipment and training. Matt Masterson of the Department of Homeland Security says another big focus will be figuring out how to fight the kind of disinformation campaign that Russia waged in 2016.
MATT MASTERSON: To help Americans understand what disinformation and foreign influence looks like. What are those tactics and techniques? - and how to go to trusted sources or understand the information that they're reading in that environment.
FESSLER: The details for this public outreach effort are still being worked out. Masterson says the big fear is that misinformation about things like election results could cause as much if not more chaos as tampering with votes. Still, some cybersecurity experts think the government isn't doing nearly enough.
JAKE BRAUN: We're, essentially, just as vulnerable as we were in 2016.
FESSLER: Jake Braun heads the Cyber Policy Initiative at the University of Chicago and is co-founder of the DEF CON Voting Machine Hacking Village, which exposed security flaws in equipment used around the country. Braun says many places still use insecure equipment. He's disturbed that President Trump hasn't made clear that those who tamper with those systems will be held to account.
BRAUN: Probably the number one conclusion I've come to in the last several years of working on this is that our elections are, essentially, unsecureable and that without a really strong and clear deterrence policy in place from the White House, the bad guys are going to do what they want to do.
FESSLER: He and others hope to make that as difficult as possible.

Remembering Northern Ireland Journalist Lyra McKee,www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616252/remembering-northern-ireland-journalist-lyra-mckee,"Remembering Northern Ireland Journalist Lyra McKee Remembering Northern Ireland Journalist Lyra McKee Embed Embed
NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro asks Press Association journalist Aoife-Grace Moore about the death of activist and journalist Lyra McKee in Northern Ireland.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Police in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, have arrested two men in the death of Lyra McKee, a journalist and activist who was killed Thursday as she witnessed rioting there. The city is also known as Derry. Its chief detective warned yesterday of a new breed of militant threatening peace in Northern Ireland. For more on McKee and on the violence, we turn to the Press Association journalist Aoife Moore. She's in Dublin. Welcome to the program.
AOIFE MOORE: Thank you. Hello.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So just your reaction to what happened. It must be very difficult for the community there.
MOORE: Absolutely. I mean, Creggan, where Lyra was killed, is a really tight-knit community anyway. And when such a tragedy happens, like Lyra's death, it's really shaken the people who live there. I mean, these are people who have, you know, overcome already so many years of trauma. And I think they thought that was very much behind them. And to have an innocent woman killed on their streets again is just an - like a hardy (ph) kind of revert back to.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do we know more today about what happened on the street during this riot? Was this an accident? Or was it targeted?
MOORE: It doesn't appear at the moment that Lyra was targeted. It appears the gunman, who was crouched down behind a wall, was firing indiscriminately in the direction of a police blockade. And Lyra and a few of her friends and a few journalists were on the other side of the blockade. And when he fired those scattered shots into the blockade, one hit Lyra in the crossfire.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And the accused - what's known about them?
MOORE: At the minute, all that's known is there's - two men have been arrested. They're 18 and 19 - so very young men. But for Derry people, this hasn't come as much of a surprise - the age of the men. These dissident republican groups that carry out these kinds of flashpoints tend to use younger, teenage men - maybe from like a vulnerable community and kind of use them to carry out these kinds of attacks.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Lyra was 29. She was a fellow journalist and a beautiful writer whose ""Letter To My 14-Year-Old Self"" five years ago was widely praised. Can you tell me a little bit more about her work and what you know of her life?
MOORE: Yeah. So Lyra was, as you say, a beautiful writer. She specialized in kind of feature work and long-form essays. She was an activist, an LGBT woman. She often wrote about her challenges and what she felt about being a gay woman in Northern Ireland. And her work, although political, is often political in the sense of the young people who've been left behind since the troubles. We're supposedly living in a time of peace now. And people like me and Lyra here in our late 20s - although we remember the army on the streets, we also remember the Good Friday Agreement. And we were very young when it was signed. But there are masses of problems that have been left behind as we kind of live in the shadow of the troubles. And her - a lot of her work reflected that.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: One of the things that's striking about this is that the alleged assailants weren't born when the peace deal was struck in Northern Ireland. Both you and Lyra weren't even 10 years old when the Good Friday Agreement was signed. I understand that your family has also been affected by violence and that you're from Derry.
MOORE: Absolutely. I mean, I grew up on the streets where Lyra died. And like most families in Creggan and the wider Derry community, my mom's brother was shot and killed on Bloody Sunday. That's very common in Derry. I think you would struggle to find a household that hasn't been touched in some way by violence. So I'm not very special in that sense.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why do you think violence is flaring again and young people are dying now in violence that was supposed to have been done away with?
MOORE: I do think - and like Lyra said herself - that we've been denied the spoils of peace. We are still living in the shadow of the troubles. And that shadow leads to unemployment, poverty, lack of infrastructure. Young people really need to go away from Northern Ireland to work or to go to university or kind of, like, live their lives like our peers get on the British mainland.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Aoife Moore, a journalist with the Press Association. She spoke with us from Dublin.
Thanks again.
MOORE: Thank you.

"After Mueller Report, What Are The Next Steps For Lawmakers?",www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616245/after-mueller-report-what-are-the-next-steps-for-lawmakers,"Republicans and Democrats remain as divided as ever over the information revealed in the redacted Mueller report. But the ball is now in House Democrats' court.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
As you heard, the findings of the Mueller report have ricocheted across the Capitol and the country, as many lawmakers are back in their home districts when the report dropped. The special counsel essentially said it was up to Congress to decide what to do next. And that is the main question - what, if anything, will a divided Congress do? Joining us to discuss the path ahead is lead political editor Domenico Montanaro.
Good morning.
DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. The Mueller report is public and - at least the redacted version is. And Republicans and Democrats remain as divided as ever. But the ball is now in the House Democrats' court, right? What do we think they'll do when they get back to Washington?
MONTANARO: Yeah, and the reason it's in their court is because everybody's talking about the I word - impeachment - and whether or not that's something that Democrats will go after now, now that we have this Mueller investigation report. And frankly, a lot of Democrats believe the president did abuse his power. They believe that what he did when it comes to those multiple cases of potential obstruction were impeachable offenses.
But they have to consider the politics. And veterans on Capitol Hill know the backlash that Republicans faced in the late 1990s when they impeached Bill Clinton, who left office with a 60 percent approval rating - wound up being. So Democrats are really reticent to do that. What's going to happen now is these investigations - these other investigations will continue forward. Democrats say they want the unredacted Mueller report in full at least to them. They want the underlying documents. Barr is set to testify May 2.
And I think the politicization of Barr has made it more likely that Mueller will have to testify. And Democrats are saying they want him to testify no later than May 23. So I think the person we haven't heard from in more - in two years, really, he will likely have to testify. And these other investigations, they're going to look under all those rocks and see if there's any other things financially that maybe will move Republicans to their side because there's really not going to be impeachment without Republican support.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, well, let's talk about Republican reaction to the report. Not a lot of it, I guess, is what we've seen so far, not a lot of criticism, at least.
MONTANARO: No, what you've seen is a lot of circling the wagon, so to speak, around President Trump, trying to protect him. In fact, you saw Lindsey Graham, the senator from South Carolina, who's the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate - when the Mueller report dropped, he was in Ivory Coast with Ivanka Trump, with the president's daughter. So he has made a point of more wanting to ingratiate himself with the president and with his family rather than looking more deeply into an oversight role into what the president has done related to obstruction or related to what his campaign's contacts were with Russia. He wants to move on. The most strident or strong response - nuanced response, I guess you could say - from a Republican has been from Mitt Romney, the senator from Utah, who said that he was sickened by the president's behavior. But he's really the only one.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we've also seen a really interesting reaction from the president, which has shifted over time.
MONTANARO: Absolutely. I mean, you can just see it on - in tweets. I mean, when the report dropped on Friday, and he hadn't quite read it yet, he was still touting no collusion, no obstruction. And then as the news coverage kind of leaked out and continued out, and he started to see what more was in that report and all of these aides who are on the record saying that they had defied the president when he tried to obstruct the investigation potentially on a whole bunch of different avenues, whether it was his White House lawyer Don McGahn - who decided that he would either - he would rather resign than lean on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Robert Mueller.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: You know, with all this focus on the report and what to do next, will this Congress be able to get anything else done, which is really what the American people want to see?
MONTANARO: You know, divided government is supposed to be intended to create compromise. But unfortunately, most Americans think compromise is agreeing with them (laughter). So sure, compromise with me. But really, there isn't going to be a whole lot that they're looking to do legislatively, especially with an election around the corner.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Lead political editor Domenico Montanaro, thank you so much.
MONTANARO: You're welcome.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
And this past week, we finally got the long-anticipated Mueller report, which didn't seem to resolve much of what the country has been divided over for the past two years.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And this is the day, for nearly two years, that many Americans have been waiting for...
WILLIAM BARR: Good morning, everybody, and thanks for being here this morning.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: ...Where Attorney General William Barr is about to speak to reporters about the special counsel's report.
BARR: We now know that the Russian operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump or the Trump campaign.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm having a good day, too. It was called...
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: ...No collusion, no obstruction.
KELLYANNE CONWAY: That report makes very clear that this White House and this president and none of us got in their way.
NANCY PELOSI: For the attorney general, though, to say, I'll use my own judgment about what I redact - that's not necessarily going to be the final product.
MITCH MCCONNELL: I trust Bill Barr. I think it's rather laughable to see them turn their guns on him. But that's all they're left with, frankly, is to go after him.
JERRY NADLER: The special counsel made clear that he did not exonerate the president. And the responsibility now falls to Congress to hold the president accountable for his actions.
MARK MEADOWS: I think it's highly inappropriate for Bob Mueller to suggest impeachment in coded words.
ELIZABETH WARREN: Do you believe that that constitutes an impeachable offense? I do believe that the evidence is just overwhelming.

How To Report On Trump's White House,www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616200/how-to-report-on-trumps-white-house,"NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro asks Rebecca Ballhaus of the Wall Street Journal and Carol Leonnig of The Washington Post about the challenges of reporting on the Trump administration.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
The Mueller report was a bombshell. But a lot of what was in it had been reported before due to the dogged journalism of the past two years. At the time, the White House denied much of what was being revealed, calling it fake news - a claim President Trump has been repeating on Twitter this weekend. We're going to bring in two journalists now who did some of that reporting to talk about what they learned from the Mueller report and what comes next. Rebecca Ballhaus covers the White House for The Wall Street Journal. And she took part in the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on President Trump's payments to Stormy Daniels. Welcome to the program.
REBECCA BALLHAUS: Thanks for having me.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And Carol Leonnig is an investigative reporter for The Washington Post, who is also a Pulitzer Prize winner. Welcome to you.
CAROL LEONNIG: I'm glad to be here.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Carol, you wrote on Twitter, hug a reporter today. They toiled to bring you the facts amid Trump chants of fake news. So was this a win for journalism?
LEONNIG: I think it really vindicated the reporting of the last two years in several ways. Many of the reports from The Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal - a lot of those are detailed in a - sort of a cinematic way by Robert Mueller. But the actual events are, in large measure, ones reporters know about and have told the public - the times that the president threatened to fire Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller and Rod Rosenstein. And there's only one way in which I think that the reporting may have been more breathless and possibly speculative. And that is the way in which we kept raising the question, are all of these Russian contacts with the Trump campaign - could those all have happened without some sort of coordination with the Trump campaign? And Robert Mueller said no. He did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy but certainly evidence of a presidential campaign that was welcoming Russia's help.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Rebecca, that's a big caveat there, isn't it? The Mueller report found no coordination or collusion. And on the right, that's the story.
BALLHAUS: Right. And I think that's, of course, what the White House is spending the most time dwelling on. The only other thing that I would add is that I think, in some ways, the reporters who Trump spent the last two years calling fake news really did help the president in that I think if we had been presented with all of the findings of the Mueller report, particularly as they pertain to the president's efforts to shut the investigation down - if those had all come at us for the first time on Thursday, I think we'd be seeing a much different response from Congress, from Democrats and much more interest in possibly doing something with those findings than we've seen so far.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: This is for both of you. One of the things that we now know to be true from the Mueller report is that this administration repeatedly misled reporters and the public. Of course, Sarah Huckabee Sanders acknowledged to Mueller that she made up that she had heard from members of the FBI after Comey was fired. You are both seasoned journalists. This presents a particular set of problems for journalists, doesn't it?
LEONNIG: You know, while I was living through it, I remember feeling so naive. I came back to cover the presidency from a book leave. And when I arrived back in the newsroom in early 2017, I was sure that a story that I had gathered about the president asking his lawyers whether or not he could pardon himself was true because of the sourcing that I had. And yet when I went to the White House, they told me that it wasn't true. And the president said it wasn't true. In any other presidency, that would've caused me to pause dramatically and to reassess whether or not my sources were careful and accurate because a president doesn't tell you that you're wrong. There are many administrations in the past - the Obama administration, the Bush administration, the Clinton administration - that have told me partial facts or have tried to steer me away from the facts that I've found and have misled me by omission. But they have never directly, squarely lied to my face. And that is the difference here. The president lies to our faces and tells his aides to lie to our faces.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Any thoughts on that, Rebecca?
BALLHAUS: Yeah. I would just add to that that I feel like we also learned this lesson with the Trump administration early that there were frequently times when we brought them reporting, and they would say it's not true. And we would have to decide to go with it anyway. And one story that comes to mind is in 2017, we wrote a story about some of the president's lawyers wanting Jared Kushner to step down because they were concerned about the scrutiny on him in the Russia investigation. And we brought that to the White House. They - we got really strong pushback. They sent us a lot of on-the-record denials, which is also unusual. And then in the middle of that process, we got a call from one of the president's lawyers, who happened to, on the record, confirm the story. So we went with it. And I think that was an early lesson that if the White House denies something, that's not a reason to stop a story. It just means you have to be really sure in your other sourcing.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let me put this to both of you in this context of what you've just said. Washington Post editor Marty Baron said famously about this era that journalists are not at war. We are at work. Does that still stand? There seems to be a war of at least credibility being waged. And the claims of fake news have taken their toll, according to many polls.
LEONNIG: Absolutely, they have taken their toll. And I think that Marty Baron and his words, which I believe are still true for us and many of our colleagues - we're not going after the president. We are going after facts. And yet his Twitter war against us has been very successful in trying to raise questions about the care with which we write and our political leanings. We don't have political leanings. And we have to, I think, now in this era spend much more time showing readers how we do our work so that this effort to claim that we're biased, that we're making things up does not win the day.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Rebecca.
BALLHAUS: Yeah. I would just add to that that, if anything, it has made us work harder at making sure that our stories are absolutely bulletproof in every instance because we know that they're going to be gone after either by the president on his Twitter feed, by his advisers on TV. We know that they're going to have to stand up to a pretty high level of scrutiny. And so I think that's always a good way to approach a story. But I think that those efforts have, if anything, intensified over the last two years. And I think we've also seen this with Trump, really, since the beginning of when he started running, which is that, you know, for all his fake news comments publicly, his supporters are also really intent to believe whatever he tells them. And they're really resistant to believing a reality other than the one that the president presented to them.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Rebecca Ballhaus from the Wall Street Journal and Carol Leonnig of the Washington Post, thank you both very much.
BALLHAUS: Thank you.
LEONNIG: Thank you.

Honduran Man And Daughter Reunited After Being Separated While Seeking U.S. Asylum,www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616193/honduran-man-and-daughter-reunited-after-being-separated-while-seeking-u-s-asylu,"Elmer, a Honduran man, and his teenage daughter, Marisol, have been reunited in Wisconsin after being separated 10 months ago when they sought asylum after crossing into the U.S.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
And now an update on another story we're following - last July, we met Elmer, a Honduran man who was separated from his teenage daughter Marisol after crossing into Texas and asking for asylum. He was deported alone. Since then, Elmer, with the help of lawyers and advocates, has been trying to reunite with Marisol in the United States. In March, Elmer handed himself to U.S. authorities again, and he was put in immigrant detention. Reporter James Fredrick now picks up this story.
A note to listeners, NPR is not using their last name or the city in which they live because they fear publicity might jeopardize their asylum case.
MARISOL: (Speaking Spanish).
JAMES FREDRICK, BYLINE: Late last Friday night, Marisol got the news she'd been waiting almost a year for. Her dad was free. It's the next morning, and she's getting ready to head to the airport. She's chatty and smiling as always, curling her long black hair and putting on a little eyeliner. Her 3-year-old cousin chirps in the background. She says she's been thinking about this day all the time.
MARISOL: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: She says, ""I don't think you have any idea how much I've thought about this. Sometimes I'd be in school, and I'd get all stressed out wondering where he was, how he was, all that. When he was detained, I was really worried he'd get deported again."" She goes to change tops for the third time, nervous but excited for her dad to finally see her again.
Since they were separated, Marisol spent months in a detention center for immigrant teenagers before coming to live with her uncle and aunt in Wisconsin. She was dealing with a new country, a new language, a new school - all while her dad bounced around Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. But now he's just 30 minutes away at the airport.
Marisol is kind of hesitant when she first walks into the airport, unsure where she should go. And then - she spots him down the hallway. She starts running, then stops, then runs again. Her little cousin tails behind her. Marisol jumps into Elmer's arms, and he spins her around.
ELMER: (Speaking Spanish).
MARISOL: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: ""I missed you so much,"" he whispers to Marisol. ""You, too,"" she responds.
ELMER: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: ""We did it,"" says Elmer. ""I can't believe it. I can't believe I'm here.""
I expected this to be a tearful reunion, but neither Elmer nor Marisol has shed a tear. They're both laughing and joking and posing for pictures.
ELMER: (Speaking Spanish).
MARISOL: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: ""She's gotten taller,"" says Elmer. ""I'm about to be taller than you,"" she brags.
(LAUGHTER)
FREDRICK: Elmer looks as relaxed as I've ever seen - and happy. And yet even on his happiest day, he knows he still has months or years left fighting his asylum case.
MARISOL: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: Back home, Elmer and Marisol are jumping into all the father-daughter stuff they've missed over the last 10 months.
ELMER: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: It's the mundane daily errands he's most excited for, like dropping Marisol off at school on Monday morning. He asks her some boring dad questions.
ELMER: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: ""What classes do you have today?""
MARISOL: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: She says she doesn't have classes today, just tests. What kind of tests? - he asks. Like any good 15-year-old, she responds a little impatiently. I don't know, just some standardized tests.
MARISOL: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: These are the little moments Elmer and Marisol were robbed of for the last year.
ELMER: (Speaking Spanish).
(LAUGHTER)
FREDRICK: ""Give me a hug,"" Elmer says, ""and behave in there."" Of course, she laughs. And again, like any good 15-year-old, she asks Dad for $10.
ELMER: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: ""Dropping her off at school,"" he says, ""it's wonderful. You'll never know how happy it makes me.""
For NPR News, I'm James Fredrick in Wisconsin.

Congresswoman On Key Election Security Findings From The Mueller Report,www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715616186/congresswoman-on-key-election-security-findings-from-the-mueller-report,"NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., about what we learned about election security and Russian interference from the redacted Mueller report.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
The political fallout from the Mueller report continues, but there may be a more pressing concern ahead of the 2020 election. According to the redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in a sweeping and systematic fashion. Investigators found that Russians hacked almost 60 Democratic Party computers. The report also revealed cyberattacks that targeted states' election infrastructure.
To discuss what the report revealed about election security, we turn now to Representative Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and a member of the Congressional Task Force on election security. Thank you for joining us.
ZOE LOFGREN: Sure. Thank you.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So that task force that you're a part of, made up of Democrats, put out a report last year on the issue of election security. Did you learn any new information about election security and Russian interference from the Mueller report that you didn't know?
LOFGREN: We were not aware that the Russian military had attacked Florida election systems. And we didn't know about the attack on the software of an election vendor. And as I think you know, we have asked for the full, unredacted report, which will be very helpful as we try and understand what the Russian military actually did.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to talk to you about Florida because there is a difference of opinion on this. On the one hand, we have Mueller saying this did happen. There were Democrats in that state, like Bill Nelson, who purported that there had been an attack on the election infrastructure there. But others say that it didn't happen.
LOFGREN: Well, I - all I have is the Mueller report. And I do know this; the Department of Homeland Security was aware, I am told, of this attack. They did not advise the state of Florida because their position is they only deal with the victims. And the victim in this case was the county, not the state - which is a stupid rule.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: The Mueller report also emphasized the urgency of fixing election security gaps before 2020. What can Congress do?
LOFGREN: For one thing, we need to provide resources to the states. I mean, a lot of the equipment that is being used is 10 or 20 years old. Some states are using software that no longer receives updates. They're very vulnerable to attack - a cyberattack. Many of them, including in Florida, don't have a paper record. So if there were to be an attack by a foreign adversary that even changed votes, there'd be no way to prove it or know it. So that'd have to change.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you think the Mueller report has shifted the positions in Congress at all on the other side of the aisle?
LOFGREN: Well, it's hard to know. I mean, this report was just received. The entire U.S. Congress is home in their districts right now. I'm here in San Jose. Really, we don't have a lot of informal discussions unless we're all in Washington, and that won't happen for a week.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Are you confident that the United States will be prepared for the 2020 elections? Can you make this - that promise to the American people?
LOFGREN: I don't know at this point. I can promise this: I'm going to do the best I can to make sure that we are. But as you know, we have a Democratic majority in the House, a Republican majority in the Senate and a president who seems to think this is not a problem. So I can't promise what the U.S. government will do. All I can promise is what I will try and do.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Representative Zoe Lofgren, thank you very much.
LOFGREN: Thank you.

Aimee Spinks/HBO Aimee Spinks/HBO Suranne Jones stars as Anne Lister — sometimes called the first modern lesbian — in Gentleman Jack.
Aimee Spinks/HBO HBO's new period drama, Gentleman Jack , is set in the 1830s and tells the extraordinary story of Anne Lister: landowner, businesswoman, mountaineer, and sometimes called ""the first modern lesbian."" Lister came from a wealthy family in Halifax, England, and began recording her love affairs with women in coded entries in her diary. Eventually she would live openly with her neighbor Ann Walker as a couple. Those explicit diaries remained a secret until the 1980s — and in 2011 they were named by UNESCO as a pivotal document in British history. The HBO adaptation looks at Lister's relationship Ann Walker and her defiant embrace of her sexual orientation. Suranne Jones stars as Anne Lister — she says it's become possible to tell Lister's story now, because we finally have the language to discuss gender and sexuality more openly. ""So I just feel like this is the right time to tell her story in the full-bodied way that it needs to be told.""
Interview Highlights On preparing to play Anne's complexities
YouTube Sometimes when you get a part, you're almost cooked, you're ready to go ... but with this, both me and [writer and director Sally Wainwright] felt like I was a work in progress, and I was going to have to put a lot of work in ... I was able to visit Halifax library and actually take out one of Anne Lister's original diaries and read that for myself, which was a real emotional experience, because I'm touching the paper which she had her hands all over, and Sally was able to read the code to me, over my shoulder, which was again extraordinary ... the code itself, parts of the diary still hadn't been decoded, so it was being decoded especially for us as we filmed, which was really exciting. We'd get an email, and it was kind of like live, as we were filming scenes in the end, where we were getting pieces of information that had never been seen before ... we got to film in Shibden Hall, which was her actual house, so the whole experience was magical; I felt like she was with us every step of the way. But the experience of that really allowed her to get into my bones every single day on set.
On Anne's physicality
She never wavered from wanting to, in her words again, 'love, and only love the fairer sex.' She felt like it was her god-given nature to do that.
Suranne Jones
A lot of the work that Sally's done over the eight episodes are direct from the diaries. A lot of the words that I speak, Sally has used, not verbatim but she's really worked them into the way she writes her dialogue. And there's pieces of information that we have — she walked fast, and she walked upright. She was mistaken for her masculinity. She had a low voice, she looked like an oddity. She was very striking. She always wore black, in mourning for an ex-girlfriend that she lost to a man, to a marriage. So by the time we meet her, she's been wearing black for 16 years. And she was fiercely intelligent, so we wanted to tell the story of her intelligence through her physicality as well, which is kind of the big hand gestures and the tapping; she checks out of scenes before other people do, because she's already on to the next thing ... and she had to be larger than life, she had to be a presence that anyone who knows the diaries can feel it when they read it off the page, and I really wanted to encapsulate that on screen.
On Anne's self-certainty
Sally described her to me as having a very healthy opinion of herself, a very healthy opinion of life, excited by life, wanted to live life to the full. And she was true to her nature. She never wavered from wanting to, in her words again, ""love, and only love the fairer sex."" She felt like it was her god-given nature to do that. She was authentic in that way, and she had no blueprint, there were no communities. Lesbian wasn't a word then. But she just was striking in the way that she knew exactly who she wanted to be, and pushed on and lived in that way.
On what we should take from her story today
I think whether you're part of the LGBTQIA community or not, Anne Lister is trail-blazing, she's life-affirming, she's uplifting, she's courageous. And she believes that everyone has a voice and deserves to be themselves and to speak. And I think in this climate, we need more stories like that.

Claire Harbage/NPR On a bright Sunday afternoon in early March, the Tamir River in the steppes of Mongolia becomes a bowling alley. Two dozen Mongolian herdsmen have gathered to play musun shagai , known as ""ice shooting."" Right now, the ice on the river is perfect. Clear and smooth. The players are cheerful and focused.
Their goal? To send a small copper puck called a zakh down a 93-yard stretch of ice and knock over several cow ankle bones — painted red, none bigger than a golf ball — at the other end. Extra points for hitting the biggest target, made of cow skin.

""You have to spin it,"" says Gurvantamir Jamts, 47, a newcomer to the game. He is the mayor of Tsetserleg, the capital of Arkhangai province, where musun shagai was invented.
He cradles a copper puck between his thumb, index and middle fingers. He shakes it. Metal balls rattle inside. Thrown properly, the puck glides forward with the sound of an ice-skating blade on a freshly resurfaced rink.

"Interview: Peter Bagge, Author Of 'Credo' : NPR",www.npr.org,Etelka Lehoczky,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715175808/from-little-house-to-libertarianism-rose-wilder-lane-s-troublemaking-life,"They Told Us So: Fantagraphics Turns 40
It's interesting that it took until, like, the '90s for this to become an open topic, because the evidence of what a heavy hand Lane had in writing those books was right in front of everybody's faces. Wilder didn't have a typewriter and wrote the first drafts in longhand. She'd hand it to her daughter, who would type it. Lane would send it back to her mother and they'd fight like cats and dogs, but the last draft that was sent to the publisher was always typed. And you could see the different writing styles.
How was Lane as a writer?
She was very good, but her writing is inconsistent. She could be a hack. My favorite book of hers is Old Home Town , a collection of short stories about what it was like to grow up in a small town like Mansfield, Missouri. To me that's her masterpiece.
Another book that is fascinating is 1919's Diverging Roads . It's this feminist shout-out. She describes herself as a feminist throughout, and it's all about discovering herself and becoming independent. Her attitude was that professional women should encourage each other to stick with their careers, as she did throughout her life.
You depict the intense friendships she had with other women, but it's only in the book's back matter that you write, ""the current consensus among people who closely follow her work is that she was bisexual."" Why didn't you focus on that in the main part of the book?
It's shocking how a lot of the topics she wrote about still come up. Peter Bagge
Mainly because that is literally the first time it's ever been discussed in print. When you read her biographies you're like, ""All these intimate, close, long-term relationships — it feels like they're more than just pals, you know?"" The problem is that there is no hard proof. Other authors didn't even want to speculate in print. So I felt it was reckless for me to put it in the comic.
It was fun to see Lane hashing over ideas with Ayn Rand. How do you think they influenced each other?
It was the two of them and a third woman, Isabel Paterson. They bounced their ideas and arguments off each other, and it emboldened them. It wasn't a coincidence that, around that same time, the three of them all wrote books espousing their political views.
Lane was also engaged with the politics of race at the time, since she wrote for the African-American newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier . What did she write about?
It's shocking how a lot of the topics she wrote about still come up. She talked a lot about redlining and how difficult the whole economic structure, between banks and governments, made it for black communities to progress. She wrote a lot about the over-policing of black people — things you still hear about all the time today.
Between her political stridency and her personal quirks, Lane isn't always lovable. Do you worry that readers won't like her?
I really struggled with that. She was a very flawed person. She was temperamental, she suffered from very severe mood swings. To me it made her ridiculous, which was part of the fun of doing the book. I had a lot of laughs while reading and writing about her. But yeah, it's still a mystery to me how readers will respond.

Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio The Iowa caucuses are still nine months away, and with at least 20 Democrats either considering a run or officially declared, many of them are looking for ways to stand out in the crowded field. One tried-and-true way: show up in voters' homes.
Politics Presidential Candidates Still Like To Party The house party has a long tradition in the presidential primary politicking of the two early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where locals open their doors to let aspiring presidents audition in their living rooms. It's a staple of the early campaign, when many candidates can't pack larger venues.
""It's pretty surreal that you can have a candidate running for president in your living room,"" says Liz Adelman, who recently hosted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., at her Des Moines, Iowa, home.
Adelman is originally from outside Washington, D.C., and has lived in Iowa for about 10 years.
""We've done this before, so I kind of knew the drill of what to expect in terms of food and put everything in cabinets to hide,"" says Adelman, who works in public relations, with a laugh. ""It doesn't normally look this clean.""

NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro gets the latest on the ground in Colombo from journalist Lisa Fuller.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
At least 200 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded in eight blasts across Sri Lanka. The coordinated bombings targeted luxury hotels and churches in the country. Joining us now to discuss the latest news is journalist Lisa Fuller, who joins us from Colombo. Lisa, what have you seen there on the ground?
LISA FULLER: During the day today, it was complete chaos - Colombo. This was not something that anybody was expecting. Sri Lanka hasn't seen this level of violence since its civil war ended 10 years ago. And even then, something like this has never happened in Colombo. So I think people just were completely shocked - just with no warning for this type of incident.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Have you been able to speak to any of the victims? What have they been telling you?
FULLER: They have been telling me that they don't know what happened. The blast seemed to go off in the restaurant of the hotels. So it was while people were having breakfast in the morning - so mostly tourists. And then they said all of a sudden, they woke up in the hospital. And that was really all they could remember. There was another bombing in Batticaloa in eastern Sri Lanka. And I talked to a nurse who was right outside the church when it was blasted. And she said there were children who were right near the bomber. And so there were children getting thrown out of the church when the bomb blast went off.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Of course, it's Easter Sunday. And I understand no group has taken responsibility for the attacks. But Sri Lanka's defense minister has said that the culprits were religious extremists. What does that mean? Do you know?
FULLER: So, I mean, throughout the day, there's been a lot of speculation and a lot of news that ended up being false. It was from a letter that had been forged. So, I mean, the most recent information that I have is that they were Sri Lankan. They were from one group. But I have not been provided with any more information from the government other than that.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Seven people have been arrested so far. Can you give us some background...
FULLER: Right.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: ...On Sri Lanka? You know, there was a long civil war there, which ended in 2009. What is the context for this?
FULLER: Yeah. The war ended 10 years ago. And that was between a separatist group called the Tamil Tigers and the - so Tamils are a ethnic minority. And the majority Buddhist Sinhalese population that dominates the government fought against that. There is also a Muslim minority in the country. And since the war ended, Muslims have faced a lot of discrimination in the country.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And there is, of course, a Christian minority, which was targeted in these attacks - at least partially - with the church. And their reaction to this? I mean, any ideas about why they were in the crosshairs?
FULLER: Yeah. The Christian (unintelligible) are both Tamil Sinhala. And there's actually a lot of talk about discrimination against Christians in the last week because there was an incident in a town called Anuradhapura, where sort of a gang threw stones at the church while they were trying to hold services. And we've seen a lot of those types of incidents consistently throughout the last 20 years but just very low, low levels of violence, like assaults on one person. Those attacks have been mainly carried out by Buddhists - they're extremists sort of from the same groups - but have sponsored the attacks against the Muslims.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: A very terrible day in Sri Lanka. Journalist Lisa Fuller in Colombo, thank you very much.

The people of El Salvador have chosen a new politician to lead the country, ending three decades of control by two political parties.
Nayib Bukele, 37, held his wife's hand and waved to crowds as Coldplay's ""Viva La Vida"" boomed from the speakers. ""This day is a historic day. This day, El Salvador destroyed the bipartisanship,"" he said .
The former mayor of San Salvador, Bukele campaigned on a promise to fight corruption and as an alternative to the country's two main political parties: the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance — ARENA — and the left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front — FMLN — which became the ruling party in 2009.
Bukele became a small-town mayor with FMLN in 2012, then was victorious in the capital's mayoral election in 2015. He was expelled from the FMLN two years later for criticizing the party and now leads the small, conservative Grand Alliance for National Unity, or GANA, which means ""win"" in Spanish.
Polls predicted that Bukele was poised to win the presidential election. More than half of Salvadorans cast ballots for Bukele, ensuring that a runoff wouldn't be needed.
They want him to provide solutions to the country's long-standing problems with corruption and crime. Since El Salvador's civil war ended in the 1990s, the Central American country has been plagued by poverty, scandals and rampant violence linked to gangs — a major reason that some Salvadorans have headed north to the United States.
Online newspaper El Faro reported that both FMLN and ARENA paid gangs for votes in the 2014 presidential election. It also reported that Bukele formed pacts with some of the country's most notorious gangs, including a faction of Barrio 18, to carry out city projects. Citing sources from gangs and his team, El Faro reported that ""[Bukele's] campaign gave money to the three main gangs"" in 2015 when he was a mayoral candidate.
Minister of Justice and Public Security Mauricio Ramírez Landaverde said the gangs had increased their violence because ""they are looking to be included in the candidates' platforms,"" according to The Associated Press.
The AP reported in mid-January that nearly 170 people, including five police officers, had been killed between Jan. 1 and Jan. 16.
Bukele has said he will not use an iron fist, or mano dura, policy against gangs.
In 2012, then-President Mauricio Funes' government helped broker a truce among El Salvador's gangs. However, that agreement collapsed two years later. A 'Voice For The Voiceless': Sainthood For El Salvador's Archbishop Óscar Romero
Between 2014 and 2017, nearly 20,000 Salvadorans were killed, according to the International Crisis Group. At neighborhood roadblocks in the capital, some lookouts, or banderas, are ""barely eight years old.""
While El Salvador's homicide rate has decreased, the country continues to have one of the world's highest rates, according to the U.S. State Department. In 2017, rape increased 18 percent from the previous year, with 1,850 reported cases."

Originally broadcast in 1999.
Music Interviews Aretha Franklin: The 'Fresh Air' Interview DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. When Pulitzer Prize winners were announced earlier this week, Aretha Franklin was honored with a special citation for what the jury called her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades. Franklin died last August at the age of 76.
Her talents are also being celebrated with the release of a new documentary about her gospel performance recorded in 1972 at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts, Los Angeles. Sydney Pollack directed a version of the film decades ago, but it was never released because of problems synchronizing the images and sound. Digital experts have solved those problems, and the film, called ""Amazing Grace,"" is now in theaters.
Today we're going to hear some of Terry's conversation with Aretha Franklin recorded in 1999. We will start with an excerpt of that gospel performance in 1972.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ARETHA FRANKLIN: (Singing) What a friend we have in Jesus - all, all, our sins and griefs to bear. What, what a privilege it is to carry everything to God in prayer. Gotta (ph) sing it one more time. What, what a friend we, we have in Jesus - all, all our sins and our griefs to bear. Whoa (ph), what a privilege it is to just carry, oh, everything, everything to God in prayer, whoa.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Let's talk a little bit about the influences on you during your formative years. Your father, the Reverend C.L. Franklin, he was one of the most popular preachers of his generation. He was nationally known through his tours and through, I think, radio broadcasts as well as recordings.
You say in the book that church nurses carried smelling salts to revive worshippers who were overcome to the point of fainting by the Spirit or by your father's sermons. What was it like for you to watch your father speak and people fainting in church?
FRANKLIN: Well, it was tremendous. I loved going to church. But as a young girl, I certainly enjoyed watching and listening to my dad.
GROSS: You toured with your father through churches, through the Deep South. And I'm wondering what it was like for you during the days of segregation to tour through the Deep South - you know, how that compared to what you were used to in Detroit.
FRANKLIN: Well, it certainly was not what I was used to or accustomed to in Detroit. There were times that we were asked to go to the back of the restaurant, say, or we couldn't use the bathrooms. We got information that Gulf - you could use the bathrooms there if you - and we didn't buy gas where we could not use the restrooms. So we went to Gulf a lot, I must tell you.
GROSS: Many singers who grew up in the church weren't allowed by their parents to listen to or to perform pop music. It wasn't that way in your family. What did your father think about pop music and jazz?
FRANKLIN: My dad, I think, appreciated gifted artists. We just didn't have that problem in our home. ""Rockin' With Leroy"" used to come on when I would come in from school. It was a very, very big R&B broadcast of the day when I was a young girl. My dad really appreciated music, and he never tried to limit us in any way with respect to music or anything like that.
GROSS: Well, as you describe in your new autobiography, great performers like Nat Cole and Art Tatum knew your father and would sometimes be in your living room at the piano. That must have been something.
FRANKLIN: Yes, that's true. Art Tatum was often a visitor in our home. He was a very good friend of my dad's - Oscar Peterson and Arthur Prysock, Mahalia Jackson, of course James. And he loved Sam - Sam Cooke. And he just really very broadly appreciated one's artistry when they were truly gifted and really good.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""YOU SEND ME"")
FRANKLIN: (Singing) Darling, you send me - darling, you send me - darling, you send me - honest you do - honest you do - honest you do - whoa, oh, oh, you thrill me. Darling, you thrill me. Baby, you - you thrill me - honest you do - honest you do - honest you do. At first, I thought it was infatuation.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: Now, you were friends with Sam Cooke - the great gospel-singer-turned-soul-singer. How did you meet?
FRANKLIN: Sam and I met at a Sunday evening program that we had at our church back in the early '50s, and I was sitting there waiting for the program to start after church. And I just happened to look back over my shoulder, and I saw this group of people coming down the aisle. And, oh, my God, the man that was leading them - Sam and his brother, LC. And these guys were really super-sharp. They had on beautiful blue and - navy blue and brown trench coats.
And I had never seen anyone quite as attractive - not a male as attractive - as Sam was. And so prior to the program, my soul was kind of being stirred in another way.
GROSS: Well, now, he crossed over from gospel to pop before you did. What impact did it have on you when you heard him having a hit pop song on the radio?
FRANKLIN: We were going down the highway. We were somewhere in the South. And my sister and I, and the driver and maybe one or two other people in the car - we knew that he had left the gospel field. And, of course, I was rather sad about that. But as we were driving, we knew that he had recorded. And just out of the dark came this fabulous voice, and it was Sam. And it was his first record. And he was singing, ""You Send Me,"" and there was just pandemonium in the car.
My sister and I just had a fit. Oh, my God, it's Sam. It's Sam. It's his record. You know, it was like that - ""You Send Me."" This is - it's his record, you know. And there was just so much excitement in the car. The driver really had to pull over.
GROSS: So did that make you think, maybe I should consider making pop records?
FRANKLIN: Well, I don't know at the time. I don't think that was my feeling, and it wasn't to begin with. I was interested in changing fields as well, but I was not as confident, I guess, as Sam was to begin with. And finally, I said, well, if Sam made it, maybe I could, too. And I was willing to give it a try.
GROSS: In 1966, after your contract with Columbia Records was up, you moved to Atlantic Records, which was the home of rhythm and blues greats like The Drifters, The Clovers, Ruth Brown and Ray Charles. The producer Jerry Wexler took you down to a studio in Muscle Shoals, Ala., that was famous for its great session men - which included Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham.
Now, Spooner Oldham tells a story that when he heard you sit down at the piano and play your first chord, he thought, wow, that's really great, and that he who - and he's a pianist - that he should let you play piano while he moved over to electric piano playing behind you.
Were you pleased that he agreed that you should be the one at the piano?
FRANKLIN: I remember that particular session. It was the very first session, so naturally, yes, I remember it. And we really were kind of struggling at that point to get to the music. It just wasn't quite coming off - although we had dynamite players.
We had the Muscle Shoals section, and they were really very, very hot - cutting a lot of good, greasy stuff or what you would call greasy in that day. But we weren't getting to the music in the way that we should have - it just wasn't coming off. And finally, someone said, Aretha, why don't you sit down and play? And I did. And it just happened. It all just happened. We arrived, and we arrived very quickly.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""RESPECT"")
FRANKLIN: (Singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T - find out what it means to me. R-E-S-P-E-C-T - take care, TCB, oh. A little respect - whoa, babe, a little respect. I get tired - keep on trying. You're running out of fools, and I ain't lying. Start when you come home or you might walk in...
DAVIES: Aretha Franklin spoke with Terry Gross in 1979. This week, Franklin was awarded a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, and a new documentary about her 1972 gospel performance called ""Amazing Grace"" is now in theaters. Franklin died last August at the age of 76.

'Long Day's Journey Into Night' Astonishes With Technical Achievement,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/714699084/long-day-s-journey-into-night-astonishes-with-technical-achievement?station=KXJZ_FM,"Chinese writer-director Bi Gan's new film centers on a former casino owner haunted by the memory of a woman from his past. It features a 59-minute sequence, shot in a single take and converted to 3-D.
DAVE DAVIES, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" is the second feature from the Chinese writer-director Bi Gan. The film has been a critical sensation since it premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival. The movie features a nearly hour-long 3-D sequence as the story follows a former casino manager haunted by the memory of a woman from his past. Film critic Justin Chang has this review.
JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: Bi Gan's ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" is the most magical movie I've seen in many a moon. It's a beautiful and sometimes baffling noir romance that borrows visual styles and motifs from filmmakers as different as Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch and Andre Tarkovsky. Its chief innovation however feels like something new - a 59-minute sequence shot in a single take and converted to 3D that stands as one of the great poetic and technical achievements in recent filmmaking.
To answer the obvious question first, this ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" shares an English title but not a plot with Eugene O'Neill's classic play. The Chinese title translates more accurately as ""Last Evenings On Earth,"" which is also the title of a short story collection by the Chilean writer Roberto Bolano. Most of Bolano's stories are about solitary wanderers going on mysterious quests in Latin America and Europe.
The movie captures something of their restless lonely spirit even though it takes place half a world away in director Bi's hometown of Kaili City in Southeast China. A handsome divorcee named Luo Hongwu, played by Huang Jue, has returned home after his father's death. As he wanders the area with its rain-washed streets and rocky tunnels, he begins searching for a woman he loved long ago. She's played by the actress Tang Wei from Ang Lee's movie ""Lust, Caution.""
And whenever she appears - always wearing a green dress - we know we are lost in either a memory or a dream. You can sense the influence of the great Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai in the story's fragmented structure. Its themes of lost time and remembrance, and its seductive almost fetishistic attention to visual detail. He's also there in the protagonist's dreamlike voiceover which casts a veil of melancholy over every image.
But compared with Wang's movies, ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" feels almost completely unbound by narrative logic. The first half flows from flashback to reverie to present tense reality, with little effort to differentiate among the three. Luo tells us more about his past - about a childhood friend who was killed years ago by a local gangster, and about a book containing a magic spell that, according to legend, could make your house spin.
How these details and symbols all fit together is a mystery the movie has little interest in solving. Director Bi knows that we sometimes go to the movies to lose ourselves. And getting lost can be beautiful, even pleasurable. About halfway through the story, Luo enters a movie theater and puts on a pair of 3-D glasses, which is the audience's cue to do the same.
Suddenly, we are transported alongside Luo into a dark cavern. He walks out, rides a motorbike some distance and zip lines down to a small village where several beguiling encounters await him. All this is captured in one seamless shot by a gently flowing camera that, combined with the effect of the 3-D, makes us feel as if we're floating through space.
Recent Hollywood movies, like ""Gravity"" and ""Birdman,"" have made clever use of long travelling shots, achieved largely through editing and visual effects trickery. But ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" is a much more analog, handcrafted affair, which makes its achievement all the more astonishing.
By all accounts, the shot was fiendishly difficult to plan and choreograph. And the effect is one of sustained tension and wonderment, like watching a metaphysical Rube Goldberg device play out for close to an hour. Details from the first half turn up mysteriously in the second - a piece of fruit, a karaoke performance and a beautiful woman who bears a striking resemblance to Luo's former lover. That's a clear reference to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo,"" The greatest film ever made about romantic obsession.
The bifurcated structure of ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" is very much open to interpretation. I felt like I was being told the same story twice in two different-but-equally-moody registers of dream logic. In the first half, the ground is forever shifting under our feet as each new scene seems to reset the narrative.
The second half, with its unified flow of action, is easier to follow, but in some ways even more mysterious. There's something incredibly poignant about the movie's notion that the past is always with us, even as time just keeps on going and going. If movies are dreams, then Bi Gan never wants us to wake up.

Christians around the world gathered on Sunday to mark the end of Holy Week and celebrate Easter.
Festivities took on many forms. While some worshippers reenacted the Passion of the Christ, others gathered for candlelit services or colorful processions.
For many Christians, this year's holiday was a more somber affair. In Paris, the fire the engulfed Notre Dame this past week forced worshippers to find other places to attend services. In Sri Lanka, celebrations were shattered Sunday morning with a series of explosions that ripped through multiple churches and hotels, killing nearly 300 people and injuring hundreds more.
Speaking at the Vatican, Pope Francis addressed the tragedy and the lives lost.
""I want to express my loving closeness to the Christian community, targeted while they were gathered in prayer, and all the victims of such cruel violence,"" he said. ""I entrust to the Lord all those who were tragically killed and pray for the injured and all those who are suffering as a result of this dramatic event.""
The pope also spoke about conflicts in other areas of the world and urged leaders to work together to find peaceful resolutions .

toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR A tiddlywinks game mid-play, with winks spread out around the pot. Though players eventually want to ""pot"" their ""winks,"" players also strategize how to block their opponents by landing their piece on top of another's piece.
Claire Harbage/NPR Updated at 8:33 a.m. ET on April 27
In 1995, Sports Illustrated likened Larry Kahn and David Lockwood to the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier of Tiddlywinks. A fearsome metaphor for two men who, in the parlance of their game, spend their time squopping and potting, rather than bobbing and weaving.
Heading into this week's Tiddlywinks World Championships, Kahn had won 114 national and world Tiddlywinks titles. Lockwood had won 41. ""Larry is the Ali,"" Lockwood concedes.
But their rivalry is a friendly one, and when they're not competing against one another, they make a formidable pair. As a duo, they previously won five international titles together.
On Friday, they snapped a 21-year drought with their sixth title together at the annual Tiddlywinks World Championships at the University of Cambridge.

Claire Harbage/NPR On a recent afternoon in a simply remodeled basement located in the Virginia suburbs, Lockwood paces the perimeter of a regulation 6-by-3-foot table in gym socks and red track pants, calculating his best move.
Colorful, dime-sized discs, or winks , dot the felt-matted surface. In the center lies a traditional plastic red cup no bigger than a shot glass. Kahn, wearing Tevas over his socks, is playing in shorts, as usual, lest he gets too warm circling the tabletop.

Tiddlywinks has a startlingly simple premise: Shoot the most winks into the cup. For all its academic fandom, the very name of the game and its companion slang evokes the lexicon of a nursery rhyme. But Lockwood is quick to blast the game's reputation as a bygone children's pastime.
""Tiddlywinks is not what you did when you were 5 years old,"" he says. ""Tournament tiddlywinks is a fascinating combination of physical skill at a micro level and positional strategy.""

Claire Harbage/NPR What began as a 19th century adult parlor game in England, first patented in 1888, reemerged in university circles across the United Kingdom and the United States as a tournament game held at Cambridge University in 1955.
Over time, professional winkers, largely recruited from Cambridge, Oxford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, helped heighten its complexity and strategy.
Probability, physics and dexterity rule the game.
Offensively, potting — or sinking a wink in the cup — depends on how much pressure a player exerts on the squidger , a larger disc used to flick smaller discs, or winks, into the cup. To gauge your potting chances, competitors know that pressure equals distance, Lockwood explains.

Claire Harbage/NPR To keep opponents from scoring, players use their winks for another purpose: squopping . Translation: they flick their winks on top of their opponent's discs to effectively take them out of play.
""You need to defend the ones that you've got and/or attack the ones that they've got,"" Lockwood explains.
These days, there's hardly a market for the niche sport. Several companies don't even make the equipment anymore.
So committed winkers have had to get creative. Lockwood and Kahn have procured orthopedic felt for their playing surface. They make their own squidgers by sanding down plastic discs molded from spice jar lids. They're banking on 3-D printing becoming more affordable in the near future to help streamline the process.
It's not something they could have imagined when they started playing Tiddlywinks during their freshman year at MIT, when Kahn and Lockwood each signed themselves up on a whim. Kahn thought the game sounded fun to learn. Lockwood checked ""Tiddlywinks"" as a joke, he says, after perusing the list of activities offered in the student handbook.
""I was the last person to make the eight-player team in 1972,"" he says.

Today, Lockwood says the game has changed his life. ""I've been to Britain more than 100 times since then, mostly to play Tiddlywinks.""
It's a sentiment shared by Kahn, who says the game has ""enriched my life.""
Kahn and Lockwood both say that one of the best parts of belonging to the winking community has been the friendships they've gained.
""Immediately you have a bond with people I've never met and it's continued on, through today. For whatever reason, the game has sort of kept people together to some extent.""

Claire Harbage/NPR Of course, when talk turned to the tournament, they turned less sentimental.
""It'd be nice to you know, as old as we are compared to the other players, be able to to go in and win a match,"" Kahn says. ""To show the old guys can still do it.""
Lockwood is blunter. ""I really want this,"" he says. For him, the victories are addicting.
""If you get a modicum of success, you're more frequently willing to continue to play, but it's also a very frustrating game because you miss these things that you've made so many times in the past,"" he says.
""But only the past is certain."""

Barbara Nitke/Hulu Stories of first-generation Americans tend to stress the same struggles. How do you fit in with your peers when your parents aren't assimilating? How do you balance your instinct to rebel against your parents with your awareness of what they sacrificed to get here?
A new TV series called Ramy addresses many of those issues. Its namesake character is an Egyptian-American millennial in his 20s grappling with being a practicing Muslim. He's also struggling to blend his religious beliefs with 21st century life in the U.S: praying, dating, working, drinking, relating to your parents. It's complicated.
Pop Culture Muslims Are Having A Hollywood Moment The show is out on Hulu, and it's co-written and co-created by Ramy Youssef, an actor and stand-up comedian. He based the main character on his own experiences growing up in suburban New Jersey as a Muslim who considers himself religious.
""I would say it's all very emotionally true,"" Youssef says. ""I tried to imagine a character that didn't have a creative outlet. In real life, I have these creative outlets, and I have really clear conversations with my parents. But this is a little bit removed from that, and just a little bit more at the base level of emotion. So he's a little more stunted, and I wanted to write from that place.""
Interview Highlights On first-generation Americans who are millennials may have it different from previous first-generation experiences
Well, I think that we face just some different economic things. I mean, I think a lot of the pressure that happens in this show is about money. I mean, we see my character kind of forced into this relationship with his uncle, this family member that is pretty intolerable. But it's clear that the only reason he hangs around is because he has money, and he has this influence over the family. And so you see somebody who is trying to do good and be good and figure out what that means to him morally. But he's also pressed to kind of accelerate his life.
On the cringeworthy uncle Naseem character
For the record, he's also racist and homophobic and Islamophobic. So he is all of those things. And absolutely, I think that the show isn't going to sit for everyone with the approach that we took. And that's OK. There's a lot of — there's, I think, 500 shows on TV this year. So we wanted to take this approach not to be sensational, not to offend for the sake of offending — that's not even really what we're setting out to do. And I think that many people who have watched this show and they see that character, along with seeing the other characters, say, ""I know that guy."" You know, ""I know a Ramy"" or ""I know an uncle Naseem"" or ""I have an uncle Naseem, and instead of the racist anti-Semitic thing he says, he actually says stuff about Muslims, or he actually says stuff about black people or he actually says stuff, you know, 'insert group' — and we don't know what to do with him.""
And so what we were really looking to do here is to not hide any of these characters, but actually set them up and show them and begin their stories so that we can trace out their arc over multiple seasons. That is very much my intention with the first season of my show, is to plant the seeds of a lot of things that can grow. So there isn't this resolution or instant karma. I think that there's a little bit of an uneasy feeling, and I think that's OK. I think that that's what's really nice about TV, is that things can play out a little bit slower.
On being a religious person, as he joked on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert
I grew up in a town where I watched my gay friends struggle to come out to the religious community. And now I live in LA, where I'm a religious person struggling to come out to the gay community.
I think it's something that I found early on in doing stand-up — that I could just feel a little bit of attention in the room when I started talking about it in an honest way. 'Cause I think church is kind of a punch line, you know? Like, that sounds like the end of the joke, right? ""And then I took her to church!"" And I think religion has earned being made fun of. I think that religious culture and the industry of religion pretty much deserves most of the heat that it gets.
But I think that there's a human side to why the faiths have continued, and I think that there's some really valuable things, and is my personal belief. And so presenting a character that isn't trying to erase this part of his life, isn't trying to erase his parents' culture and the tradition that he comes from, was what we really tried to do with this show. And I think ... most of the [first-generation] stories that we've seen is somebody fighting to have the ability to just be not like their family, or like everyone that's in front of them. There's almost this subtext of, like, ""Hey, I want to be white too, and I have the right to do that, mom."" And that that feels like every narrative that's been jammed down my throat as a viewer.
And so what I wanted to show was something that felt more of a internal look at the character being introspective — who is actually struggling to keep his faith in his life, while also take some of the opportunities that are presented to him in the place that he grew up in. 'Cause that's closer to my life.
On dedicating episodes to his on-screen sister and mother

toggle caption Craig Blankenhorn/Hulu The show Ramy dedicates plenty of face time to the title character's sister Dena (May Calamawy) and mother Maysa (Hiam Abbass), shown.
Craig Blankenhorn/Hulu That was something that I fought for a bunch when we were presenting it to the network. But it was really important because I felt like it was the only way you could understand the world. And I think that when we talk about representation, and showing a family that hasn't been seen before, representation isn't three lines in a scene. Representation is actually when the character doesn't have lines, but the camera is lingering on them in their thoughts after something happened, and then we get to see them walk to their car. You really need to follow a character in order to understand what they're going through.
So I didn't want to just play this game where I was checking boxes by giving my sister and my mom a line here or there. I wanted to actually sit with them and experience what they were going through, and I want that to be the tone of this show. So we might not have every type of character or every type of experience — yet. But that's because we want to give it the right treatment and we want to actually represent them.
On what he might want to show people about Muslims with the show
I just want people to see Muslims as human. That's it. I don't really think that there's much more you could get out of this series, because it's so limited. We're talking about one type of family. To say that all Muslims are like this — to even say that Arab Muslims in North Jersey are like this — would be ridiculous. This is my point of view, and that's why I call the show Ramy . I made the show that I would want to see. So it's only going to hit on certain things.
I just want to complicate the conversation. I want you, instead of thinking of terrorism when you think about a mosque, maybe you can think about the characters in this show. I would love to re-frame certain words in certain settings. But outside of that, even my re-frame is not worthy of where your mind should land. It's just a complication of the conversation.

Jade Bird Debuts Self-Titled Album,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715774846/jade-bird-debuts-self-titled-album,"British musician Jade Bird is out with her debut self-titled album, Jade Bird . She talks with NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer about how she expresses herself through songwriting.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Finally today, some music.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SOMETHING AMERICAN"")
JADE BIRD: (Singing) You don't call me now, and I don't think too much about you. But when she's not around, I can feel you're lonely. Oh, I can feel you're lonely somehow.
PFEIFFER: That's Jade Bird singing one of her breakthrough songs, ""Something American."" She's 21 but sings like a much older soul. And although her musical interests are diverse, she often gets described as a country and Americana musician. That's even though she's British.
Now Jade Bird is out with her first full-length album. She named it after herself - ""Jade Bird."" When I spoke with her earlier this week, she explained why she always writes her own lyrics.
BIRD: You're exploring yourself via music. And so I think for - in order to that - to be diluted - that wasn't something I necessarily wanted for my first record, so I made a real attempt to do that with myself. I think it's the only thing that you have that's kind of very unique to you. It's your voice on paper, in a way. So that's why it was so important - you know, being a young woman and growing up and having all these conflicts, there's no one better to tell it than me.
BIRD: You mentioned conflicts. And there is a heartbreak theme to several of your songs. One of them is called ""17,"" and here's part of that one.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""17"")
BIRD: (Singing) Stay, let me explain why I act so mean. Don't look away, baby. It's not all that it seems. I'm so afraid that you'll just get up and leave. My heart will break like I'm 17.
PFEIFFER: Anything in terms of the lyrics there that you feel comfortable sharing about what kind of relationships you've been through that result in lyrics like that?
BIRD: Yeah. I think, you know, I use the metaphor of 17 as kind of your first heartbreak almost, you know, being the worst because you're at your most vulnerable when you're young. And it doesn't necessarily have to be 17. I just - people always assume that your first heartbreak is your boyfriend or, you know, something like that. And I don't think it has to be. It's just someone you put trust in that ultimately lets you down. And I think, you know, that has happened, and that's been a big part of my past and my life and so therefore, that was quite a cathartic song to release, almost, and to write.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""17"")
BIRD: (Singing) I say less than I should. I say more than I mean. I would try if I could, but I'm all I can be. If I had more, I would change the cover, you see. I have walls that have stood before you ever loved me...
PFEIFFER: Your childhood has been described as kind of tumultuous. You were basically a military brat. You moved around a lot. I think you watched both your parents and your grandparents split up. How did that influence your music?
BIRD: You know, I've been quite obsessed with what that means for me. ""Love Has All Been Done Before,"" which is on this record, is basically about that. It's the fact that I'm - you know, could be in a really good relationship, yet I feel like, you know, my parents' past or my past might dictate what that means for me in the future. Love has all been done before - you know, that - in that respect, it's all going to end the same way. And it is quite a - you know, probably a cynical way of being, and I've kind of learned to come out of that via writing all these songs.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LOVE HAS ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE"")
BIRD: (Singing) You are good, and you are pure, the angel knocking at my door. But I need something, something more 'cause love has all been done before. And you are sweet, and you are nice, keep me calm and satisfied. But I need something, something more 'cause love has all been done before.
PFEIFFER: You've said before that you used to think that unhappiness was key to songwriting, although you've also talked about now being in a much happier place in life, a good relationship. Are you at the point now where you feel like having a balanced, joyful life can also make for good songs?
BIRD: Yeah. I've definitely come out the other side in that. The last six months of my album cycle - and it was a two-year process, all in all, which is crazy - I wrote, you know, the majority of my songs that made it onto the record. And I think that was a real lesson for me because, you know, I've got my best friends on the road with me. I'm with, you know, great - I'm in a healthy relationship. And it means I don't have to cause chaos to write good songs, almost, or songs that are of a certain quality.
And so that was a bit of a revelation for me because you always broach with the stigma that you have to be unhappy, and you have to be tortured and stuff. I think it's just processing. I think you always have to process something as a creative. But you don't necessarily have to be kind of morose to do that.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SIDE EFFECTS"")
BIRD: (Singing) Whatcha (ph) say we just get away? Pack up and save it for a rainy day. It's a side effect of love, my dear.
PFEIFFER: You have said in the past that you would rather be respected than heralded. I think that's the exact quote. What did you mean by that?
BIRD: I think that, you know, I don't really have a need or want to be famous, almost. I really value my anonymity, and I value being able to go and experience a city or a place. And so that's not really what I'm doing it for. But the artists that I really love - you know, Tori Amos, like Carole King, Fleetwood Mac - they seem to have a certain level of musical respect that I would really love to get one day. And that's why I kind of make music - not only to process how I'm feeling to connect with an audience but, you know, also to just know that I've made it on the way to making a really great album, you know. I really - I hope for that one day. That's my ambition.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SIDE EFFECTS"")
BIRD: (Singing) Give me a sign, and we'll go. If it's tonight or tomorrow...
PFEIFFER: That's Jade Bird talking to us about her debut album called ""Jade Bird,"" which is out now.
Thanks for talking with us.
BIRD: Thank you so much. Cheers.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SIDE EFFECTS"")
BIRD: (Singing) Baby, please. It's just a side effect of changing your life.

"After Notre Dame Caught Fire, Parisians Mark Easter Elsewhere",www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715774839/after-notre-dame-caught-fire-parisians-mark-easter-elsewhere,"Parisians and visitors from around the world mark Easter days after part of the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral burned.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
There's much debate in France over restoring the historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which caught fire Monday. And plans are in the works to rebuild, but for now, the fragile structure is off-limits. So today, the local community attended Easter Mass at another church in central Paris. This follows five months of anti-government yellow vest protests in the French capital, including yesterday's clashes between police and demonstrators. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports from today's Easter Mass.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHOIR OF NOTRE DAME: (Singing in foreign language).
OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: ""Agnus Dei"" - lamb of god - sung by the choir of Notre Dame - not in its regular home, but at Saint-Eustache, the church standing in for the cathedral today. The archbishop of Paris, Monsignor Michel Aupetit, celebrated Easter Mass. Regine du Boisbaudry, a Saint-Eustache parishioner with her two young children and husband, says they were stunned by the Notre Dame fire.
REGINE DU BOISBAUDRY: It's a real disaster for us, and we're happy here to welcome all the Catholic family of Notre Dame - and to welcome everyone from all over the world, of course.
QUIST-ARCTON: Du Boisbaudry runs a legal translation company with her husband. After discussing Notre Dame, we turned to the current political situation in France - the yellow vest protests on the streets yesterday in continuing demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron. She said she gets the legitimate grievances of the protesters about social inequalities and poverty.
DU BOISBAUDRY: Macron - it's - that's very, very, very important. He must respond to their demand very, very urgently - the yellow vest, yeah. And he must understand that it is his priority first, and after, of course, Notre Dame. It's another part of our history.
QUIST-ARCTON: Tear gas is floating towards us from the Place de la Republique - the republic square - where yellow vest protesters...
(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)
QUIST-ARCTON: Did you hear that? Another tear gas canister. Riot police in full gear are standing between the yellow-vesters and onlookers.
The air was thick with smoke as protesters clashed with riot police, who also fired stun grenades. Caroline Camus told NPR she's fully engaged, and she said everyone, including Macron, should understand there's deep-seated anger in France.
CAROLINE CAMUS: It's time to speak. It's time to pray a lot because it's in the heart of people, this hunger. You understand?
(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)
CAMUS: You understand?
QUIST-ARCTON: More tear gas.
CAMUS: And it's time to move for the citizens, for the republic.
QUIST-ARCTON: Camus says she hopes Macron gets that. The French leader is due to address the nation Thursday in a speech delayed since the evening of the Notre Dame fire Monday. The fleeting solidarity and feeling of unity among the French this past week is vanishing. Reality is staring Macron in the face.
But last night, the focus was again on the cathedral. A national concert featuring singers and celebrities was held to raise more funds for Notre Dame. Popular French singer Slimane's interpretation of Jacques Brel’s song, ""When We Only Have Love"" (ph), hit the spot - togetherness. Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, NPR News, Paris.

#NPRPoetry: Alberto Rios On The Power Of 'Or',www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715774832/-nprpoetry-alberto-rios-on-the-power-of-or,"It's National Poetry Month, and for our series #NPRPoetry, NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with poet Alberto Rios, who combed Twitter for his favorite original poems.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
And now our continuing celebration of Poetry Month. We've been asking listeners to share original tweet-length poems. And each week this month, we've been reading through your submissions. With us this week to go through the submissions is Alberto Rios. He's the poet laureate of Arizona and an English professor at Arizona State University.
Alberto, thank you for doing this with us.
ALBERTO RIOS: Thank you so much for having me.
PFEIFFER: You have picked poems that you like from Twitter this week. What's top of your list?
RIOS: Yes. Well, the top of my list, if I can just characterize it first as an ethos, is exuberance. For example - and I can tell this one was from Arizona - this was by Casimir Wojciech (ph).
(Reading) The air is warm with mesquite dreams and the silence of rattlesnakes and the wind and the San Aritos (ph) and the muskrat still digging and the earthworms and ants and these finches tied to each branch who would rather die than stop singing.
PFEIFFER: I like that one. It was a very sensory. You could hear and see and feel the landscape.
RIOS: You could. And the word - that and - there's - it's written here as an ampersand in tweet fashion. But I'm always intrigued by the smallest, little pieces of language, the littlest signposts. And I think of and, one of the coordinating conjunctions - and, but, or, nor, for and so - as the chicken soup of the English language. And says you're not alone. There's something more. You're connected to something. And that very sort of comforting and, and, and, and - I love the idea that nature is combining to overwhelm us with something good.
RIOS: What else did you like that you saw this week? This is from Jenny Karr (ph).
(Reading) Tiny fists punch crashing water as the ocean is reduced to a series of one-foot-high waves. Nothing compared to their vitality, their power. The boys fight with such gleeful determination one can't help but think they may just win.
PFEIFFER: Right. That was fun because it sounds like they're fighting small waves, but they feel like they're fighting the whole ocean.
RIOS: I know. I know. And we can see it as an adult. But in their moment, in that small battle that little boys have with a wave, I - you can feel what that means.
PFEIFFER: We have another reader submission. And in this case, the poet introduces himself.
DAVID FOSTER ANGLER: This is David Foster Angler (ph) from Portland, Ore.
(Reading) I'm walking a poem home. It's a late night out, arm in arm, stumbling in the dark, trying to stay between the lines a little like a bear cub. Don't get between us. I'm helping a poem out of its clothes and encouraging it to drink water. Too much of anything can make you a mess.
PFEIFFER: It's a great one.
RIOS: I love that. I love that - the personification of the poem itself - such a meta-statement. I loved it.
PFEIFFER: Exactly - the poet...
PFEIFFER: ...As a person stumbling home drunk.
RIOS: Drunk with itself. I love it (laughter).
PFEIFFER: Do you have any advice to share with listeners who want to submit a Twitter poem of their own?
RIOS: Yeah. I think there was a lot of humor, a lot of joking. And I have a lot of fun with that. I love humor. I respond to it. But I have to say, it comes off as a defense mechanism, and I would say if you're going to contribute a poem, speak from the heart. Say it true and stand with it.
PFEIFFER: That's Alberto Rios, Arizona's Poet Laureate and author of ""A Small Story About The Sky.""
Alberto, thank you.
RIOS: Thank you so much.

NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with human rights activist Shannon Sedgwick Davis, author of To Stop a Warlord: My Story of Justice, Grace, and the Fight for Peace .
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
You may remember Joseph Kony from the Kony 2012 video that went viral several years ago. He's the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, or the LRA, a rebel group in Central Africa. The group is notorious for abductions and massacres in remote villages. An effort to take down Kony is documented in a book called ""To Stop A Warlord: My Story Of Justice, Grace, And The Fight For Peace"" by Shannon Sedgwick Davis. She is CEO of the Bridgeway Foundation, which came up with an unconventional idea for ending the LRA's atrocities - use charitable money to train a military force to track down and stop Joseph Kony.
I spoke with Sedgwick Davis and asked her why her organization took such an extreme measure.
SHANNON SEDGWICK DAVIS: We had this mission statement to end mass atrocity. And as we looked around the globe, and as we gave grants, we were finding that we were giving grants to either advocate against mass atrocities that were going on or advocate for international bodies to engage mass atrocities, or we were picking up pieces. We were giving grants to rebuild a school that had been burned down. And we weren't really doing our mission statement.
And in 2008, there was a Christmas massacre committed by the Lord's Resistance Army, and hundreds of people were killed and abducted. And then again in 2009, when I was actually visiting Congo and spending time with a researcher whose work we supported there from Human Rights Watch, I learned that 321 people had been killed in a subsequent Christmas massacre, and we were only learning about it months later. And that's when we had to take a really hard look at our mission statement and say, either we need to change our mission statement to be more accurate, or we need to actually get engaged and try to stop a mass atrocity.
PFEIFFER: And, you know, that massacre you referenced, what was one of many things striking about it is that in some ways, these villagers were like sitting ducks. I mean, a neighboring village would be massacred, and yet, the new village had no way - no warning system to know that they should hide or that these terrible people were coming. So it seemed like there could be simple fixes to help.
SEDGWICK DAVIS: Yes. It was absolutely horrific, and you're exactly right. In looking at the gap of communications, we met an amazing man, a Congolese man. And he really had the solution in terms of being able to send this warning out to other villages and just needed some resources to grow that network. That network now has hundreds of radio networks that are able to warn each other about a variety of atrocities that might be happening in that region.
PFEIFFER: You use a pretty effective writing device of alternating between your story and the story of a man named David Ocitti. He was a child fighter for Joseph Kony. He's an example of someone whose life was transformed. Can you tell us about the emotional purpose of weaving his experience throughout your book?
SEDGWICK DAVIS: Yes. David was 16 when the LRA came to his village and attacked the village. They kidnapped his brothers and him. And then they held him at gunpoint and asked him, who do you love the most - your mother or your father? And he said his father. And then the LRA killed his father. And David, six months into his time with the LRA, made the very brave decision to try to escape. He was successful at escaping.
He became an excellent partner for us. He would go into villages - let's say that we identified someone who was leading a group, who might have been kidnapped at the age of nine and now was 39 and operating in the jungle. David would look for any family that they might have that had survived, record messages from their mothers or their sisters - (foreign language spoken) - come home, my son. I have never stopped waiting for you. And we would plug the iPhone that he had recorded these messages on into these speakers that we had bolted on the helicopters we were using and hover over an area and blast these messages. And 730 came out during the period of our mission.
PFEIFFER: Although one of your partners - I think Laren - is that how you say his name?
SEDGWICK DAVIS: Yes, Laren.
PFEIFFER: He seemed unconvinced. At one point, he says, we're going to live in a world where a mass murderer goes free. We didn't capture Kony. I can't say we won. At some time, when I read the book, I wondered, are you trying to persuade us and yourself that it was a mission accomplished even though you didn't get your guy?
SEDGWICK DAVIS: Yeah, so let me be very clear in terms of a mission accomplished. The lives that were saved matter and matter immensely. Kony is still there. The LRA still exists. But we're incredibly grateful for the progress that we made.
PFEIFFER: There's this long history of Western people going into Africa to try to help - mixed results, mixed reception. Did you hesitate at all, either doing what you did or writing your book, that you may be perceived that way?
SEDGWICK DAVIS: Absolutely. These are questions that we asked ourselves constantly through the mission. And how we do this work is essential. Listening closely to communities, being invited by them to come and listen and provide some small support is so important
PFEIFFER: That's Shannon Sedgwick Davis. She's CEO of the Bridgeway Foundation, and her new book, ""To Stop A Warlord,"" is out now.
Shannon, thank you very much.

Supreme Court Prepares To Hear 2020 Census Citizenship Question,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/715774818/supreme-court-prepares-to-hear-2020-census-citizenship-question,"Supreme Court Prepares To Hear 2020 Census Citizenship Question Supreme Court Prepares To Hear 2020 Census Citizenship Question Embed Embed
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear a case about whether the 2020 Census can include a question about a person's citizenship status.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear a case about the 2020 census. The justices are weighing whether the Trump administration could include a citizenship question on it. Some people argue that question shouldn't be included because it could affect the accuracy of the country's headcount.
Here to explain is NPR correspondent Hansi Lo Wang. He covers the census and is with me in our Washington, D.C., studio. Hi, Hansi.
HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Hey, Sacha.
PFEIFFER: Would you explain the basics of this case to us? What would this question ask? And why is there a dispute over it?
WANG: This is a question that asks, is this person a citizen of the United States? Research has shown that this is a sensitive question, and especially now in this political climate of increased immigration enforcement, rising anti-immigrant rhetoric. Asking about citizenship will likely discourage households with non-citizens from participating in the census.
And that is a big deal because a census is supposed to be a head count of every person living in the country. That's a constitutional mandate regardless of citizenship or immigration status. And those numbers determine how many congressional seats each state gets, as well as how almost $900 billion a year in federal funding for roads, for schools, how all that money is distributed around the country.
PFEIFFER: Right, so a lot of financial and political implications if you don't have the correct population number, particularly of certain minorities.
WANG: Exactly.
PFEIFFER: What are the two sides arguing? What's that what's the for and the against?
WANG: Well, the Trump administration says it wanted to ask this question, they wanted it included on the forms for the 2020 census because it wants more detailed citizenship data in order to enforce part of the Voting Rights Act. However, if you've talked to voting rights advocates, and also, we have three federal judges at the district court levels, they have all agreed that this - one judge called it a sham justification - that there essentially is no data problem, that if the Trump administration really wanted to have more detailed citizenship data in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act, there was an alternative way that the Census Bureau was advocating for and suggesting, which would be to use existing government records.
That was a way - the Trump administration did not want to even meet with the Census Bureau to discuss and hear out the Census Bureau's suggestions. And that's part of one of the reasons why three federal judges have ruled that adding this question was a violation of administrative law and is also a violation of the Constitution in terms of hurting the government's ability of counting every person living in the country.
PFEIFFER: But, Hansi, a citizenship question has been on the census before. So why a controversy now?
WANG: The census has asked about citizenship before. And currently, the Census Bureau uses a different survey, known as the American Community Survey, to collect that information. But one of the considerations these three federal judges have made - or two federal judges have made in California, as well as Maryland - said that asking about this question in the context in which this question is asked is very important to consider, especially, again, this current political climate. They are really - critics of the question are really worried that this will really harm the accuracy of the headcount.
PFEIFFER: There's a deadline looming involving this case. What's the time pressure?
WANG: The Census Bureau says forms, the paper forms for the 2020 census, that has to - the printing of those forms has to start by July. The Supreme Court is currently expected to end their session in June. So the Census Bureau is waiting for a decision by the end of June in order to get those forms printed on time. There are no do-overs with the census. So whatever the court decides and whatever ends up being asked, we will be living with the data collected from it over for the next decade.
PFEIFFER: That's NPR correspondent Hansi Lo Wang. Thank you.
WANG: You're welcome.

NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with Alaina Teplitz, United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, to better understand the attacks that took place in Sri Lanka.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Now we're going to place the attacks in context. With us is the U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka, Alaina Teplitz. She's been serving as ambassador there since October, and she joins us from the U.S. Embassy in Colombo.
Thank you for joining us, Ambassador Teplitz.
ALAINA TEPLITZ: Thank you, Sacha. It's a pleasure to be with you tonight.
PFEIFFER: This is obviously a developing story, but the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, issued a statement saying that several U.S. citizens were among the more than 200 people killed. Do you have any information more about who those people were?
TEPLITZ: There are U.S. citizens who've been caught up in these really devastating attacks. I can't give out more details at this time because of privacy concerns. But I think we're all just very shocked and saddened by the breadth of the attacks and how senseless they were, particularly targeting people as they worship this morning at Sunday services and were enjoying holiday meals at several of the big hotels.
PFEIFFER: Right - Easter day. Now, a decade ago, Sri Lanka ended an extremely violent civil war where large-scale suicide bombings were common. Do we know why this now after a relatively peaceful past 10 years?
TEPLITZ: That's a good question. We don't really have all the answers we want about who was behind these attacks. I don't believe they were linked to that conflict period. But for a country trying to recover, trying to achieve reconciliation among the ethnic and religious groups here, this is not going to support that effort.
PFEIFFER: Could you tell us more about the ethnic and religious makeup of Sri Lanka and whether those demographics are relevant to what is happening today?
TEPLITZ: There are three major ethnic religious groups in Sri Lanka. There's a large, Sinhalese-speaking, Buddhist population. They make up the majority of the population here. Then there's a smaller, Tamil-speaking, largely Hindu population and then a slightly smaller, Muslim, Tamil-speaking population. These three groups have lived side by side for hundreds of years but don't always get along well. And the 30-year conflict that we spoke about earlier was a result of the Tamil Hindu population and the Sinhalese Buddhist population being at odds about local autonomy.
So I think the efforts to try and overcome, you know, a history of strife through 30 years of brutal civil war has been tremendous. There's still a lot more progress that needs to be made, though. And why today's attacks on Christian churches and, again, local major hotels happened is unclear. It's a sad day for a country trying to overcome this history.
PFEIFFER: Online disinformation and misinformation, particularly on social media, is such a huge issue today. Sri Lanka did something unusual and interesting, which was basically preemptively shut down things like WhatsApp and Facebook - things that might spread information. Do you have any information about why they made that decision and what the history is that would prompt that?
TEPLITZ: About a year ago, there were attacks on the Muslim community in Kandy, which is a city in central Sri Lanka. And social media postings helped fuel false information and helped accelerate the violence during that episode. It was around February of 2018. And I think there's concern that that kind of thing could have happened today. Again, given a history of intra-community strife and occasional sparks of violence, the government was probably very concerned that social media could again fuel that kind of activity.
PFEIFFER: Shutting down those sites also makes it hard for people outside the country to get accurate information. Have you been getting any feedback from people who are struggling to get information and can't get it?
TEPLITZ: Yeah. It's obviously a two-way street. When you shut down those avenues of communication, it just makes it that much harder to get the right information out there. We haven't heard any complaints at this point from people, but we clearly noticed the same thing.
PFEIFFER: Does the U.S. have any plans at this point for how to help Sri Lanka with this?
TEPLITZ: Well, we're very interested in supporting the government here and conducting a thorough investigation behind the attack. There were American victims of this attack. We'd like to know who perpetrated it, find the networks that they're connected to and ensure that it never happens again.
PFEIFFER: That's the U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka, Alaina Teplitz.
Thanks for making time for us today.

SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
And we start today's program with an Easter Sunday tragedy in Sri Lanka. Coordinated bombings this morning killed more than 200 people and wounded hundreds more. The explosions happened in churches and in hotels popular with tourists. NPR's Lauren Frayer has been monitoring the situation from Mumbai, India, and she joins us now on the line.
Hi, Lauren.
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Hi, Sacha.
PFEIFFER: Could you tell us what more you know since this morning about these bombings?
FRAYER: Right. So the country is under curfew - 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Schools and offices will be closed Monday and Tuesday. The government has blocked Facebook and 4G networks, the idea being they don't want to take any chances about terrorists possibly communicating on social media. The defense minister says most of these eight blasts are believed to be the work of suicide bombers.
And the prime minister just held a news conference in which he said rather cryptically that the government had some prior information of this attack but that it was not raised to the highest levels to his Cabinet. He called the response to that alert inadequate. Meanwhile, police responded by cordoning off whole areas. SWAT teams in camouflage with big guns are patrolling part of the capital, Colombo, and doing searches of buildings apparently tied to the investigation.
PFEIFFER: There are 13 suspects being held in connection with these bombings. Is there much known about them?
FRAYER: Not much. Police say they've also uncovered a van that was used by the attackers, also a safe house. Three police officers were killed in a blast at that property. Officials say the suspects detonated explosives, killing themselves rather than being taken into custody alive. The big question is who those suspects are, whether these attacks were planned locally or internationally. And there's been no claim of responsibility. Sri Lanka's been through this before, though. It fought a 26-year civil war. And at the height of that conflict, bombings were common on shopping malls, hotels, attacks like this. And what's sad is that Sri Lanka was just about to celebrate 10 years of peace, 10 years since the end of that conflict.
PFEIFFER: Lauren, it was just five weeks ago that the mosque shootings happened in New Zealand. Do you have any sense of worldwide reaction to what happened in Sri Lanka?
FRAYER: Yeah. I mean, the Eiffel Tower shut off its lights tonight to pay tribute to the Sri Lanka victims. Messages of shock and condolences are pouring in, including from the New Zealand prime minister. President Trump also tweeted his condolences. He said, quote, ""we stand ready to help"" - exclamation point. Pope Francis spoke at St. Peter's Square in Rome, saying that he wanted to express his loving closeness to the Christian community in Sri Lanka. He noted that, you know, many of these people were killed while they were praying, attending services on Easter Sunday morning.
Most of the dead are Sri Lankans, but dozens are foreigners, including Americans. Many of them are tourists who were staying in these luxury hotels or attending Mass at a Catholic church while on vacation. Sri Lanka's a big tourist destination in Asia, famous for these beautiful beach resorts. And that industry is likely to be very hard-hit by this attack.
PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Lauren Frayer. Lauren, thank you.
FRAYER: You're welcome.

Barbara Nitke/Hulu Stories of first-generation Americans tend to stress the same struggles. How do you fit in with your peers when your parents aren't assimilating? How do you balance your instinct to rebel against your parents with your awareness of what they sacrificed to get here?
A new TV series called Ramy addresses many of those issues. Its namesake character is an Egyptian-American millennial in his 20s grappling with being a practicing Muslim. He's also struggling to blend his religious beliefs with 21st century life in the U.S: praying, dating, working, drinking, relating to your parents. It's complicated.
Pop Culture Muslims Are Having A Hollywood Moment The show is out on Hulu, and it's co-written and co-created by Ramy Youssef, an actor and stand-up comedian. He based the main character on his own experiences growing up in suburban New Jersey as a Muslim who considers himself religious.
""I would say it's all very emotionally true,"" Youssef says. ""I tried to imagine a character that didn't have a creative outlet. In real life, I have these creative outlets, and I have really clear conversations with my parents. But this is a little bit removed from that, and just a little bit more at the base level of emotion. So he's a little more stunted, and I wanted to write from that place.""
Interview Highlights On first-generation Americans who are millennials may have it different from previous first-generation experiences
Well, I think that we face just some different economic things. I mean, I think a lot of the pressure that happens in this show is about money. I mean, we see my character kind of forced into this relationship with his uncle, this family member that is pretty intolerable. But it's clear that the only reason he hangs around is because he has money, and he has this influence over the family. And so you see somebody who is trying to do good and be good and figure out what that means to him morally. But he's also pressed to kind of accelerate his life.

For the record, he's also racist and homophobic and Islamophobic. So he is all of those things. And absolutely, I think that the show isn't going to sit for everyone with the approach that we took. And that's OK. There's a lot of — there's, I think, 500 shows on TV this year. So we wanted to take this approach not to be sensational, not to offend for the sake of offending — that's not even really what we're setting out to do. And I think that many people who have watched this show and they see that character, along with seeing the other characters, say, ""I know that guy."" You know, ""I know a Ramy"" or ""I know an uncle Naseem"" or ""I have an uncle Naseem, and instead of the racist anti-Semitic thing he says, he actually says stuff about Muslims, or he actually says stuff about black people or he actually says stuff, you know, 'insert group' — and we don't know what to do with him.""
And so what we were really looking to do here is to not hide any of these characters, but actually set them up and show them and begin their stories so that we can trace out their arc over multiple seasons. That is very much my intention with the first season of my show, is to plant the seeds of a lot of things that can grow. So there isn't this resolution or instant karma. I think that there's a little bit of an uneasy feeling, and I think that's OK. I think that that's what's really nice about TV, is that things can play out a little bit slower.
On being a religious person, as he joked on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert
I grew up in a town where I watched my gay friends struggle to come out to the religious community. And now I live in LA, where I'm a religious person struggling to come out to the gay community.
I think it's something that I found early on in doing stand-up — that I could just feel a little bit of attention in the room when I started talking about it in an honest way. 'Cause I think church is kind of a punch line, you know? Like, that sounds like the end of the joke, right? ""And then I took her to church!"" And I think religion has earned being made fun of. I think that religious culture and the industry of religion pretty much deserves most of the heat that it gets.
But I think that there's a human side to why the faiths have continued, and I think that there's some really valuable things, and is my personal belief. And so presenting a character that isn't trying to erase this part of his life, isn't trying to erase his parents' culture and the tradition that he comes from, was what we really tried to do with this show. And I think ... most of the [first-generation] stories that we've seen is somebody fighting to have the ability to just be not like their family, or like everyone that's in front of them. There's almost this subtext of, like, ""Hey, I want to be white too, and I have the right to do that, mom."" And that that feels like every narrative that's been jammed down my throat as a viewer.
And so what I wanted to show was something that felt more of a internal look at the character being introspective — who is actually struggling to keep his faith in his life, while also take some of the opportunities that are presented to him in the place that he grew up in. 'Cause that's closer to my life.
On dedicating episodes to his on-screen sister and mother

Craig Blankenhorn/Hulu That was something that I fought for a bunch when we were presenting it to the network. But it was really important because I felt like it was the only way you could understand the world. And I think that when we talk about representation, and showing a family that hasn't been seen before, representation isn't three lines in a scene. Representation is actually when the character doesn't have lines, but the camera is lingering on them in their thoughts after something happened, and then we get to see them walk to their car. You really need to follow a character in order to understand what they're going through.
So I didn't want to just play this game where I was checking boxes by giving my sister and my mom a line here or there. I wanted to actually sit with them and experience what they were going through, and I want that to be the tone of this show. So we might not have every type of character or every type of experience — yet. But that's because we want to give it the right treatment and we want to actually represent them.
On what he might want to show people about Muslims with the show
I just want people to see Muslims as human. That's it. I don't really think that there's much more you could get out of this series, because it's so limited. We're talking about one type of family. To say that all Muslims are like this — to even say that Arab Muslims in North Jersey are like this — would be ridiculous. This is my point of view, and that's why I call the show Ramy . I made the show that I would want to see. So it's only going to hit on certain things.
I just want to complicate the conversation. I want you, instead of thinking of terrorism when you think about a mosque, maybe you can think about the characters in this show. I would love to re-frame certain words in certain settings. But outside of that, even my re-frame is not worthy of where your mind should land. It's just a complication of the conversation.

Thomas Mukoya/Reuters Christians around the world gathered on Sunday to mark the end of Holy Week and celebrate Easter.
Festivities took on many forms. While some worshipers reenacted the Passion of the Christ, others gathered for candle-lit services or colorful processions.
For many Christians, this year's holiday was a more somber affair. In Paris, the fire the engulfed Notre Dame this past week forced worshipers to find other places to attend services. In Sri Lanka, celebrations were shattered Sunday morning with a series of explosions that ripped through multiple churches and hotels, killing more than 200 people and injuring hundreds more.
Speaking at the Vatican, Pope Francis addressed the tragedy and the lives lost.
""I want to express my loving closeness to the Christian community, targeted while they were gathered in prayer, and all the victims of such cruel violence,"" the Pope said. ""I entrust to the Lord all those who were tragically killed and pray for the injured and all those who are suffering as a result of this dramatic event.""
The Pope also spoke about conflicts in other areas of the world and urged leaders to work together to find peaceful resolutions .

"'Game Of Thrones' Season 8, Episode 2: 'Think Back To Where We Started'",www.npr.org,Glen Weldon,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715794928/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-2-think-back-to-where-we-started,"Which Characters Will Lose The 'Game Of Thrones?': A Chronicle Of Many Deaths Foretold
There's a bit at the end of the scene when Dany's like, ""What say you, Warden of the North?"" and Jon Snow's all like, ""Hm? Sorry, I was miles away, thinking about how different Auntie Mame would be if Rosalind Russell and the kid who played Patrick were schtupping each other what no reason NO REASON I'm fine what is that the time I gotta go .""
Tyrion gets a royal dressing down from Daenerys, as the show makes explicit something that's been implicit for several seasons now — Tyrion isn't as smart as he thinks he is. This means he's due for a nice, redemptive Big Smart Thing That Will Save The Day any episode now, so those of us who've been impatiently waiting for the writers to let Tyrion be Tyrion shouldn't have long to wait.
Forging ahead
Arya visits Gendry in the Winterfell forges, where many, many dragonglass weapons are being made. In a nice callback, she admires his uh ... form, and they share some banter. She asks for details about the Army of the Dead, and Gendry proves an inarticulate storyteller (""They're bad. Very bad."") who jokingly condescends to Arya, all while sporting a bad haircut, which is why you heard so many millions of people yelling ""ARYA YOU CAN DO BETTER GIRL"" at their televisions at 9:07 ET Sunday night. But the heart wants what it wants, as do the loins, so here we all are, neck deep in ... what are people calling it? Ardry? Genya? I like Ardry, because is sounds like ""arduous,"" which is what this particular ship seems.
Jaime meets Bran in the godswood, and Bran's like, ""So, bangs now, hunh?"" and Jaime's all, ""Yeah, I wanted a change; I think they frame my face, like yours do, what do you think?"" and Bran's all ""We're bangs buddies now! And bangs buddies don't hold grudges for throwing each other out tower windows!""
Jaime and Tyrion get a walk-and-talk scene intended, in whole or in part, to quell online questions about whether Cersei is really pregnant (she very is). Jaime stares down over some battlements, which have been newly festooned with defensive dragonglass, at Podrick and Brienne. Jaime and Brienne get a touching exchange in which Jaime asks to serve under Brienne in the coming battle, and if this moment between them touched a soft salty part of you, hoo boy, just wait half an hour.
Daenerys and Jorah Mormont spend some time dutifully inching Tyrion's redemption arc a few inches further down the road. This is followed by a scene in which Daenerys and Sansa get some quality time onscreen together, finally — though as their conversation is dominated by talk of Tyrion and Jon Snow, they manage to fail the Bechdel test so flagrantly, with such verve, elan and aplomb, that they'll need to retake it after school. (It's a nice scene, though.) ""Tell me,"" Daenerys asks Sansa, pointing out that she's up in the frozen North at Jon Snow's side, when she could be down in King's Landing serving herself up a nice big helping of Cersei en flambe , ""Who manipulated whom?"" (The fact that she said ""whom"" instead of ""who"" right there means she was raised right and deserves the Iron Throne.)
They are interrupted before Daenerys can answer Sansa's question about the fate of the North, once the battles are over. (It's the first of two times this episode that fate will interrupt her at a crucial time.) Theon shows up and is warmly welcomed by Sansa — very warmly. Surprisingly warmly, frankly. I mean, sure, he did save her life. But that didn't seem like a ""You saved my life"" hug.
Crypt-o currency
Davos serves soup — the color and consistency of hot ketchup — to several peasants readying for the coming battle. Gilly assures someone that the crypts are the safest place KLAXON KLAXON KLAXON KLAXON and we meet an adorable moppet who will likely become Victim No. 1 when ice-zombie Lyanna Stark or whoever comes crawling out of her grave next week.
Dolorous Edd, Beric Dondarrion and Tormund make it back to Winterfell, where battle preparations proceed apace. At a war council held around a big map table that's not nearly as cool as the one at Dragonstone, plans are made. Well. Plan , anyway.
The plan, such as it is: Get to the Night King — who, we learn, has got a thing for Three-Eyed Ravens. Sam gets a nifty little speech about memory, history and the stories we tell, which causes everyone around the table to look at each other meaningfully. Or questioningly. Or amorously. It's hard to tell.
""We'll put you in the crypt,"" Jon tells Bran (wait for it!), ""where it's safest."" ""What a stupid idea, I've seen next week's episode,"" Bran doesn't say.
What he does say is that he'll park his wheelchair in the godswood and wait for the Night King there, defended by Theon. Tyrion wants to fight, but Daenerys orders him to stay in the really, no kidding, completely absolutely super-duper safe crypts.
After the council, Daenerys tries to connect with Jon, but he disappears, leaving a broody dust cloud behind him and a Jon-Snow-shaped hole in the wall.
""You've had a strange journey,"" Tyrion says to the creepy goth kid who can see through time and supplant the consciousness of wildlife — two skills he honed via the mentorship of Max von Sydow, the half-tree wizard. ""I'd like to hear about it."" The scene cuts away then, leaving us to wonder if Bran told Tyrion about his own story alone, or shared some spicy tidbits about the real identity of Jon Snow.
More battle prep. Missandei and Grey Worm make plans for a beach vacation; Jon, Sam and Dolorous Edd (plus Jon's dire wolf Ghost!) brood on the battlements, giving the show yet another opportunity to mash the ""Gilly and little Sam will be SAFE DOWN IN THE CRYPTS"" button. ""Think back to where we started,"" says Sam, transforming the episode's subtext into text.
In the Great Hall of Winterfell, Tyrion and Jaime drink by the fireplace and reflect on how much they've grown as people. They are joined by Brienne, Podrick, Davos and Tormund. (No Varys, though, which seems like criminal oversight.) Tormund flirts a bit, tells a story about how he got the name Giantsbane (it's what you guessed, pretty much) and demonstrates the kind of table manners that you'd imagine someone who's lived most of his life without tables would possess.
Arya meets the Hound and Beric Dondarrion on the Battlements of Brooding, and once again the series reminds us how far these characters have come — which suggests that some or all of them won't make it through next week's battle. I'm thinking Beric's Done -darrion, at the very least.
Gendry finds Arya in a kind of storage room and gives her the weapon she asked him to build for her. The two of them catch up with each other, and then they really catch up with each other. Like, horizontally. Sweatily. And if you've recently binged every episode in preparation for this final season, and 13-year-old, Season 1 Maisie Williams is fresh in your mind, you will be forgiven for turning your eyes from the screen during this bit.
Knight moves
Back at the Fireside Chat, Tyrion is drunk. Like, ""You know bros I think we actually might live through the hordes of ice zombies led by Death himself"" drunk.
There follows a scene between Jaime and Brienne that is fueled by, and comments on, and enriches, their complicated history together: Jaime knights Brienne of Tarth. If you can, watch this scene again, and notice just how much Gwendoline Christie is serving you — the tiniest quiver of her lips, at just the right moment, the eyes that glisten but never quite well up. So much passes between them: strength, gratitude, awe, respect, love. When it's done, everyone applauds, because, I mean ... wouldn't you?
Lyanna Mormont refuses to be sent to the crypts ""where it's safe"" (Hey, show? We get it) by her cousin Jorah, because of course she does. Sam presents Jorah with his family's Valyrian steel sword, which is called Heartsbane. (He does not tell Jorah the story of how it got the name Heartsbane; one assumes it has nothing to do with anyone suckling at anyone else's teat.)
Then Podrick sings a sad song that will put you in the mind of that moment in The Return of the King when the Steward of Gondor orders Pippin to do some emo cabaret while he eats his dinner loudly and slurpily. This turns into a quick montage of our cast of players (including Sansa and Theon, making googly eyes at one another over steaming cups of tea, so goodbye Theon it's been real) that concludes in the Winterfell crypts, which look, not for nothing, just really quite remarkably safe.
Jon is staring at the tomb of his mother, Lyanna Stark. Daenerys approaches him, and he spills the I'm-secretly-a-king-oh-also-we've-been-doing-an-incest beans. She doesn't accept it — because why would she — but Jon is firm. As it were.
Look, it's no secret that the scenes between Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington haven't exactly lit up the screen with big hot sexytime electricity. The show needs them to have it, though, and plows on as if they do — but now that the secret's out, that disconnect will likely fall away. Because the truth is their onscreen chemistry always felt more familial than intended, so at least now we're all on the same page.
Just before Jon can tell Daenerys what his intentions are re: the Iron Throne, the war horns sound, conveniently enough: White Walkers have been sighted.
White Riders , technically, I suppose, as we get our first and only special effects shot of the episode — a horde of those pasty, icy, long-haired Edgar-Winter-looking zombies massing before Winterfell. No sign of the undead dragon, or the Night King himself, however. He's still in the latrine, presumably, because lord knows he hasn't been getting enough Bran. Though that's about to change. "

Jason Martin has been writing songs about the blessings and futility of time since he was rocking a pair of mutton chops and wearing guitar feedback like a velvet cloak. As the heavy shoegaze of 1994's Silver and 1995's Gold morphed through several iterations of his rock band Starflyer 59 , each showcasing a richer hue of Martin's unmistakable songwriting, his candid sense of self evolved in time. ""It's been 25 since I wrote 'Blue Collar Love,'"" he sings about one of those early songs on Starflyer 59's 15th album, Young in My Head . ""Man, I need to go / I had my turn / Stayed longer than most.""
Even as Starflyer 59 has transformed itself from shoegaze to hard rock to dream-pop to New Wave to post-punk and beyond, the essentials remain the same 25 years later: reliable chord changes, fuzzy and clean guitar tones, unfussy but sterling guitar solos. ""I'm kind of an oddly nostalgic person,"" Martin told NPR in 2016 . ""I don't like change."" That's especially been true of the records he's released in the past decade — The Changing of the Guard , IAMACEO , Slow — which not only rely on a leaner rock-and-roll palette, but also look back on a steady career just below the radar, and a life mixed with equal parts triumph and regret.
Young in My Head channels much of the music of Jason Martin's youth. There's the detached, chiming noise-pop cool of The Jesus and Mary Chain threading throughout the title track, with the guitar solo echoing the bopping melody. The Smiths ' forlorn swoon is all over ""Hey, Are You Listening,"" as longtime collaborator TW Walsh decorates the edges with ambient synths. And, because music becomes so ingrained in a person's DNA, textures and hooks from The Cure , New Order and Daniel Amos all swim through the bloodstream of new songs that, ultimately, can only sound like Starflyer 59. ""Cry,"" in particular, layers jangly rhythm guitar, a lounge-y motif and a hazy girl-group-inspired chorus for a sturdy rock song that ends in a fantastical feast reminiscent of Americana 's most opulent, extended bliss-outs .
But even as Jason Martin sings about melancholy endings — ""The thought of getting too old / Well, it makes me want to cry"" and ""Moving on and moving forward 'cause I know someday / I know someday I'll be gone,"" and lines referencing the final days of both Starflyer 59 and his own life — there's a Samuel Beckett-ian thrust to Young in My Head . In ""Remind Me,"" the same song that references a much younger, greener Martin, he sings, ""I wanna work with my kid / Record all of his songs / 'Cause mine are all gone."" That's not just a sentimental line; his 16-year-old son, Charlie, plays drums on the whole record. Jason Martin goes on with the tedium of life — of making music, of continuing Starflyer 59 — because his son goes on."
"News Brief: Sri Lanka Explosions, Mueller Report, Climate Education : NPR",www.npr.org,David Greene,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875232/news-brief-sri-lanka-explosions-mueller-report-climate-education,"A curfew is lifted the day after Sunday blasts killed nearly 300 people. Trump's team appeared on Sunday talk shows to attack Mueller's report. A new NPR poll spotlights climate change education.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
The death toll in Sri Lanka is going up after a series of coordinated blasts hit churches and luxury hotels across that country on Easter Sunday.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Yeah, 290 people have now been confirmed dead and about 500 or more were injured. No one is claiming responsibility for the attacks, but the country's defense minister has described this violence as a terrorist attack carried out by religious extremists. These attacks are the most violent since Sri Lanka's long civil war came to a close 10 years ago. U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Alaina Teplitz spoke to NPR's Weekend Edition in the hours after the attacks.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
ALAINA TEPLITZ: The efforts to try and overcome, you know, a history of strife through 30 years of brutal civil war has been tremendous. There's still a lot more progress that needs to be made, though. It's a sad day for a country trying to overcome this history.
MARTIN: Freelance journalist Lisa Fuller is in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, and she joins us now. Lisa, I guess the first question we should ask is, what else do we know about who might be responsible for this? I mean, as David mentioned, the country's defense minister says it's a terrorist attack by religious extremists. Do we know anything more?
LISA FULLER: So for most of the last two days, we were getting a lot of conflicting information. But just within the last hour, the minister of health went on TV and said that they know who carried out the attack - a group called the National (ph) Thawahid Jaman, which is a Muslim group that is a Sri Lankan group, but he said they also have international ties.
And the information for why they can - why we had so much conflicting data was that the prime minister was kept out of the security briefings. So it seems like there's a pretty big split within the government right now, and that's sort of responsible for the mixed messages.
MARTIN: So we noted that Sri Lanka has been beset by all kinds of violence - civil war, brutal war - but it ended 10 years ago. Was there a religious element to that conflict, or are the attacks that we saw on Easter - is that something new?
FULLER: I think the attacks we saw on Easter are something new. The civil war had sort of a religious element on one side - so it was the Sinhala Buddhist majority against the Tamil - separatist group from the Tamil minority. So sort of - there was this idea of Sri Lanka having to be a Buddhist state from the majority, but on the other side, it was more about autonomy. But as far as the religious element of this, it's still becoming clearer, and it definitely doesn't look anything like the war.
MARTIN: It's my understanding a relative of yours was actually right outside one of the churches when the explosion happened, the one on that church. Can you tell us what happened?
FULLER: Yeah. My sister-in-law was parking her motorcycle outside of the church in Batticaloa, which is in eastern Sri Lanka, when the blast went off. So she wasn't hurt, but there were children that were sort of thrown out by the blast, sort of right next to her. So yeah, she was pretty close by.
MARTIN: The death toll is rising - approximately 500 more are injured. What are you learning about the victims?
FULLER: From - I mean, that there - I was at the hospital yesterday. You had some tourists and foreigners, as well as, you know, mostly locals; I think it's a very wide variety of people. So we have the - obviously, Christians were targeted at the church, but the restaurants were targeted at the hotel, so that was a pretty big mix of people that you saw there.
MARTIN: Right, a lot of tourists, foreign tourists. It appears there may have been indications that - of the risk, some kind of security threat. What are we learning about that?
FULLER: So that's the information that's now coming out, that basically there was a lapse in government, wherein they in fact did have warning, but that that warning was not passed to others, and therefore, it did not get to the public.
MARTIN: Lisa Fuller, freelance journalist based in Sri Lanka. Thank you so much.
FULLER: Thanks for having me.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
MARTIN: OK. First, there was the waiting for the Mueller report, then the release of the redacted Mueller report, and now the fallout from the Mueller report.
GREENE: Right. And that fallout includes some very different interpretations of that report. Democrats now have even more questions. The White House is looking to have it both ways - they're claiming that the Mueller report was rigged but also insisting that it exonerates President Trump of any wrongdoing, despite the many troubling details about his behavior in it.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
RUDY GIULIANI: They tried very, very hard to create a case that the president was involved in Russian whatever - couldn't do it.
KELLYANNE CONWAY: The Mueller report itself says that there was no interference.
GUILIANI: There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.
CONWAY: This has been a frustrated president about an ill-conceived, illegitimate investigation from the beginning.
GREENE: The voices there - the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, also senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, appearing on ""Fox News Sunday,"" ABC's ""This Week"" and CNN's ""State of the Union.""
MARTIN: Well, we have NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith with us. She's also a host of the NPR Politics Podcast. Hey, Tam.
TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey.
MARTIN: So the president's supporters attacking the Mueller report; at the same time, leaning on its conclusions to say the president did nothing wrong.
KEITH: That's right, and that is more or less what you'd expect (laughter). I mean, you know, take what you can get. One interesting thing is that they've really been focusing on the idea of what is prosecutable. And for instance, Rudy Giuliani on CNN saying, hey, this isn't what prosecutors look at; morality isn't what they look at. There is nothing legally wrong here - a lot of emphasis on the law, rather than on what is right or wrong...
MARTIN: Right or wrong, right.
KEITH: ...In sort of a broader sense.
MARTIN: Ethics and morality are one thing; criminality is a different standard.
KEITH: Exactly.
MARTIN: So what about the Democrats? Because Nancy Pelosi is holding a conference call today with her caucus. What are they considering?
KEITH: They are considering what to do next. And there is a big challenge that several prominent Democrats have talked about - prominent congressional Democrats - which is that, although some people would like to talk about impeachment, many of these prominent Democrats in Congress say, that's great, but the Senate will never convict because Republicans control the Senate. And so they feel like they're sort of stuck, and they're trying to figure out how to proceed.
MARTIN: Because even the Democrats who want this will make the argument that it's just important symbolically, even if the Senate won't approve.
KEITH: Yeah, and those that want it say a message needs to be sent about what is right and what a presidential candidate and then a president should do in office - how they should comport themselves - saying that the idea of abuse of power, which many of these Democrats see in that report, that that can't continue, can't be allowed.
MARTIN: And what about the 2020 presidential contenders?
KEITH: They are mostly quiet on this or trying to dodge, though Senator Elizabeth Warren has come out in favor of impeachment.
MARTIN: All right. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Tam, we appreciate it. Thanks.
KEITH: You're welcome.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
MARTIN: It is Earth Day today, and NPR has a new poll out this morning with Ipsos that highlights a big gap between what people hope to see from climate change education and what they're actually getting.
GREENE: Yeah, wanting and doing are two different things. Most Americans, according to the poll, believe their kids should be learning about climate change in school, and teachers agree with that, but more than half of teachers say they are not covering this in their classes.
MARTIN: So how come? We're going to ask Anya Kamenetz of NPR's education team. Hi, Anya.
ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel.
MARTIN: All right, tell us more about what you found in the survey.
KAMENETZ: So the vast majority of people, 4 out of 5, support teaching children about climate change - and that crosses party lines, by the way - and 65% of respondents also don't think that you should need parents' permission to teach this subject, even though it is controversial. Eighty-six percent of teachers - even more than parents - say, yes, we should teach about climate change, and dozens of states have science standards that at least mention the topic. But we found more than half of teachers say they do not personally cover it in their own classes.
MARTIN: Why? I mean, do they just not see it - well, you just said that they do see it as a priority. So explain that contradiction.
KAMENETZ: Right. So you know, 65% of them said, you know, it's not my subject area. And of course, most teachers are overburdened, they're overworked; most teachers are not high school or middle school science teachers. However, there may be something else at work here.
So Mallory Newall from Ipsos, which conducted the poll for us, says that there were key attitudinal differences, key differences in outlook between teachers who cover climate change and those who don't.
MALLORY NEWALL: For some teachers, that might just be a way to rationalize why they're not talking about it.
KAMENETZ: For example, she said that the teachers who don't talk about climate change were less likely to believe that it was a serious threat and were less comfortable answering students' questions about it. Having said that, we also did a callout to our own audience, and we heard from teachers from Florida to Hawaii that are covering the topic in their classes, and that includes all levels and all subjects - I mean, preschool teachers, English teachers, Spanish, home ec - and, for example, Rebecca Meyer, who's an eighth grade English teacher in the Bronx. And she covered it by assigning her students a novel about water scarcity called ""Not A Drop To Drink.""
REBECCA MEYER: They were very engaged. I mean, they loved it. They learned so much that they didn't know.
KAMENETZ: So one additional wrinkle is that almost a third of teachers told us that when talking about something like climate, they are worried about parent pushback.
MARTIN: So is that happening? Are parents pushing back?
KAMENETZ: Well, not really. I mean, you would be surprised. In some areas, of course - there are places where a lot of people work in the oil industry, for example. But on the other hand, 84% of parents of kids under 18 told us, yes, kids should be learning about climate change. But then we heard this other weird divide where just 45% of those parents say, yes, I speak to my own kids about this topic.
Yeah. So, like, Laine Fabijanic - she's a mother of three in Glenwood, Colo. - she says she's concerned about climate change. You know, there's a ski industry - lack of snow in the winter there. Her family recycles. They eat local and organic. They're even putting solar panels on the house. But she says, you know, she has not mentioned the big picture to her young daughters, who are in elementary school, and actually, now that we asked, she's wondering why she hasn't really brought it up with them.
MARTIN: Very interesting. Anya Kamenetz of NPR's education team. Anya, happy Earth Day.
KAMENETZ: Thanks, Rachel; you, too.

Ralph Freso/Getty Images Ralph Freso/Getty Images A sign directs voters to a polling station on Nov. 8, 2016, in Cave Creek, Arizona. The state is one of several considering new voting laws that could make it more complicated to vote in 2020.
Ralph Freso/Getty Images After high turnout in last year's midterm elections propelled Democrats to a new House majority and big gains in the states, several Republican-controlled state legislatures are attempting to change voting-related rules in ways that might reduce future voter turnout.
In Texas, state lawmakers are considering adding criminal penalties for people who improperly fill out voter registration forms. Arizona Republicans are proposing new voting rules that could make it more complicated to cast an early ballot. In Tennessee, GOP lawmakers are considering a bill that would fine groups involved in voter registration drives that submit incomplete forms.
Politics Georgia Governor Signs Law Addressing Some Criticisms Of Contested 2018 Election Republican lawmakers in those states say new laws are needed to maintain the integrity of voter rolls and prevent fraud. Voting rights advocates and Democrats dismiss those claims and argue that the policies are designed to dampen turnout among younger, nonwhite and poorer voters, who are less likely to back Republicans.
If enacted, these proposals could have an impact on future elections, especially in Arizona and Texas, where demographic and political trends are making both states more competitive on the national level for the first time in decades.
Last fall, Arizona Republicans saw their total control of all statewide offices shattered by surging Democratic turnout , losing four of nine statewide races — including a U.S. Senate seat. Democrats view the state's other Senate seat as one of their best pickup opportunities in 2020. In Texas, record turnout helped Democrats flip two congressional and 12 state legislative seats — not to mention come closer than they have in decades in the Senate race. While Tennessee wasn't ultimately competitive in 2018, there was a surge of newly registered voters in the Democratic strongholds of Memphis and Nashville.
Politics House Passes Extensive Election And Campaign Finance Overhaul Bill The bills in Republican-controlled states that could curb voting come as many Democratic-run states are heading further in the opposite direction by expanding access to early and absentee voting and adopting automatic voter registration (several traditionally Republican states have also adopted automatic voter registration).
""We are seeing both the good and bad side of the fallout of the 2018 election,"" said Danielle Lang, co-director of the voting rights and redistricting program at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center.
Enlarge this image Democrats saw a major increase in voter turnout in Texas last year. Now, in the name of combating voter fraud, the Republican-controlled state legislature is looking at a new law that could increase criminal penalties for those who don't fill out voter registration forms properly. Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images Democrats saw a major increase in voter turnout in Texas last year. Now, in the name of combating voter fraud, the Republican-controlled state legislature is looking at a new law that could increase criminal penalties for those who don't fill out voter registration forms properly.
Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images Texas: from misdemeanor to felony
Texas Senate Bill 9 — which was recently approved by the state Senate and is under consideration by the legislature — would make it a felony, punishable by jail time, for anyone who provides false information on a voter registration form or casts a ballot when they are ineligible, even if it's by mistake.
Politics Ahead Of The 2018 Election, Texas AG Ramps Up Voter Fraud Prosecutions Voting groups in the state say they are concerned this effort could result in jail time for people who don't properly fill out their voter registration forms. Currently, providing false information on an application is a misdemeanor.
""If Senate Bill 9 passes, a person who makes a simple mistake — puts the wrong ZIP code on a voter registration card — could be prosecuted, fined and even put in jail,"" said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, which registers young voters, among other things.
She described the bill as ""one of the most strict voter suppression laws in the country,"" noting that Texas is already one of the most difficult states in which to register voters and that the proposed new penalties could make it even harder.
Politics Texas Officials Begin Walking Back Allegations About Noncitizen Voters This latest push to tighten Texas' voting laws comes months after Texas election officials launched a troubled effort to remove alleged noncitizens from the state's voter rolls .
The bill's sponsor, state Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Republican from rural east Texas, says the point of the bill is not to crack down on people who ""inadvertently check a wrong box."" He says the point is to make sure local prosecutors ""are prioritizing these crimes.""
""This bill is aimed at people who are intentionally cheating,"" Hughes says. ""This is not to catch people who make an honest mistake.""
Cases of intentional voter fraud are rare in Texas — in many instances in which authorities have prosecuted someone, the people being prosecuted said they did not realize they were ineligible to vote.
Voting rights lawyers are also concerned about the bill's increased criminal penalties for those who cast a ballot — including a provisional ballot — when they are ineligible to vote.
Provisional ballots were created by federal law to allow people to vote if they aren't sure they can, and a provisional ballot is counted only once election officials determine that the voter who submitted it is eligible. Provisional ballots are often used when eligible voters are erroneously not included in their state's voter roll.
Senate Bill 9 undermines that federal protection, said James Slattery, a staff attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project.
""It would assume that if you knew the facts that made you ineligible to vote, even if you didn't know the law, casting that provisional ballot would essentially make you a criminal,"" he said.

Tennessee's legislature is considering a bill that would impose hefty financial penalties on groups that register voters if they submit too many improperly filled out forms.
Alex Wong/Getty Images Tennessee: ""We have never seen a bill like this""
In Tennessee, Republican lawmakers point to a surge of incomplete voter registration forms submitted in Memphis and Nashville during the run-up to the 2018 midterms as the motivation behind that state's legislation.
Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins said that under the state's current law, county election commissions are obligated to track down and verify incomplete registration forms.
""This is only going after folks that create chaos intentionally or knowingly,"" Goins told member station WPLN .
Elections Voters Approve Major Changes To Redistricting And Other Voting Laws The measure, which already passed in the state's House , is backed by Goins. It proposes fines of up to $10,000 for groups that pay people and that submit more than 500 incomplete forms, with lower penalties for fewer incomplete registration forms.
But for people who ""intentionally and knowingly"" submit incomplete forms, the bill suggests they could face misdemeanor charges.
The legislation would also require groups to turn in the forms within 10 days of the registration drive and would require training for people conducting voter registrations of over 100 people. Groups also wouldn't be allowed to pay campaign workers per registration form.
The risk of fines could deter people from organizing registration drives, said Tequila Johnson, the co-founder of the Equity Alliance, who said the bill is an attack on organizations like hers that focus on registering people of color.
""We have never seen a bill like this on the floor, until we dared to register 86,000 black and brown people to vote,"" Johnson said at a news conference in Nashville. ""This screams racism.""

Arizona is considering major changes to popular early voting rules, which could affect some 200,000 voters.
Ralph Freso/Getty Images Arizona: ""This is a service — it's a convenience""
The changes that Arizona Republicans are considering would focus on registered voters who have signed up to cast mail-in ballots but don't use them.
The bill would remove some people from what's called the Permanent Early Voting List. People on the PEVL get ballots mailed to them so they can mail the ballots back or drop them off on Election Day.
But Republican state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita wants counties to purge people from that list if they don't vote using an early ballot in two consecutive election cycles .
""We want to make sure that the lists are up to date. That's just good practice. That makes sense on, frankly, any kind of database that you have,"" she told a House committee. ""That you're really communicating with those who want to be communicated with and that are using the service. This is a service — it's a convenience.""
Politics Partisan Election Officials Are 'Inherently Unfair' But Probably Here To Stay Local election officials say that they already have ways to maintain clean voting rolls and that the proposed legislation will simply confuse voters. The Arizona secretary of state's office estimates that 200,000 voters currently on the early voting list did not vote in both 2016 and 2018. But the office also said the bill's language is unclear, making it hard to assess its potential impact.
Democratic Rep. Athena Salman called it voter suppression to purge the PEVL.
""There is a great debate around whether or not it is 'peh-vl' or 'pee-vl.' But I find it fitting that if this bill passes, the list will no longer be 'permanent,' and so one might call it 'evil,' "" she said.
Republicans dispute that this is an attempt to make voting more difficult. The bill doesn't remove people from the registration rolls, just the mailing list for early ballots.
Republican lawmakers have proposed other bills this legislative session that have drawn criticism from voting rights groups, including one that bans paying workers for each voter registration form they turn in.
""All Americans care about election integrity""
This latest round of legislation lands after a decade-long push by state-level Republicans for strict voter ID laws around the United States. Those laws were criticized by voting rights advocates for adding obstacles to casting a ballot that would particularly harm nonwhite and poor voters, although a recent academic study suggests the laws have had ""no negative impact on registration or turnout.""
Politics Georgia Set To Remain A Battleground For Voting Rights Ahead Of 2020 The stated basis that Republican lawmakers gave for many of those laws was to reduce the incidence of in-person voter fraud. Repeated research has unveiled scant evidence of anything more than a small number of instances of voters attempting to cast multiple ballots. But the repeated message that voter fraud was rampant has become a powerful motivator for Republican campaigns to turn out their own voters. Likewise, Democrats have also used potential threats to voting access to mobilize their own supporters.
But the impact of that push has been to increase partisanship and conflict around voting, the centerpiece of a democratic system.
Lawmakers often reexamine voting laws after an election, said Lang, of the Campaign Legal Center. For example, there was a bipartisan push from Iowa's Republican governor to make it easier for felons to restore their right to vote after release, although it ultimately failed. And Kansas, which had been ground zero for fights about election laws for years, recently passed a bipartisan voting law that will make it more convenient to cast a ballot.
""All Americans care about election integrity, and yet these issues get framed in very unhelpful partisan ways,"" Lang said.

Mueller Report Still Attracts Attention From Both Sides Of The Aisle : NPR,www.npr.org,Tamara Keith,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875239/mueller-report-still-attracts-attention-from-both-sides-of-the-aisle,"The White House spent the weekend on television, insisting that special counsel Robert Mueller's report exonerates President Trump. At the same time, Democrats are discussing their next steps.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So first there was the waiting for the Mueller report, then the release of the redacted Mueller report, and now we have the fallout from the Mueller report. And this fallout includes a lot of different interpretations. Democrats now have even more questions, a lot of questions. The White House is really looking to have it both ways. They're claiming the Mueller report was rigged. They're also insisting that it exonerates Donald Trump, even though the report says the opposite.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
RUDY GIULIANI: They tried very, very hard to create a case that the president was involved in Russian whatever. Couldn't do it.
KELLYANNE CONWAY: The Mueller report itself says that there was no interference.
GUILIANI: There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.
CONWAY: The president is not going to jail. He's staying in the White House for 5 1/2 more years.
GREENE: All right. We heard there the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, also senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, on ""Fox News Sunday,"" ABC's ""This Week"" and CNN's ""State Of The Union."" I'm joined by NPR White House correspondent and host of the NPR Politics Podcast Tamara Keith. Hi, Tam.
TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi.
GREENE: So the president's team - I mean, is this a love-hate relationship with the Mueller report? What are they saying here?
KEITH: Yeah. I think that they are looking at a couple of different things. They are both talking about, legally, the president was not indicted on anything. So they're saying, look, clean bill of health, on the law. You know, Mueller did not find anything that was prosecutable. And then they're also saying, but, hey, this report has a lot of stuff in it that is negative and could be embarrassing to the president, like a bunch of his subordinates not doing what he told them to do. And so the report, they say, is rigged or various other terms. The president used a term that we can't repeat on the radio to describe the report.
GREENE: So they're basically saying, I mean, the law is what's important, ignore the morality and ethics and other things that may have come up with this behavior.
KEITH: Quite literally. Rudy Giuliani, on CNN, said, morality, that isn't what prosecutors look at. So they are very much focused on the law. Democrats, on the other hand, are going to be focused, as they continue to hold hearings and do the investigations that they've already started, they're going to be looking at things about, like, what is right and wrong, what example to set, whether there was abuse of power and other things that aren't illegal but may be questionable.
GREENE: And they have - the House Democrats have what sounds like a pretty important conference call, maybe to talk about strategy, this morning. What are they thinking about?
KEITH: Well, they are considering how to proceed. Several top Democrats have said in the last several days since the Mueller report came out, hey, there's a lot of stuff in here that we're very concerned about. We don't want to set a precedent that it's OK for a president to, you know - for a campaign to accept help from a foreign adversary or for a president to want to shut down investigations and order people to shut down an investigation.
But on the other hand, they're saying impeachment would be the course. But how do you proceed on impeachment? That's their concern because they say the Senate certainly wouldn't convict. So is it a political folly to move in that direction?
GREENE: Although, some Democrats saying it's worth it no matter what the Senate would do, I mean, because the important role that they feel they'd play, which really speaks to the moment for Democrats in terms of what to do next. Is this a good campaign issue? I mean, are they talking about it on the campaign trail?
KEITH: They aren't talking about it much on the campaign trail. Elizabeth Warren did bring it up, said that she thought that they should move to impeachment. But many other candidates are keeping their distance in part, they say, because they aren't hearing a lot from voters about demands for impeachment.
GREENE: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Tam, thanks.
KEITH: You're welcome.

When the United Kingdom voted for Brexit nearly three years ago, some thought it might mark the beginning of the end of the European Union. But a Brexit domino theory has remained just that.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
So when the United Kingdom voted for Brexit nearly three years ago, some thought it might mark the beginning of the end of the European union; instead, it is the U.K. itself that has descended into political chaos, and now many other countries in Europe see Brexit as a cautionary tale. Here's NPR's Frank Langfitt.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: After the 2016 Brexit referendum, many wondered if France, the Netherlands or Italy might follow the U.K.'s lead.
(SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: After the Brexit, is a Frexit (ph) possible?
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Recent polls show half of Dutch voters want a referendum on EU membership.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Will we see the end of the EU as we know it?
LANGFITT: But a Brexit domino theory has remained just that. Isabell Hoffman tracks opinion in the EU for Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German independent foundation. She says Brexit hasn't hurt the EU's standing; it's actually helped it.
ISABELL HOFFMAN: We do see a Brexit effect in the numbers when it comes to support for the European Union, actually. They go up in a significant manner, and they stay up ever since.
LANGFITT: Hoffman says support is up 10 percentage points since the referendum.
HOFFMAN: Which means that there are now roughly 70% of people who'd say, we would vote for our country to stay in the European Union.
LANGFITT: The EU's a political union and trading bloc of 28 nations. Observers say more people are rallying to support it these days because it's under siege, and they're wary of leaving because the Brexit process has been a disaster. George Papaconstantinou, who served as Greece's finance minister, says much of Europe has watched Brexit play out with horror.
GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU: With disbelief, astonishment - a country which prides itself as having an extremely robust parliamentary system suddenly finds itself completely adrift.
LANGFITT: He says the chaos has served as a warning to other countries that might want to follow Britain's path.
PAPACONSTANTINOU: The whole process of Brexit being so complicated, so difficult, made people realize that you don't leave the EU so easily.
LANGFITT: Euroskeptic parties in France, the Netherlands and Sweden have since backed off calls for Frexit, Nexit (ph) or Swexit (ph) referenda and focused on changing the EU from inside. In the last decade, the EU has weathered an immigration and a financial crisis. Papaconstantinou, who spoke over Skype, says some people appreciate it more these days.
PAPACONSTANTINOU: It's much more than just fearing the divorce. I think that there is a shift in attitudes of people actually believing in some kind of a common destiny in a way that they didn't five years ago.
LANGFITT: But the European Union continues to face big problems - economic growth is slowing, the population is aging, and its critics are gaining more political power.
MATTHEW GOODWIN: I think you can make a convincing case for why the challenges to the EU have gained momentum.
LANGFITT: Matthew Goodwin is a professor of politics at the University of Kent.
GOODWIN: Populism is a bigger issue today for Europe than it was in 2016. We've got populists running Italy, which also happens to be the third-largest economy in the eurozone. You've got breakthroughs for similar parties in Sweden, now Spain, Germany, Austria, now Estonia.
LANGFITT: Goodwin says the EU has the upper hand now, and the Brexit mess has strengthened it. But he thinks the long-term success of the European Union is far from certain.

When Is Snoring A Sign Of A Serious Health Issue? : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Allison Aubrey,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/22/714249236/beyond-annoying-how-to-identify-the-sounds-of-a-troublesome-snore,"
When is a snore just annoying and when is it a sign of sleep apnea? Luckily, they sound pretty different. Aleksandra Shutova / EyeEm/Getty Images/EyeEm hide caption toggle caption Aleksandra Shutova / EyeEm/Getty Images/EyeEm When is a snore just annoying and when is it a sign of sleep apnea? Luckily, they sound pretty different. Aleksandra Shutova / EyeEm/Getty Images/EyeEm
An estimated 40% of adults in the U.S. snore . And, men, you tend to out-snore women. (Yes, this may explain why you get kicked or shoved at night!)
And despite the myth that snoring is a sign of deep sleep, there's really no upside to it.
""Snoring really does not demonstrate anything good, "" says Erich Voigt , an ear, nose, and throat doctor and sleep specialist at New York University Langone Health. ""You can have beautifully deep sleep in a silent sleep.""
Snoring is never great news, but often it's harmless (other than the pain your sleeping partner may feel). In some cases, though, it's a sign of something serious.
When we sleep, if the air that moves through our nose and mouth has a clear passage, we can sleep silently. But when the airways are narrowed, we snore.
""Snoring is basically a vibration of the tissues inside of the airway,"" Voigt explains — that is, the roof of the mouth and the vertical folds of tissue that surround the tonsils.
A lot of factors can contribute to snoring, says Voigt. We can control some of the underlying triggers. For instance, drinking alcohol is linked to snoring. Alcohol tends to make the tissues within our mouths swell a bit, and alcohol can also change the quality of sleep.
""Your brain is sedated from alcohol, so the combination can make you snore worse,"" Voigt says.
Being overweight can also increase the likelihood of snoring. So, when people lose weight, this can reduce the amount they snore.
Other factors that contribute to snoring may be outside our control. There are physical obstructions, such as a large uvula or a deviated septum. In addition, allergies and upper respiratory infections can cause the tissues in the roof of the mouth to become floppy, swollen, or stretched out, Voigt says.
When is snoring just annoying and when is it a sign of a potentially serious problem? A light, rhythmic snore — that stays pretty steady — is common and tends to be harmless. ""It might be bad for the bed partner, but it's not a big health problem,"" Voigt says.
But when snoring becomes loud and erratic, this can signal a problem. So, if you're concerned about the person you sleep with, what should you listen for?
""A crescendo where the snoring is getting louder and louder,"" Voigt explains, is the first sign. The crescendo is typically followed by periods of no sound, and then a gasp that can sound like a snort.
This pattern of snoring can be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea , which is a serious condition that can increase the risk of heart disease. What happens to people with this condition is that the airway will collapse in on itself and close. ""And as the person is trying to breathe in, the air will not pass. That's what the apnea is,"" Voigt explains.
You can watch and listen to this YouTube video for a good demonstration of the sounds made by someone with sleep apnea. What Snores To Listen Out For Listen to what normal snoring sounds like at the beginning of this video. At minute 1:10 you can hear the snoring and gasping that is characteristic of sleep apnea. David Oleniacz Videos YouTube
""During the first minute he has regular rhythmic snoring,"" Voigt says. ""Then, in the second minute he has a pause, (apnea) or no breathing, followed by a big gasp for air.""
Often, people with sleep apnea don't wake to consciousness, so they don't know they have a problem. If you sleep with someone who snores, you're in a good position to help flag the issue. Then, it's best to get it checked out by a doctor who can diagnose the problem. "
Climate Change Education Poll: 4 In 5 Parents Want It In Schools : NPR,www.npr.org,Anya Kamenetz,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/714262267/most-teachers-dont-teach-climate-change-4-in-5-parents-wish-they-did,"Angela Hsieh/NPR Angela Hsieh/NPR
More than 80% of parents in the U.S. support the teaching of climate change. And that support crosses political divides, according to the results of an exclusive new NPR/Ipsos poll: Whether they have children or not, two-thirds of Republicans and 9 in 10 Democrats agree that the subject needs to be taught in school.
A separate poll of teachers found that they are even more supportive, in theory — 86% agree that climate change should be taught.
These polls are among the first to gauge public and teacher opinion on how climate change should be taught to the generation that in the coming years will face its intensifying consequences: children. Loading...
Don't see the graphic above? Click here
And yet, as millions of students around the globe participate in Earth Day events on Monday, our poll also found a disconnect. Although most states have classroom standards that at least mention human-caused climate change, most teachers aren't actually talking about climate change in their classrooms. And fewer than half of parents have discussed the issue with their children. Loading...
When it comes to one of the biggest global problems, the default message from older generations to younger ones is silence.
Parents and the general public
Laine Fabijanic, a mother of three living in Glenwood Springs, Colo., says her part of the country is feeling the effects of climate change, from an unusually snowless winter last year to scary fires. She and her family recycle and eat organic; they are even installing solar panels on the house. When The News Is Scary, What To Say To Kids
Still, she says she hasn't talked about the big picture of climate change with her young daughters. ""I don't think we've talked much about it at all,"" she said in an interview. ""Probably because it hasn't come up from them.""
About 3 in 4 respondents in our nationally representative survey of 1,007 Americans agreed that the climate is changing. That figure is in line with previous results from Ipsos and other polls. Loading...
Don't see the graphic above? Click here
Parents are even more likely than the general public to support teaching students thoroughly about climate change, including its effects on our environment, economy and society. Among parents with children under 18, 84% agree that it should be taught in schools. Protests Calling For Climate Action Disrupt London For 3rd Day
A plurality of all parents support starting those lessons as early as elementary school. And though it may be a controversial subject, 65% of those who thought climate change should be taught didn't think parental permission was necessary. Among Republicans, the corresponding figure was 57%.
However, parents like Fabijanic aren't necessarily holding these conversations themselves. Just 45% of parents said they had ever discussed the topic with their own children.
Teachers support teaching climate change more in theory than in practice
If they don't hear about it at home, will kids learn about climate change in school? To answer this question, NPR/Ipsos also completed a nationally representative survey of around 500 teachers. These educators were even more likely than the general public to believe in climate change and to support teaching climate change. Why Science Teachers Are Struggling With Climate Change
In fact, 86% of teachers believe climate change should be taught in schools. In theory.
But in practice, it's more complicated. More than half — 55% — of teachers we surveyed said they do not cover climate change in their own classrooms or even talk to their students about it.
The most common reason given? Nearly two-thirds (65%) said it's outside their subject area. Loading...
Don't see the graphic above? Click here
Let's not forget that teachers are busy, and often underresourced and overworked. When asked to rank the importance of climate change, it fell to near the bottom of a list of priorities for expanding the curriculum, behind science and math, basic literacy and financial education.
Parents seen as obstacles to teaching climate
But there are other factors at work, too, in the decision of whether to cover climate change.
For example, almost a third of all teachers say that when it comes to teaching climate change, they worry about parent complaints. Loading...
In our poll, teachers who do not teach the subject were allowed to choose more than one reason. They named many obstacles. 17% say they don't have the materials. 17% also say they don't know enough about the subject to teach it. 4% say their school does not allow the subject to be taught.
Moreover, there also seems to be a divide in terms of resources, attitudes and support between teachers who cover climate change in their classrooms and those who don't.
Mallory Newall of Ipsos said for some teachers, maintaining that it's not their job to teach climate change ""may just be a way to rationalize why they're not talking about it.""
That's because teachers who do talk about climate change are also more likely to say: There should be state laws that require teaching it (70% versus 38% of teachers who don't talk about climate change). They have the resources they need to answer students' questions about climate change (77% versus 32%). Their students have brought up climate change in the classroom this year (78% versus 14%). Their school encourages them to discuss climate change (64% versus 18%).
In our NPR Ed newsletter , we did a callout to teachers to find out more about how they teach climate change. Some teachers we heard from mentioned the divisiveness of the issue and the difficulty in dealing with students whose parents are deniers of climate change.
""There's so much political jargon around climate change that I would either have to dismiss their concerns that they bring up or burn a lot of time talking about something that is outside my content area,"" said Jack Erickson, a science teacher at Cienega High School in Vail, Ariz., in response to our callout.
Some teachers get creative in teaching climate change
On the other hand, about 42% of teachers in our survey said they are indeed finding ways to address climate change in the classroom.
In our callout, we heard from far more than just science teachers. Preschool, English, public speaking, Spanish, statistics, social studies teachers — even home economics teachers and librarians — all are finding ways to approach the topic. "
"What Are PFAS, And Are They Toxic To Humans And The Environment? : Shots - Health News : NPR",www.npr.org,sports.yahoo.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/22/708863848/scientists-dig-into-hard-questions-about-the-fluorinated-pollutants-known-as-pfa,"Enlarge this image Parts of the Cape Fear River near Fayetteville, N.C., are contaminated with a PFAS compound called GenX. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is surveying residents in the area about their health. Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images Parts of the Cape Fear River near Fayetteville, N.C., are contaminated with a PFAS compound called GenX. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is surveying residents in the area about their health.
Mark Wilson/Getty Images Scientists are ramping up research on the possible health effects of a large group of common but little-understood chemicals used in water-resistant clothing, stain-resistant furniture, nonstick cookware and many other consumer products.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are generally referred to by their plural acronym, PFAS . PFAS are resistant to water, oil and heat, and their use has expanded rapidly since they were developed by companies in the mid-20th century. Today, PFAS' nonstick qualities make them useful in products as diverse as food wrappers, umbrellas, tents, carpets and firefighting foam. The chemicals are also used in the manufacture of plastic and rubber and in insulation for wiring.
In short, they are all around us. And as a result, they've found their way into the soil and, especially in some regions, into our drinking water.
""We're finding them contaminating many rivers, many lakes, many drinking water supplies,"" says Linda Birnbaum , director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program. ""And we're finding them not only in the environment, but we're finding them in people.""
""Essentially everyone has these compounds in our blood,"" she explains.
That's in part because PFAS don't break down easily — a quality that has earned them the nickname ""forever chemicals."" Some varieties have been found to stick around in the human body for years, if not decades. Others accumulate in soil or water, creating a continuous source of exposure.
Despite their ubiquity, however, scientists know relatively little about the health effects of most types of PFAS.
No PFAS legal safety limit yet
""Despite their everyday use, the body of science necessary to fully understand and regulate these chemicals is not yet as robust as it needs to be,"" acknowledged the assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Water, David Ross , at a congressional hearing on PFAS in March.
This year, the EPA signaled that it is considering setting a legal safety limit for some PFAS in drinking water, but it hasn't acted yet.
Meanwhile, public spending on research of the chemicals has gone up. The National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and multiple state university systems have all increased their funding for PFAS studies in recent years.
Enlarge this image The Environmental Protection Agency signaled this year that it is considering setting a safety limit for PFAS in drinking water. Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images The Environmental Protection Agency signaled this year that it is considering setting a safety limit for PFAS in drinking water.
Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images ""We have more and more of our grantees who are looking at PFAS in their studies — both mechanistic studies and animal studies,"" as well as epidemiological studies that analyze large populations, explains Birnbaum. But the work is slow going.
""These are a very broad class of chemicals — probably 5,000 or more — and it seems like new ones are being produced all the time,"" she says.
In most cases, U.S. chemical regulations do not require that companies prove a chemical is safe before they start selling it. It's up to the EPA to determine whether a substance is unacceptably dangerous and under what circumstances, and typically such analyses begin only after public health concerns are raised.
As a result, ""we really don't know much about the great majority of these chemicals,"" says Birnbaum.
One approach that scientists supported by the National Institutes of Health are taking is to analyze hundreds of PFAS varieties at once. The goal is to identify subgroups of PFAS with similar characteristics, so scientists won't have to do a battery of toxicity tests on each individual chemical.
""There's no way that we'll ever be able to test 5,000 or more PFAS,"" Birnbaum explains.
Early studies suggest some health risks
Some of the most large-scale PFAS epidemiology research in the U.S. was conducted by a science panel starting in 2005 as part of a class action lawsuit against the chemical company DuPont. The case alleged that thousands of people in West Virginia and Ohio were hurt by industrial releases of a PFAS chemical called PFOA.
The panel — made up of three career epidemiologists whom both sides of the court case agreed to have evaluate the scientific evidence — found a ""probable link"" between long-term exposure to the chemical and certain medical conditions, such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease.
Additional studies of both humans and rodents have found similar associations.
Environment And Energy Collaborative Decades-Old Chemicals, New Angst Over Drinking Water ""I think we have growing information that at least some members of this class can be problematic,"" says Birnbaum.
Those findings have raised a host of new questions, first about mechanism: How do PFAS chemicals act in the body? It's one thing to see an association between exposure to a substance and disease. It's much more difficult to determine a likely path from chemical exposure to disease symptoms.
""We still don't know the precise molecular ways that they produce toxicity,"" explains Jamie DeWitt , a toxicologist who studies PFAS at East Carolina University.
For example, DeWitt and others have published studies of both humans and rodents that suggest exposure to one PFAS chemical — PFOA — can suppress the body's response to vaccines.
""I'm pretty sure that a type of immune cell called a B cell is involved"" in that suppression, says DeWitt. ""But I don't know why the B cell doesn't produce enough antibody. Is it signaling molecules that say, 'Hey, B cell, make antibody?' Is it something wrong inside the B cell itself? Is it the amount of energy that the B cell has? These are these molecular mechanisms that we're still trying to figure out.""
Knowing those mechanisms for PFOA might help scientists estimate the potential risks of other PFAS that have a similar structure, she says. ""Honestly, I think we're still at the very beginning.""
At the current rate of research, Birnbaum says, it will take about two years to get a basic handle on the toxicity of the whole PFAS group. But there will still be many questions for both scientists and regulators.
""Realizing that these chemicals have escaped into the environment, how are we going to remediate those problems? How are we going to get rid of these chemicals?"" she says.
""A question that we all need to be asking is: What's essential?"" she says. ""Do we really need it? Are there some places where we need to have this class of chemicals to be safe? But if that's the case, we would like them used in closed systems so they don't escape and end up contaminating the whole world.""
Asked to comment on how essential PFAS are, a spokesperson for the FluoroCouncil , part of the main trade group representing chemical companies in the U.S., defended their widespread use in consumer products.
""PFAS are an essential enabling technology that play a vital role in products ranging from lifesaving applications in pacemakers and defibrillators, to the design of lower-emissions automobiles with improved auto safety, to the manufacturing of semiconductors, solar panels and high-performance electronics,"" a spokesperson for the FluoroCouncil wrote in an emailed statement to NPR.
""The vast differences within the PFAS family of chemistry are not immediately obvious to many people,"" the statement continues. ""While some of the names sound the same, PFAS have differing characteristics, formulations, intended uses, and environmental and health profiles.""
Shots - Health News Are Your Pipes Made Of Lead? Here's A Quick Way To Find Out Living with uncertainty
While two years is not very long in the world of basic scientific research, it can feel like an eternity to people who are worried about their health. In response to public concern, some states already are taking action on their own, both to regulate PFAS emissions and exposure and to gather public health information in communities where the water is known to be contaminated.
""For people who live in areas where one of their drinking water sources has a level [of PFAS] that was high enough to raise concern, there's a really strong demand for information,"" says Alissa Cordner , a sociologist at Whitman College and one of the organizers of a nationwide PFAS contamination list .
""There's so much uncertainty around what the scale and the consequences of contamination are,"" she explains, and that uncertainty makes people afraid. ""In terms of individuals wanting to know 'What's in my drinking water?' the testing is still prohibitively expensive.""
And even when scientists or officials test water in a community, the lack of scientific evidence gathered, so far, about PFAS and health makes it difficult for people to know how to react. Most in-home water filters don't remove the chemicals effectively, according to the CDC .
""I think it's confusing, because you have so many chemicals about which we know so little, other than they're a member of this large class,"" says Birnbaum. ""I think that is confusing, but it's also frustrating. So we're trying to address those problems right now."" Regulators, scientists and citizens all agree: Research results can't come soon enough."
France Looks Ahead After The Devastating Fire At Notre Dame,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875305/france-looks-ahead-after-the-devastating-fire-at-notre-dame,"French President Macron is scheduled to give the state of the nation address on Thursday. It was postponed last week after the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So today marks a week since Notre Dame caught fire, and the French cultural minister now says that the cathedral has been stabilized. That fire provided a brief respite for embattled French President Emmanuel Macron as the country came together in shock and worry. But that unity was short-lived. And NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports that Macron must now address the deep divisions in French society.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing in French).
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Notre Dame's displaced congregations celebrated Easter Mass across the Seine river in the much younger 16th-century church of Saint-Eustache, where Louis XIV took his first communion. Outside the church, 23-year-old Parisian Baya Massamba-Wa (ph) says the last week has been crazy.
BAYA MASSAMBA-WA: There is, like, a chaotic atmosphere, you know? I think that it's very strange right now because, you know, it's the Easter celebration. And with Notre Dame burning, the yellow vest movement - it's really difficult to know what is our place now in France. We don't know how to react, really, as young people.
BEARDSLEY: The young IT specialist says she's doing fine but France seems to be tearing apart.
(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)
BEARDSLEY: Yellow vest protesters took to the streets for a 23rd Saturday in a row. In clashes around Paris' Place de la Republique, the protesters threw rocks and bottles. And police responded with tear gas. There were injuries and some 200 arrests. Yellow vester Cedric Demesse (ph) says they feel bad about Notre Dame, but it has nothing to do with their predicament.
CEDRIC DEMESSE: (Through interpreter) We've been in the streets fighting for purchasing power and better lives for five months. And all our president has done is fire on his people for five months. But we will never give up, whether it takes six months, a year or five years.
BEARDSLEY: Demesse says it's pretty disgusting that Notre Dame got a billion euros in just one day while France leaves its homeless in the streets and yellow vesters haven't gotten a penny for their problems. He's talking about the fact that French billionaires like Louis Vuitton's Bernard Arnault quickly donated millions to rebuild the cathedral. That's ignited a raging debate over wealth, inequality and tax deductions, says Christophe Barbier, editorialist with L'Express magazine.
CHRISTOPHE BARBIER: Now there is $1 billion to rebuild. It is wonderful. But we are in France. So immediately, some people say - what? One billion for a church and no money for the poor? There's a problem. And France is this schizophrenic country, able to be in a very strong moment around Notre Dame and to give money and, the morning after (laughter), able to have a battle around the money for Notre Dame.
(SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTS)
UNIDENTIFIED YELLOW VEST PROTESTERS: (Chanting in French).
BEARDSLEY: Saturday's demonstrations turned particularly nasty when some yellow vest demonstrators screamed at police, go kill yourself. The chant was considered below the belt, as 28 police officers have actually committed suicide since the beginning of the year. No one knows why, but stress and overwork are thought to be contributing factors.
Macron is set to address the yellow vest crisis on Thursday in a crucial speech he was supposed to give the night Notre Dame caught fire. Barbier says, so far, Macron has enacted policies to help businesses and those who are already successful. But now he must try to help the working poor.
BARBIER: Emmanuel Macron has to find real solutions for the French people in the next weeks before the summer. If he fails, I think September, October will be a very tough period with a new fire, not in Notre Dame but in all the country.

"Hindu Nationalism, The Growing Trend In India",www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875298/hindu-nationalism-the-growing-trend-in-india,"As India's economy has opened and grown robustly, so has Hindu pride. A lifetime after India cast off colonial rule, it's embracing a new identity and its majority Hindu faith is playing a big part.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The world's biggest democracy, India, is holding elections right now. Voting actually began earlier this month, and it lasts for five weeks. During these elections, we're looking at a big trend in India. As its economy has opened to the world and grown really robustly, so has Hindu pride. Some call it Hindu nationalism. A lifetime after India cast off colonial rule, it is embracing a new identity, and its majority-Hindu faith is a big part of that.
NPR's India correspondent Lauren Frayer joins us now to talk about this theme and also tell us about the story she's going to be bringing us in the coming days. Hi, Lauren.
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Hi there.
GREENE: So can I start with a really basic question? What is Hindu nationalism?
FRAYER: Sure. So Hinduism is the biggest religion in India. Polytheistic. That means that there are many gods. And it's historically been open to embracing of diversity of traditions. About 80 percent of Indians are Hindus. Now, Hindu nationalism is political. It's the idea that the Hindu faith and culture should shape the state and its policies. And the movement has its roots in the 19th century, in opposition to liberal Hindu reformers, colonialism and Christian missionaries.
GREENE: OK. So this is something that started in opposition to something else a long time ago. Why is it on your mind now? Why are we thinking about it?
FRAYER: Because Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a Hindu nationalist. He belongs to a Hindu nationalist political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. And he spent his formative years working for this group called the RSS. Some members call it, like, a Hindu version of the Boy Scouts, focusing on values in civic life. But, you know, they also train with weapons and have participated in anti-Muslim riots. Modi is running for a second term, and many see this election as a real turning point for India. Milan Vaishnav, who directs the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C., says this election will determine...
MILAN VAISHNAV: India's future as a secular republic that embraces pluralism and, you know, kind of adheres to the founders' notion that India's unity is strengthened by its diversity. And over the past five years, we have seen the rise of a Hindu Nationalist Party and the spread of this kind of nationalist ideology.
FRAYER: And that ideology is often at odds with the secularism that is enshrined in India's constitution, the whole system that India has really had since independence from Britain in 1947.
GREENE: So this is really quite a moment in this country. I mean, it's been secular for - I mean, I'm just doing the math - for, like, 70 or so years. Where's this drive to change that coming from?
FRAYER: Right. So let's go back to India's founding - 1947, freedom from the British, India decided to become secular. And here's why. India is so diverse. I mean, there are hundreds of languages, ethnic groups, castes and the founding fathers, among them Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, believed that really only a pluralist democracy could hold such diversity together. Hindu nationalists, though, were really miffed. They wanted a Hindu state, and they didn't get it. And it was actually a Hindu nationalist who, less than a year later, assassinated Gandhi.
And so Gandhi's death sort of shut down this whole debate, and secularism took hold. And now, a lifetime later, the debate is opening up. India elected a Hindu nationalist, Prime Minister Modi. Right now, like, even secular parties are scrambling to brandish their Hindu nationalist cred because it's just so popular with voters.
GREENE: OK. You have a prime minister who's a Hindu nationalist. I mean, Hindu nationalism is now mainstream. This party's been in power for five years. How has India as a country, as a culture, changed?
FRAYER: Beef bans, for example. Cows are sacred to Hindus. I can get a hamburger in my Mumbai neighborhood, but it's buffalo meat. Ayurveda is all the rage. That's food, health and beauty products based on ancient Hindu healing traditions. You know, in the U.S., you've got this wellness craze, Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop. Well, here it's a Hindu wellness industry, and it's absolutely booming. The very map of India is changing. Cities and landmarks with Muslim-sounding names - Allahabad, for example, a city in northern India built by Muslim kings in the 16th century, they've changed its name to Prayagraj, a word that refers to a Hindu holy site there.
I went to that city, and I spoke with Yogeshwar Tiwari. He's the head of the local university history department. And he calls those Muslim kings invaders who forcibly converted Hindus, and he says now history has to be revised.
YOGESHWAR TIWARI: People now certainly feel history has not been presented and narrated and understood in the way that it should have been understood. Every nation goes through course correction.
FRAYER: And that makes Indian Muslims pretty uncomfortable. This is their heritage. One in 6 Indians is Muslim. They're a bigger minority than African-Americans are in the U.S. We're talking about 180 million people here.
GREENE: So if India moves farther and farther away from the secular past, and Hindu identity really takes hold even more, what does that look like? What are the implications?
FRAYER: So some say India could become a Hindu homeland in the way Israel is a homeland for Jews worldwide. In fact, Modi's government has introduced a new citizenship amendment bill that would give Indian citizenship to anybody persecuted in neighboring countries, except if they're Muslim. So India would be using religion as a criteria for citizenship for the first time. Another possible model is Turkey, a secular republic that's seen its majority-Muslim faith brought into public life in a more overt way under Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
GREENE: Well, so you're covering an election right now, and this whole conversation seems very central. I mean, it's really a debate about getting to the heart of who India wants to be. And a lot will ride on whether Prime Minister Modi wins this or not. What do you think? What are the polls suggesting?
FRAYER: So most observers say he will win, and the question is by how much. And that would really determine his mandate to change the country. But it's not just Modi. Tanika Sarkar is a historian, retired from Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, and she says Hindu nationals have grown these really deep roots into Indian society.
TANIKA SARKAR: They have associations among students, trade unions, retired army people. You know, religion, of course, temples. They have penetrated the everyday lives of Hindus in a very big way. Whether they win the election or lose the election, this work will go on.
FRAYER: India's still a young country, 72 years old. It's still really working out who it wants to be. And increasingly, Hindu nationalism is going to be a part of the answer to that.
GREENE: Such interesting stuff. Well, you have me interested in this election very much now. I can't wait to follow your stories as you bring them to us later this week.
FRAYER: Thanks so much, David.
GREENE: Thank you. That's NPR's Lauren Frayer speaking to us this morning from Mumbai.

Is Joe Biden Too Centrist For Today's Democratic Party?,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875291/is-joe-biden-too-centrist-for-todays-democratic-party,"A lot of energy and media coverage of the 2020 Democratic field is focused on the far left-wing. But is that where most Democratic voters are? That's a key question for likely contender Joe Biden.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Here in the United States this week, former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to announce he is running for president. Just one of the many questions about his potential candidacy is whether he is too centrist for today's Democratic Party. Here's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Donald Trump has a theory of the case for the 2020 election - according to his campaign strategists, any Democrat who wins the nomination will have moved so far to the left, they'll be an easy target for the president to disqualify as a Socialist.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism; they want to replace individual rights with total government domination.
LIASSON: And at least right now, the frontrunner in the Democratic race is a self-identified Democratic Socialist.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BERNIE SANDERS: Democratic socialism, to me, is creating a government and an economy and a society which works for all rather than just the top 1%.
LIASSON: One of Bernie Sanders' goals is the textbook definition of socialism - he wants a government takeover of the health insurance industry, ""Medicare for All."" But other Democrats don't want socialism; they just want a stronger social safety net in order to reduce extreme inequality, restore economic mobility and make sure free market capitalism creates broadly shared prosperity. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says that Bernie Sanders may be leading the pack right now, but his brand of democratic socialism isn't embraced by the majority of Democratic primary voters.
CELINDA LAKE: Every single Democrat out there wants to have some kind of guaranteed medical insurance for everyone, and they want it to be affordable. Eighty-three percent want to invest more resources in infrastructure and dealing with climate change. Now, is that a Green New Deal or something else? Is that Medicare for All or something else?
LIASSON: The answer to those questions will be determined next year. Meanwhile, there are a lot of clues that actual Democratic voters may be less liberal than the image created by Donald Trump or the disproportionate media coverage given to the most left-leaning members of Congress. For example, a Gallup poll in December found that 54% of Democrats want their party to be more moderate; a smaller number, 41%, want their party to be more liberal. And, says Lake, there's another important data point about Democratic voters.
LAKE: For the first time, people actually think that the person that they like the best might be different from the person who can most beat Donald Trump. Always before, people kind of pick their person as the person they thought was most electable.
LIASSON: So right now Democratic voters are feeling a lot more pragmatic than they have in the past. And despite all that youthful energy coursing through the party, Celinda Lake points out that in primary states like New Hampshire and South Carolina, a fresh, new face might not be in demand.
LAKE: In all of the early states, about two-thirds of the voters are over 50, and that older electorate likes experience.
LIASSON: J. Ann Selzer, who conducts the Iowa poll, asked Democrats there whether it's important to have a younger candidate. Her poll specifically asked about Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
J ANN SELZER: In both cases, running before and the experience in office won out over saying, the time for either of those candidates has passed. So there is no sense in this poll - and this was done in March - that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are too old.
LIASSON: Biden's allies also have a theory of the case for 2020, and it's the polar opposite of Trump's - Biden's strategists believe the majority of Democratic voters are not living in woke-a-topia (ph). Instead of reflecting the voices of Democratic activists on social media, Biden's aides believe the Democratic voters value experience and pragmatism, and they think it's a good thing - not a bad thing - to work across the aisle. So if Biden's advisers are right, age and ideology won't stop his campaign. But as he's already seen, Biden will have plenty of other obstacles to clear.

Nearly 300 People Are Killed In Easter Sunday Attacks In Sri Lanka,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875277/nearly-300-people-are-killed-in-easter-sunday-attacks-in-sri-lanka,"A curfew has been lifted, the day after a series of explosions hit churches and hotels. David Greene talks to freelance journalist Lisa Fuller in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Coordinated bombings across Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday killed at least 290 people and wounded more than 500 others. These blasts hit luxury hotels as well as churches. The country's health minister confirms that all the suicide bombers were local, but they had the help of an international network. The Archbishop of Colombo spoke after the attacks.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MALCOLM RANJITH: And I ask all our Sri Lankan people not to take the law into their own hands and to maintain peace and harmony in this country.
GREENE: The U.S. State Department, in a revised travel advisory, is warning that terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Sri Lanka. Journalist Lisa Fuller is in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo. Lisa, thanks for taking the time for us this morning.
LISA FULLER: Thanks for having me.
GREENE: So what are we learning about who carried this out?
FULLER: So we have rapidly changing and evolving information. So the health minister gave a press conference saying that the attacks were carried out by a group called the National Thowheeth Jama'ath and that they may have had the assistance of an international network but that they - all of the bombers were Sri Lankan. But at that same time, there was another minister giving a briefing saying that the attacks were carried out by a gang and not an organized outfit. So basically, throughout the last 24 hours, the only thing that is completely clear is that there are divisions within the government. And sort of that lack of coordination may have had something to do with the lapses in security.
GREENE: Who is the group who you did mention, who might have done this?
FULLER: They're not a group that anyone - or not very many people are familiar with. They are purportedly Islamic extremists, but it's not a name that is known well within Sri Lanka.
GREENE: As I understand it, you have a relative who was right outside one of the churches when an explosion there happened. Can you tell me what you've heard from that relative?
FULLER: Yeah. My sister-in-law was parking her motorcycle outside one of the churches, about to go in for the Easter service, when the bomb went off. So yeah, she's safe and fine, but there were children that were sort of thrown from the blast right out in front of her. So it was pretty gruesome in terms of, you know, the bodies and the carnage that she was describing, which I guess is what you expect in attacks like this.
GREENE: Yeah. Well, I'm glad she's OK. These attacks - I mean, this comes - what? - like, 10 years after the civil war in Sri Lanka ended. I mean, are people suggesting this is somehow tied to the forces that were at work in that conflict?
FULLER: So - yeah, it's almost exactly 10 years after - in fact, next month it'll be 10 years. But this violence looks nothing like anything in the civil war. That was fought between the majority Sinhala Buddhist government and a separatist group from the minority Tamil communities. Tamils are Christian and Hindus. And Muslims are not only a separate religion, but they're also a separate ethnic group in Sri Lanka.
So I mean, even after the civil war, there were much lower levels of violence. But this - in terms of scale and in terms of form in Sri Lanka, we haven't seen anything like this in recent history.
GREENE: Journalist Lisa Fuller is in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, on Skype with us this morning. Thanks for your reporting.
FULLER: Thank you.

'Invisibilia' Team Takes A Deep Dive Into The Science Of Desire,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875270/invisibilia-team-takes-a-deep-dive-into-the-science-of-desire,"Most of us have a ""type"" — certain quirks and qualities we're just more into, that pique our sexual desire. But why are we attracted to the people we're attracted to?
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
The fifth season of NPR's podcast Invisibilia just wrapped. And in it, the team drove deep into the science of desire with a story of one young woman who diagnosed a problem with her own sexual attractions - a problem not too many people would be willing to talk about publicly. We are using the first initial of this woman's name to protect her privacy.
Also, a warning - this story may not be suitable for younger listeners. Here's NPR's Yowei Shaw.
YOWEI SHAW, BYLINE: It was 2013. L was a sophomore in college procrastinating yet again on Reddit when she happened upon a thread about sexual attraction. One of the posters was asking people what races they were most sexually attracted to. And L was like, interesting question. And she posted...
L: I'm mostly attracted to white and Asian guys. But, you know, I'd like - I like to be open-minded.
SHAW: L thought nothing of it until someone replied to her comment.
L: Oh, so you won't date brown guys or black guys.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
L: I was just like, oh, like, I think you're mistaken. Like, oh, no. Like, I'm not racist. I said I'm open-minded to dating other people.
SHAW: L was proud to be Chinese American. She was even creating safe spaces online for other Asian American women to process the racism and misogyny they had to deal with every day. So the call-out blindsided her. Until one night, L was lying in bed, swiping on Tinder with her index finger.
L: I started to realize, as I was swiping past faces, I was unconsciously, like, rejecting people because of, like, the color of their skin. And it shook me. It made me feel bad.
SHAW: There's been a lot written about how our sexual attractions are programmed by the culture - what movies we watch, what we learn about race growing up, what our families teach us. So here's my question. Once your racial preferences have been programmed by your cultural bubble, can you change them?
I started calling around to sex researchers. But before I tell you what I found out, one quick note - basically, almost all the researchers I spoke to told me there's a huge difference between something like sexual orientation and racial preference. Sexual orientation is much more biologically based, whereas racial preferences are not written into your genes, not even if you feel a racial preference strongly.
GONZALO QUINTANA ZUNINO: It's kind of sad that people would just say, I just have one type - when they haven't even tried more.
SHAW: Gonzalo Quintana Zunino is a neuroscientist in Canada about to start his postdoc Toronto. He's done several studies, mostly with rats, trying to understand how people might form their partner preferences on the level of skin color or dimples.
And he has an idea about why they could be hard to change. In a recent study, he conditioned rats to develop preferences for perfumed rats and found that the male rats that had all their early sexual experiences with perfumed females...
ZUNINO: They obviously prefer the female that was bearing the scent.
SHAW: But if rats had climaxed for the first time with a non-perfumed rat - even if they went on to have a lot of sex with perfumed partners, the rats did not show a preference for perfume...
ZUNINO: Exactly.
SHAW: ...All of which taught to Zunino a crucial lesson that might even apply to people.
ZUNINO: The first sexual experience - the first cut was very deep.
SHAW: That's because, whenever you have your first sexual experience with pleasure, your brain is activating two key chemicals, dopamine and oxytocin. And together, they increase pleasure and desire, arousal and bonding. And once you experience their effects, you will never forget the circumstances that made it all happen.
ZUNINO: Whatever that is around and whatever that - your partner looks like.
SHAW: And once you have an orgasm, you will pay even more attention to those cues in the future.
ZUNINO: Absolutely.
SHAW: And if you repeat the pleasure with those characteristics over and over...
ZUNINO: Well, that will just constantly reaffirm to your brain, this is what you like.
SHAW: But that doesn't mean any preference is set in stone. Zunino thinks you can't subtract what's already been laid down. But you can probably add new preferences by exposing yourself to new kinds of people.
ZUNINO: We're not prisoners of our past.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Laughing).
SHAW: People are actually trying to think through how to do this in a systematic way, like Russell Robinson, a professor at Berkeley Law School who, for the past 10 years, has been teaching students about the ways in which social structures influence are romantic choices.
RUSSELL ROBINSON: I don't believe in any sort of firm rules like everybody must be open to every race or everybody must stay within their race.
SHAW: His position is, basically, we live in a structurally racist world. So the solution isn't to shame individuals for the romantic choices. Instead, just look at your own attraction patterns and try to understand what might be shaping them.
ROBINSON: Might you rethink that, might you expose yourself to different types of people and try to shed the bias that has created those preferences if that's the reason behind the preferences.
SHAW: Robinson doesn't even think having a racial preference is necessarily wrong. You might have very good reasons for having one. But here's what he says is key. It shouldn't be based in a racial stereotype, potentially even including stereotypes about white people. One day in class, a Latino student told Robinson she could never date a white man because a white man could never see her as fully human.
ROBINSON: And so I told that to my dear friend who is herself Latina. And she said, you just know the universe is going to send her an amazing white man. So I like that idea that, like, you know, establishing these rules and thinking that, you know, you figured it out - it's, like, then life happens.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SHAW: Remember L from the beginning? Well, she accidentally stumbled into a version of Robinson's advice on her own. After the Tinder epiphany, she set off on a personal journey to evaluate the patterns of her own romantic attraction.
L: I remember thinking, like, well, why do you like him so He's - honestly, like - it's just like, he's so basic.
SHAW: And over the next few years, she began to notice new people on the street and on dating apps.
L: Sure. Oh, OK - great. He likes me. Hey.
SHAW: Pausing over all kinds of people she used to instinctually swipe away.

College Admissions Scandal Reveals Difficult Path To Acceptance,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875260/college-admissions-scandal-reveals-difficult-path-to-acceptance,"Getting into college is already difficult and unnerving for many students. For low-income students, the recent college admissions scandal is prompting a crisis of faith about how fair the practice is.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Trying to get into college is already difficult and unnerving for many students, but the massive college admissions scandal is prompting a crisis of faith about the fairness of the process. Max Larkin from member station WBUR has more.
MAX LARKIN, BYLINE: Sitting inside Harvard's gleaming new campus center, Jose Larios doesn't have many illusions about how the system works.
JOSE LARIOS: Wealth is extremely influential in college access. If you come from a well-off family in, say, Beverly Hills, odds are you've heard of college, the SAT, the ACT. Your child, from a very young age, has that as an expectation.
LARKIN: But famous families using bribes and fraud to get their kids in - that caught Larios by surprise. It felt like overkill.
LARIOS: So how someone could, like, already be extremely advantaged already and then decide, let me actually break the law, break the system more than already is, and commit fraud - that is shocking to me.
LARKIN: Walking across campus, Larios explains that he didn't have those same advantages growing up in Jamaica, Queens. He remembers telling his parents - who immigrated from Honduras - about his plan for the SAT.
LARIOS: I actually had to explain to them what I was actually doing with these, like, large volumes of books I would, like, borrow from the library.
LARKIN: Larios took the subway to free preparatory programs across New York City. They taught him some of the hard truths about higher education.
LARIOS: Student from, like, my background would have, like, a graduation rate of less than 10%.
LARKIN: Now in his junior year, Larios is beating those odds. And he gives a lot of credit to programs designed to expand college access for people like him. They don't just demystify financial aid or offer test prep. They give students from low-income backgrounds a place to strategize, celebrate and vent. And now they're coping with questions of fairness.
ZAIRA GARCIA: There's a lot of work that is put into going to college. To see that they just reap the benefits without putting in that work - I was like, wow, that's basically telling us to, like, screw off.
LARKIN: That's Zaira Garcia, a senior at East Boston High School. Most of that school's students come from low-income households. And less than half of its graduates were enrolled in college in the spring after graduation. Garcia works with the school's GEAR UP office - a state-run college prep program. She's an athlete, and she's in at Northeastern with a generous scholarship.
But her classmate, Naylene Rivera, wasn't so lucky. Rivera says she's a good student, also an athlete, and engaged in her school. But that left one big problem - SAT stress.
NAYLENE RIVERA: I was just, like, staring at my tests, thinking about how I'm not going to do well because I don't have enough time. I studied, but I'm forgetting everything in the moment. So I just think it's not fair.
LARKIN: For all the GEAR UP seniors at school that day, the memory of the SAT is tied up with panic and mostly disappointing results. And though a few say they know their lives won't be determined by test scores or college acceptances, they add that sometimes it can feel that way, especially coming from their background. It's a paradox for young adults at public city high schools. They may have more to gain than anyone from attending top-flight colleges, but those colleges still aren't set up to welcome them en masse.
Back at Harvard, Jose Larios understands how that school could change his own future.
LARIOS: I can absolutely see, like, why this is a springboard for someone, like, from a low-income background. There's professional experiences straight out of college where they pay you six-figure salaries.
LARKIN: But he says, for now, he has other plans. He wants to go into public policy to try to even the odds for students like him. For NPR News, I'm Max Larkin in Boston.

It Appears A Sitcom Star Will Be The Next President Of Ukraine,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715875246/it-appears-a-sitcom-star-will-be-the-next-president-of-ukraine,"With most of the votes counted, it appears a comedian with no political experience will become president. He made a name for himself on TV playing a teacher who becomes president by a twist of fate.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Art is imitating life in Ukraine. Almost all the votes have been counted in the presidential election there, and the winner is a comedian who plays a president on television.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKIY: (Foreign language spoken).
(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)
MARTIN: And that is the voice of Vol - Volodymyr - I'll get it out - Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He was greeting supporters Sunday night after his landslide victory. He made a name for himself in a TV show, called, ""Servant Of The People,"" in which he plays a high school teacher who becomes Ukraine's president by a twist of fate. NPR's Lucian Kim has been covering the election, and we've got him on the line from Moscow. Hi, Lucian.
LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning.
MARTIN: So Zelenskiy has no political experience, unless you count playing a president on TV as experience. Clearly, Ukrainians were willing to take a risk here. Why?
KIM: Practically everybody in Ukraine knows Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanks to his various TV shows and especially that show, ""Servant Of The People,"" where he plays this honest, incorruptible guy who ends up being president. What's amazing is that despite Zelenskiy being a household name, people don't really know what he stands for.
And during the election campaign, he was very vague about his positions. And in that way, he really became a blank slate for people to project whatever they wanted on him. Ukrainians expected real change from the incumbent Petro Poroshenko, whom they elected five years ago. They wanted a resolution to a Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine. They wanted an end to corruption and a turnaround in the economy.
And I think the fact that they chose Zelenskiy shows how desperate people are. But at the same time, I think it's worth noting that this was a victory for democracy in Ukraine. Poroshenko almost immediately conceded defeat. And now there will be a peaceful transfer of power.
MARTIN: Right. So that is significant. But what about Ukraine's conflict with Russia? It's been going on for years now. I mean, what will Zelenskiy's victory mean for that?
KIM: Well, this is the big question, and maybe even the biggest question. Poroshenko, the incumbent, had tried to portray himself as the only candidate who could stand up to Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. This is what Poroshenko said after conceding on Sunday night.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PETRO POROSHENKO: You may just look at the celebration in the Kremlin of the occasion of the election. They believe that with a new, inexperienced Ukrainian president, Ukraine could be quickly returned to the Russian orbit of influence.
KIM: So there's been a real personal animosity between Poroshenko and Putin in recent months, and Putin pretty much made clear that he didn't want to deal with Poroshenko anymore. So now with Zelenskiy's victory, there may in fact be an opening. I think by voting for Zelenskiy, Ukrainians showed that they're really tired by this low-level war with Russia.
MARTIN: What about Ukraine's relationship with the U.S.? I mean, Poroshenko was a close ally. Does Zelenskiy see the United States in the same way?
KIM: Well, Poroshenko has certainly made a lot of his relationship to the U.S. And as we just heard, he portrayed Zelenskiy as someone who could be easily manipulated by the Kremlin. So it remains to be seen how Zelenskiy will develop his relations with the U.S. We're hearing that President Trump has already congratulated Zelenskiy and said that the U.S. would continue to support Ukraine.
But Ukraine's big problem has always been that it's never really been front and center in U.S. foreign policy. Zelenskiy may actually have a chance to meet President Trump at the beginning of June. They're both expected to be at the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France.
MARTIN: All right. NPR's Lucian Kim for us from Moscow. Lucian, thanks. We appreciate it.
KIM: Thanks, Rachel.

The Calidore String Quartet: Tiny Desk Concert,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715168527/the-calidore-string-quartet-tiny-desk-concert,"Don't see the video above? Click here. If just one thing can be confirmed from these compelling Tiny Desk performances by the Calidore String Quartet, it should be that the centuries-old formula – two violins, a viola and a cello – is still very much alive and evolving. Indeed, an impromptu show of hands in the audience before the concert began revealed that almost everyone had seen a string quartet perform live.
The genre was born some 250 years ago and pioneered by Joseph Haydn , but composers today are still tinkering with its possibilities. Consider Caroline Shaw . The young, Pulitzer-winning composer wrote the opening work in this set, First Essay: Nimrod , especially for the Calidore String Quartet.
Over a span of eight minutes, the supple theme that opens this extraordinary work takes a circuitous adventure. It unfolds into a song for the cello, is sliced into melodic shards, gets bathed in soft light, becomes gritty and aggressive and disguises itself in accents of the old master composers. Midway through, the piece erupts in spasms that slowly dissolve back into the theme.
The Calidore players also chose music by the quirky Czech composer, Leoš Janáček who, in 1913, set one of his operas on the moon. He wrote only two string quartets but they are dazzling. The opening Adagio, from his first quartet, is typical Janáček, with hairpin turns that veer from passionate romance to prickly anxiety.
Reaching back farther, the ensemble closes the set with an early quartet by Beethoven , who took what Haydn threw down and ran with it. The final movement from Beethoven's Fourth Quartet both looks back at Haydn's elegance and implies the rambunctious, even violent, risks his music would soon take.
The performance turns out to be a fascinating through-line, traced from Beethoven's early incarnation of the string quartet, straight through to Caroline Shaw's new sounds, which occasionally glance backward.
SET LIST Caroline Shaw: ""First Essay: Nimrod"" Janáček: ""String Quartet No. 1, 'Adagio'"" Beethoven: ""String Quartet Op. 18, No. 4, Allegro - Prestissimo"" MUSICIANS Jeffrey Myers, violin; Ryan Meehan, violin; Jeremy Berry, viola; Estelle Choi, cello

Jeremy Lange/Courtesy Jeremy Lange/Courtesy of the artist The Mountain Goats' In League With Dragons comes out April 26.
Jeremy Lange/Courtesy Bandcamp playlist
With the release of In League With Dragons , The Mountain Goats ' John Darnielle is fully 18 albums — not to mention numerous EPs, several side projects, a high-profile podcast series and a pair of novels — into a career spanning more than a quarter-century. With nothing left to prove, he's found more than ever to say, as recent recordings dive headlong into the specificity-rich worlds of underground wrestling (2015's Beat the Champ ) and outcast subcultures (2017's Goths ).
If you're looking to shorthand the concept around which In League With Dragons revolves, you could say this is Darnielle's album about Dungeons & Dragons; about role-playing games and the byzantine mythologies that help animate them. (He did, after all, announce the project in a live-streamed event at the headquarters of D&D's publisher, Wizards of the Coast.) But In League With Dragons ' conceptual reach sprawls significantly farther than gaming.
Darnielle's own press statement describes the subgenre on display as ""dragon noir,"" and he begins a lengthy rundown of In League With Dragons with the words, ""This album began as a rock opera about a besieged seaside community called Riversend ruled by a benevolent wizard."" But Darnielle's greatest gifts lie in his ability to pick apart more earthbound human frailties, and the songs on In League With Dragons operate accordingly. In ""Doc Gooden,"" for example, a washed-up baseball player looks back in bitterness as he dreams of a comeback, while the jaunty ""Waylon Jennings Live!"" finds its narrator drunk at a casino, ""right where God intended me to be.""
All of which is to say that there's a lot to unpack here, from the crime-scene viscera of ""Cadaver Sniffing Dog"" to the mass pleas for mercy in ""Clemency for the Wizard King,"" and it all unfolds amid arrangements more polished and ambitious than early Mountain Goats fans could have ever imagined. It makes perfect sense when you think about it: If you're going to make an album-length tribute to fantastical, fictional worlds, you'd best not make it simple.

Good morning. I'm David Greene. When Notre Dame was burning last week, officials looked on and thought of its residents. About 180,000 bees live on the roof. Notre Dame's beekeeper, Nicolas Geant, thought they were done for. The hives could easily melt with the bees inside. He told the Associated Press he was so relieved when he saw satellite photos showing that they survived. Later, he saw for himself. He posted a video online. Hives are intact, and bees are buzzing.

Seth Moulton Announces 2020 Bid For President : NPR,www.npr.org,Jessica Taylor,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/714145274/massachusetts-rep-seth-moulton-joins-democratic-race-for-president,"Enlarge this image Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., seen being questioned by reporters on Capitol Hill last year, is joining the large field of candidates. J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., seen being questioned by reporters on Capitol Hill last year, is joining the large field of candidates.
J. Scott Applewhite/AP Updated at 9:53 a.m. ET
Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton is joining the large 2020 field, touting a record of military service, bucking his party and arguing for younger leadership.
""The greatest generation saved our country from tyranny. It's time for our generation to step up and do the same,"" Moulton said in an announcement video posted early Monday.
His opening message highlights issues from the economy, including advancing jobs to combat climate change, cutting spending on ""massive"" weapons programs, cybersecurity to protect elections, gun control and restoring America's ""moral authority.""
The 40-year-old former Marine Corps captain, who served four tours of duty in Iraq, has been a critic of his own party, especially House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He was part of a coalition in the House — along with Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who is also running for president — that argued Democrats needed a new generation of leaders. Moulton was first elected to Congress in 2014 by knocking off an incumbent Democrat in the primary, arguing a fresh change was needed.
 He echoed that argument in a February 2019 interview with BuzzFeed, confirming he was mulling over a presidential campaign because ""it's time for a new generation of leadership, and we gotta send Donald Trump packing.""
By launching a long-shot White House bid, Moulton may be able to raise his profile to be an even larger part of that younger Democratic generation, but he faces many obstacles in gaining traction in a crowded field that has already found two young, white male candidates to latch on to, in South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
Moulton talks about being inspired to go into politics after serving in Iraq, a war he describes as based on a ""lie"" about weapons of mass destruction.
""I'm running because I'm a patriot, because I believe in this country, and because I've never wanted to sit on the sidelines when it comes to serving it,"" Moulton told ABC's Good Morning America on Monday. ""That's why I joined the Marines. It's why I ran for Congress to try to prevent what I saw got us into Iraq from happening again, and it's why I'm running to take on the most divisive president in American history, to bring this country back together.""
Like Buttigieg, a Navy Reserve officer who served in Afghanistan, Moulton adds military service to the field. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, another presidential candidate of their generation, is also an Iraq War veteran and was one of the first two female combat veterans ever. The last president who had significant military service was former President George H.W. Bush, who served in World War II. Two Vietnam veterans, Republican John McCain and Democrat John Kerry, both won their respective parties' nominations but lost the general elections in 2008 and 2004.
Politics Tracking The Money Race Behind The Presidential Campaign Moulton has advocated for candidates with military experience who are running for Congress through his Serve America PAC, and he backed several Democratic veteran candidates in 2018 who were ultimately critical to Democrats' winning back control of the House. While he has called himself a progressive, Moulton has ranked as one of the most bipartisan members of the House and is a member of the moderate New Democrat Coalition.
Moulton becomes the fourth current House member to try to make the leap to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, which has been done only once before — by James Garfield in 1880."
Losses Continue To Mount Recent Midwest Flooding,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715902263/losses-continue-to-mount-after-recent-midwest-flooding,"Floods in Nebraska tore out major highways and railroad lines and destroyed levees. In addition to rebuilding lives, residents of some small towns face hours long detours to buy basic supplies.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Here in the United States, the devastating floods in the Midwest last month caused billions of dollars in damage, and those losses are still mounting. As Frank Morris from member station KCUR reports, the final tally of those losses will likely include entire communities torn apart by this disaster.
FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Lynch, Neb., with just 200 residents, is tucked away on the South Dakota line. It seems like a remarkably successful town.
(SOUNDBITE OF BOWLING BALL STRIKING ALLEY)
KEVIN THOMPSON: To have, like, a hospital, you know, theater - it's all run by volunteers. And then we've got the bowling alley here.
MORRIS: Kevin Thompson (ph) is the local electrician.
THOMPSON: We got a couple bars. And we got Faith's BBQ (ph) down the street.
MORRIS: But this town's in trouble. The grocery store is for sale. Employee Georgia Courtney (ph) is worried about losing her job and finding a place to live.
GEORGIA COURTNEY: Well, I'm homeless right now, but I'm staying with friends. There's a lot of us displaced that are trying to find a place to go, a place to live or whatever. But there's not that much housing in this town.
MORRIS: Not since last month's flood when Ponca Creek, running through Lynch, jumped its banks, swamping about a third of the town, setting off a chain reaction that threatens to unravel this tightknit community.
TAMARA SMITH: Everybody would really like to stay here, but we don't have the housing. I mean, there's just not enough room.
MORRIS: Tamara Smith (ph) lost her home. She's disabled and worries that the tiny hospital here will soon close, so she's moving.
SMITH: It's a rough time for everybody, and it's going to get a lot rougher.
MORRIS: The flood hit the only sector bringing money into this area - agriculture. Ranchers lost cattle, hay to feed them and, in some cases, access to pastures. Diane Heiser (ph) says she and her husband may sell out and leave.
DIANE HEISER: It's tough. And we live, really, in paradise. I mean, this is gorgeous. This valley here is absolutely beautiful. But the economics are just - and they're not getting any easier. It just gets harder and harder and harder to make it.
MORRIS: And it's not just Lynch. Last month's flood is forcing a reckoning in ravaged towns and farms across parts of four states.
PAT SHELDON: Well, I don't think most people in Bartlett will comeback.
MORRIS: Farmer Pat Sheldon (ph) is talking about Bartlett, Iowa - population 50 - on the southwest edge of the state, flooded by the Missouri River.
SHELDON: I don't think there's hardly anybody in McPaul that will come back. I mean, they've had water up to their eaves or higher. The town that I grew up in, around Percival, we might be lucky if half the residents come back.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, I guess I'll take a hotdog then.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: OK.
MORRIS: In Glenwood, Iowa, volunteers are serving lunch to flood victims from little towns nearby here.
SHARON STEWART: My name's Sharon Stewart (ph), and I'm from Pacific Junction, Iowa.
MORRIS: An old railroad town close to the Missouri River and prone to flooding. But Stewart says the crests never reached her house - until last month, when it took 12 feet of water. She says many of Pacific Junction's 450 people are like her, lifelong residents who won't be going home.
STEWART: They can't go back and face this again. Knowing that everything they had is gone, it's kind of like a death.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: You want to drive down the road, down that way...
MORRIS: Farther downstream, Richard Oswald (ph) farms near Rockport, Mo. But he's not farming today.
RICHARD OSWALD: Well, I've heard people say, well, I guess it's going to be a summer off because you can see all the water on the fields around us. And these fields over here to your right, those are fields that I farm. And they're completely covered with water. There's still 5 feet of water on that field.
MORRIS: The deluge broke records here and came up neck deep in a place where Oswald had never in his 69 years seen flooding before - the house where he was born and where he's lived most of his life.
OSWALD: Well, I'm not going to go back to that house. And I'm not going to let anybody else live in that house because I don't think it's going to be safe.
MORRIS: He's concerned about mold and future floods amplified by climate change and river management. There's also the threat of aging dams upstream from here giving way. But with all that hanging over his operation, Oswald is just not ready to give up farming this land.
OSWALD: I've even had people that I was - and that I am am friendly with who, when this occurred, said - well, it's just time to let this all go back to nature down here. Well, that's my farm.
MORRIS: It's clear that last month's flood is straining - sometimes breaking - tight bonds between farmers and their land and between small-town residents and their lifelong communities. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris.

"A Decade Of Calm, Explosions Kill Nearly 300 People In Sri Lanka",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715901525/after-a-decade-of-calm-explosions-kill-nearly-300-people-in-sri-lanka,"The series of blasts were set off on Easter Sunday — flaming political and social tensions. Rachel Martin talks to Jeffrey Feltman, former under-secretary-general for Political Affairs at the U.N.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Officials in Sri Lanka are trying to determine who knew what and when. Coordinated attacks killed nearly 300 people on Easter Sunday, wounding hundreds more. Authorities in the capital city, Colombo, are blaming a small local Islamist group for the attacks. About two dozen people have now been arrested. Local police reportedly told national authorities about threats to churches weeks ago, but it's unclear whether anyone acted on that information. The bombings come as Sri Lanka is about to mark 10 years since the end of a decades-long civil war.
Jeffrey Feltman is here with us in the studio. He traveled to Sri Lanka frequently as the under-secretary-general for political affairs at the United Nations until 2018, and he happened to have been in Sri Lanka just last month. Thank you so much for being here.
JEFFREY FELTMAN: Thank you very much for inviting me.
MARTIN: May I first ask if you happen to know anything about this group that's being blamed for the attack? I think the name is National Thowheeth Jama'ath.
FELTMAN: Rachel, the first I had heard of this group was this morning in waking up and seeing the news. In fact, I talked to a couple of Sri Lankan friends and contacts this morning, and they also had never heard of this group. So it's completely unknown to even prominent political figures in Sri Lanka. Whether or not the intelligence community there knew or not is a different matter.
And I think it's worth noting that the Muslim community in Sri Lanka has tended to be quiet, has tended to stay out of the news. It's less than 10% of the population. They did not participate in the almost-30-year civil war. And in fact, the Muslim community in Sri Lanka, as recently as a year ago, was victim themselves of sort of mob violence by extremist Buddhist elements. So this is, I think, a shock to at least all the Sri Lankans I've talked to.
MARTIN: So are you saying there was no - was there any religious element to the civil war in Sri Lanka?
FELTMAN: I mean, the civil war was more ethnic - between the Tamil minority, which is 11%, 12% of the population, against the Sinhala Buddhist majority, which is 70%, 74% of the population. It was more ethnic than it was religious, with Tamils extremist group called the Tamil Tigers, a terrorist group - trying to - or basically, it was an independence insurgency for 30 years, finally defeated in May 2009. But it was not religious; it was more ethnic.
MARTIN: So that leads us to the current moment. I mean, as we think about the broader context of these attacks that happened on Sunday - Easter Sunday, what is the political and social situation in Sri Lanka like today?
FELTMAN: Well, I mean, there's been an effort to promote reconciliation, reform, accountability in the aftermath of the end of that civil war. The end of the civil war had a lot of basic human rights - war crimes to end the war. But it did end the war. And so there's been a 10-year attempt to try to do reconciliation, economic development, etc. And it's been - there's been some progress - incomplete homework, I would say, but some progress.
And there's been an increase in tourism. There's been some economic development. I think all of this will certainly be affected by what is a, you know, massive, massive attack that took place on Easter Sunday. And it certainly will eventually play into the politics as they're - in Sri Lanka.
Right now, of course, the government has tried to come together in a unified way to look at what happened, to see how to react. But eventually, there will be political and economic ramifications, I would guess.
MARTIN: I want to get to those in a moment. But I do want to ask about the tactics of response here. The government in Sri Lanka is blocking major social media and messaging services in the country. What does that tell you?
FELTMAN: Well, I think that's a very mixed picture because, obviously, it's hard to get the truth out if you're blocking the vehicles by which people use to communicate between families and loved ones and more broadly. But this is a direct reaction to what happened a year ago, when the Muslim community in the central city of Kandy was attacked by extremist Buddhist mobs who incited their followers to go out using social media. So there's sort of a bad history in Sri Lanka of using Facebook, etc., to spread false information and incite violence.
So I think that explains the government's reason behind stopping the use of social media. But obviously, it has - it's a very mixed bag.
MARTIN: So you alluded to political ramifications. Just when it comes to the situation today - I mean, the prime minister has acknowledged that there may have been some intelligence missteps - that the, quote, ""information was there"" when it came to warnings about potential attacks like this but that he was never personally informed. Does that reflect a deeper rift within the Sri Lankan government?
FELTMAN: Well, there's a - you know, there's a very uneasy relationship between the president of the country, President Sirisena, and the prime minister, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. In fact, in October, the president tried to replace the prime minister with the person the president had defeated in office back in 2015. And he failed constitutionally and judicially, politically to replace the prime minister. But it's clear there's an uneasy relationship between the president and the prime minister.
But I would expect that there would be an attempt to unify the response to this horrible, horrible attack. The issue, though, is that there are presidential elections that must take place constitutionally by the end of the year. And will this become an issue by which the former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was defeated in 2015, tries to promote his party's fortunes by saying he defeated terrorism in 2009 when he exterminated the Tamil Tigers and now he can protect Sri Lanka again?
So I expect this will play out politically inside Sri Lanka over the next few months, even if right now the immediate issue is the aftermath, the investigation, security.
MARTIN: Right - and lives lost and grieving those lives. Jeffrey Feltman, former under-secretary-general for Political Affairs at the United Nations. Thank you so much for coming into the studio.
FELTMAN: Thank you very much for having me.

With nearly all the ballots counted, the 41-year-old Volodymyr Zelenskiy took 73% of the vote, trouncing incumbent President Petro Poroshenko, who received less than 25%. Zelenskiy's victory is widely seen as a rebuke of the status quo, a response to perceived corruption within the political establishment, and a reflection of malaise over the lackluster economy and ongoing conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine.
""I will never fail you,"" Zelenskiy told supporters at his campaign headquarters Sunday night, according to the Kyiv Post . ""While I'm not yet president, I can say the following. To all post-Soviet countries: Look at us. Everything is possible.""
Zelenskiy has no political experience, and few detailed policy positions. He has promised to end the war in eastern Ukraine and fight corruption within the government, but he hasn't laid out specific plans to accomplish these goals.

""What's amazing is that despite Zelenskiy being a household name, people don't really know what he stands for,"" NPR's Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim told Morning Edition . ""During the election campaign, he was very vague about his positions, and in that way he really became a blank slate for people to project whatever they wanted on him."" The fact that voters chose Zelenskiy shows how desperate people are, Kim said.
What Zelenskiy's victory will mean for Ukraine's ongoing conflict with Russia is an open question. In comments to the press, Zelenskiy said he would ""do everything possible"" to end hostilities with pro-Russian separatists in the country's Donbass region, which has left thousands dead. ""Our No. 1 task is to get all of our prisoners of war back,"" Zelenskiy said. Russia is holding 24 Ukrainian sailors, according to Reuters .
Zelenskiy told reporters he would ""reboot"" peace talks with the separatists, with an eye toward a ceasefire, the BBC reported . Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said that the Ukrainian election results show ""there is a chance to improve the relations with our country after all,"" according to The Associated Press.
But Ukraine's outgoing president cautioned that the Kremlin is celebrating the election of an inexperienced candidate. Russia believes that ""Ukraine could be quickly returned to Russia's orbit of influence,"" Poroshenko said on Twitter. ""I call on the international community to help Ukraine to secure all the recent achievements and the strategic choice of the nation for integration to the European Union and the NATO.

The Embassy also thanked Poroshenko for his efforts to strengthen Ukraine's security and democracy over the past five years, as well as his commitment to a bilateral relationship with the U.S. ""We look forward to continuing the strong U.S.-Ukraine partnership with President-elect Zelenskyy,"" the Embassy wrote .
According to The New York Times , many voters said they had supported Zelenskiy ""not so much because they thought he was a good candidate but because they wanted to punish Mr. Poroshenko for deflating the hopes raised by Ukraine's 2014 revolution and for doing little to combat corruption.""

U.S. Officials Plan To End Sanction Waivers On Iranian Oil : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715908729/u-s-officials-plan-to-end-sanction-waivers-on-iranian-oil,"U.S. Officials Plan To End Sanction Waivers On Iranian Oil U.S. Officials Plan To End Sanction Waivers On Iranian Oil Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
The U.S. on Monday will tell five countries that they will lose sanctions waivers if they continue to import oil from Iran. David Greene talks to Demetri Sevastopulo of the Financial Times .
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The U.S. State Department is expected to tighten the screws on Iran's oil industry today. And in doing so, the U.S. government is also going to be putting pressure on some of its own allies, like Turkey and Japan. Those countries and a few others have been given waivers from sanctions to continue buying Iranian oil. Those waivers are expected to end.
And joining us to talk about it is Demetri Sevastopulo. He is the Washington bureau chief for the Financial Times. He's been reporting on this. Good morning.
DEMETRI SEVASTOPULO: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So these are waivers to sanctions that are expected to be taken away. Can you just step back and remind us what these sanctions were in the first place?
SEVASTOPULO: Sure. Well, I mean, the U.S. has had sanctions on Iran for a long time. But when the Obama administration signed a deal with Iran in 2015, the landmark Iran nuclear deal with the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, they essentially arranged for waivers so that sanctions that were in place before would not be enforced. Now, when Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018, he signaled that he was going to snap back on those sanctions that had been waived for a long time.
In connection with that, the U.S. had been trying for a long time to get its allies and some partner countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil anyway. And then leading up to November, when the broad sanctions on Iran were put back on last year, the administration said it was going to make sure that its allies and partners reduced oil imports from Iran to zero.
However, when it got close to the point, it actually did give a set of eight waivers to the countries that you mentioned and said it would give them more time - 180 days - to start trying to reduce their imports and their reliance on Iran. Some of those countries - Greece, Italy and Taiwan - actually got their imports, I think, pretty much down to zero. But the others - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - still have a way to go. So basically, what's happening this morning is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is going to say, on May 2, the waivers will no longer exist, and you will face the potential of U.S. sanctions if you import Iranian oil.
GREENE: And is the expectation that this could have a big effect on Iran and, as always the goal in tough moves like this, to try and change the behavior of the regime?
SEVASTOPULO: Well, it's definitely going to have a greater impact on the Iranian economy, which is already suffering very hard under existing sanctions. So it's going to have more of an effect there. And one of the other questions, obviously, is whether it's going to impact oil prices in the global market.
GREENE: And to what extent could it do that? I mean, could we see, you know, a big spike in gas prices over the summer?
SEVASTOPULO: Well, a year ago, the Trump administration justified giving the waivers. It said, listen; oil markets are very tight right now. If we put the squeeze on, it could be bad for the U.S. economy. Well, oil prices are actually reasonably high right now, as well. They hit a high of $74 in Asia trading overnight, which is not far from where they were a year ago. What the administration here is counting on is that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will actually step in and provide output to make up for the shortfall from putting - Iranian output.
Now, whether it can do that or not will obviously be the test. They say - I talked to an official last night who said that they've arranged that. But you know, these things can fall through. So I think that's got to be the real test.
GREENE: And briefly, why now? Why is the administration doing this now?
SEVASTOPULO: Well, they say that - their logic, they say, is that it's not conducive to do this because oil prices aren't as tight as they were a year ago. But there are a number of people who would doubt that. I think it's also partly that it's just - there is a gradual push to keep ramping up the rhetoric on Iran to try and change the behavior of the regime in Tehran.
GREENE: Demetri Sevastopulo is the Washington bureau chief for the Financial Times, joining us this morning. Thanks for your time, Demetri.
SEVASTOPULO: Thank you.

Pompeo: No More Sanctions Waivers For Iranian Oil Importers : NPR,www.npr.org,David Greene,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715930346/pompeo-no-more-sanctions-waivers-for-iranian-oil-importers,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday announces an end to sanctions waivers it has granted countries that import Iranian oil, such as Japan and Turkey.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The State Department this morning is threatening to punish its allies to get at iran - the United States is trying to get other countries to stop buying Iranian oil.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: Today I'm announcing that we will no longer grant any exemptions. We're going to zero - going to zero across the board.
GREENE: That's the voice of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announcing an end to waivers it had granted to countries like Japan and Turkey. This is all part of an effort the United States began a year ago, when it pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal; that was the international agreement giving Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. Let's talk this through with NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen, who's at the State Department. Hi, Michele.
MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning.
GREENE: So explain exactly what Pompeo's doing here.
KELEMEN: So he came in to discuss this next phase of the pressure campaign, you might say. As you mentioned, the administration pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal a year ago, and it's been reimposing sanctions that were suspended under that deal. And that includes what we call secondary sanctions - that is, sanctions on countries that import oil from Iran.
The U.S. gave seven countries and Taiwan a waiver for six months the last time, but that period is now coming to an end. The administration says it won't extend those waivers any further. They say the oil market is well-supplied now. So they argue that this is a good time to push countries to get to zero, to stop importing Iranian oil completely.
GREENE: So is it just that it's a good time, or do they feel like taking away these waivers could really, you know, hurt the Iranian economy even more?
KELEMEN: Well, that's the big part. I mean, oil is the No. 1 source of cash for Iran's economy. Pompeo says that they've so far denied Iran, he claims, more than $10 billion in oil revenue. But the Trump administration faced some criticism from the right for giving too many waivers the last time around. So now they're cracking down harder.
It's not clear what they're contemplating, as far as punishments are concerned, if these countries do continue to buy oil from Iran. Pompeo says the risks aren't worth the benefits, but his aides really wouldn't say if, you know, these are going to be targeted sanctions or if they're going to go for sanctions that are really going to affect trade relations with these countries. And remember, David, we're talking about countries like China, India and Turkey.
GREENE: Well, can we talk about one of the complexities with the nuclear deal that you and I have spoken about? I mean, when the United States pulled out, other countries did not, and there were all these questions about what the United States could or couldn't do to change other countries' behaviors - is that part of the context here?
KELEMEN: Yeah. I mean, proponents of the deal say that it's working, that Iran is abiding by it, it's limiting Iran's nuclear program. Pompeo downplays that, though. He talks about an enormous coalition which is countering Iran now. He talks about the Gulf states and Israel and some Europeans.
But you know, as you mentioned, there were other world powers that are invested in this - Russia, China, U.K., France and Germany all helped negotiate the deal. The Trump administration always argued that the deal was too weak, and it also didn't cover all these other problems with Iran - Iran's support for militias throughout the region, its ballistic missile programs - and they're trying to really push on that.
GREENE: And as they push on things like this, the ultimate goal of the Trump administration is still - what? - regime change in Tehran?
KELEMEN: Well, they say it's about changing the behavior of Iran. But, of course, there's a lot of questions about how you do that, and it's hard right now to see a pathway for diplomacy on this - a way to get back to some sort of deal, either the Iran nuclear deal or something broader.
GREENE: NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen at the State Department this morning. Michele, thanks, as always.
KELEMEN: Thank you.

The state is one of several considering new voting laws that could make it more complicated to vote in 2020.
Ralph Freso/Getty Images After high turnout in last year's midterm elections propelled Democrats to a new House majority and big gains in the states, several Republican-controlled state legislatures are attempting to change voting-related rules in ways that might reduce future voter turnout.
In Texas, state lawmakers are considering adding criminal penalties for people who improperly fill out voter registration forms. Arizona Republicans are proposing new voting rules that could make it more complicated to cast an early ballot. In Tennessee, GOP lawmakers are considering a bill that would fine groups involved in voter registration drives that submit incomplete forms.
Politics Georgia Governor Signs Law Addressing Some Criticisms Of Contested 2018 Election Republican lawmakers in those states say new laws are needed to maintain the integrity of voter rolls and prevent fraud. Voting rights advocates and Democrats dismiss those claims and argue that the policies are designed to dampen turnout among younger, nonwhite and poorer voters, who are less likely to back Republicans.
If enacted, these proposals could have an impact on future elections, especially in Arizona and Texas, where demographic and political trends are making both states more competitive on the national level for the first time in decades.
Last fall, Arizona Republicans saw their total control of all statewide offices shattered by surging Democratic turnout , losing four of nine statewide races — including a U.S. Senate seat. Democrats view the state's other Senate seat as one of their best pickup opportunities in 2020. In Texas, record turnout helped Democrats flip two congressional and 12 state legislative seats — not to mention come closer than they have in decades in the Senate race. While Tennessee wasn't ultimately competitive in 2018, there was a surge of newly registered voters in the Democratic strongholds of Memphis and Nashville.
Politics House Passes Extensive Election And Campaign Finance Overhaul Bill The bills in Republican-controlled states that could curb voting come as many Democratic-run states are heading further in the opposite direction by expanding access to early and absentee voting and adopting automatic voter registration (several traditionally Republican states have also adopted automatic voter registration).
""We are seeing both the good and bad side of the fallout of the 2018 election,"" said Danielle Lang, co-director of the voting rights and redistricting program at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center.

Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images Democrats saw a major increase in voter turnout in Texas last year. Now, in the name of combating voter fraud, the Republican-controlled state legislature is looking at a new law that could increase criminal penalties for those who don't fill out voter registration forms properly.
Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images Texas: from misdemeanor to felony
Texas Senate Bill 9 — which was recently approved by the state Senate and is under consideration by the legislature — would make it a felony, punishable by jail time, for anyone who provides false information on a voter registration form or casts a ballot when they are ineligible, even if it's by mistake.
Politics Ahead Of The 2018 Election, Texas AG Ramps Up Voter Fraud Prosecutions Voting groups in the state say they are concerned this effort could result in jail time for people who don't properly fill out their voter registration forms. Currently, providing false information on an application is a misdemeanor.
""If Senate Bill 9 passes, a person who makes a simple mistake — puts the wrong ZIP code on a voter registration card — could be prosecuted, fined and even put in jail,"" said Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, which registers young voters, among other things.
She described the bill as ""one of the most strict voter suppression laws in the country,"" noting that Texas is already one of the most difficult states in which to register voters and that the proposed new penalties could make it even harder.
Politics Texas Officials Begin Walking Back Allegations About Noncitizen Voters This latest push to tighten Texas' voting laws comes months after Texas election officials launched a troubled effort to remove alleged noncitizens from the state's voter rolls .
The bill's sponsor, state Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Republican from rural east Texas, says the point of the bill is not to crack down on people who ""inadvertently check a wrong box."" He says the point is to make sure local prosecutors ""are prioritizing these crimes.""
""This bill is aimed at people who are intentionally cheating,"" Hughes says. ""This is not to catch people who make an honest mistake.""
Cases of intentional voter fraud are rare in Texas — in many instances in which authorities have prosecuted someone, the people being prosecuted said they did not realize they were ineligible to vote.
Voting rights lawyers are also concerned about the bill's increased criminal penalties for those who cast a ballot — including a provisional ballot — when they are ineligible to vote.
Provisional ballots were created by federal law to allow people to vote if they aren't sure they can, and a provisional ballot is counted only once election officials determine that the voter who submitted it is eligible. Provisional ballots are often used when eligible voters are erroneously not included in their state's voter roll.
Senate Bill 9 undermines that federal protection, said James Slattery, a staff attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project.
""It would assume that if you knew the facts that made you ineligible to vote, even if you didn't know the law, casting that provisional ballot would essentially make you a criminal,"" he said.

Tennessee's legislature is considering a bill that would impose hefty financial penalties on groups that register voters if they submit too many improperly filled out forms.
Alex Wong/Getty Images Tennessee: ""We have never seen a bill like this""
In Tennessee, Republican lawmakers point to a surge of incomplete voter registration forms submitted in Memphis and Nashville during the run-up to the 2018 midterms as the motivation behind that state's legislation.
Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins said that under the state's current law, county election commissions are obligated to track down and verify incomplete registration forms.
""This is only going after folks that create chaos intentionally or knowingly,"" Goins told member station WPLN .
Elections Voters Approve Major Changes To Redistricting And Other Voting Laws The measure, which already passed in the state's House , is backed by Goins. It proposes fines of up to $10,000 for groups that pay people and that submit more than 500 incomplete forms, with lower penalties for fewer incomplete registration forms.
But for people who ""intentionally and knowingly"" submit incomplete forms, the bill suggests they could face misdemeanor charges.
The legislation would also require groups to turn in the forms within 10 days of the registration drive and would require training for people conducting voter registrations of over 100 people. Groups also wouldn't be allowed to pay campaign workers per registration form.
The risk of fines could deter people from organizing registration drives, said Tequila Johnson, the co-founder of the Equity Alliance, who said the bill is an attack on organizations like hers that focus on registering people of color.
""We have never seen a bill like this on the floor, until we dared to register 86,000 black and brown people to vote,"" Johnson said at a news conference in Nashville. ""This screams racism.""

Ralph Freso/Getty Images Ralph Freso/Getty Images Arizona voters at a Phoenix polling place on Nov. 6, 2018. Arizona is considering major changes to popular early voting rules, which could affect some 200,000 voters.
Ralph Freso/Getty Images Arizona: ""This is a service — it's a convenience""
The changes that Arizona Republicans are considering would focus on registered voters who have signed up to cast mail-in ballots but don't use them.
The bill would remove some people from what's called the Permanent Early Voting List. People on the PEVL get ballots mailed to them so they can mail the ballots back or drop them off on Election Day.
But Republican state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita wants counties to purge people from that list if they don't vote using an early ballot in two consecutive election cycles .
""We want to make sure that the lists are up to date. That's just good practice. That makes sense on, frankly, any kind of database that you have,"" she told a House committee. ""That you're really communicating with those who want to be communicated with and that are using the service. This is a service — it's a convenience.""
Politics Partisan Election Officials Are 'Inherently Unfair' But Probably Here To Stay Local election officials say that they already have ways to maintain clean voting rolls and that the proposed legislation will simply confuse voters. The Arizona secretary of state's office estimates that 200,000 voters currently on the early voting list did not vote in both 2016 and 2018. But the office also said the bill's language is unclear, making it hard to assess its potential impact.
Democratic Rep. Athena Salman called it voter suppression to purge the PEVL.
""There is a great debate around whether or not it is 'peh-vl' or 'pee-vl.' But I find it fitting that if this bill passes, the list will no longer be 'permanent,' and so one might call it 'evil,' "" she said.
Republicans dispute that this is an attempt to make voting more difficult. The bill doesn't remove people from the registration rolls, just the mailing list for early ballots.
Republican lawmakers have proposed other bills this legislative session that have drawn criticism from voting rights groups, including one that bans paying workers for each voter registration form they turn in.
""All Americans care about election integrity""
This latest round of legislation lands after a decade-long push by state-level Republicans for strict voter ID laws around the United States. Those laws were criticized by voting rights advocates for adding obstacles to casting a ballot that would particularly harm nonwhite and poor voters, although a recent academic study suggests the laws have had ""no negative impact on registration or turnout.""
Politics Georgia Set To Remain A Battleground For Voting Rights Ahead Of 2020 The stated basis that Republican lawmakers gave for many of those laws was to reduce the incidence of in-person voter fraud. Repeated research has unveiled scant evidence of anything more than a small number of instances of voters attempting to cast multiple ballots. But the repeated message that voter fraud was rampant has become a powerful motivator for Republican campaigns to turn out their own voters. Likewise, Democrats have also used potential threats to voting access to mobilize their own supporters.
But the impact of that push has been to increase partisanship and conflict around voting, the centerpiece of a democratic system.
Lawmakers often reexamine voting laws after an election, said Lang, of the Campaign Legal Center. For example, there was a bipartisan push from Iowa's Republican governor to make it easier for felons to restore their right to vote after release, although it ultimately failed. And Kansas, which had been ground zero for fights about election laws for years, recently passed a bipartisan voting law that will make it more convenient to cast a ballot.
""All Americans care about election integrity, and yet these issues get framed in very unhelpful partisan ways,"" Lang said.

Sri Lanka Blames Islamist Militant Group For Easter Attacks : NPR,www.npr.org,David Greene,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715944514/sri-lanka-blames-islamist-militant-group-for-easter-attacks,"Government officials in Sri Lanka say that a little-known Islamist extremist group is responsible for the Easter Sunday attacks that killed almost 300 people. No group has claimed responsibility.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Government officials in Sri Lanka are saying that a little-known Islamist extremist group is responsible for the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka yesterday. Almost 300 people were killed in bombings at churches and hotels in that small South Asian country. No group has come forward to claim responsibility, which is adding to a lot of confusion. Let's turn to NPR's Lauren Frayer, who is following this story from Mumbai. Hi, Lauren.
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Hi, David.
GREENE: Let's start off with this group that the government is saying is responsible. Who are they?
FRAYER: We know very little about them, actually. I mean, the world is Googling them right now. It's called the National Thowfeek Jamaath; it's a local Muslim group local to Sri Lanka - not a household name there. It was Sri Lanka's health minister who announced this. So it wasn't the president, nor the prime minister. The health minister said all seven suicide bombers were Sri Lankan nationals. He didn't explain how they know that. It's pretty fast timing if they have done DNA testing on remains, unless they knew exactly who these people were beforehand.
And in fact, that's what many politicians coming out of this emergency meeting today said; that there were warnings about this group possibly weeks and weeks in advance, and that they weren't raised to the highest level of government, that the prime minister was not made aware. And the prime minister himself seemed pretty angry. He called the security footing here inadequate.
And so while everyone's concentrating on this local group, a cabinet spokesman also came out with seemingly contradictory information, saying that this was the work of an international network, not confined to Sri Lanka. And so that left everyone really scratching their heads. I mean, both could be true - this could be locals with international help. And of course, as you mentioned, there's been no claim of responsibility to clarify that.
GREENE: So the government - not at all on the same page right now, at a moment when a lot of people are looking for soothing and answers. I guess we should say the authorities have taken, like, two dozen people in to custody at this point. So they are - they probably are learning something about what happened.
FRAYER: Yeah, so most likely they're interrogating those people. They haven't come out with any information and shared that with the public. We don't know who those people are - whether they're accomplices, even if they're local Sri Lankan nationals or outsiders. There was an explosion last night at a house on the outskirts of the capital, Colombo. Police were doing searches as part of their investigation, and suspects inside that house detonated a blast, killing themselves, rather than being taken into custody alive. Three officers were killed there.
So security operations are very much underway. Police found three more bombs in a van parked in a city on Sri Lanka's west coast today, near one of the churches that was hit yesterday. Those bombs exploded while police were diffusing them. They also found 87 detonators at a bus depot. So there's a feeling that this is, you know, very much still a kinetic operation.
GREENE: So this country, I mean, went through a civil war that ended, like, a decade ago. Now we have this small Islamist extremist group being accused of doing this, at least now. Would that make sense? I mean, did groups like this play a role in the war?
FRAYER: It's really unprecedented. The civil war was started with a separatist insurgency by ethnic minority Tamils, but secular ethnic minority - the Tamil Tigers was one of - the name of one of their groups, and they were fighting for independence from a Buddhist majority. But if this turns out to be a local Muslim group responsible, possibly with help from international militants, it would really be unprecedented.
GREENE: NPR's Lauren Frayer in Mumbai, telling us the latest from Sri Lanka. Lauren, thanks a lot.
FRAYER: You're welcome.

Franck Martin, ""Modular By The Golden Gate""
YouTube Franck Martin's innovative entry video was filmed near the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco using a 360 camera (view this video on YouTube for the full effect). His choice of instrument is just as creative: a portable modular synth. The sounds of the water crashing on the shore add to the improvisational nature of Martin's piece. Just like the tourists walking by in the video, we were stopped in our tracks watching this entry.
Her Treehouse, ""Fireflies""

U.S. Won't Renew Sanction Exemptions For Countries Buying Iran's Oil,www.npr.org,Bill Chappell,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715938722/u-s-wont-renew-sanction-exemptions-for-countries-buying-irans-oil,"U.S. Won't Renew Sanction Exemptions For Countries Buying Iran's Oil U.S. Won't Renew Sanction Exemptions For Countries Buying Iran's Oil Embed Embed < iframe src=""https://www.npr.org/player/embed/715938722/715943536"" width=""100%"" height=""290"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" title=""NPR embedded audio player""> Facebook Twitter
President Trump will not renew special waivers that have allowed Japan, China, India, Turkey and South Korea to import oil from Iran without running afoul of renewed U.S. sanctions, the White House announced Monday. The waivers are set to expire in early May.
The oil-importing countries have been benefiting from Significant Reduction Exceptions — temporary waivers the Trump administration has been issuing since the president withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran last year.
""This decision is intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue,"" press secretary Sarah Sanders said in an emailed statement.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the goal is also to ""incentivize Iran to behave like a normal country.""
""Before our sanctions went into effect, Iran would generate as much as $50 billion annually in oil revenue,"" Pompeo said as he detailed the policy change Monday morning.
Iran has issued a defiant response, with the state-owned Islamic Republic News Agency citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi saying that because Iran views the renewed U.S. sanctions as illegal, ""it basically gives no credit to exemptions from these sanctions.""
In addition to the five countries most directly affected by the change, Taiwan, Italy and Greece also have been importing Iranian oil under the U.S. sanctions exemptions since last November. But those countries have already moved to stop importing Iranian oil.
As for the potential effects of removing Iranian oil from the global market, Sanders said the U.S., along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and other allies, ""are committed to ensuring that global oil markets remain adequately supplied.""
In a briefing about the change, a senior administration official also said that the Trump administration believes that after months of warnings about the pending move, the global market have effectively already priced in the shift, citing a 2.5% rise in oil prices.
The Trump administration's decision to halt the exemptions could have the biggest effect in India and China — two of the biggest customers for Iran's oil industry.
Discussing the oil revenue Iran already has lost, the secretary added, ""The regime would have used that money to support terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, and continue its missile development, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolution 2231, and it would have perpetuated a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.""
The U.S. sanctions will continue until Iran agrees to address U.S. demands ""at the negotiating table,"" Pompeo said.
Sanders said by ending special exemptions for oil imports under the sanctions, the U.S. is proving its ""commitment to disrupting Iran's terror network and changing the regime's malign behavior.""
U.S. refusal to renew the exceptions for some of the world's most important economies is the latest phase of what the Trump administration calls its ""maximum economic pressure campaign"" against Iran. Two weeks ago, the White House said the U.S. will take the unprecedented step of officially designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization.
Iran has promised to retaliate for that move; its legislature is weighing a bill that would ""designate all U.S. intelligence and security forces operating in Western Asia as terrorists and stipulates that any form of support for them will constitute a terrorist act,"" the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday."

Yankees and Flyers Eject Kate Smith's 'God Bless America',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715918211/kate-smiths-god-bless-america-dropped-by-two-major-sports-teams,"Enlarge this image Singer Kate Smith signs autographs for a group of American sailors circa 1938.

Hulton Archive/Getty Images The singer Kate Smith's recording of ""God Bless America"" has been a cherished part of sports tradition in the U.S. for decades. But in the aftermath of a discovery that the singer also recorded at least two songs with racist content in the 1930s, two major American sports teams, baseball's New York Yankees and ice hockey's Philadelphia Flyers, have announced that they will stop playing Smith's rendition of the Irving Berlin patriotic classic. On Sunday, the Flyers also took down a statue of Smith that had stood in front of their stadium since 1987.
A fan alerted the Yankees last week that Smith had recorded at least two problematic songs — 1931's "" That's Why Darkies Were Born "" and 1933's "" Pickaninny Heaven ,"" from the film Hello, Everybody! — the New York Daily News reported on Thursday.
On Sunday, the Philadelphia Flyers removed a statue of Smith that had stood outside the team's arena since 1987, first at the Spectrum and later at the Xfinity Live! venue. Smith sang ""God Bless America"" live for the Flyers before Game 6 of the 1974 Stanley Cup finals — after which the Flyers beat the Boston Bruins. Since then, the Flyers had treated Smith's rendition as a talisman for the team.
YouTube In a statement published Sunday, Flyers President Paul Holmgren said, ""The NHL principle 'Hockey is for Everyone' is at the heart of everything the Flyers stand for. As a result, we cannot stand idle while material from another era gets in the way of who we are today.""
The statement also said: ""While Kate Smith's performance of 'God Bless America' cannot be erased from its place in Flyers history, that rendition will no longer be featured in our game presentations.""
On Friday, the Philadelphia team had covered the statue with black cloth. A spokesman for the Flyers told NBC10 in Philadelphia on Friday, ""We have recently become aware that several songs performed by Kate Smith contain offensive lyrics that do not reflect our values as an organization."" The spokesman added, ""As we continue to look into this serious matter, we are removing Kate Smith's recording of 'God Bless America' from our library and covering up the statue that stands outside of our arena.""
Smith's career spanned more than five decades and encompassed radio, multiple television shows under her name, commercials and over two dozen albums and hundreds of singles. But it seems that no official working for either team was aware of these two songs.
The Yankees had played Smith's recording of ""God Bless America"" during the seventh-inning stretch since shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A spokesperson told the Daily News last Thursday, ""The Yankees have been made aware of a recording that had been previously unknown to us and decided to immediately and carefully review this new information. The Yankees take social, racial and cultural insensitivities very seriously. And while no final conclusions have been made, we are erring on the side of sensitivity.""
Smith, who died in 1986 at age 79, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom — the United States' highest civilian honor — from President Ronald Reagan in 1982 in honor of her artistic and patriotic contributions. In his remarks, Reagan said : ""It's been truly said that one of the most inspiring things our GIs in World War II, Europe and the Pacific, and later in Korea and Vietnam, ever heard was the voice of Kate Smith — and the same is true for all of us. ... Those simple but deeply moving words, 'God bless America,' have taken on added meaning for all of us because of the way Kate Smith sang them. Thanks to her, they have become a cherished part of all our lives, an undying reminder of the beauty, the courage and the heart of this great land of ours.""
YouTube Smith was a foundational figure in pop culture during World War II and used her fame to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. government's war efforts. During one 18-hour broadcast on the CBS radio network alone, she helped raise more than $100 million in war bonds. (That would amount to more than $1.4 billion in 2019 dollars.)
YouTube In the 1933 film, Smith said that she was singing ""Pickaninny Heaven"" for ""a lot of little colored children, who are listening in at an orphanage in New York City."" The sequence includes shots of unkempt black children, while Smith sings of a ""pickaninny heaven"" where ""Mammy"" is waiting for them as well as ""great big watermelons.""
YouTube ""That's Why Darkies Were Born"" was written for a 1931 Broadway revue called ""George White's Scandals,"" a show that featured such stars of the time as Rudy Vallee and Ethel Barrymore.
Some critics have argued that the ""Darkies"" song was meant to be a satire of white supremacist ideas — and it was famous enough in its day to be referenced in the Marx Brothers film Duck Soup . But modern-day audiences inevitably cringe at lines like ""Someone had to pick the cotton / Someone had to plant the corn / Someone had to slave and be able to sing / That's why darkies were born.""
""That's Why Darkies Were Born"" was also recorded by the pioneering and revered black bass baritone Paul Robeson — who, in his contract for EMI between 1928 and 1939, recorded quite a few songs that many contemporary listeners will find very problematic, including ""De Li'l Pickaninny's Gone to Sleep,"" Stephen Foster's plantation songs and ""Poor Old Joe"" (aka ""Old Black Joe"")."

Russia seized two Ukrainian gunboats and a tug after firing on the vessels. Ukraine described the action as ""unprovoked and crazy."" At least three of their soldiers were injured.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
The geopolitical crisis in Ukraine is escalating. On Sunday, the Russian coast guard stopped and seized three Ukrainian naval vessels passing off the coast of Crimea. That, in turn, triggered protests in Ukraine. The U.N. Security Council is holding an emergency meeting about the situation today.
NPR's Lucian Kim reports from Moscow.
LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: When Russia seized Crimea in 2014, it took control over both sides of the Kerch Strait, a narrow bottleneck connecting the Black Sea to the much smaller Sea of Azov. In May, President Putin personally opened a bridge over the Kerch Strait, connecting the Crimean peninsula to the Russian mainland. The 12-mile-long Kerch bridge has become a symbol of Russia's claim to Crimea, which Ukraine and practically every other country in the world refuse to recognize.
(SOUNDBITE OF PLANES SOARING)
KIM: On Sunday, Russia dispatched warplanes to patrol the area after the Ukrainian navy tried to send three vessels through the Kerch Strait, meaning they'd have to pass under Putin's new bridge. Russia rammed one of the boats, opened fire on the other two and seized all three vessels along with their crews. There are conflicting reports that three or six Ukrainian crewmembers sustained injuries during the clash.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED FSB SPOKESMAN: (Foreign language spoken).
KIM: A spokesman for the FSB, Russia's federal security service, said the Ukrainian vessels were violating Russian territorial waters and had to be stopped.
Ukraine is already waging a low-level war against Kremlin-backed fighters in the eastern part of the country. After the naval clash, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called a late-night meeting with top security officials in Kiev.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT PETRO POROSHENKO: (Foreign language spoken).
KIM: Poroshenko said he would ask Parliament to approve the imposition of martial law because of what he called open Russian aggression. Martial law would allow an unpopular Poroshenko to postpone presidential elections in March.
Russian state television said Poroshenko provoked the incident in the Kerch Strait as a pretext to cancel the elections and possibly to scuttle an expected meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin later this week in Argentina.

Frank Franklin II/AP Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has issued another big policy proposal as part of her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. This one concerns higher education.
Election 2020: Opening Arguments Sen. Elizabeth Warren Blasts Big Tech, Advocates Taxing Rich In 2020 Race Warren proposes that the federal government write off hundreds of billions of dollars in existing student loan debt.
The amount of debt that would be eligible for forgiveness would vary by income, but an independent expert analysis submitted as part of her plan suggests that three-quarters of households would see all their federal student loans forgiven. In addition, the analysis notes, getting rid of this debt would reduce the racial wealth gap.
The debt-cancellation plan, according to her post on Medium , ""cancels $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with household income under $100,000,"" and ""provides substantial debt cancellation for every person with household income between $100,000 and $250,000.""
Beyond the student debt plan, Warren calls for eliminating tuition at all public two- and four-year colleges, an idea introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2016 presidential race. She would also create a fund of at least $50 billion specifically for historically black colleges and universities. And, she would cut off all federal subsidies to the for-profit college sector, which has been roiled by various scandals and large-scale closures in the past decade.
The projected total price tag: $1.25 trillion over 10 years. Warren says it would be paid for by a new tax on multimillionaires, and at least partially offset by new economic growth. Federal agencies have calculated in the past that the current $1.5 trillion of outstanding student loans could be impacting consumer spending and demand for mortgages — so canceling many of those loans could indeed goose the economy.
NPR Ed Fact-Check: Bernie Sanders Promises Free College. Will It Work? Warren is not the only 2020 Democratic primary candidate with ideas about lowering the cost of college. Besides Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, has called for ""debt- free college,"" and last year she, Warren, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York signed onto a bill called the ""Debt-Free College Act."" Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas has also backed free community college.
Warren's proposal, however, is unusual for the amount of debt she would cancel outright, as well as her idea to withdraw support from the for-profit college sector.
Warren also has a longer track record on this issue than most candidates. ""Student loan collectors have power that would make a mobster envious,"" she told the The Wall Street Journal back in 2005, when she was a Harvard law professor; she was referring in part to the lack of bankruptcy protection on these loans.
