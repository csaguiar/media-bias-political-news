Biden Apologizes for the Wrong Thing | The American Spectator,spectator.org,Debra J. Saunders,06-23-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/biden-apologizes-for-the-wrong-thing/,"Biden Apologizes for the Wrong Thing How was it bipartisan if they were all Democrats? Sen. Joe Biden in 1991 (Rob Crandall/Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by Scott McKay
J oe Biden backtracked on the wrong old thing.
Earlier this month, the former vice president abandoned his decadeslong support for the Hyde Amendment, a middle-ground measure that bans federal funding for most abortions. It was a reversal that showed Biden could be pushed into a progressive corner that demands choice for women who want abortions and denies it to those who do not want to bankroll a procedure that goes against their deeply held beliefs.
“I do not think it is good public policy, and I wish we never had a Hyde Amendment, but it is the law of the land right now,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week. No lie. Her own House passed a budget that included the Hyde Amendment without a single Republican vote — because they want the measure to pass the Senate. Thus, Biden’s position change puts him to the left of House Democrats.
So now, lest he walk back too many of his longtime planks and turn his entrance into the Democratic primary into a full-blown apology tour, Biden, 76, stuck with his rhetoric at a high-ticket fundraiser Tuesday night in New York. There, he waxed about the good old days in the Senate when the august body got things done.
In that spirit, he praised two racist segregationist senators — the late James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia — because “at least there was some civility” and commitment to get things done.
On the one hand, Democratic presidential hopefuls who pounced on Biden reflect the expectation in the progressive left that every politician enter the arena as pure as a virgin, untainted by the assumptions prevalent in the communities and eras in which they grew up — unless he or she grew up in a commune. In their world view, there is no such thing as people evolving. There are only good people (themselves) and bad people (those who disagree with them).
Hence, they are happy to turn reflecting the values of America in the 1970s and 1980s into a capital offense for public officeholders. That’s no way to win at the ballot box.
When Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., suggested Biden should apologize, Biden responded, “Apologize for what?” And: “There’s not a racist bone in my body.” (He sounded a lot like President Donald Trump saying he’s “the least racist person you’ve ever met.”) Biden added: “I’ve been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period, period, period.”
The Washington Post undercut that claim Friday with a story about Biden’s alliance with Eastland when Biden was a freshman senator who opposed court-ordered desegregation and busing.
On the issue of busing, I happen to agree with Biden. I saw busing fail the black students who were bused to my white suburban public school district in the 1960s. It was a well-intended but cruelly ineffective policy that put adolescents in buses for hours every day so that they could attend classes for which they were unprepared, through no fault of their own.
I don’t think Biden could voice a like viewpoint in this 2020 primary.
That said, then-Sen. Barack Obama surely was aware of Biden’s warts, and still he chose the Delaware Democrat to be his running mate. To the casual voter, a Democrat tossing out the racist charge against the vice president to the country’s first African-American president has to appear completely over-the-top.
Here’s another odd element in Biden talking fondly of hardcore Southern Democratic segregationists as great examples of civil legislators. The problem in politics today, Biden said, is, “You look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.” If his point is that he can work across the aisle, Biden should have named actual Republicans, not Eastland and Talmadge, who were Democrats.
Instead, Biden spoke as if his brain had airbrushed the D’s after the senators’ names. Likewise, MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt described Biden’s favorable remarks about “two former Republican colleagues.” She later corrected the record.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand offered she didn’t think Biden “should be bragging about working on a bipartisan basis with segregationists.” But it wasn’t bipartisan. It was one party working with itself — like all of Washington today.

Monsignor Rossi Boots Me From D.C. Basilica on Corpus Christi Sunday,spectator.org,George Neumayr,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/monsignor-rossi-boots-me-from-d-c-basilica-on-corpus-christi-sunday/,"Monsignor Rossi Boots Me From D.C. Basilica on Corpus Christi Sunday I have been told that it is a “five year ban.” by Scott McKay
A rchbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the whistle-blowing former papal nuncio to the U.S., recently confirmed my scoop from last year that Monsignor Walter Rossi, who runs the Basilica of the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, is an accused gay predator.
“‘Monsignor Rossi is, without a doubt, a member of the ‘gay mafia.’ You can read about him online on The American Spectator website,” Viganò told the Italian journalist Marco Tosatti.
“I can say that, while I was a nuncio in the United States, I received the documentation that states that Msgr. Rossi had sexually molested male students at the Catholic University of America,” according to Viganò. “The Vatican, in particular Cdl. [Pietro] Parolin, is well aware of the situation of Msgr. Rossi, as is Cdl. Wuerl. I can finally testify that Rossi’s name was proposed for promotion to my predecessor, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, who blocked his progress.”
Fearing my investigation of the gay mafia, Rossi last year put me on the Basilica’s Most Wanted list — an internal security memo/poster I discovered that instructedits security detail to call the police if they saw me on the premises. I never received any notice of the duration or rationale of the ban. So when I went to the Basilica on Corpus Christi Sunday and trotted along in its procession, I didn’t know for certain if Rossi would boot me from the Basilica. But he did.
His security guards had been casting meaningful glances at me during the Mass and shadowed me wherever I went. Then they called the police, who turned up near Rossi’s Lexus in his special parking spot near the Basilica’s doors. But it was left to the director of security to do the deed. “I need to talk to you,” she said to me, looking very grave, as if I wasn’t a journalist and Catholic but a member of ISIS (the security also ludicrously flanked Rossi, as if he was in mortal danger).
“You are barred from the Basilica,” she said, “which means you are not supposed to be here. I am going to ask you to leave.” The woman’s name is Valencia Camp, who, a quick Google search reveals, is tied to various Rossi retainers (one of whom lives in an apartment that Rossi was once listed at).
Camp informed me that I have been banned “for five years,” and that the “bar notice is with the Metropolitan Police.” What, I asked, are the grounds for the order? She wouldn’t answer: “I need you off the property.” Does the Basilica, I also asked, have a policy of banning journalists (which is not exactly in keeping with the supposedly “transparent” Church of Pope Francis)? “When their behavior is inappropriate,“ she replied, but wouldn’t specify what inappropriate actions I had ever committed. I also asked her, given that the ban baldly violates my canonical rights as a Catholic to frequent the sacraments, what authority Rossi has to ban me from a Catholic church. She responded with bureaucratic babble and secularism: “This is a civil issue with the police.” (The police have never contacted me and I never received a “barring order” stipulating that I can’t step on to the property for five years. My interchange with Camp can be seen on my iPhone video below, which at o1:33 also includes a nice shot of Rossi’s Lexus.) https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Neumayr-Camp-video-20190623_134604_002.mp4
Rossi is a protégé of two confirmed frauds and out-of-control gay clericalists, Michael Bransfield and Theodore McCarrick. He learned at their knees how to treatthe Basilica as his personal fiefdom. Because Rossi sees the Church’s “property” ashis own, he feels no hesitation in violating the canonical rights of a Catholic simply because he doesn’t want to be questioned by him about Viganò’s charges and other sordid matters.
Were the Church to investigate Rossi, as it investigated his patrons, it would find the same pattern of squalor, greed, manipulation, and homosexual harassment. Viganò has established at the very least that he received complaints about Rossi’s predation. The faithful have a right to ask about those charges. Rossi also sits on the board of Catholic University, which, were his misdeeds heterosexual, would have landed him on the front page of the Washington Post a long time ago.
I had heard rumors last year that the Post was asking questions about Rossi, but of course it never produced a piece. The bulb on the Post ’s “spotlight” isn’t even flickering. In hock to the Catholic left and sympathetic to the spread of homosexuality within the Church, the Post ’s religion reporters haven’t even reported on Viganò’s comments about Rossi. Never mind that it is obviously relevant D.C.-related news for a D.C. paper. For the Post , the “Me Too”movement simply doesn’t extend to homosexuals, one of its favorite minority groups. But imagine if Viganò had said he received complaints about a prominent priest who was hitting on the CUA cheerleading team. The press and Catholic U’s president would respond with an immediate investigation.
For now, Rossi enjoys the PC immunity of the press and the protection of the utterly hypocritical Church of Pope Francis, which preaches poverty by day and practices decadence by night. Pope Francis goes on and on about “self-interested clericalism” than protects and promotes its most obvious practitioners. The McCarrick-Bransfield-Rossi triumvirate, with its beach houses, boy toys, and ballooning bank accounts, resembled nothing less than self-interested clericalism on steroids.
The principal celebrant at the Mass, by the way, was Monsignor Charles Antonicelli, who served as vicar general and moderator of the curia under the disgraced Donald Wuerl. Rossi introduced him rather pompously at the beginning of the Mass, noting that Antonicelli in effect had been Wuerl’s chief of staff and now serves as (Wuerl successor) Wilton Gregory’s. How is that for business as usual? Viganò had Antonicelli sized up, famously noting that Wuerl “lies shamelessly” and “prevails” upon Antonicelli to “lie as well.”
Rossi hopes to hide behind those lies, and who knows maybe he can gut it out under the corruption of Francis, for whom “making a mess” applies not to angry orthodox Catholics but to wayward priests and left-wing activists. With one hand, Rossi invites Nancy Pelosi and company to Communion; with the other, he calls the police and his praetorian guard on me."
Why the Dems Will Never Win Back Trump Voters,spectator.org,David Catron,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/why-the-dems-will-never-win-back-trump-voters/,"Why the Dems Will Never Win Back Trump Voters Their cartoonish image of the President’s base dooms them to failure.
I t’s an article of faith among Democrats that the President’s base consists primarily of white working class voters without college degrees, and that they must be won back in order to beat Trump in 2020. This is why Elizabeth Warren inflicted that cringe-making, “I’m gonna get me a beer,” video on a long-suffering electorate. It is why Joe Biden, who reputedly enjoys a special rapport with blue collar voters, is the frontrunner for his party’s presidential nomination despite his penchant for gaffes and plagiarism. Thus, during this week’s Democratic debates, the candidates will devote considerable effort to courting the “deplorables.”
This will, however, be an exercise in futility because everything they believe about Trump’s base is false. Their view of this large and growing segment of the electorate is distorted by a myth concocted primarily by the media to explain away a deeply uncomfortable reality — that Trump possessed a better understanding of the public mood than did the professional political class. They were unable to abandon their preconceived notions about Trump and his supporters, despite easily accessible contrary data. The belief that his message was resonating only among the working class was debunked by Nate Silver as early as May of 2016:
It’s been extremely common for news accounts to portray Donald Trump’s candidacy as a “working-class” rebellion against Republican elites.… But the definition of “working class” and similar terms is fuzzy, and narratives like these risk obscuring an important and perhaps counterintuitive fact about Trump’s voters: As compared with most Americans, Trump’s voters are better off. The median household income of a Trump voter so far in the primaries is about $72,000.
That figure wasn’t merely above the national median household income, it was higher than the median income for Hillary Clinton’s supporters. Silver went on to point out that the general portrayal of Trump’s voters as uneducated also failed to conform to the facts: “About 44 percent of Trump supporters have college degrees… higher than the 33 percent of non-Hispanic white adults, or the 29 percent of American adults overall, who have at least a bachelor’s degree.” Blue collar workers were a real and valuable cohort of the President’s supporters, but the financial and educational make up of his base was more complex than most acknowledged.
Yet, even a guy as smart as National Review ’s Kevin Williamson succumbed to the Never Trump delusion that Trump’s supporters were a bunch of white trash losers. In an essay published in the spring of 2016, he snarled , “Donald Trump’s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.” Even after Trump won the Republican nomination, the legacy media, the Never Trumpers, and the Clinton campaign clung desperately to their belief that his supporters were a contemptible collection of irredeemable, uneducated homophobes, xenophobes, and racists. They were, as Clinton famously phrased it , “a basket of deplorables.”
Normally, even a candidate as politically inept as Hillary Clinton wouldn’t be dumb enough to publicly insult the customers, but the polls and the projections of all the experts indicated she was a sure winner. The most pessimistic estimate of her chances came from Nate Silver, who indicated that she had a 71 percent chance of winning. So, she had every reason to believe that she could get away with an honest declaration of the malice with which she regarded the voters who failed to support her. And, like the “expert” projections, all the polls suggested that she was right. Fortunately, they were wrong. Why? The Washington Examiner reports :
But there’s one factor when it comes to Trump that no poll will ever be able to register: the tendency of a substantial number of his supporters to lie. The American Psychological Association released a study in May of 1,000 American voters who said after the 2016 election that they voted for a different candidate than the one they had publicly said they would. Among the study’s participants, 27% secretly voted for Clinton, but an astounding 54% voted for Trump.
This brings us back to the 2020 presidential election. The polls were wrong in 2016 because there was, essentially, a reverse “Bradley effect.” And it probably still skews the polls, even after Trump has been president for well over two years. Trump’s supporters are routinely slandered, in the legacy news media and on social media platforms, as morally repugnant reprobates or just too stupid to understand how to vote in their own best interests. There is no easier way to render a room silent at a social occasion or start an altercation at a family gathering than to praise President Trump or anything he has accomplished — no matter how benign.
In other words, supporting Trump simply isn’t the done thing in polite society. To do so is to risk loss of social status — if not outright ostracism — and open conflict with friends or family. Trump supporters mislead pollsters or simply refuse to answer their questions pursuant to similar psychological and social incentives. All of which leads to a lot of confusion concerning who it is that supports President Trump and precisely why. This, in turn, renders it very difficult for round heel politicians like Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren to pander to “working class” voters they badly need to “win back” to the Democratic fold in the 2020 election cycle.
Warren will no doubt get her a beer, grab a copy of her DNA test, and seek the advice of the Cherokee tribal elders. Biden, having learned from the media that Trump supporters are all racists, may pour himself two fingers of Scotch and try to imagine what his segregationist mentors James Eastland and Herman Talmadge would do in similar circumstances. In the end, however, it doesn’t really make very much difference. Trump voters all have at least one thing in common. They know that not a single Democrat on that NBC stage Wednesday or Thursday can be trusted — as Talmadge might have put it — in an outhouse with a muzzle on."
Corn at the Pump,spectator.org,Geoffrey Norman,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/corn-at-the-pump/," T here was a time — and not so long ago — when America’s leaders would say that we were “addicted to oil,” and warn us that we could not “drill our way out of this.” This turned out to be a) simpleminded, b) patronizing, and c) wrong. Pretty much par for the course, then. So of course the solutions for meeting the crisis, as prescribed by our political class, were either ineffectual or just wrong as both science and economics. The politics, though, were another thing. One proposed remedy that we were promised would help us avoid an energy crisis severe enough to crush the economy was… burn corn, not oil. American farmers have no trouble growing things. Never have. They are famously hardworking, resourceful, and innovative. We don’t have food scarcity in America. We have surpluses. American agriculture inspired an industry of farm equipment and machinery that is supreme in the world. John Deere. New Holland. Massey Ferguson. So it seemed simple enough to replace the oil we couldn’t extract from the ground with a bi-product of the things we could make grow out of it. That would be ethanol. And Americans surely did know how to make that. They had been doing it right from the nation’s beginning, turning American corn into American bourbon. Mostly legal. Sometimes not. In which case it was called moonshine, the scientific and boring name for which is “ethanol.” It also works with the internal combustion engine. The car you drive burns the stuff. So do your lawnmower, chainsaw, and outboard. With less satisfactory results. Ethanol is not generally kind to two stroke engines. A small engine mechanic I know says the stuff doesn’t just keep him in business. It pays for his vacations. Still, during the “peak oil” panic, the government began mandating ( viz: forcing) refiners of petroleum to add a certain percentage of ethanol to the gasoline they produced. Gasoline cut with ethanol would go further and ease the inevitable transition to electric vehicles and the more immediate, and dire effects of the looming scarcity and the global warming crisis. Authorities like Al Gore promised that producing enough ethanol and blending it with gasoline in the right proportions might help us avoid prices of four dollars a gallon, and more, at the pump. If it caused problems with small engines… well, small price. So refiners were now obligated, by law, to add ethanol to the gasoline they produced and that was generally available at the pump. American drivers had no choice but to buy it and burn it. American farmers predictably began planting corn, fencerow to fencerow, as far as the eye could see. After all, they had a market that was guaranteed by the government. Instead of “If you build it, they will come,” it was “If you grow it, they will blend.” Meanwhile, the petroleum industry had decided it would not simply lie down and die and was saying, “Peak oil, my butt. You think we can’t drill our way out of this? Here, hold my beer and watch.” America soon became the world’s largest producer of crude. Where we had once been obliged to bow down to “our good friends” the Saudis to be sure of those millions of barrels of imported crude, we were now exporting the stuff. We are blessed with an abundance of both ethanol and crude oil. Good news, right? A situation where markets could do their magic. Well… The thing is, those farmers who had gone all in on corn for ethanol — and the refiners who had built an industry to service them — were now a political dependency and they were not going down without a fight. Mandated ethanol was, to them, a matter of first, prosperity, and then, survival. Instead of doing away with the requirement, they wanted to strengthen it. Their instrument would be government, in the form of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is positioned to raise the allowable percentage of ethanol in gasoline. From ten to fifteen. When he was campaigning in Iowa, President Trump promised his support for the rule change. It would, of course, be good for Iowa’s farmers and the refiners who bought their corn and turned it into ethanol. The refiners of petroleum, on the other hand, were opposed to paying for even more of something that wouldn’t really improve their product or lower their price. There are escape clauses in the ethanol regulations that allow the EPA to exempt some small oil refiners from the ethanol mandates and the Trump administration had been using them to grant more and more waivers. The ethanol industry, unsurprisingly, opposes this. It is all classically and convolutedly fertile ground for the kind of big money lobbying and log rolling that has made Washington so admired in the eyes of the people over which it presumes to rule. Those people find it difficult to understand the logic of Washington’s decisions and to follow the maneuvers of the lawyers and lobbyists and politicians who craft those decisions. They don’t grow corn and they don’t pump oil. But they know exactly how the two should be blended for the betterment of us all. And mass production of ethanol, which even Al Gore now says was a mistake, will be with us forever."
The Tampa Bay Travelers?,spectator.org,Larry Thornberry,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-tampa-bay-travelers/,"
T ampa
Silliness, pretention, greed, mendacity, and guile stalk the land. No, no, no, I’m not talking about the reinforced platoon of Democrats who have announced their desire to be America’s next president, though this scrum is guilty of all of the above. (The answer to the question, “How many Democrats are running for president this year?” is the same as the answer to the question, “How many Baldwin brothers are there?” That answer is: “No one knows for sure. But there’s A LOT of them.”) I’m instead referring to the Tampa Bay Rays daft plan to play half of their home games in Montreal and half in St. Petersburg.
That’s right, a Major League Baseball team with two home towns, two stadiums, two fan bases, even two languages. All in the name of improving attendance for a team which, even when it’s winning, sells fewer tickets than a Wayne Newton concert. (Tune in to a Rays game from Tropicana Field and when the camera pans the nearly empty stadium you’re likely to see the Maytag repair man. Sitting alone, of course.) For most of the team’s history it has been either last or next to last in attendance. The Rays’ average home attendance of a little better than 14K this year is the lowest in MLB save for the Miami Marlins, which Derek Jeter and his new ownership group stripped of almost all baseball talent and most of its player salary before last season.
Rays owner Stu Sternberg, in accordance with a Major League Sports Franchise Owner Union work rule, never ceases hounding Tampa and/or St. Petersburg to build him a new ball yard at taxpayer expense. It would have to be at taxpayer expense as the Rays have shown no interest in putting up more than a trifling amount of the extravagant cost of its plant and equipment. At the current going rate for a stadium that includes all the revenue-enhancing bells and whistles Sternberg wants, it would take about a billion dollars to fill his begging bowl.
Both Tampa and St. Petersburg have made it clear there is no local appetite for buying Sternberg the sports palace he dreams of. This is the backdrop of the two-language hairball the Rays and Major League Baseball coughed up last Thursday, when it was announced that MLB had given Sternberg and his ownership group permission to explore this daft sports polygamy. Under the plan, the Rays (and/or whatever they would be called in French Canada) would play their early season games in St. Petersburg and then, when it gets really hot in St. Petersburg, they would play the remainder of their games in Montreal.
There may have been more crackpot sports ideas floated, maybe even enacted, over the past century. But it would take a while to think of one. Sternberg claims this time-share plan is an effort to keep baseball in the Tampa Bay area long-term. If we still had phone booths, we could get everyone who believes this into one with room left over for Aaron Judge. Bay Area officials have treated the idea with the contempt it deserves.
“Sharing this team with Montreal is not an option on the table,” St. Petersburg mayor Rick Kriseman said Thursday. “I’m tired of all the games that are being played related to getting a new stadium built. We all deserve better and should not take this too seriously. This is just the latest chapter in the book of negotiations.” He summed up economically with, “This is getting a bit silly.”
Just so.
Here are just a few of the inconvenient truths that disable the two-homeport scam:
The two-city plan would require both Montreal and Tampa or St. Petersburg to build a new ball yard for a part-time team. None of these cities has demonstrated any appetite to spend tax money on a pricey ML ball park. Sternberg argues the Florida park would not need to be an enclosed park as the games would be played here before the heat and rainy season begins in mid-June. Hard to imagine any city uninterested in spending a billion dollars for an 81-game home season would be willing to spend two-thirds of that amount for 35 or 40 games.
The Montreal/Tampa Bay split would be between two places where baseball has failed. After 35 years in Montreal, the Expos became the Washington Nationals.
Hard to imagine that the Major League players union would hold still for obliging Rays players to have two homes during the summer. There would be serious logistic, expense, and tax complications. And pity the poor Hispanic players from south of the border, already struggling with English, and now obliged to learn French.
The Rays are locked into a lease with the City of St. Petersburg obliging them to play all their home games there through the 2027 season.
There’s more, but you get the idea.
To add more daffiness to an already daft plan, the Rays have scheduled a press conference for 2 p.m. Tuesday where, presumably, Stu and his merry men will try to put lipstick on this pig. They’ve decided to hold the conference at the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg. How appropriate. A truly nutty idea flogged in a building dedicated to a nutter. Looking at old Salvador’s paintings, not to mention that goofy mustache, I’ve always thought he was pulling our legs. Clearly, so is Stu. Hard to decide which is more surreal, this idea or Salvador’s “work.”
When encountering ideas that are so daft it’s impossible to take them seriously, one should be alert to the possibility that they were never meant to be taken seriously. This is almost certainly the case here. The smart money hereabouts is that Sternberg et al. long ago made the decision to leave the Tampa Bay area, probably even before the still-born effort to get a new stadium in Tampa. All the talk from Sternberg about other sites and about this Florida/Canada open marriage, it’s hard to resist, is just posturing.
Sternberg has probably seen that attendance will never significantly improve here. (Why it’s so low is a subject for another day.) There’s no chance here of a boffo TV contract. And the corporate base here is too thin to provide the kind of corporate support that is so important in the insane economics of all Major League sports today. Ergo he’s not going to get his new ball yard. Sternberg, of Rye, New York by way of Brooklyn, was a successful Wall Street salesman and investor before he bought the Rays. He’s too smart and too savvy not to see that the baseball numbers in Tampa just don’t add up. His interest is almost certainly not in selling this ridiculous plan, but to either find a city gullible enough to build him the ball yard he wants – be it Montreal, San Antonio, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Portland, or Keokuk – or to find an ownership group willing to pay a price he finds agreeable for the team.
As a lifetime fan of the Grand Old Game, I’m sorry MLB didn’t work here. But it hasn’t. I’m weary of Sternberg and MLB trying to hold up local residents for hundreds of millions of tax dollars for the benefit of rich players and even richer owners. I’m more than ready to say to Stu and the boys, “Good bye, God’s speed, and ya’ll drive careful, y’hear?”"
