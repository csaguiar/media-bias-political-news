Cher tweets about wanting President Trump to be sexually assaulted — and deletes the tweet after realizing her horrific mistake. But she's not apologizing.,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cher-tweet-trump-sexually-assaulted,"Entertainer Cher suggested during a Thursday morning Twitter tirade that President Donald Trump be sexually assaulted in prison.
She later backed down when she apparently realized making jokes about sexual assault isn't OK no matter who you are.
What are the details? In a since-deleted tweet , the 73-year-old performer wrote , ""Been giving impeachment much thought throughout the day & I would [love] 2 see Trump impeached, brought 2 trial, [locked] up in [chains], & boy toy of Big Bubba.""
The offending tweet was captured by the Daily Mail before she deleted it.
The performer's tweet came on the heels of special counsel Robert Mueller's statement Wednesday reiterating the findings of his office's report. During a news conference, Mueller also announced that he would be closing his office and resigning. You can read more about Mueller's news conference here .
Former CNN host and current ""Good Morning Britain"" anchor Piers Morgan took exception to Cher's remarks, and pointed out what he believed to be liberal hypocrisy.
On Twitter, Morgan wrote , ""BREAKING: Cher says she wants President Trump to be raped in prison as 'Toy boy of Big Bubba.' Disgusting, and if she'd said it about Obama she would never work again.""
Following backlash for the remark, Cher deleted the tweet and issued a clarification, admitting that she has to ""check"" herself on occasion. In the tweet, however, the entertainer was adamant that her follow-up was not an apology.
"" This is Not Apology,It's a Cher 'wtf Moment'.Dont Usually Delete My Twts,But Sometimes I Need 2 Check Myself.What I Thought Of As Stupid Joke'On Paper',Went 2 Far.Think trump Belongs In Jail,but Big Bubba Joke Was Wrong.If I Twt,I Have a Responsibility,"" she wrote. ""THERES IS A LINE NOT 2."""
China has stopped buying US soybeans during ongoing trade dispute - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-has-stopped-buying-us-soybeans-during-ongoing-trade-dispute,"China has stopped all purchases of U.S. soybeans as the trade dispute between the two countries continues.
What's the background? In March 2018, President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum to the United States, citing national security concerns. China retaliated to this by announcing tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. This triggered an escalating series of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs announced by both countries.
After a temporary truce in December, trade negotiations seem to have again broken down.
On Thursday, Bloomberg News reported that China was putting all future purchases of soybeans from the United States on hold. Existing orders have reportedly not been cancelled.
Before the tariffs, China was the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, purchasing $12.25 billion worth of the product in 2017. Since then, this number has continued to decrease. At the start of the 2018-19 marketing year, U.S. exports of soybeans to China had dropped by 97 percent.
Of course, soybeans are just one part of a larger picture. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. exports to China overall in the first three months of 2019 were down by $17.1 billion compared to the same time period in 2018,
After the trade war cease-fire in December, China had bought roughly 13 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States.
What's next? With the loss of the Chinese market, U.S. soybean producers have been forced to sell their beans at discounted prices to Iran . Although the U.S. government has imposed tough sanctions on Iranian banking, energy, and shipping sectors, these do not apply to agricultural commodities.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture paid out $7.7 billion in aid compensate farmers for both the loss of their export market and the increased prices of farming equipment made with steel and aluminum."
Giving cash to panhandlers could cost you $50 in this New Jersey city - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/newark-ticketing-drivers-giving-money-to-panhandlers,"Police have begun ticketing drivers who give money to panhandlers in the city of Newark, New Jersey.
City officials claim that the new ordinance is intended to make the roadways safer for drivers, pedestrians, and those begging for money, WLNY-TV reported.
""People are well-meaning and want to help, but this is a safety issue,"" Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose told the news station. ""We have panhandlers wading into traffic at busy exit ramps off Route 280 or on McCarter Highway, which jeopardizes their own health. We had a female pedestrian killed on McCarter Highway just a few weeks ago.""
Ambrose added that handing out cash to homeless people often causes more problems than it helps.
""When a driver stops and gives a panhandler money, they're basically helping them feed bad habits,"" Ambrose said. ""We want to discourage this, but while offering these panhandlers significant and meaningful help.""
In recent weeks, police have cited nearly 100 drivers and 250 panhandlers. Violators face a $50 fine, plus the cost of court fees.
What is the city doing to help the homeless? The new law is part of the city's overall strategy to help the homeless population.
Newark Hope One, a police mobile unit launched in December, goes into the neighborhoods where the homeless gather and offers critical services to help them get off the streets.
""I'm pleased Hope One Newark is making an impact in meeting the needs of those addicted, suffering from mental illness or living homeless,"" Ambrose said. ""We're coming to them, and giving them a pathway to improve their lives.""
The mobile services unit has helped more than 120 people so far in 2019, Ambrose told Essex Daily Voice ."

""It wasn't anything about not getting the credit; it was more so the language that was very inappropriate and not acceptable for a teacher whatsoever,"" she told the station, adding that the teacher should be held accountable.
""I think for sure she needs to be reprimanded,"" Smith told WJHG. ""I believe that something should be placed in her file.""
The station said the teacher from the Springfield school doesn't want to respond publicly to the situation.
What does the school's principal have to say?
Principal Coy Pilson told WJHG the teacher's name isn't being released but steps are being taken to deal with the incident.

Pilson added to the station that the teacher ""was apologetic"" and called the deed ""a mistake on her part."" But he also told WJHG all his teachers are ""caring"" and ""loving"" but ""also human.""

"Nancy Pelosi slams President Trump's 'merit-based' immigration plan, then takes a jab at first lady's parents who immigrated to US",www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-slams-trump-immigration-plan-and-first-ladys-family,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) slammed President Donald Trump's merit-based immigration proposal, followed by a jab at Slovenia-born first lady Melania Trump's parents.
""When the president says merit, turn it upside down, that means make America white again,"" Pelosi said during an event at the Commonwealth Club of California in San Francisco on Wednesday, the Huffington Post reported.
""I don't know if merit counted for when his wife's family came into the country,"" Pelosi continued. ""I don't know, maybe it did. God bless them if it did. But he calls that chain migration, which he wants to get rid of.
""Should we attach a green card to the diploma of so many scientists and engineers and all the rest and graduate students who train in the U.S. so that they can stay here?"" Pelosi asked. ""Of course. But that's not the point. The point is that the president does not share the view of even Ronald Reagan and two Bushes in recent history.""
When did Melania Trump's parents become citizens? The first lady's parents, Viktor, 74, and Amalija Knavs, 72, became U.S. citizens last summer.
They had waited years for their green cards, according to The Hill. A green card allows foreign nationals to live and work in the country permanently. Once the couple became eligible, they applied for citizenship.
Melania reportedly came to America on an Einstein visa, which is offered to ""individuals of extraordinary ability,"" as a model.
After Melania gained permanent residency status, she applied for citizenship. In 2006, she took the oath to become a naturalized U.S. citizen.
""In Melania Trump's case, it took years for her to become an American citizen, then years for her to petition for her family and they went through the process, passing all of the American citizenship questions and everything just like any other person,"" Michael Wildes, the first lady's attorney, told The Hill in an earlier interview.
What is the president's immigration plan? President Trump introduced his American workers' first immigration plan on May 16. Here's what he said during his speech in the White House Rose Garden:
American citizenship is the most precious gift our nation has to offer when we swear in new citizens we do more than give them a permit we give them a history, a heritage, a home, and a future of limitless possibilities and potential.
We are proposing an immigration plan that puts the jobs, wages, and safety of American workers first.
Our plan achieves two critical goals. First, it stops illegal immigration and fully secures the border and second it establishes a new legal immigration system that protects American wages promotes American values and attracts the best and brightest from all around the world.
Every year we admit 1.1 million immigrants as permanent legal residents. These green card holders get lifetime authorization to live and work here and a five-year path to American citizenship this is the most prized citizenship anywhere in the world by far.
Our proposal fulfills our sacred duty to those living here today while ensuring America remains a welcoming country to immigrants joining us tomorrow and we want immigrants coming in. We cherish the open door that we want to create for our country but a big proportion of those immigrants must come in through merit and skill to protect benefits for American citizens immigrants must be financially self-sufficient.
Finally to promote integration assimilation and national unity future immigrants will be required to learn English and to pass a civics exam prior to admission. Through these steps, we will deliver an immigration system that respects and even strengthens our culture our traditions and our values. Trump Debuts Bold New Immigration Plan youtu.be"
California Assembly passed a bill limiting use of force by police — but Black Lives Matter is not on board,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-use-of-force-bill,"California's state Assembly unanimously passed a bill targeting the use of force by police officers in the state — but only after a series of compromises that ultimately led to Black Lives Matter pulling its support from the legislation.
What's the story? Before this legislation could be passed, it had to have changes made that had been requested by law enforcement. Among these changes were the removal of definition of the word ""necessary"" from the bill's outline of when deadly force would be allowed and the removal of wording that would require police to try to de-escalate a situation before using deadly force.
The state Senate is expected to pass the legislation as well (possibly with additional amendments), and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom (who has called the bill ""important"") has indicated that he is prepared to sign it into law.
Under the guidelines laid out in this bill, the actions of a police officer in the time leading up to a fatal encounter could be investigated. Currently, only the moments immediately around the shooting can be looked at. It also limits when lethal force is permissible.
But former supporters worry that the wording of the bill is vague enough to force the courts to deal with sorting out the details down the road. And this, they argue, might have to wait until someone else is killed by police.
Which groups pulled out? In addition to Black Lives Matter, a group based in northern California that represented the families of people killed by police also pulled its support from the legislation.
Laurie Valdez, the partner of Antonio Guzman Lopez who was killed by police in 2014, called the new version of the law ""a slap in our face.""
""Another person is going to have to die before we can prove that this bill is not going to do what you think it's going to do,"" she told the Los Angeles Times ."
Disney CEO suggests that the company may stop filming in Georgia over abortion law: 'Don't see how it's practical',www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/disney-ceo-suggests-that-the-company-may-stop-filming-in-georgia-over-abortion-law,"Disney CEO Bob Iger says that he is considering the idea of pulling filming from Georgia over its recently passed, restrictive abortion law.
What did he say? During an interview with Reuters , Iger said that it would be ""very difficult"" for Disney to continue production within the state if the new law takes effect.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed the bill into law earlier in May. The measure is set to go into effect on January 1.
""I rather doubt we will,"" Iger said of filming in the state. ""I think many people who work for us will not want to work there, and we will have to heed their wishes in that regard. Right now, we are watching it very carefully.""
He added, ""I don't see how it's practical for us to continue to shoot there.""
Gov. Kemp recently blasted the burgeoning entertainment boycott, comprised of liberal celebrities insisting that women's rights are being trampled upon with the law's passage.
""I understand that some folks don't like this new law,"" he said during a recent news conference. ""I'm fine with that. We're elected to do what's right — and standing up for precious life is always the right thing to do.
""We value and protect innocent life,"" he said, ""even though that makes C-list celebrities squawk.""
According to Reuters, blockbuster hits like ""Avengers: Endgame"" and ""Black Panther"" were filmed in Georgia.
Anything else? Netflix voiced a similar position earlier this week, and insisted that the company is also considering pulling production out of the Peach State.
In a statement, Ted Sarandos, the company's chief content officer, said, ""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this. It's why we work with the ACLU and others to fight it in court. Given the legislation has not yet been implemented we'll continue to film there — while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to."""

""You know, sometimes I think we're hurt by saying ... we hurt our boys by calling something 'toxic masculinity,' I do,"" Streep said, ""and identifying those and putting those two words together ... because women can be pretty f***ing toxic.""
The audience laughed, and Streep promptly assured the other panelists she was not referring to them.

"Man gets released from jail and, less than hour later, allegedly attacks 91-year-old woman. Man goes back to jail.",www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-gets-released-from-jail-hours-later-is-back-in-jail,"A man is behind bars — again — after he reportedly attacked a 91-year-old woman less than an hour after being released from an Arizona jail.
Thanks to a fast-acting neighbor, the woman didn't suffer serious injuries, KNXV-TV reported.
Danny Nicholas, 36, allegedly forced his way into the elderly's woman's home, knocked her to the ground, and tried to steal the wedding ring off her finger.
When neighbor Catherine Mason saw what was happening, she quickly jumped into action and rescued the woman from her attacker.
What are the details? Authorities released Nicholas from the Scottsdale city jail at about 11:35 a.m. on May 20, according to police.
At about 12:15 p.m., he reportedly knocked on the elderly woman's door and asked her for a ride home. She refused.
Mason said her 8-year-old daughter was watching from across the street when Nicholas allegedly forced his way into the woman's home.
""My sister and daughter saw him push our elderly neighbor into her house, and close the door behind him,"" Mason told KSAZ-TV .
That's when Mason immediately jumped into action.
""I just kind of barged in, and he was right there like, kinda, she was on the ground and I kinda like just yanked him up and started yelling and he just ran,"" Mason told KNXV.
First responders arrived and transported the elderly woman, who hit her head on the ground during the attack, to a local hospital.
The 91-year-old woman has returned home and is reportedly feeling better.
Where did the police find the suspect? Police reportedly caught up with Nicholas about 1.5 miles from the woman's home after they received reports that a man had asked several people for a ride home.
Authorities charged Nicholas with burglary, robbery, and kidnapping. He's being held without bond.
What else? Mason said the incident is a reminder to be cautious when someone you don't know knocks on the door.
""It's a good reminder for the kids, remind your kids, remind your grandparents – just don't answer the door if it's somebody you don't know,"" she said. ""Keep an eye out for your neighbors."""

Federal judge says Trump admin can't work on border wall while appeal on blocked funds is pending,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-refuses-to-allow-wall-construction-to-continue-during-appeal,"A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration is not permitted to continue construction of the border wall between the United States and Mexico, while an appeal is pending.
What's the background? In February , after Congress refused to provide President Donald Trump with the money he requested to build a border wall, the president declared a national emergency in order to reallocate existing funding for this purpose. In March , the Pentagon announced that it would be reallocating $1 billion in funds it had already received, in order to comply with this national emergency.
On May 24, Judge Haywood Gilliam from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the Pentagon from using these funds to build a wall.
The Trump administration submitted a request Wednesday to continue working on the wall while it appealed this order. Not doing so, the request argued, ""will irreparably harm the Government (and the public) by prohibiting the Government from taking critical steps to stop the flow of illegal drugs from entering the country through the southern border.""
It also said that the federal government would be incurring unnecessary costs by having to provide security to the building sites and materials, for an undetermined amount of time without any work being done.
On Thursday , Gilliam denied this request, saying that the administration was not ""likely to prevail on the merits of [its] appeal.""
Before he was appointed by former President Barack Obama to the 9th Circuit Court, Gilliam had donated $30,000 to Obama and other Democratic candidates. However, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee during his 2014 confirmation hearing that ""any personal views would not interfere in any way with my ability to neutrally apply the law.""
Trump and the 9th Circuit Court have some history Trump has criticized the 9th Circuit Court, which is headquartered in San Francisco, for its rulings against his policies in the past, tweeting in November that it was a ""complete and total disaster"" and ""out of control."" He also tweeted that there was ""much talk over dividing the 9th Circuit in 2 or 3 Circuits"" because it was ""too big!"""
Actress Selma Blair accused of 'cultural appropriation' for wearing head wrap — but she refuses to bow down to PC pressure,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/selma-blair-head-wrap-pc-pressure,"Actress Selma Blair is taking an online beating from some observers who said a photo of her wearing a head wrap is ""cultural appropriation.""
The 46-year-old — who's appeared numerous movies, including ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""Legally Blonde"" — posted an Instagram photo of herself this week with filmmaker Rachel Fleit, who's known for embracing her hair loss and baldness caused by alopecia, People reported .
Both were wearing head wraps.
""We have one answer to your bad hair days or NO hair days. #alopecia @rachelfleit … wraps! (oh, it's been around for thousands of years…),"" Blair noted in the caption.
She followed up that post with another photo of herself, this time accompanied by her 7½-year-old son — and both were wearing head wraps.
Backlash Some commenters blasted Blair for wearing the head wrap, People said:
""This is not brilliant and is not cool. White people have scorned Sikhs for hundreds of years, and now we wanna appropriate and make it trendy? No. Just no. We don't get to do this."" ""Cultural appropriation. How can one wear that when the religious people who actually wear it gets so much ridicule."" ""You are so wonderful and I know you mean no harm, but this is serious cultural appropriation. I'd be happy to have a private conversation about how this is hurtful to Sikhs if you're open to it."" How did Blair respond? Unlike other celebrities who've caved to pressure from online trolls, Blair didn't back down.
""This is not at all a Sikh turban or imitating one,"" she said in one comment, the magazine reported. ""And funnily enough, Sikhs absorb negativity, diffuse it. Tolerance. So none of these comments hurt. They may be not knowing what they write. A head wrap can be useful and beautiful in all cultures.""
Blair added a few other salvos to cool off the mob, People noted:
""Covering one's head is not appropriating anything but warmth and a wig alternative."" ""Scarves have been worn by all colors for ages. Relax. What do you want a woman with no hair to wear? Just an itchy wig? Why not tie your own scarf and bejewel it. I think it's a pretty alternative."" ""This is a scarf. A turban. Not a ritualized religious statement. I will keep on doing what I want to do in this case."" Multiple sclerosis struggles It could be argued that such acrimony is minor for the actress, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis last year.
Blair offered an Instagram post in early May that described her struggles with the side effects of MS.
""Here's a truth,"" she wrote. ""I feel sick as all hell. I am vomiting and all the things which are not polite to speak of. My son ran away. From me. I have to get him to school. The medical treatments take their toll. I am going to get through this. We do. This will pass.""
And she shared the following in March:
Blair told People for its 2019 Beautiful Issue that she's glad to be simply living.
""Life is hard, and living with a chronic illness is hard,"" she told the magazine. ""There are things I can't do at the moment, but things like all these [facial] lines are a luxury because it means I'm still alive and enjoying it."""
Former Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum hit with federal subpoena,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-florida-democratic-gubernatorial-candidate-andrew-gillum-hit-with-federal-subpoena,"A federal grand jury has hit former Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum with a subpoena , reportedly seeking information regarding his 2018 campaign.
Here's what we know While Gillum was mayor of Tallahassee, the city government (but not — as Gillum frequently pointed out — Gillum himself) was the subject of an FBI investigation. In January, the Florida Ethics Commission did determine that there was probable cause that Gillum had failed to report gifts he had accepted from lobbyists and vendors while he was mayor.
Gillum settled with the Ethics Commission in April and agreed to pay a $5,000 fine. Questions about Gillum's interactions with an undercover FBI agent also dogged his campaign.
The Tampa Bay Times obtained a copy of the subpoena, which was issued on March 26. It reported that along with records dating back to the beginning of 2015, the subpoena also demanded records related to both Gillum's gubernatorial campaign and his political action committee.
It is not clear what specifically the grand jury is investigating, but the Times said that while the subpoena focuses on ""people and organizations with clear ties"" to Gillum, they have ""less obvious connections to Tallahassee City Hall."" This could indicate that it is not related to the previous investigation into corruption in the Tallahassee city government.
After his loss in November 2018 to current Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, CNN hired Gillum as a contributor.
What did Gillum say? For now, Gillum has not weighed in on the details of the recent subpoena.
""We stand ready to assist any future review of our work, because I am confident we always did the right thing and complied fully with the law,"" he told the Times in a statement.
Gillum added that he had run an ""open and honest campaign"" and said ""[w]hen you run a campaign that puts the power in the hands of the people, and fights for change, it inevitably invites close scrutiny, regardless of the facts."""

Garlan Gudger says that pro-abortion activists threatened to rape his wife over his support of the state's new abortion ban.
What are the details? In an interview on Alabama Public Television, Gudger revealed that activists have threatened his family.
Gudger, who has been a vocal supporter of the state's new abortion ban, has said that ""abortion is murder"" and that unborn children deserves protections ""even in the most difficult of circumstances.""
""It's been tough dealing with the balancing of my wife and my children being attacked,"" Gudger told Alabama Public Television
""Capitol Journal"" host Don Dailey during the discussion. ""I obviously don't like that part. No one should be attacked or threatened with harm for a difference of opinion. But overall, I'm doing well, besides that.""
Gudger revealed that social media trolls have reached out to his teenage son through the internet, while other activists have told his wife that ""they were going to break into our house and rape and do other things to her.""
Gudger said that the threats have been a source of stress and concern in his household, and revealed that he isn't the only pro-life lawmaker to receive such threats.
""A lot of the other colleagues on the floor the same way,"" he added. ""It's something we have to deal with, and we're dealing with it.""
Gudger also said that despite the threats, he has no intention of changing his position on abortion.
What else? Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed the strict pro-life bill into law last week.
In a statement following her signing of the bill, Ivey said, ""To the bill's many supporters, this legislation stands as a powerful testament to Alabamians' deeply held belief that every life is precious and that every life is a sacred gift from God.""

Louisiana state legislature overwhelmingly passes its own strict pro-life bill — and the Democratic governor says he’ll sign it,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-governor-will-sign-louisiana-pro-life-bill,"Louisiana's state Legislature passed a pro-life ""heartbeat"" bill Wednesday, the latest in a string of states to pass such legislation. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, said that he will sign the bill into law.
What are the details? The bill passed the House by a 79-23 vote, and requires a fetal ultrasound prior to a physician performing any abortive procedures whatsoever.
The bill, if signed into law, would ""prohibit the abortion of an unborn human being with a detectable heartbeat.""
If the ultrasound detects a fetal heartbeat, the abortion is illegal unless the provider insists that the procedure is necessary ""to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or to prevent a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman,"" CNN reported .
The bill also stipulates that an abortion provider can continue with the abortion if the ""unborn child has a profound and irremediable congenital or chromosomal anomaly that is incompatible with sustaining life after birth.""
Providers who do not comply could lose their licenses and face up to two years in prison.
On Wednesday, NBC reported that the House rejected an amendment that would have made abortions permissible and legal in cases of rape or incest.
What else?
After the vote, Edwards tweeted his pro-life stance.
""I know there are many who feel just as strongly as I do on abortion and disagree with me — and I respect their opinions,"" he explained in a lengthy statement. ""As I prepare to sign this bill, I call on the overwhelming bipartisan majority of legislators who voted for it to join me in continuing to build a better Louisiana that cares for the least among us and provides more opportunity for everyone.""
Louisiana's latest proposed ban joins the ranks of those in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, and Ohio."
Iconic Monty Python star accused of racism for saying London is 'not really an English city' anymore.

How did London's mayor react? London Mayor Sadiq Khan — who's been lambasted for his knife-control policies amid a stabbing epidemic in the city — tweeted that Cleese's comments make him ""sound like he's in character as Basil Fawlty."" It's a reference to the sitcom ""Fawlty Towers"" in which Cleese plays a character known for his ""incompetence, short fuse, and arrogance"" guaranteeing that ""accidents and trouble are never far away.""
""Londoners know that our diversity is our greatest strength,"" Khan continued. ""We are proudly the English capital, a European city, and a global hub.""
How did others react? An op-ed writer for the Independent called Cleese's comments ""xenophobic"" and that they ""reveal a sad truth about aging comedians.""
TV comedy writer James Felton blasted Cleese in a mocking tweet : ""Hi I'm John Cleese. Today I'll be complaining there are too many immigrants in London from my home where I live in the Caribbean.""
Cleese last year said he was moving to the Caribbean.
What did Cleese have to say next? Cleese offered a follow-up tweet saying, ""I suspect I should apologize for my affection for the Englishness of my upbringing, but in some ways I found it calmer, more polite, more humorous, less tabloid, and less money-oriented than the one that is replacing it.""
As for detractors who said Cleese's London comments were hypocritical given his time spent in the Caribbean, the funnyman was only too happy to clarify things.
""It might interest those people who seem to think my remarks about London are racist as opposed to culturalist, to consider that what I like about spending time in Nevis,"" he tweeted in regard to the Caribbean island. ""Nevis has excellent race relations, a very well educated population, no sign of political correctness.""
Cleese also pointed out that less-attractive aspects of any culture should be taken into account:
Anything else? Cleese has long been impatient with those who push political correctness and a supposed right to never be offended, saying in 2016 that ""all humor is critical. If we start saying, 'Oh, we mustn't criticize or offend them,' then humor is gone, and with humor goes a sense of proportion — and then, as far as I'm concerned, you're living in '1984.' So the idea that you have to be protected from any kind of uncomfortable emotion is one I absolutely do not subscribe to."""
New Hampshire legislature overrides governor's veto and repeals death penalty,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-hampshire-repeals-death-penalty,"New Hampshire's state Senate has overruled Republican Gov. Chris Sununu and officially repealed the state's death penalty.
Here's what we know In April, Sununu vetoed a bill to ban all future death penalty sentences.
On Thursday, the state Senate overrode that veto by a vote of 16-8, with not a vote to spare to reach the two-thirds majority necessary for such an action. The override was bipartisan, with 12 Democrats and four Republicans voting in favor of it and two Democrats and six Republicans voting against. The New Hampshire state House had previously voted to override the governor's veto by a similarly slim margin.
State Sen. Melanie Levesque (D) called the death penalty ""archaic, costly, discriminatory, and final.""
From a practical standpoint, the repeal will change little. Even with the death penalty on the books, New Hampshire had not executed any prisoners since 1939. There is currently one prisoner in the state on death row: Michael Addison who killed a police officer in 2006. The law was constructed to not apply to Addison's already decided case.
And while the death penalty had previously been legal under state law, New Hampshire currently has no practical means to carry this out by lethal injection. It has no approved way to obtain the compounds needed for lethal injection, nor does it have an approved place for the execution to occur.
Death by hanging was, until Thursday, still a legal alternative in the state if lethal injection was not possible, but it seems unlikely that this could happen in 2019 without public outcry.
What did the governor say? On Thursday, Sununu said he was disappointed that the Senate had overridden his veto.
""I have consistently stood with law enforcement, families of crime victims, and advocates for justice in opposing a repeal of the death penalty because it is the right thing to do,"" he said.
While New Hampshire lawmakers have been trying to get the death penalty repealed for decades, multiple governors have thwarted their efforts. Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen vetoed an anti-death penalty bill in 2000, and in 2011, Gov. John Lynch (D) expanded the existing death penalty law to cover additional crimes."
Glenn Beck cuts CNN's Chris Cuomo down to size for mocking pro-gun rape survivor on Twitter,www.theblaze.com,TheBlaze Staff,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/glenn-radio/cnns-chris-cuomo-shames-pro-nra-rape-survivor-on-twitter,"CNN host Chris Cuomo lit up Twitter on Wednesday when he posted a mocking response to a National Rifle Association video featuring rape survivor Kimberly Corban arguing for gun rights.
In the video, Corban opens up about a rape she survived when she was a 20-year-old college student before advocating her right to protect herself and her two children with a firearm.
""I'm a mother of two, and if that predator or anyone else tries to harm me or my family, they have to come through my firearm first,"" Corban says in the ad. ""I will never be unarmed or utterly vulnerable ever again. The only reason I can say that is because the NRA fought for my rights before I ever knew that I needed them.""
Cuomo reacted by retweeting the ad with the caption, ""Only in America.""
On Thursday's radio program, Glenn Beck and Stu Burguiere discussed Cuomo's tweet mocking a rape victim and noted how much it contradicts his ""it's a woman's right to choose"" stance on abortion.
""This is the guy who just last week was defending a woman who said 'that thing that's growing in a woman's uterus is not a baby'...the guy is a complete lunatic,"" Glenn said.
""Chris Cuomo, let me ask you this ... should [we] just take handgun use and make it a woman's choice?"" he continued. ""Or should we just make it legal for rape and incest? Because here was a rape victim that you supposedly care about. That's who you used to say you're fighting for.""

California is one step closer to forcing companies like Uber and Lyft to hire workers as employees,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-is-one-step-closer-to-forcing-businesses-to-hire-gig-workers-as-employees,"The California Assembly on Thursday passed a proposal that would tighten regulations on companies such as Uber that use independent contractors.
The AB5 bill, which was approved by a vote of 59-15, would force companies to prove its gig workers don't qualify as employees.
Now, the bill is headed to the state Senate.
The Labor Federation-sponsored bill would require companies to pass a three-part test to determine whether or not a worker is entitled to benefits and labor protections, including paid parental leave, overtime pay, unemployment insurance and a guaranteed wage of $12 an hour.
""This kind of started with Uber and Lyft, but now we've seen a proliferation of this business model that is essentially built around this classifying workers as independent contractors and cheating those workers out of basic protections in the law,"" Steve Smith, spokesman for the California Labor Federation, told The Hill .
What are the details? The bill would expand last month's California Supreme Court's decision known as Dynamex, according to The Guardian .
In its decision, the court ruled that businesses should use the ""ABC"" test when determining who is eligible for minimum wage and overtime pay. The decision did not address other issues that are included in AB5.
Before a company hires a contractor, it must prove the following, according to the bill's text :
The person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact. The person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business. The person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed. State Rep. Lorena Gonzalez (D), who authored the bill, thanked her colleagues for supporting the measure.
""Big businesses shouldn't be able to pass their costs onto taxpayers while depriving workers of the labor law protections they are rightfully entitled to. Thank you to my Assembly colleagues for the bipartisan support today and voting #YesOnAB5. #AB5 now heads to the State Senate,"" Gonzalez tweeted Thursday.
What do opponents say? The bill could devastate many businesses, according to Jack Frost, president of Pro-Small Biz California.
""Small businesses rely heavily on third-party providers because they don't have the wherewithal in many cases"" to hire employees for some tasks, Frost told the San Francisco Chronicle . ""Independent contractors help create efficiencies and a profitable bottom line.""
Independent contractors would lose many of their freedoms, Lyft explained in a statement after the bill passed in the Assembly, the Lewiston Tribune reported.
""Lyft drivers overwhelmingly prefer the freedom of working where, when and how much they want,"" the company said.
What else? Democrats have a supermajority in both the California General Assembly and the Senate, which means the bill is likely to pass and become law."
What is impeachment and is Trump impeachable?,www.theblaze.com,TheBlaze Staff,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/why/what-is-impeachment-and-is-trump-impeachable,"Is President Donald Trump impeachable? On Wednesday's episode of "" The News & Why it Matters ,"" Sara Gonzales, Glenn Beck, Stu Burguiere, and Jason Howerton highlighted the impeachment process and discussed whether or not impeachment was an appropriate response to allegations that President Trump lied about having suggested special counsel Robert Mueller be fired from the Russian collusion investigation.
""What impeachment is, is do the American people feel that the president betrayed them,"" Glenn explained. ""They will not feel that way if the economy continues this way — they feel that this is really unfair and you've gone too far.""
Click here to watch the full episode.
According to Glenn, Democrats approached impeachment in a way that sought to compel the American people to want justice served for the specific lie that Mueller cited in his statement on Wednesday.
Using the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton as an example, Stu explained that because Clinton lied under oath about his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton perjured himself and lost the trust of the American people which prompted the impeachment process. He added that because Trump was not under oath when he allegedly lied, a crime had not been committed.
Glenn explained that the American people had long since accepted that Trump would not be completely honest during his presidency and that as long as the economy is doing well, Americans do not care about a lie he told about an action that never transpired. Watch Mueller's full statement here for more details.
The clip ends with Glenn who made the most important point of all, that Democrats are trying to impeach Trump for political reasons rather than for criminal implications.
""When it comes to impeachment, it is not criminal, it is political. When it comes to impeachment, the people have already accepted his lies,"" Glenn said.

Near-record settlement for family of inmate who died of dehydration in jail overseen by Sheriff David Clarke,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/near-record-settlement-for-family-of-inmate-who-died-of-dehydration-in-jail-overseen-by-sheriff-david-clarke,"The children of an inmate who died of dehydration in Wisconsin's Milwaukee County Jail during the tenure of Sheriff David Clarke Jr. have been awarded a $6.75 million settlement, in what is reportedly one of the largest payouts in U.S. history for an in-custody death.
What are the details? According to the original complaint , pretrial detainee Terrill Thomas, 38, died in April 2016 after spending a week deprived of water by jail employees despite pleas from himself and other inmates. He had been arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and felony firearms violations after opening fire in a casino, CNN reported, and was purportedly experiencing a mental health crisis.
Thomas was initially held in a special-needs unit for increased observation due to concerns over his mental health. There, he stuffed clothing and torn pieces of mattress into the toilet, causing it to overflow and flood the cell. As punishment, Thomas was transferred to solitary confinement, and all water sources to his cell were shut off.
Lt. Kashka Meadors of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office admitted during a 2017 inquest that she had ordered Thomas to be transferred, but that ""it should have been the toilet water, just the toilet water"" that was shut off.
Fellow inmates reported hearing Thomas beg for water for days, and asked corrections officers to turn it back on, but were repeatedly ignored. Several county employees and contracted medical professionals were named as defendants in the lawsuit for allegedly turning a blind eye to Thomas's deteriorating condition and refusing to even bring him a drink.
Thomas was eventually discovered dead in his cell. An autopsy revealed he died from ""profound dehydration"" and his death was classified as a homicide.
The Terrill Thomas Estate sued 29 defendants over his death, including former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr., who oversaw the jail at the time and was accused by the family of ""knowingly"" sanctioning the practice of shutting off inmates' water supplies.
Clarke — who is a prominent conservative pundit and previously had a radio show on TheBlaze — has since retired from law enforcement. He did not face any criminal charges and a judge dismissed the Thomas family's claims against him with the settlement agreement.
CNN reported that three county officials have been sentenced to jail in connection with Thomas's death.
Anything else? Attorney Erik Heipt, who represented the Thomas estate, hailed the family's settlement, which will be paid out jointly by Milwaukee County and Armor Correctional Health Services Inc. at a near-record amount for an incarceration death in the U.S. He said the settlement money will be split among Thomas' six children, including four minors, CNN reported.
Heipt told HuffPost , ""What happened to Terrill Thomas was a form of torture. He was a mentally ill man who needed help. Instead, he was deprived of life-sustaining nourishment — water. This is the sort of atrocity that should never happen in an American jail. Ever. There's no excuse for it."""
Passenger: DC metro bus driver asked riders for directions and took them to wrong station across state lines,www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dc-metro-bus-driver-asked-riders-for-directions-dropped-them-at-wrong-station-across-state-lines-passenger,"The Washington, D.C. area's running joke of a public transportation system took another hit to their reputation this week as a bus driver had to stop and ask for directions after he took a full load of passengers not only to the wrong station, but also out of state in the process.
WTOP Radio tells the story of Randy Lilleston, a commuter from Northern Virginia who was supposed to take a WMATA shuttle bus from his end-of-the-line station to the Pentagon while multiple stations were closed for updates and repairs.
However, Lilleston said, things didn't go as expected after it was found out that the bus driver didn't know how to get to the designated stop, which put a sense of ""doom"" into the vehicle filled with morning commuters trying to get to work.
""The bus driver turned around and said, 'I'm not sure how to get to the Pentagon. Can someone give me directions?'"" Lilleston said, according to WTOP.
The driver then reportedly took a wrong turn, taking I-95 towards Baltimore, which took the commuters meandering through Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, before eventually dropping them off at the Anacostia metro station, rather than the Pentagon.
Lilleston said that the mishap helped him by putting him closer to work, but it inconvenienced others who were stuck having to adjust their morning route to work.
The story above was far from the only mishap associated with WMATA's summer shutdown this week. NBC Washington reported that many of the shuttle bus drivers brought in to cover the closed stations didn't know their various routes because they were brought in from other parts of the country as contractors.
Other commuters complained about packed buses, long lines, and massive delays during the first few workdays of a long-term shutdown affecting six stations on the Blue and Yellow Lines.
""As anticipated during the first few days of a major shutdown such as this, there have been some operational issues that will generally be smoothed out during this first week as we settle into our operations and customers adapt to the travel alternatives,"" Metro said .
The planned multi-station shutdown is planned to last until early September."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) agreed to work on new legislation to reform lobbying regulations.
The interaction began after Ocasio-Cortez criticized laws that allowed retired members of Congress to become lobbyists immediately upon entering the private sector.
""If you are a member of Congress + leave, you shouldn't be allowed to turn right around&leverage your service for a lobbyist check,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""I don't think it should be legal at ALL to become a corporate lobbyist if you've served in Congress.""
""At minimum there should be a long wait period,"" she added.
Sen. Cruz responded that he agreed with his otherwise ideologically opposed colleague in Congress.
""Here's something I don't say often: on this point, I AGREE with @AOC Indeed, I have long called for a LIFETIME BAN on former Members of Congress becoming lobbyists,"" tweeted Cruz.
""The Swamp would hate it, but perhaps a chance for some bipartisan cooperation?"" he added.
Ocasio-Cortez responded soon after.
""Let's make a deal,"" she tweeted . ""If we can agree on a bill with no partisan snuck-in clauses, no poison pills, etc - just a straight, clean ban on members of Congress becoming paid lobbyists - then I'll co-lead the bill with you.""
The interaction received praise from many, both on left and right, for seeking bipartisan agreement to reform government. And it happened on Twitter.

The company is filming three original shows in the Middle East—one in Egypt, and two in Jordan. In Egypt, abortion is punishable by imprisonment. In Jordan, it is only allowed in rare cases dealing with the health of the mother or the development of the unborn child. Apparently, ""abortion rights"" only matter to Netflix in America. From The Daily Caller :
Netflix's expressed reluctance to produce content in regions with strong anti-abortion laws seemingly does not extend to the Middle East, where recently the company has been ramping up the number of undertaken projects, according to Variety .
Netflix is working on its third Arabic original, titled ""Paranormal,"" Variety reports. The show will be based on a series of Arabic horror books written by Egyptian author, Ahmed Khaled Tawfik, according to Variety. The show will be produced in Egypt, where abortion is punishable by imprisonment in almost all circumstances, according to the Pew Research Center . Back stateside, however, a Georgia law that bans abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat (around six weeks) may apparently be a deal breaker for Netflix.
Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said Tuesday that if the Georgia law takes effect, Netflix could pull productions from the state.
""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,"" Sarandos said in a statement. ""It's why we will work with the ACLU and others to fight it in court. Given the legislation has not yet been implemented, we'll continue to film there, while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to. Should it ever come into effect, we'd rethink our entire investment in Georgia."""
Rand Paul tackles Justin Amash's argument for supporting impeachment against Pres. Trump - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-paul-argues-against-amash,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) criticized the justification that fellow libertarian Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) offered for his support of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Paul made the comments while appearing on Fox News on Thursday.
""As a libertarian Republican, I think the whole investigation sort of has an un-libertarian feel, you have an intelligence community that has so much power, that many libertarians we've always said gosh, this much power can be abused,"" Paul explained.
Amash said that he concluded from his reading of the redacted version of the Mueller report that there were numerous examples of obstruction of justice by the president and that these were impeachable offenses.
""And when I look at it I see an abuse of power from [former FBI Director James] Comey,"" Paul continued, ""from [former DNI James] Clapper, from [former CIA Director John] Brennan, from all these guys who I think took this power that they had, this great power that we entrusted with them to spy on foreigners, and they directed it against Americans for partisan reasons.
""So I think this has to be investigated and I think it's wrong for any Republican to think oh gosh this is a legitimate investigation,"" he added.
""I think it's a very partisan investigation,"" Paul concluded.
A pro-Trump Republican state lawmaker announced that he would challenge Amash for his seat soon after he said he would support impeachment.
Here's the video of Paul's comments: Rand Paul calls out ex-DOJ officials' 'abuse of power' in Trump spying www.youtube.com
Amash debated with a pro-Trump supporter at his town hall event who accused him of being a Democrat because of his turn away from the president.
""I haven't changed, I am who I said I was,"" Amash said at the end of his statement. ""I am a principled constitutional conservative who has stayed consistent regardless of whether we have President Obama in office, or President Trump."""
"NYT bans reporters from partisan cable news shows like Rachel Maddow's, Don Lemon's: report",www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyt-bans-reporters-from-partisan-cable-news-shows-like-rachel-maddows-don-lemons,"The New York Times has started enforcing an old company policy that discourages reporters from appearing on partisan, opinionated cable news shows, according to Vanity Fair .
The policy reportedly came back in force when NYT finance editor David Enrich was invited on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" on May 19 to discuss a story about allegedly suspicious Deutsche Bank transactions involving Pres. Donald Trump and Jared Kushner.
Enrich accepted, but then was told by superiors to cancel the appearance because NYT was ""wary of how viewers might perceive a down-the-middle journalist like Enrich talking politics with a mega-ideological host like Maddow,"" Vanity Fair reported.
Times executive editor Dean Baquet has reportedly begun to believe that cable news opinion shows have become even more opinionated than normal, leading to a strong ""preference"" that reporters steer clear.
Other shows flagged as too partisan include Don Lemon's CNN show, as well as Fox News shows hosted by Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity (although Vanity Fair notes that NYT journalists typically don't appear on Fox News).
Here's how the Times explained it to Vanity Fair :
It's not so much a new policy as a reinforcement of an old one. Reached for comment, a Times spokeswoman pointed me to the section of the Times 's ""Ethical Journalism"" handbook that covers broadcast media appearances: ""In deciding whether to make a radio, television or Internet appearance, a staff member should consider its probable tone and content to make sure they are consistent with Times standards. Staff members should avoid strident, theatrical forums that emphasize punditry and reckless opinion-mongering."" Contrast this with The Washington Post, which has no such restrictions on its reporters. A spokeswoman told Vanity Fair:
""We view all broadcast programs as opportunities to expose our journalism to different audiences,"" a spokeswoman told me. ""We ask our reporters to speak objectively about the news topics they cover or share fact-based analysis with the goal of giving viewers a better understanding of a story. We also ensure clear identification for opinion journalists to share their wide-ranging perspectives."" (H/T Fox News )"

Sanders (I-Vt.) of the failures of socialism after he encouraged socialist activists to protest at a Walker speaking engagement in Vermont.
""Scott Walker made his name busting unions, cutting health care, and gutting funding for public education,"" Sanders said in a statement on Wednesday.
""Scott Walker's brand of divide-and-conquer politics has no place in Burlington,"" he added, ""the city that sparked our political revolution by electing Bernie Sanders as mayor in 1981.""
Walker fired back by defending his record as governor, and reminding the self-proclaimed socialist democrat of the failures of socialism in Venezuela.
""Don't let the facts get in the way of your political rhetoric,"" Walker tweeted at Sanders.
""Under Democrat control of the state,"" Walker added, ""WI had a waiting list for healthcare coverage under Medicaid.""
""I eliminated the waiting list and everyone living in poverty is now covered,"" he added. ""WI is a Top 10 state for healthcare coverage.""
Walker went on to defend his record on jobs, work choice, publicly-funded education, employment and wages. Then he added one more about Venezuela.
""Venezuela is a real time ex of the failure of socialism,"" Walker tweeted. ""They promise prosperity but too often deliver poverty.""
""It puts power in the hands of the few instead of the many,"" he concluded.
Venezuela was once of the wealthiest countries in Latin America, but has fallen into economic, social and financial chaos after decades of socialist governance. Conservatives have used the example to warn against socialism, while many liberals blame U.S. sanctions for the failures in Venezuela.

Chicago PD releases Jussie Smollett texts with Nigerian brothers involved in hoax hate crime,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-pd-releases-jussie-smollett-texts-with-nigerian-brothers-involved-in-hoax-hate-crime,"Chicago police released text messages and other records related to the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax case, revealing more about the communication the ""Empire"" star had with the Nigerian brothers who were allegedly in on the scheme, according to the Daily Beast .
In the months leading up to the incident, Smollett exchanged texts with Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo seeking to purchase drugs from them, including ecstasy, marijuana, and cocaine. Smollett paid them for the drugs using PayPal and Venmo.
A conspicuous message occurred in January when Smollett texted them ""Might need your help on the low. You around to meet up and talk face to face?""
After that message, Smollett picked up one of the brothers and drove to their apartment. Police say they conducted a practice run of the hoax assault the next morning, and that Smollett told them to call him ""Empire f****t"" and ""Empire n****r"" while beating him up.
Smollett allegedly paid the brothers $3,500 by check and wrote that the check was for a nutrition and fitness program.
The documents released by Chicago PD also detail how uncooperative Smollett was during the investigation, refusing to look at photos of potential suspects and refusing to turn over his phone or submit to DNA testing.
While Smollett's charges for filing a false police report were dropped, the legal fallout from the case continues. The Osundairo brothers are suing Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, for defamation.
The city of Chicago is suing in an attempt to get $130,000 back for overtime pay incurred during the investigation. And, a judge is petitioning for the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's handling of the case, including the bewildering decision to suddenly drop all 16 charges against Smollett and potential conflicts of interest due to communications Foxx may have had with the Smollett family and associates."

In a statement released after the president's announcement, the White House indicated that they would raise tariffs by 5 percent every month, up to a hefty 25 percent.
""Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory,"" the statement read.
Congress has abrogated its power to set tariffs to the executive branch, and could vote to rescind that power at any time.
Mexico became the top trading partner to the United States in the most recent economic data from February. Typically it falls behind Canada and China in the third top trading spot.
Dow futures plummeted by more than 160 points after Trump's announcement.

North Korea has executed officials involved with Hanoi summit between Kim Jong Un and Pres. Trump,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/north-korea-has-executed-officials-involved-with-u-s-summit-in-hanoi,"Some North Korean officials who were involved with the summit between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump have been executed after the meeting failed to produce any meaningful gains for either side, according to Reuters .
The Hanoi summit in February ended abruptly after Pres. Trump walked away from negotiations, saying Kim was asking for too much in exchange for steps toward denuclearization.
Kim Hyok Chol, a special envoy to the United States, along with four other foreign ministry officials who helped set up the summit, were reportedly executed and blamed for meeting's failure. The Chosun Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, reported that the officials were charged with spying for the United States.
Kim Yong Chol, a counterpart to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Shin Hye Yong, an interpreter for Kim Jong Un, were reportedly subjected to forced labor as punishment for their roles in the summit.
More information was published by North Korea's state newspaper. From Reuters:
North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary on Thursday that ""Acting like one is revering the Leader in front (of others) but dreaming of something else when one turns around, is an anti-Party, anti-revolutionary act that has thrown away the moral fidelity toward the Leader, and such people will not avoid the stern judgment of the revolution.""
""There are traitors and turncoats who only memorize words of loyalty toward the Leader and even change according to the trend of the time,"" the commentary said. Pres. Trump has maintained a conciliatory stance toward Kim, despite disagreement with senior national security advisers and other heads of state on the issue.
Recently, North Korea tested short range ballistic missiles in violation of a United Nations Security Council resolution, but Pres. Trump publicly disagreed with both Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and national security adviser John Bolton.
""My people think it could have been a violation,"" Trump said. ""I view it differently."""
Author poses major abortion challenge to Christians,www.theblaze.com,Billy Hallowell,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/author-poses-major-abortion-challenge-to-christians,"As the nation's abortion battle heats up, faith leaders like Daniel Darling, a pastor and the vice president for communications of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, are on the front lines.
Darling, whose latest book "" The Dignity Revolution: Reclaiming God's Rich Vision for Humanity "" works to help people see God's vision for their lives, recently told ""The Pure Flix Podcast"" why he believes the unborn deserve protection.
""Every generation faces questions of ' Will we stand up for the vulnerable ?'"" he said. ""One of the most pressing ones is abortion, where the least defensible among us — the ones who actually have no voice ... legally can be targeted for death.""
(Read also: The 9 Christian Values That Change Lives )
Listen to Darling's challenge to Christians at the 4:00-mark:
Darling challenged Christians to stand up and have a voice when it comes to defending the unborn, urging believers to boldly speak out.
""Christians are the ones saying, 'No, even if the law says that's not a human being, we know what God says. That is a human being there,'"" he said. ""We have to be the ones that stand up and say, at great cost, 'There's a human being there.'""
(Read also: 25 Bible Verses About Loving Others )
Darling also spoke about the importance of people recognizing that they are made in God's image — a Christian belief based on Genesis.
He explained that holding to this worldview has a powerful sway over our lives, and added that being ""made in God's image"" means that there is essentially something special about human beings that is distinct from the rest of creation.
""It impacts the way we see ourselves and the way we see others,"" he said, noting that it keeps us from thinking we are ""here randomly."" ""I'm created with a purpose by a God who created me in His image.""
Embracing this worldview requires a level of humility, as people must recognize that they are made in God's image and not their own. Darling is hoping to address these issues among others in ""The Dignity Revolution.""

Darling's new book focuses on helping reshape peoples' politics, while also encouraging readers to think more deeply about themselves and the world around then.
The question at its center: ""What does it mean to be human?""

Now is the time to take a stand against the pro-abortion garbage coming from the left,www.theblaze.com,Steve Deace,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/now-is-the-time-to-take-a-stand-against-the-pro-abortion-garbage-coming-from-the-left,"A man who exercises his constitutionally protected right to defy gravity by jumping out of a plane without a parachute is not dead when he hits the ground.
That might be the strangest way I have ever started a column. It is pure gibberish of the grandest order, but since it is gussied up with a phrase like “constitutionally protected"" there must be at least some grain of truth behind it, right?
Or since a relatively smart person wrote it with a healthy dose of communication skills and education behind him, it has to have some grounding in reality, doesn't it?
Nope. It's just totally made up drivel.
Just like when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently spoke about abortion.
In doing her part when the United States Supreme Court recently looked the other way on the topic of explicitly allowing baby murder on the basis of race, gender, and disability in the state of Indiana, she said this: ""A woman who exercises her constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy is not a 'mother.'""
Not only is that the purest form of inane blather, but it is straight from Hell's mouth. For the same serpent who once whispered into Eve's ear the words “Did God really say ... ?"" is the same fiend who now has Ginsburg and so many others on the hook with feminist words of self-loathing, science denial, and blood lust.
More and more, though, the forces of light are revealing the true malice of the hearts of darkness in our midst. Their fancy phrase-ologies and double speaks aren't casting the same spell on us that they once did.
No more 'my body, my choice'. No more reproductive freedom. Just an obvious death cult that wants what it wants, no matter how innocent and tiny a human being stands in its way.
For here's what Ruth Bader Ginsburg is telling you:
You're not a mother until you want the baby. You have no obligation to the child, rather it's obligated to you.
It must scratch your itch, and if it doesn't, it will be scratched right out of existence altogether. It's your constitutionally protected right, after all.
Except it isn't. It is eugenics. It is demonic. It is murder.
We are rife with Ginsburgian lucid insanity like this on all sides of us in this present age — our news, our schools, our entertainment. We can't escape it.
Since it often comes from people with more money or power or achievement than us and with a level of passion that many times seems incontestable, we have spent years caving to it and letting it have its way with our life and our country. Even when we were certain, in your heart of hearts, they were wrong. Deadly wrong.
No more. Because the still small voice is on the march and the lies and the liars are being cast aside like I have never before seen in my lifetime. Just a few years ago we were talking about bags of frozen baby body parts for sale with barely a reaction in GOP circles, and now we have principled pro-life bills spreading across the land. A long overdue confrontation with the death cult Goliath in the Valley of Elah.
Could it be that God is at work? And if so, will we join Him?
Burn this paganism to the ground in the arena of ideas while the opportunity is clearly at hand. Then, when we are finished, vow to never again believe the Gnostic garbage spewed forth in the name of fake rights, cheap freedom, and an understanding of the human condition that has no basis in reality.
Anything less and the darkness wins."
Private company resumes construction of the border wall - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/private-company-resumes-construction-of-the-border-wall,"A private company has restarted construction of a half-mile section of border wall in Sunland Park, New Mexico, after being ordered on Wednesday to stop due to permit issues.
What's the background? After Congress refused to give President Donald Trump the funding he requested for the construction of a border wall, We Build The Wall started a GoFundMe campaign to privately fund the project and raised more than $23 million.
On Monday , company founder Brian Kolfage announced that his company had begun construction on part of the wall. But two days later , the mayor of the city that included the construction site, Sunland Park, New Mexico, had ordered the company to immediately stop construction.
Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea said the city had ""not provided any permits"" and had ""not approved of the construction that has gone up already."" The company itself claimed that it had already submitted all proper permits, but the city contested that.
Without offering proof, Kolfage accused city leaders of stopping the project because they had been ""paid off"" to ""lie and shut down the wall project"" by Mexican cartels.
However, by Thursday, the issues seemed to have been resolved.
""WINNING!"" Kolfage wrote in a tweet on Thursday "" @WeBuildtheWall was given the green light yesterday afternoon by the city of Sunland Park to resume construction, and our permits were re-issued. From the start We Build The Wall, Inc complied with all regulations as required by law as we stated.""
Kolfage told the Texas Tribune that the current section of the wall his company was working on would cost between $6 million and $8 million.
What else? After the company failed for months to give updates about the project's progress despite raising millions of dollars, it faced accusations that it had scammed donors. Kolfage would later say that the reason he had not updated donors was because ""powerful people want to stop our progress"" and he didn't want to ""tip anyone off."""
MTV dating show set to 'make history' with first 'sexually fluid' cast,www.theblaze.com,Jana J.

""Are You the One? is about to make history when it returns to MTV,"" the cable television network announced Thursday. ""The long-running dating program, which will premiere on June 26, is the first series in the United States to feature a sexually fluid cast.
""All the participants this season identify as sexually fluid, meaning there are no gender limitations when it comes to their PM [perfect match],"" MTV wrote in a release . ""Finding love is fair game — so come one, come all.""
Terrence J. is host of the reality TV dating show that is headed into its eighth season.
What are the details?
The show's 16 cast members will travel to Hawaii where they hope to discover their ""perfect match"" during the 10-episode program. The winning couple splits the $1 million prize.
""Terrence will work with the love hopefuls like never before, coaching and guiding them to tap into their true feelings and follow their hearts,"" MTV wrote.
The show also plans to introduce Dr. Frankie, a relationship expert, who specializes in working with the LGBTQ community.
""Dr. Frankie will work with the singles to help them become better daters and navigate between drama, poor choices and recurring patterns in relationships,"" the release said.
What else is known about the cast? Most of the cast members' personal social media pages have been scrubbed. But some posts are still available. One cast member, Paige Cole, wrote in Instagram that she came out publicly as bisexual on the show.
""After considering all my options, I've decided to take my talents to MTV's ""Are You The One?"". Y'all wanna see my dating life get zesty???

More major film studios threatening to pull productions from Georgia over pro-life law,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/major-film-studios,"WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures and AMC are among the growing list of major film studios that have threatened to pull film and television productions from Georgia if the state enacts its recently passed abortion law.
""We will watch the situation closely and if the new law holds we will reconsider Georgia as the home to any new productions,"" WarnerMedia, which encompasses HBO, Turner and Warner Bros., told Agence France-Presse in a statement. ""As is always the case, we will work closely with our production partners and talent to determine how and where to shoot any given project.""
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed into law earlier this month a ban on abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected at about six weeks' gestation. The bill is intended to protect the rights of unborn children.
What's the story? The three studios joined Netflix, Disney, and AMC and several others that have publicly criticized the abortion law that is set to take effect Jan. 1.
Netflix said earlier this week that if Georgia doesn't reconsider the new law, ""we'd rethink our entire investment in Georgia.""
And Disney claimed many of those it works with would no longer want to work in the state.
""I think many people who work for us will not want to work there, and we will have to heed their wishes in that regard. Right now, we are watching it very carefully,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said.
Georgia is the third largest film production hub in the U.S. behind Los Angeles and New York.
What did the other studios say? Following NetFlix and Disney's lead, NBCUniversal said if the law goes into effect it would impact the company's production sites.
""We fully expect that the heartbeat bills and similar laws in various states will face serious legal challenges and will not go into effect while the process proceeds in court,"" NBCUniversal said in a statement to AFP. ""If any of these laws are upheld, it would strongly impact our decision-making on where we produce our content in the future.""
Sony also issued its stance on Thursday.
""As the MPAA [Motion Picture Association of America ] has noted, the outcome of the Georgia 'Heartbeat Law,' and similar proposed legislation in other states, will be determined through the legal process,"" a Sony Pictures Entertainment spokesperson said, according to The Hollywood Reporter . ""We will continue to monitor that process in close consultation with our filmmakers and television showrunners, talent and other stakeholders as we consider our future production options.""
What did the governor say? The governor said in an earlier interview that his decisions aren't based on what people in Hollywood think he should be doing.
""I can't govern because I'm worried about what someone in Hollywood thinks about me,"" Kemp told the A tlanta Journal-Constitution . ""I ran the last two years on these issues, and I got elected with the largest number of votes in the history of the state of Georgia, and I'm doing what I told people I would do … Our business environment's good. We cannot change our values of who we are for money. And we're not going to do that. That's what makes our state great.""
On Wednesday the governor toured several Atlanta movie studios as a show of support for the industry.
What else? The loss of television and film production could affect Georgia's economy.
Last year, Georgia's film production industry reportedly provided about 92,000 jobs, according to AFP."
AG Bill Barr says he's not concerned about his reputation because 'everyone dies',www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ag-bill-barr-not-worried-about-reputation,"In an interview with CBS News , U.S. Attorney General William Barr said that he wasn't too concerned with his reputation, since ""everyone dies.""
What did he say? ""I am at the end of my career,"" Barr said after CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford asked him if he was concerned about ""the reputation that you have worked your whole life on."" He seemed unfazed when she mentioned the negative publicity he was receiving for being in the Trump administration.
""Everyone dies and I am not, you know, I don't believe in the Homeric idea that you know, immortality comes by, you know, having odes sung about you over the centuries, you know?"" he asked.
He added that although he'd ""rather be back to my old life"" he did not regret taking the job.
Earlier in the interview , Barr said he believed that special counsel Robert Mueller ""could've reached a conclusion as to whether"" President Donald Trump committed ""criminal activity,"" even if he was unable to indict.
He said he and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were ""both surprised"" when they met with Mueller and found that he had not stated a conclusion about whether or not President Donald Trump had committed obstruction of justice.
He added, though, that he was not going to ""argue about those reasons when he didn't make a decision."" He also said that neither he nor Rosenstein pressed Mueller on this issue. He also said that he thought Mueller had provided him and Rosenstein with enough information ""to make that decision"" not to prosecute the president.
Barr also denied that he was going out of his way to protect Trump at the expense of doing his job. He insisted that he was ""going to make the decisions based on the law and the facts,"" and that he thought the backlash he received ""just goes with the territory of being the attorney general in a hyper-partisan period of time."""
"Obama grossly misrepresents American gun laws during speech in Brazil, saying they 'don't make much sense'",www.theblaze.com,Nate Madden,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/obama-grossly-misrepresents-american-gun-laws-during-speech-in-brazil-saying-they-dont-make-much-sense,"Anti-gun politicians either willfully misrepresenting or just not knowing about American gun laws is a long-running frustration of those in the Second Amendment camp. It's even more frustrating when one of those politicians is a former president of the United States.
""Some of you may be aware our gun laws in the United States don't make much sense,"" Obama told a crowd of people at VTEX Day technology conference in São Paulo, Brazil. ""Anybody can buy any weapon any time — without much if any regulation, they can buy it over the internet, they can buy machine guns.""
Yes, this another iteration of the common but patently false notion that America's current gun law situation is anarchistic because it's less restrictive than that of other countries. In reality, Obama's comments are way off the mark.
First off, not everyone can buy a gun in the United States.
Convicted felons and people under indictment for felonies cannot buy guns under federal law. Other "" prohibited persons "" include fugitives from justice, people convicted of domestic violence, convicted drug users, people adjudicated as a "" mental defective ,"" illegal aliens, people who were dishonorably discharged from the military and people who have renounced their U.S. citizenship.
FBI background checks for disqualifying factors like these — as well as other state-level disqualifying factors — are required for every purchase from a federally-licensed firearms dealer and for every weapons transfer that crosses state lines. And yes, the same requirements exist for internet sales.
Now let's address Obama's comment about buying machine guns, which federal law define as any firearm ""which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.""
Yes, Americans can indeed own automatic weapons privately, but the bureaucratic and cost barriers to doing so are nowhere near as low as Obama implied in his speech.
In 1986, the Hughes Amendment to the Firearm Owners protection act made it ""unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun."" Before that, automatic firearms were required to be registered under the National Firearms Act , which was first passed in 1934.
However, automatics that were already registered under the NFA were grandfathered in under the Hughes Amendment, meaning that ""NFA guns"" manufactured before 1986 are still legal for private ownership and transfer.
In order to buy one, however, you have to first apply a tax stamp from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives — which costs $200 and requires the notification of a local chief law enforcement officer — and then register with the bureau. That process can take months or longer.
And paying for the tax stamp is only a minor part of the expense of legally acquiring a pre-1986 transferable NFA machine gun. They can also get quite expensive , often costing tens of thousands of dollars or more.
And all of that is assuming that you live in a state that hasn't passed its own ban; according to the anti-gun Giffords Law Center, 16 states currently have laws against the possession, sale, or manufacture of machine guns in some form.
It is also worth noting that, in spite of having draconian anti-gun laws, Brazil has one of the highest murder rates in the world .
The idea that America still looks like the wild west when it comes to gun law may make for a spicy anti-Second Amendment talking point, but it just doesn't hold up to the facts."
Watch: Charlamagne tha God embarrasses Elizabeth Warren in interview: 'You're... the original Rachel Dolezal',www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-elizabeth-warren-called-out-in-interview-for-being-the-original-rachel-dolezal,"Democratic presidential candidate and former Native American claimant Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) was hit with a surprise Friday morning, when she was accused during a radio interview of being ""the original Rachel Dolezal"" — the white NAACP chapter president who falsely posed as an African American for years before being exposed.
What are the details? Warren appeared in studio for "" The Breakfast Club "" with host Charlamagne tha God on New York's WWPR-FM, to discuss the planks of her campaign platform such as supporting reparations for slavery and making tons of things ""free"" like college.
At first, the dialogue seemed to be going well. The interviewers indulged Warren by egging on the White House hopeful about her proposals for raising taxes, breaking up businesses and trusting Washington bureaucrats to take over more of the U.S. economy.
But around the midway mark (19:55), the discussion took a turn when host Charlamagne tha God said, ""I want to clear up some stuff, because, you know, there's a lot of criticism that's said about you so I want to give you the opportunity to speak on these things.
""The Native American thing,"" he began, ""Do you regret taking the DNA test?""
""Look, I can't go back,"" Warren responded, before co-host DJ Envy suggested they remind listeners that ""people were very upset"" after finding out that the senator from Massachusetts turned out to have almost no Native American ancestry after decades of claiming otherwise.
Warren went on to admit she shouldn't have made the claim, before Charlamagne pressed, ""How long did you hold on to that? Because there were some reports that said you were Native American on your Texas bar license and that you said you were Native American on some documents when you were a professor at Harvard. Like, why'd you do that?""
""So, it's what I believe,"" the Democrat responded, adding that it's what she had been told by her parents.
""When did you find out you weren't?"" Charlamagne pushed further.
Warren dodged the question, replying, ""I'm not a person of color, I'm not a citizen of a tribe, and tribal citizenship is an important distinction and not something I am. So...""
Charlamagne then asked, ""Were there any benefits to that?""
After Warren denied she received any favor from claiming to be Native American, the host said, ""You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal a little bit.""
Never losing eye contact, Charlamagne reminded the audience, ""Rachel Dolezal, white woman pretending to be black.""
Anything else? Warren got a brief reprieve from the heat before Charlamagne resumed his questioning (26:23) over the senator's past as a registered Republican, which Warren danced around.
By then, Charlamagne was done calling the candidate ""Liz,"" as he had earlier. ""You had a lot of confusion back in the day, Ms. Warren,"" the host told her. ""You thought you were Native American, you thought you were Republican. When did you get on the right track?""

Struggling Dem candidates ticked after party raises the bar on qualifying for presidential debates,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dems-bristle-over-debate-criteria-for-2020-primary-allege-racism-sexism,"The Democratic National Committee has upped the requirements for its presidential candidates to make the cut in this fall's primary debates, much to the ire of struggling 2020 contenders and their supporters.
What are the details? In order to hit the stage in the first two debates this summer, the field of 23 Democratic White House hopefuls must either show they have at least 65,000 donors or hit the 1 percent mark in three qualified polls, according to Politico .
On Wednesday, the DNC announced it has essentially doubled those requirements for candidates to participate in following debates set for September and October, raising the minimum threshold to 130,000 unique donors and 2 percent in four polls in an effort to cull the herd.
Struggling candidates are crying foul. The Wall Street Journal reported that after the announcement, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet told reporters Wednesday that the tougher requirements are ""completely arbitrary.""
""I don't think they should be winnowing the field,"" said Bennet, who threw his hat in the ring earlier this month. ""And I certainly don't think the DNC should be favoring national fundraising and cable television over the early states like New Hampshire.""
Former Rep. John Delaney (Md.) wrote a letter to DNC chairman Tom Perez requesting more transparency on how the new rules were determined. According to The Washington Post , Delaney ""has been largely self-funding his campaign and did not intend to devote great energy to raising money at this point.""
Delaney argued, ""Forty percent of the American people can't afford their basic needs like food, utilities, and housing, so obviously they're voiceless in this process. If you can't afford your basic needs, you're not giving money to candidates. Why is that a good decision for the party?""
Political operatives have also pushed back against the new rules.
Sayo Bhojwani, founder of the purportedly nonpartisan group, New American Leaders , even went so far as to allege the new guidelines were racist and sexist, telling Axios , ""The DNC's new rules, coming so early in the cycle, will amplify the harm done to diverse candidates by a political elite — from pollsters to talking heads — dominated by white male gatekeepers.""
Democratic strategist Jess Morales Rocketto echoed the same sentiments to Politico, saying, ""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at that criteria and know who's going to get kicked out. It's easy to see that the debates in the fall are going to be a bunch of white men and, if that's the case, that's a big misstep.""
Anything else? The New York Times reported that 19 candidates so far have qualified for the first debate scheduled in Miami June 26-27.
According to the Associated Press , current projections show former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (Texas) and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are least likely to be threatened by the higher thresholds for the fall debates."
Scientists use spider venom to kill off malaria-carrying mosquitoes - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientists-use-spider-venom-to-kill-off-malaria-carrying-mosquitoes,"Scientists are replicating a spider's venom in order to kill off malaria-carrying mosquitoes.
How bad is malaria? Malaria has plagued humans throughout history, from King Tut to at least eight former presidents (George Washington, James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, Ulysses Grant, James Garfield, and Teddy Roosevelt. Chester A. Arthur may also have contracted the disease).
It is caused by a parasite that is often carried by mosquitoes. According to the Centers for Disease Control , people who contract malaria suffer from a wide range of symptoms including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, body aches, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause respiratory distress, kidney problems, and hypoglycemia.
In 2016, 445,000 people are estimated to have died from malaria. Most of these cases occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, and most were young children.
After the governments worldwide began banning the pesticide DDT (thanks largely to Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring), the number of malaria cases worldwide spiked dramatically.
In South Africa, according to NPR , the number of cases jumped from 11,000 in 1997 to 42,000 in 2000 after DDT was banned. South Africa resumed use of DDT the following year, and the number of cases dropped back to what they had been.
Similar scenarios played out in other countries throughout the world that banned the use of DDT. In 2006 , the World Health Organization approved the use of DDT indoors, as a method of reducing the population of malaria-carrying mosquitoes.
Now, thanks to spiders , fungus, and science, there may be a way to limit the spread of this disease.
What have scientists done now? Scientists discovered that a fungus found in the African country of Burkina Faso killed mosquitoes. They then figured out a way to genetically modify that same fungus so that it would produce a toxin normally found in the venom of a funnel-web spider.
Armed with their new spider fungus, the scientists created a completely enclosed fake village and released mosquitoes inside to test its effectiveness. Dr. Brian Lovett from the University of Maryland told the BBC that the goal of the project was to ""break malaria transmission in an area.""
The mosquito population dropped by more than 90 percent within 45 days. Control groups of mosquitoes, meanwhile, saw their numbers increase, ruling out any other factors behind the mosquito massacre. The BBC reported that scientists do not want to eradicate the mosquito population altogether, but hoped to be able to control it.
Diabate Abdoulaye, head of the medical entomology laboratory of the Institut de Recherche en Science de la Santé in Burkina Faso, said that current methods of malaria protection, like bed nets, have ""reached their fundamental protective limit.""
He said he was optimistic about using the fungus, telling The Guardian , ""We strongly believe it is going to work because the mechanism and the behaviours of mosquitoes across the landscape of Africa are pretty much the same."""
Jimmy Kimmel fawns over 'warrior' Pelosi as he practically begs her to lock up Trump and company,www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-kimmel-trump-impeach-hood,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was interviewed by a fawning late-night host Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, in an interview where he called her a ""warrior,"" asked her if she can start sending people like Attorney General William Barr to jail, and seemed to think no one knows what's in the Robert Mueller report.
Pelosi, for her part, said that President Donald Trump ""wants"" them to bring impeachment charges, because he thinks the Senate will clear him and that will get him off the hook for any potential criminal prosecution after he leaves office. She said that the only person who knows better than she does what he should be ""held accountable for"" is Trump himself.
Oh, and she worried that disadvantaged youths might find the Trump administration and its responses and actions with regard to the Mueller probe into collusion with Russia to be unfair or unjust compared to their own experiences.
Or, as she put it: ""How do you explain that to kids in the hood?""
No really. She said that. And Kimmel responded by saying ""that's why we need you to get in there and to take care of this, and do something to these guys!""
The audience ate that up.

In a strange assertion, Pelosi claimed that she had the opportunity to see the unredacted Mueller report, but that she declined because she doesn't want to see it if everyone else can't.
Kimmel, in a stranger assertion, said, ""I hope the President didn't do anything.""
""I hope that when they look through the Mueller report, you know, it is what he says it is,"" he continued. ""But we haven't had a chance to see the Mueller report.""
He prefaced it with ""this may seem disingenuous"" which was definitely true. It seems very like he wants to find out something terrible and put Trump and all who work with him in jail. He even said that a few seconds later, so...

Debunking left-wing fallacies about 'Heartbeat' bill,www.theblaze.com,TheBlaze Staff,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/louder-with-crowder/intellectual-fallacies-abortion,"On Thursday, "" Louder with Crowder "" host Steven Crowder debunked a few common fallacies perpetuated by the left about the ""heartbeat"" bills passed in Georgia and Alabama, that prohibited physicians from performing an abortion procedure after six weeks.
In this clip, Crowder poked fun at feminists who claimed that they have a constitutional right to have an abortion due to the feminist tendency to disregard a citizen's right to free speech and to bear arms.
Click here to watch the full episode.
Crowder debunked the left's claim that a woman would face life in prison if she elected to terminate her pregnancy. He explained that in U.S. history, only two instances occurred that involved a woman having received criminal charges for terminating her pregnancy, and both instances dated back to the 1900s.
According to Crowder, the Alabama bill prohibits physicians from performing an abortion procedure and would allow for legal prosecution if a physician were found in violation of the law. He asserted that neither the Alabama bill nor any evidence of precedent exists to support the irrational fear of criminal prosecution for a woman who had terminated her pregnancy.
Next, Crowder turned his attention to the fallacy that this Alabama ban is going to overturn Roe v. Wade.
""It could... some people would like to see it overturned,"" Crowder said. ""That's a separate issue from the argument. There's a few common misconceptions about Roe v. Wade, and what would happen IF it were overturned. All states place restrictions, or most states place restrictions or regulations. Texas, they wanted to ban abortion after 20 weeks, which [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren famously opposed because she is a 'moral' lady.
""Everyone has the hill they are willing to die on,"" Crowder continued. ""What's yours? It's the hill littered with dead babies. It's the 'dying hill.'""

WTF MSM!? Disney won’t stop filming in Georgia and Bob Iger knows it,www.theblaze.com,Rob Eno,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/wtf-msm-disney-filming-in-georgia,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here .
Déjà vu …
Hollywood is gearing up for a fight in the wake of Georgia's new ""hearbeat"" pro-life legislation. Netflix was first out of the gate to say it would reconsider working in Georgia, and Disney CEO Bob Iger followed suit. The threats hinge on whether or not Georgia actually enforces the legislation. Will Disney follow through on its threat, or was it merely virtue-signaling? Based on the other places Disney happily films around the world, it's virtue-signaling.
I was on the Overtime segment for ""The Steve Deace Show"" on Thursday to discuss this . Deace explained how the noncommittal commitment from Iger was really about putting out a fire that nobody will remember months from now. We know this is true because Disney films in multiple locations around the world with more restrictive abortion laws than Georgia's new law. It also has theme parks in these countries.
For example, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was filmed in the Republic of Ireland, where abortion was illegal until a recent referendum, but remains against the law after 12 weeks . Disney has a theme park in France, where abortion remains illegal after the 12th week of pregnancy .
This is a play by Disney to intimidate Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) into not fully enacting this legislation. The company thinks it will work, because it has before. In 2016, the Georgia Legislature passed religious liberty legislation. Business groups, led by Disney among others, bullied then-Gov. Nathan Deal (R) into vetoing the legislation .
Disney already does business in places with much more restrictive policies on abortion and places that treat the gay community much harsher than any law in the United States. Iger answers to shareholders first. If Georgia continues to offer tax breaks to the filming industry, films will continue to be filmed there.
The filming trades union isn't buying the bluster either, saying it "" expects continuing job stability ,"" despite the threat of boycotts.
As I said on ""The Steve Deace Show,"" Disney will stop filming in Georgia when all the celebrities who said they were moving to Canada if Trump were elected actually move to Canada. Vancouver is the Hollywood of the North already, so what's stopping them?

Former New Yorker fact-checker Talia Lavin, who smeared Ben Shapiro after the Notre Dame fire, is finding the marketplace of ideas to be uninterested in her wisdom. Lavin had been scheduled to teach a course called ""Reporting on the Far Right."" Virtually no one signed up for the class, so New York University canceled it .
Lavin resigned from the New Yorker after a false accusation of a Nazi tattoo against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Lavin is a serial fabulist who sees it as her duty to attack conservatives relentlessly. She's a poster child for the sort of activism that masquerades as journalism today.
It's somewhat heartening to see that her message doesn't have appeal, even at a liberal bastion like NYU.

Texas on pace for ANOTHER record month in illegal immigration: 19% increase from April,www.theblaze.com,Daniel Horowitz,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/texas-on-pace-for-another-record-month-in-illegal-immigration,"After the new record numbers of family units coming to the border almost every month this fiscal year, some might have thought the crisis would have maxed out in April and the numbers would begin decreasing. But preliminary data from Customs and Border Protection apprehensions so far in May show that numbers continue to skyrocket.
According to preliminary weekly data used internally by CBP and given to CR by a Border Patrol agent who must remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to the press, 71,834 illegal aliens were apprehended between points of entry in the state of Texas from May 1 to May 28. That works out to a daily pace of 2,565.5 per day or a flow of 936,408 annually – just in the state of Texas alone. One has to go back to fiscal year 2006 to find this level of annual apprehensions in all four border states combined .
This ensures that May will now crush April's unfathomable numbers . The same internal, preliminary CBP data for April shows that 60,476 illegals were apprehended in Texas during an equivalent 28-day period from April 3 through April 30. That means that illegal immigration into Texas likely increased roughly 18.8 percent in May over April.
Overall, in April, almost 99,000 illegal immigrants were caught between points of entry at the entire southwestern border, in addition to roughly 10,000 inadmissible immigrants at points of entry. Given that approximately 60 percent of the aliens have been coming in through Texas and Texas' numbers increased almost 19 percent in May, it's likely that when the final numbers are tallied for the entire border, May will easily set another overall record. Axios is reporting that 75,000 families have arrived, absolutely blowing out the record 58,000 in April.
On Wednesday, a record 1,036 illegal immigrants came in one large group at El Paso, which is the most of any single group coming in at once. Clearly, the situation is getting worse, not better.
While the overwhelming majority of the illegal aliens hailed from the three northern triangle countries in Central America, there were also a number of people from other Latin American countries and even other parts of the world. There were 1,045 from Brazil, 1,787 from Cuba, 1,118 from Ecuador, and 1,301 from Nicaragua. This suggests that a number of people in other countries relatively close to the smuggling routes are catching on to the de facto open border for those coming in with a child.
There were also illegal aliens caught from countries of possible terror concern, including 67 from Bangladesh and 40 from Uzbekistan. Special interest aliens (SIAs) usually pay smugglers much more to get smuggled in while agents are tied down with Central American family units, so it's very likely that the apprehension rate for those from countries of particular concern is lower.
Yesterday, Politico reported that the president would be announcing a shutoff of asylum for those who could have claimed asylum in Mexico or other countries. When reading the Immigration and Nationality Act and the UN treaty on refugees , it's striking how they are all written in singular language referencing individuals claiming asylum. Nothing in our laws would ever define a mass cartel smuggling operation accounting for a significant percentage of a country's population as asylum. It's an invasion. Whether the president is prepared to treat it as such is yet to be determined, but the clock is ticking on his legacy. In 2015, when Trump referred to the border situation as making America a "" dumping ground ,"" we were apprehending 38,000 illegal aliens per month. Now, we are seeing twice that number just in Texas alone."

Report: Former Obama officials are currently advising Iran on how to counter President Trump,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-obama-officials-advising-iran,"Former officials from the Obama administration are reportedly advising Iran amid escalating tensions with U.S., running an independent foreign policy initiative to counter President Donald Trump.
What are the details? According to left-leaning outlet the Daily Beast , architects of the Iran nuclear deal, secured by former President Barack Obama, have been in talks with Iranian officials over the past two months — including Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif — both over the phone and in person, urging the regime to ""stay calm"" and ""not take Trump's bait.""
None of the ""several"" former Obama aides interviewed by the Daily Beast were named, but they were apparently willing to explain what type of counsel they were providing Iranian higher-ups and insisted their ongoing interactions with the Islamic Republic are ""normal.""
Journalists Betsy Woodruff and Erin Banco noted that ""conversations of this nature sometimes generate"" accusations of violating the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from engaging in discussions relevant to a U.S. dispute with another country on behalf of the government.
The authors also pointed out ""the likelihood that former Obama officials could face such a charge is basically zero percent,"" given the fact that no one has ever been convicted under the 1799 law.
The ex-officials would not answer whether or not they had funneled information from the Iranian government to congressional Democrats, but admitted to educating Democratic members of Congress on their experience working with Iranian leaders.
A Republican aide told the Daily Beast those actions are problematic.
""It's not just about what they were saying to the Iranians,"" the anonymous staffer said. ""It's about what they were saying to their political allies back here in the U.S. Their strategy was to divide and isolate the Trump administration just as the Trump administration was trying to re-establish deterrence with Iran.
""In the current highly partisan political environment, the only safe course is to signal national unity — and they contributed to eroding that at home and abroad,"" the staffer added.
Anything else? The United States' relationship with Tehran has been shaky for decades, but became more tense after President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the regime. Meanwhile, Iran has been threatening to reverse course on its promises to remaining signatories under the deal by resuming production of highly enriched uranium.
Fellow Iranian rivals Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have blamed Tehran for recent attacks on oil tankers and a Saudi pipeline, further complicating matters. But both sides remain entrenched, with the U.S. demanding Iran stop funding Islamic terrorist groups and imposing its strict theocracy on its people while Iran has dug in its heels out of protest of the economic sanctions.
According to the Los Angeles Times , Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech Wednesday, ""We will not negotiate [with the United States], as negotiations are useless and may even incur harm."""
California Gov. Newsom welcomes women to his state for abortions,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-gov-newsom-welcomes-women-to-come-to-his-state-for-abortions,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Friday welcomed women seeking abortions to come to his state, signing a ""Proclamation on Reproductive Freedom.""
He described the proclamation as the reaffirmation of California's commitment to women's ""reproductive freedom.""
""California will continue to uphold women's equality and liberty by protecting their reproductive freedom, educating Californians about their rights to reproductive freedom, welcoming women to California to fully exercise their reproductive rights, and acting as a model for other states that want to ensure full reproductive freedom for women,"" Newsom wrote, according to the Sacramento Bee .
The governor's proclamation comes as several states, including Georgia, Alabama, and Missouri, have passed legislation recently that would place tighter restrictions on abortion.
Newsom has slammed such legislation, claiming it is all about ""power"" and ""control.""
""This is about power. Control. Overturning Roe v Wade,"" he tweeted last week after Missouri's Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed legislation that would ban abortions after eight weeks.
What about the letter he signed along with other governors?
Newsom also signed onto a joint letter on Friday with governors Kate Brown (D-Ore.) and Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) urging other states to review their ""reproductive freedom"" laws and to develop laws protecting abortion in their states.
The letter claims that restrictions on abortion put women's lives at risk.
""[S]tates across the country have enacted new and extreme restrictions on abortion, attacking safe and legal health care and putting women's lives at risk,"" the governors wrote.
""The common goal among these bans and restrictions is clear: to violate a woman's constitutional right to safe and legal abortion, contrary to 40 years of precedent,"" the letter continues.
""In the absence of federal leadership on this issue, states must step up and put in place their own protections – both in statute and in their state constitutions, and through the expansion of family planning and education – to defend every American's right to reproductive freedom.
""Roe is settled law, but newly enacted and clearly unconstitutional laws in a handful of states compel our states to act now to reaffirm longstanding commitments to safeguard the fundamental rights of women."""
Judge blocks Missouri government from closing last abortion clinic in the state,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-blocks-missouri-government-from-closing-last-abortion-clinic-in-the-state,"A judge has blocked Missouri's government from closing the last abortion clinic in the state. The Planned Parenthood clinic was scheduled to be shut down tonight at midnight.
What's the story? The Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis was ordered closed after it failed to comply with existing laws regulating abortion. Its license expires at 11:59 p.m. Friday. The clinic did not agree to a request from the state government to interview its seven physicians to ensure that they were adhering to existing legal guidelines. Planned Parenthood argued that these physicians are not its own employees, and cannot be ordered by the clinic to submit to interviews.
On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit to keep the location open.
This location became the last abortion clinic in the state after another location in Columbia Missouri failed to meet the requirement of employing physicians with admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and was forced to close in 2018.
On Friday , just hours before the clinic's deadline that would have forced it to close its doors for good, Judge Michael F. Stelzer from Missouri's 22nd Judicial Circuit Court ordered the clinic to stay open until next week. There will be a hearing Tuesday to consider a preliminary injunction against the order to close the clinic.
Stelzer wrote in his order blocking the clinic's closure that Planned Parenthood had proven ""that immediate and irreparable injury will result if petitioner's license is allowed to expire."" Stelzer was appointed by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon in 2014.
If the Planned Parenthood clinic is closed, Missouri will be the first state since the Roe v. Wade ruling to have zero legal abortion clinics in the state. While this clinic is closing because it failed to meet regulations, Missouri also recently passed a law that bans abortions after the eighth week of pregnancy ."
97-year-old woman attends her first prom — and she's crowned prom queen - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/97-year-old-woman-first-prom-crowned-queen,"A Rhode Island woman recently helped her 97-year-old grandmother's dream to attend prom come true.
When Julie Huddon of Warwick found out her grandmother Helen Danis didn't attend her high school prom because her family didn't have enough money, she decided to do something about it, WJAR-TV reported.
Over the weekend, Danis attended the prom at her great-grandson Evan's high school where she was crowned honorary prom queen.
""She didn't stop smiling the whole night!"" Huddon told USA Today in a message after the prom. ""It was so special to share this memory with her, not only for me but my son as well, her great grandson!""
Prom was one of a number of childhood activities that Huddon has helped cross off her grandmother's bucket list.
""We've been doing a lot of things that she has said she wanted to do,"" Huddon told WJAR. ""She sat on Santa's lap for the first time in December. I never know about her, she's full of surprises.""
How did the event come together? A few months ago, Huddon asked the principal at Pilgrim High School if she could attend the prom and bring her grandmother.
After getting the go-ahead, Huddon set up a ""PromPosal"" for her grandmother.
""I got a crown for her and wrote her a note, asking her to be my date to prom,"" she told WJAR.
""Grammie, Will you be my prom Queen & go to Senior Prom with me?"" the note said.
Of course, Danis said yes.
Huddon bought her grandmother a long dress for the big night and gave her a corsage to wear.
""I tried it on, it was very nice. It was the first time I tried a dress on and it fit without altering it,"" Danis told NBC News .
The family rode a trolley together to the prom where Danis was crowned honorary prom queen.
""I was so proud,"" Huddon said. ""All the seniors were cheering for her and clapping, they ended up naming the principal honorary prom king, and he danced with her.""
""My favorite part was being there with all the kids, and having such a good time,"" Danis told NBC News."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
Erick Erickson of the Resurgent was suspended for 12 hours from the popular social media platform on Friday.
Screenshots of the notice from Twitter were shared by many objecting to the judgement.
""Elizabeth Warren set to introduce the Wrecking American Prosperity Under Marxism, or WAMPUM Act, wherein she gives everything away for free,"" the joke from Erickson read.
Twitter said the missive had offended their terms of service, saying, ""you may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.""
Speaking to PJ Media, Erickson pointed to the selective application of Twitter's rules to punish conservatives.
""I think Twitter is a private company and can do what it wants, but I think Twitter also clearly is more predisposed to punish conservatives than progressives,"" Erickson said . "" It's somewhat ironic that they did this today about the time Elizabeth Warren was, again, having to revisit that controversy.""
Warren was forced to face her missteps on claims of her Native American heritage in an awkward interview where she attempted to dodge painful and damaging questions.

Glenn Beck: Nazi propaganda posters show how today's abortion debate has taken an evil turn,www.theblaze.com,TheBlaze Staff,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/glenn-radio/abortion-debate-disabled,"On Friday's radio program, Glenn Beck compared recent leftist arguments that aborting babies with disabilities is the compassionate thing to do with pamphlets from Nazi Germany that promoted the same message.
Glenn played a video clip of CNN's Alisyn Camerota speaking with Republican Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill on Wednesdday about his state's proposed pro-life law, which would prohibit abortions based on race, sex, or disability.
""Indiana had tried to block women from getting abortions, if it were based on a disability. And I'm just curious about that one. Why would you want a family to have to have a child with a severe disability?"" Camerota asked.
Glenn compared Camerota's comments to two Nazi propaganda pamphlets.
""I found them last week,"" Glenn said of the pamphlets. ""They're both from Germany. And the first one is [about] children with disabilities. And it says, translated, 'Sterilization is not a punishment, but liberation. What parents would like to wish their children such a horrible wish. Who wants to be guilty of this?' That's exactly what Alison was saying. Who wants to be guilty of this? Who wants to put the child or parent through this?""
He read the second pamphlet, which translated to ""You also carry the burden. Someone with disease will cost the average 50,000 Reich marks before he reaches 60 years"" and showed a German worker holding up two disabled people.
""We're going to find out that those with disabilities are the ones who are far greater than we are,"" said Glenn.

Elizabeth Warren wants to change the policy that prevents sitting presidents from being indicted,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-change-the-policy-that-prevents-sitting-presidents-from-being-indicted,"After special counsel Robert Mueller emphasized that charging President Donald Trump with a crime was never an option due to a Department of Justice policy, Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced that, if she's elected president, she'll do everything in her power to change that, according to The Hill .
Warren said that as president she would appoint officials to the Justice Department who would change policy to allow for a sitting president to be charged with a crime. She also said Congress should pass a law allowing a president to be charged.
""Congress should make it clear that Presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,"" Warren wrote in a post on Medium. ""And when I'm President, I'll appoint Justice Department officials who will reverse flawed policies so no President is shielded from criminal accountability.
""Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That's not how our country is supposed to work,"" Warren continued.
Warren, who has been in favor of impeaching Pres. Trump since the Mueller report was released, believed that Mueller was referring the president for impeachment in his less-than-10 minute statement earlier this week about his findings.
""Mueller's statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He's referring President Trump for impeachment, and it's up to Congress to act,"" Warren wrote.
Still, even after the statement, even Democrats are conflicted about whether to impeach. Their hesitancy contradicts daily public statements from Democrats who claim the president has or likely has committed impeachable offenses.
But, they also fear political backlash and they understand that their case isn't nearly strong enough to convince a Republican-majority Senate to convict."

At least four other people are currently being treated for injuries in area hospitals.
At least 11 people were killed when a gunman identified as a longtime city employee opened fire at a municipal center on Friday afternoon, according to NBC News .
The gunman was able to injure six other people in addition to the fatalities before police shot and killed him at the scene of the crime. One of the injured victims was a police officer, who was ""saved by his vest"" according to Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera.
Cervera said the suspect was killed after an extended gunfight with four officers who responded to the attack.
The violence broke out around 4 p.m. local time in the city building where departments such as public works, public utilities, communications, and others are located. The suspect was reportedly a public utilities employee
Police have not determined a motive for the attack, which Cervera described as ""indiscriminate."" The suspect has not been identified.
CNN reported that a semi-automatic pistol and a rifle, believed to have been legally purchased, were found at the scene.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam issued a statement:
""This is a horrific day for the Commonwealth of Virginia. We are devastated by the tragic shooting in Virginia Beach. I am in Virginia Beach with law enforcement authorities and Mayor Dyer, where I am monitoring the situation and offer the state's full support.

Trey Gowdy decimates Adam Schiff for claiming Republicans privately tell him to oppose Trump,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trey-gowdy-rips-into-adam-schiff,"Trey Gowdy, the former congressman from South Carolina, decimated Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) in a brutal interview on Fox News about the repercussions from the Mueller report.
Charles Payne asked Gowdy to comment on the assertion from Schiff that many Republicans were privately encouraging him to continue opposing the president, but they were too cowardly to say it publicly.
""Well let's just get the top line out of the way, I don't know a single Republican who gives a damn what Adam Schiff thinks of him or her or the Republican party,"" Gowdy responded.
""There are three kinds of Republican Adam really likes, those that vote with Democrats, those that lose, and those that die, and for most of us that's too steep a price to pay to curry favor with Adam Schiff,"" he explained.
""This is the same Adam Schiff that did everything in his power to keep you from finding out that Hillary Clinton had her own server, and classified information traversed that server,"" Gowdy continued. ""He did everything he could to make sure you never found that out, Charles, the dossier, you wouldn't know about if it was up to Adam Schiff. The FISA application and what was used in it, you wouldn't know about if it was up to Adam Schiff.
""He went to court to make sure that you did not know that the DNC funded Christopher Steele's work,"" he explained. ""And you wouldn't know about the Strzok-Page texts if it were up to Adam Schiff, so the king of transparency is one of the most overly partisan charlatans that I had the pleasure of serving with.
""There are plenty of Democrats I do care what they think,"" Gowdy concluded, ""Adam Schiff just ain't one of them.""

Here's why Chicago PD was so furious when Jussie Smollett's charges were dropped,www.theblaze.com,Aaron Colen,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/heres-why-chicago-pd-was-so-furious-when-jussie-smolletts-charges-were-dropped,"Newly-released documents revealed that Chicago Police thought Jussie Smollett would be forced to admit guilt as a part of the deal he struck with prosecutors to have his charges dropped, according to WBBM-TV .
The revelation explains the outrage that came from police when Smollett's felony charges for disorderly conduct were suddenly and unexplainably dropped, and Smollett was allowed to walk free while maintaining publicly that he was totally innocent of staging a hoax hate crime for attention.
From WBBM:
Documents revealed that on February 28 after Smollett was indicted, the state's attorney's office notified CPD, saying the case would be prosecuted with $10,000 in restitution, community service and admission of guilt. But that admission of guilt never happened as charges were suddenly dropped by Kim Foxx's office nearly a month later, and Smollett walked free, blindsiding police. Chicago PD commander Ed Wodnicki said at the time that the decision to drop the charges was a ""punch in the gut."" Chicago police officers dedicated significant overtime to working the case after Smollett claimed white Trump supporters assaulted him while spewing racial and sexual slurs.
""We worked closely throughout our three-week investigation to get to point where we arrested the offender,"" Wodnicki said, according to NBC News . ""For the state's attorney at this point to dismiss charges without discussing this with us at all is just shocking.""
Mayor Rahm Emanuel was also outraged .
""This is an unbelievable, not just a whitewash of justice, this is a person now who got off scot-free with no sense of accountability of the moral and ethical wrong of his actions, from top to bottom, not only besmirching the name of the city... but you have a person using hate crime laws that are on the books to protect people who are minorities from violence, to turn around and use those laws to advance your career? Is there no decency in this man?"" Emanuel said.

CNN hosts are stunned when analyst exposes liberal hypocrisy on rhetoric against Pres. Trump,www.theblaze.com,Carlos Garcia,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/haberman-says-trump-is-not-novel-in-ignoring-congress,"CNN's political analyst Maggie Haberman offered a surprising rebuttal to those on the left who were angered over subpoenas being ignored by members of the Trump administration.
""This president is not novel in certain ways,"" explained Haberman to CNN hosts John Berman and Alisyn Camerota, who were criticizing U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
""There has been an erosion of norms, of certain institutions going back for some time, I know there's been a lot of talk about responding to congressional subpoenas,"" she explained.
""Eric Holder didn't respond to a congressional subpoena,"" Haberman pointed out, ""and I don't seem to recall the same level of anger around it on the left, as there has been around what's been going on right now with the Trump administration.
""And those are not grand jury subpoenas, but I don't think the president does anything in a new way, he does do it in a more extreme way, and that is what you're seeing here,"" she concluded.
Haberman also pointed out that Mueller's address to the media about his report and how it was interpreted likely ""spooked"" President Donald Trump because it was made in his ""public relations language.""

Texas teacher suspended for reporting illegal immigrant students to Pres.

The teacher's name is Georgia Clark, and she is employed at Carter-Riverside High School in Fort Worth. Using a now-deleted Twitter account, Clark requested assistance from the president to deal with ""illegal students"" and ""drug dealers"" that she said were taking over the school.
""Mr. President, Fort Worth Independent School District is loaded with illegal students from Mexico,"" Clark allegedly wrote on May 17, tagging Pres. Trump. ""Carter-Riverside High School has been taken over by them. Drug dealers are on our campus and nothing was done to them when the drug dogs found the evidence.""
The school district has placed Clark on administrative leave with pay as they investigate the matter. The district has not detailed what specific policy or regulation the teacher may have violated by sending the tweets, about illegal immigrants, none of which identified specific students.
""I do not know what to do. Anything you can do to remove the illegals from Fort Worth would be greatly appreciated,"" another tweet from Clark read. Some of the tweets included phone numbers to contact her.
""Mr. President, I asked for assistance in reporting illegal immigrants in the FWISD public school system and what I received was an alarming tweet from someone identifying himself as one of your assistants followed by a second tweet from the same person,"" Clark wrote in another post.
""Our mission is to prepare ALL students for success in college, career and community leadership,"" FWISD superintendent Kent Scribner said in a statement . ""Let me reiterate our commitment that every child in the District is welcome and is to be treated with dignity and respect. As we conclude the school year this Friday, please know we take this promise very seriously and your child's safety and well-being are always our number-one priority. Thank you."""
Devin Nunes makes serious request after glaring discrepancy found in Mueller source docs,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/devin-nunes-mueller-report-dowd-transcript,"Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, is calling for the public release of ""all backup and source documentation"" related to Robert Mueller's Russia investigation after a discrepancy surfaced in source documents provided by the special counsel's office.
What are the details? Nunes' reaction came after the public release of a Nov. 2017 voicemail transcript from former Trump lawyer John Dowd to the attorney representing former national security adviser Michael Flynn in which Dowd asked Flynn's attorney for a ""heads up"" if Flynn knew material damaging to the president.
The transcript released Friday included new content that was not included in Mueller's source documentation.
""It's all a fraud,"" Nunes said.
Side-by-side comparison shows documentation provided by Mueller left out crucial contextual details, including where Dowd explicitly said he was not asking for ""any confidential information"" and when Dowd said his request was ""not only for the president but for the country.""
Here's the complete Dowd transcript: Hey, Rob, uhm, this is John again. Uh, maybe, I-I-I'm-I'm sympathetic; I understand your situation, but let me see if I can't ... state it in ... starker terms. If you have ... and it wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh ... I understand that you can't join the joint defense; so that's one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there's information that. .. implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don't know ... some issue, we got to-we got to deal with, not only for the President, but for the country. So ... uh ... you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of ... protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any ... confidential information. So, uhm, and if it's the former, then, you know, remember what we've always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains, but-Well, in any event, uhm, let me know, and, uh, I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, Pal. Flynn, who plead guilty to lying to federal investigators in Dec. 2017, claims the call is evidence of an effort to obstruct Mueller's investigation, according to Fox News .
Dowd, however, vehemently disagrees, calling the voicemail transcript a ""baseless, political document designed to smear and damage the reputation of counsel and innocent people."""
Star of new 'Aladdin' movie explains how she stays grounded in her Christian faith while keeping a Hollywood career,www.theblaze.com,Billy Hallowell,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/naomi-scott-aladdin-star-faith-in-hollywood,"Naomi Scott has received widespread attention and praise for her phenomenal performance in Disney's new, live-action retelling of “Aladdin,"" but the actress is also gaining some accolades for bolding speaking out about her Christian faith.
In a recent interview with Compassion UK , a Christian organization that helps kids in poverty, Scott, 26, proclaimed that she's not sure how she would do life without her faith. The actress' comments came when she was asked how her faith has shaped her life and career.
(Read also: 'Jesus...Save Me': Actor's Plea to God Changed Everything )
""My husband and I were actually talking about this yesterday. Sometimes we get asked the question, 'How do you juggle your faith and what you do?'"" she said, ""But for me, I don't know how I would do life without my faith .""
Scott said she stays grounded and focused with the knowledge that she is ""loved and valued."" She explained that she doesn't see her faith as some sort of separate part of her being.
""Quite honestly, I don't see it as this separate thing, this add-on thing,"" she said . ""My faith is just a part of who I am and what I do.""
And Scott wasn't done there. She added that she and her husband, Jordan Spence, often talk about ""God's grace"" and the fact that they aren't defined by what people say or what happens in life.
In the end, her identity is based on God — a truly powerful message from a Hollywood actress who has a major megaphone right now considering the success of ""Aladdin.""

This isn't the first time Scott has discussed her faith, as she also openly spoke about Christianity's role in her life for an April interview and cover shoot with British Vogue.
""[My faith is the foundation ] of every decision I make, and of my marriage,"" she said. ""And [my husband Jordan Spence and I are] are young people with big aspirations – I want to be a power couple, I want to make all the money and have a big house.""

"New poll has great news for Trump ahead of campaign season, bad news for Democrats",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/donald-trump-approval-rating-harvard-poll,"President Donald Trump's approval rating hit the highest level in two years this week, boosted by a strengthening economy and surging consumer optimism.
 According to the latest Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, 48 percent of voters approve of Trump's job performance while a slight majority — just 52 percent — do not approve of his job performance, according to The Hill .
The last time Trump's approval reached 48 percent in the Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll was in June 2017.
The survey showed Americans most approve of Trump's performance on economic matters. The Hill reported that a record 62 percent of voters told Harvard/Harris they approve of Trump's handling of unemployment, while 59 percent said they approve of his overall handling of the economy.
Meanwhile, 71 percent of voters said they believe Trump has made the economy ""somewhat strong or very strong,"" and 51 percent said the economy continues to head in the right direction.
Unfortunately, just 39 percent of respondents told Harvard/Harris they believe the country is headed in the overall correct direction.
What's the bad news for Dems? Given that voters traditionally tend to ignore social issues and emphasize economic concerns at the voting booth, this poll presents a major problem for Democrats in 2020 who are already focusing a serious chunk of their campaign efforts on social issues.
If this poll is any indication of voter sentiment heading in 2020, with a strong economy behind the president, Democrats will have their work cut out for them if they want to win back the White House.
Mark Penn, co-director of the Harvard/Harris survey, told The Hill the increase in Trump's approval reflects the president's strong possibility of re-election.
""People's views on the economy are gradually pushing Trump's numbers up and his actions on other issues like China and immigration are neutral to positive,"" Penn said. ""Every point of increase in this range of 45 to 50 improves the possibility of re-election."""
AOC tries to slam ICE over stillborn baby. She inadvertently makes pro-life argument instead.,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-abortion-ice,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) attempted to bash Immigration and Customs Enforcement on social media Friday after a woman went into premature labor while in immigration detainment in February, resulting in the tragic birth of a stillborn child.
Instead, Ocasio-Cortez inadvertently made a pro-life argument.
What did Ocasio-Cortez say? In February, immigration authorities revealed that a 24-year-old Honduran woman went into premature labor while she was detailed at a migrant holding facility. Tragically, the woman gave birth a stillborn child.
On Friday, Ocasio-Cortez responded to the news, despite the tragedy being more than three months old.
""I'm sure EVERY state passing abortion bans will also be prosecuting ICE officials for the deaths of premature babies that happen in their custody? Right? Since they intend on jailing doctors, surely they'll jail ICE for the same thing,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.
It's not clear why Ocasio-Cortez chose to respond to the news more than three months after it was initially reported.
What was the reaction? The New York Democrat was widely panned for comparing abortion — which pro-life activists say is murder of unborn children — to stillbirth, a tragedy during which a child is birthed without signs of life.
""To even remotely try to contrast this horrific incident the same as willfully choosing to murder an unborn baby....is outrageous!"" one person said in response to Ocasio-Cortez.
Meanwhile, Lila Rose, a prominent pro-life activist, noted that Ocasio-Cortez essentially made a pro-life argument with her tweet.
Wow - so you're acknowledging a baby has value & shld be protected after birth AND before birth? Because last I saw, you were tweeting the talking points of the abortion industry & cheering for the killing of babies in the womb as a “right."" Blind, tragic hypocrisy.
— Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) May 31, 2019 Rose also rebuked Ocasio-Cortez for her comparison between stillborn children and aborted children.
""ICE officers don't intend to kill the babies of pregnant women. A stillbirth is a tragedy no one celebrates,"" Rose said . ""Abortionists intentionally kill the babies of pregnant women. They kill 2700 babies daily. And you and your political friends proudly celebrate it."""
"Veterans in AOC's district storm out of meeting after she bashes America, Trump, Israel PM: 'I was revolted'",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/vets-aoc-storm-bronx-bashed-america,"Democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had a closed-door meeting with community leaders in the Bronx this week, and it didn't go well. In fact, some folks were appalled. And some veterans, one seated next to the Congresswoman herself, stood and stormed out in disgust while she was speaking.
The New York Post reported on Saturday about Wednesday's meeting, after speaking on the record with some who were in attendance, including veterans who stormed out.
Vietnam War veteran Silvio Mazzella, treasurer for that community board, told the Post ""She knocks the country, she knocks the president. And that's not what America is about.""
Another veteran, Anthony Vitaliano, who was also with the NYPD for nearly 40 years and was previously chairman of Community Board 11, was seated between Ocasio-Cortez and one of her staffers. He said he couldn't take it anymore.
""""I just couldn't hear her BS anymore,"" he told the Post. ""I just got up, got my umbrella in my hand and walked right out.""
After a board member brought up Yemen, Ocasio-Cortez apparently went in on American foreign policy with regard to the Middle East but did not blame any other factors or countries for violence in the region, as several attendees told the paper.
Vietnam vet Mazzella said Ocasio Cortez talking about America that way ""really turned me off completely.""
She also bashed Israel's Netanyahu and talked about a number of other progressive or left-wing talking points, which you can read about here in the New York Post's article , leading one attendee to say ""I was revolted.""
Three attendees, including the two veterans and board members named above, stormed out ""in digust"" according to their own accounts and one another's. The Post also spoke with unnamed attendees, some of whom ""adored"" what AOC had to say, but apparently did not dispute that others stormed out.
Nevertheless, a spokesman for the congresswoman denied that anyone ""stormed"" out. ""The only person that left the meeting while it was underway was someone who had to go pick up their children,"" said Corbin Trent.
""That's bulls–t, said Vitaliano when the Post relayed the denial. ""Everybody that was there knows I walked out.""
So it seems Democrats do care about when and how one uses the word ""storms"" about leaving a meeting. Which is weird since they were just making fun of Trump for disputing that phrase about his own meeting."
"California Dems to consider resolution that links Israel to Tree of Life Synagogue massacre, report says",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-democrats-israel-pittsburgh-massacre,"During this year's California Democratic Party convention, which takes place in San Francisco this weekend, progressive activists will consider a resolution that links Israel to the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre that left 11 Jewish parishioners dead last October.
 The resolution claims the Tree of Life Synagogue massacre was ""the culmination of an alarming re-emergence of virulent antisemitism that is a core element of historical and currently resurgent white supremacism in the United States and around the world.""
""[The] Israeli government, along with some of its U.S. backers, welcomed support from Christian fundamentalist and ultra-right groups in the United States and abroad, dangerously ignoring their deeply rooted antisemitism while aligning with their virulent Islamophobia,"" the resolution goes on to claim.
Fox News first obtained the proposed resolution , which has been kept under wraps ahead of this weekend's convention. More than a dozen Democratic presidential contenders are expected to attend the convention.
The resolution is tentatively titled, ""Commending the House for resolving to fight all racism and bigotry and for resisting the false conflation of support for Palestinian rights with antisemitism,"" and is authored by state Assembly delegate David Mandel, a lawyer who holds dual U.S.-Israel citizenship.
What did Mandel say? Mandel disputed the characterization that his resolution links Israel to the massacre, but agreed that it indirectly does so.
""The Israeli government and its supporters here seem to be embracing the right-wing and not caring what they say about anything else — Islamophobia, dog whistles for anti-Semitism,"" Mandel said. ""That, I think, does indirectly lead to some of the violence.""
""What we're saying is the Israeli government is aligning itself with right-wing governments around the world, including in this country, and those right-wing groups — a core tenet of their ideology is antisemitism,"" he told Fox News.
The California Democrat went on to claim that ""most of the 3,000 or 4,000 delegates at the convention will agree with us,"" but predicted the resolution may not pass.
In 2017, Mandel helped pass a resolution at the convention denouncing the "" occupation of the Palestinian lands"" by the Israeli government.
Additionally, Mandel is spearheading another resolution at this year's convention calling on party officials to ""to devote an equal amount of time to visiting Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories"" if they take subsidized trips to Israel."
James Comey accuses Bill Barr of 'echoing conspiracy theories' in interview on origins of Trump probe - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/comey-says-barr-conspiracy-theorist,"Former FBI Director James Comey bashed Attorney General William Barr on Saturday, accusing him of ""echoing"" conspiracy theories in his interview with CBS Friday .
That interview took place one day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller gave his statement, just short of ten minutes long, about the investigation, his report, and his reluctance to go before Congress to testify. In the interview, Barr contradicted one of Mueller's central assertions, saying that he felt Mueller ""could've reached a decision"" about whether Trump obstructed justice or not.
Barr also questioned the origins of the investigation into the Trump campaign, a matter which the Justice Dept. under his direction is conducting its own investigation. ""I think the activities were undertaken by a small group at the top, which is one of the, probably one of the mistakes that has been made instead of running this as a normal bureau investigation or counterintelligence investigation. It was done by the executives at the senior level, out of headquarters,"" said Barr.
That leadership at the top, to which Barr referred, obviously includes then-FBI Director Comey, even though Barr told CBS's Jan Crawford he was ""not going to get into the individual names at this point.""
Comey was not happy. He said that Barr offered ""no facts,"" and that an Attorney General should not be ""echoing conspiracy theories.""
""He should just gather facts and show them,"" said James Comey.
""That is what Justice is about,"" James Comey added.
In the CBS interview, Barr said that ""Mueller has spent two and half years and the fact is there is no evidence of a conspiracy. So it was bogus, this whole idea that the Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus."" That, too, could not have sat well with Comey, who just a few days ago penned an op-ed for the Washington Post defending himself and his investigation.
After finding out that Russia was attempting to interfere with the 2016 election, wrote Comey, ""what should the FBI have done? Let it go? Go tell the Trump campaign? Tell the press? No. Investigate, to see what the facts were.""
""We didn't know what was true. Maybe there was nothing to it, or maybe Americans were actively conspiring with the Russians. To find out, the FBI would live up to its name and investigate,"" he said. ""As director, I was determined that the work would be done carefully, professionally and discreetly. ""
Much of his argument was specifically about the FBI not dislosing details to the Trump campaign.
""We were just starting. If there was nothing to it, we didn't want to smear Americans. If there was something to it, we didn't want to let corrupt Americans know we were onto them. So, we kept it secret. That's how the FBI approaches all counterintelligence cases.""
It's a big topic this week. Just the other day Catherine Herridge of Fox News revealed that, in a meeting about security threats with the Trump campaign, disgraced FBI Deputy Director Peter Strzok withheld information that Russia was attempting to interfere, and that Russians were targeting Trump officials, and even that two Trump campaign staff, George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn, were at that time the subject of investigation.
d that certainly was a big part of my formative years of dealing with those issues. The fact that today people just seem to brush aside the idea that it is okay to you know, to engage in these activities against a political campaign is stunning to me especially when the media doesn't seem to think that it's worth looking into. They're supposed to be the watchdogs of, you know, our civil liberties.
Barr talked about the explanations offered by Comey and others regarding those decisions, and why they are investigating that investigation.
""The fact that today people just seem to brush aside the idea that it is okay to you know, to engage in these activities against a political campaign is stunning to me,"" he said. ""Especially when the media doesn't seem to think that it's worth looking into. They're supposed to be the watchdogs of, you know, our civil liberties.""
Crawford asked Barr what he has seen that makes him question those decisions.
Barr said he has ""not gotten answers that are, well satisfactory, and in fact probably have more questions, and that some of the facts that- that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened.""
Crawford pressed for specifics, but Barr said he couldn't go into details. ""Things are just not jiving,"" he said, though he emphazised several times he saw a problem with the leadership of the FBI at the time, and not ""rife through the bureau.""
All of that no doubt contributed to Comey's outbursts, and there will likely be interviews for him in the coming days and weeks as Barr continues to investigate, and Democrats continue to question Barr's commitment to his job and ability to perform his tasks objectively."
"Former Super Bowl champion says Tom Brady, Drew Brees need to protest national anthem. Here's why.",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/martellus-bennett-brady-brees-manning-national-anthem-protest,"Retired NFL tight-end Martellus Bennett, who won the Super Bowl with the New England Patriots in 2016, is calling on prominent white quarterbacks in the NFL to continue national anthem protests.
What did Bennett say? Speaking this week at the Athletes + Activism forum hosted by The Atlantic columnist Jemele Hill, Bennett said Americans would wake up to issues like police brutality and systematic racism if prominent NFL quarterbacks like Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Peyton Manning protest the national anthem.
""If Peyton Manning joined the conversation, the conversation in the NFL would change. If Drew Brees came in and really joined the conversation, it would change. Tom Brady. All these great white heroes that they have running around, throwing the football — if they jump into the conversation, it would be so much bigger,"" Bennett said, according to Yahoo News .
Pictured: Martellus Bennett Justin Edmonds/Getty Images
It's not clear how Manning would impact the conservation. He retired from football following the 2015 season.
Still, Bennett believes American heroes like Brady can awaken segments of America he believes remain ignorant to issues that deeply impact minority communities.
""If they were to take a knee with Colin Kaepernick, that conversation would totally change,"" Bennett said. ""If Tom Brady took a knee, white America would be like, 'Oh my God. What is this that Tom Brady's talking about?'""
""They would start doing research and would join in the conversation. It would pique their interest,"" he added. ""But since it's a black guy taking a knee, it's like, 'Alright, these guys, here he goes again. It's another one of these guys out here doing this.'""
Does it have to be a quarterback? According to Yahoo News, Bennett said that if any real change is going to be made, it has to be a quarterback who shows solidarity with Colin Kaepernick because quarterbacks possess the real star power in the NFL.
Still, Bennett did not dismiss the work of former Philadelphia Eagle defensive end Chris Long , who protested the anthem in solidarity with his black teammates.
""Chris Long [joined] the conversation, but he's a defensive end. I love Chris Long. Chris Long is my boy. Shoutout to Chris,"" Bennett said. ""But it's not the position."""
"Obama trashes US gun laws in Brazil, claims Americans out buying up machine guns without 'any regulation' - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/obama-trashes-us-gun-law-in-brazil,"Former president Barack Obama was abroad, speaking at a tech conference in Brazil this week when he told the audience that America basically has no laws or regulations on selling weapons, including what he called ""machine guns.""
The moment was captured and put on YouTube, where it has since been removed by the user. But not before it was shared on Twitter and Facebook. (Watch below.)
""Some of you may be aware, our gun laws in the United States don't make much sense,"" said Obama. ""Anybody can buy any weapon any time, without--"" he had to pause as the foreign audience applauded him criticizing the United States. He then continued saying ""You know, without much, if any regulation, they can buy it over the Internet, they can buy machine guns.""
Obama was speaking the context of his speaking with parents after their children were murdered in the horrific Sandy Hook school shooting. He was expressing his pain and dismay at not being able to tell parents that the laws would change to prevent the easy purchase of machine guns.
However, the Sandy Hook shooter actually was prevented from purchasing a weapon, by our laws and regulations in this country. In fact, that evil murderer had to steal a weapon to commit his heinous acts. Stole them from his own mother, whom he murdered first. As Hot Air's Allahpundit put it ""I don't know what sort of regulation Obama has in mind to prevent that scenario apart from a total ban and mass confiscation.""
As Allahundit also pointed out, Obama was pitching America's lawlessness in a country that has a notoriously high murder rate, about six times that of the United States.
Of course weapons are regulated in the United States and many laws, both state and federal, govern their purchase, sale, use, manufacture, and more. The many intricate debates over gun laws that happen within our borders may not translate well in countries that have their own systems; it does not mean they do not exist.
But Obama obviously wasn't going for facts. He was just indulging one of American liberalism's favorite pastimes: criticizing America to an audience abroad.
In fact, that was kind of his specialty , back in the day."

That is, took it right out of the hands of 2020 Democrat Sen. Kamala Harris.
NBC News tweeted about it shortly after it happened, characterizing the man as a ""protester"" for some reason. Later, after the incident, a Boston Globe reporter tweeted that he called himself an ""animal rights activist' when speaking with reporters.
Watch as the liberal white male stomps across the stage past two women of color and steals the mic from a third to say he has a ""much bigger idea"", man-bun and Gandalf-beard bouncing the whole way.
A reporter from the Guardian later interviewed man-bun, who is actually named Aidan Cook, about the ""optics"" of his action. She also, for better or worse, included a close-up photo.
""""I tried to show my profound respect for each of the people onstage,"" he said, after which actual physical question marks floated in the sky around him.
The question that Sen. Harris was answering at the time? It was about the so-called ""gender gap"" in pay in the United States. The Senator, for her part, handled the whole thing very well.
In the social justice hierarchy wars, it's hard to predict which aggrieved class will come out ahead. But considering the relative lack of bloodthirsty Twitter outrage, it's safe to say in this case, it appears being white and male is offset by being a disheveled weirdo with a frightening man-bun. Who knew?"
"WATCH: Sky News promo has Trump casting giant, diaper-clad shadow across UK ahead of state visit",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/sky-news-trump-promo-shadow-baby,"Well, this is something, alright. It's the new promo that Sky News has put out to pitch their wall-to-wall coverage of President Trump's three-day state visit to the UK, which begins on Monday, June 3rd.
The ad shows a giant shadow crossing over London, Buckingham Palace, even the Queen, as dramatic music swells to a crescendo, when the shadow's caster is revealed: a giant blimp of Trump as a baby in diapers.
Watch:
That blimp or parade balloon, whatever you may call it, has made several appearances since Trump took office, as Blaze readers surely recall .
That is truly a test of the eye of the beholder. Are they mocking him? Fearing him? Is it casting him as bigger than the UK? More important? What is his shadow?
Or it's just a humorous play on the fact that he's coming, that his visit is really big news, and also that the baby ballon that protesters use every time he crosses the pond or there's a protest has become a bit of a cultural phenomenon.
That would be my bet. But hey, what do I know, I'm just an American."
"Bubonic plague (aka The Black Death) probably already here, in Los Angeles, says Dr. Drew",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bubonic-plague-los-angeles-drew,"The Black Plague. The Black Death. The all-time global pandemic was so devastating, and so frightening, that hundred of years later, even the name still conjures fear and anxiety.
The bubonic plague is a metaphor for any global health horror. It is an idiom, a warning, it's a cautionary tale and the story of nature wrath, or God's. And, unfortunately, more important than all those other things, it's back .
And worse, it's here . Along with typhus, typhoid and more, because the city is covered in trash, rats, and feces.
This week, Dr. Drew Pinsky talked to Fox News Channel's Laura Ingraham about the appalling conditions in the city of Los Angeles, where public health risks are myriad, deadly serious, and unbelievably, getting worse.
""We have a complete breakdown of the basic needs of civilization in Los Angeles right now,"" said Dr Drew. He listed what he called the ""three prongs"" of the problem.
The first prong is ""airborne disease,"" he said, pointing out that ""tuberculosis is exploding.""
The second prong is the one that brings the black death: ""Rodent-borne.""
""We're one of the only major cities in the country that doesn't have a rodent control program, and sanitation has broken down, we had a typhus last summer, we will have a typhus outbreak this summer,"" he explained. ""I'm hearing from experts that bubonic plague is likely, it's already here. It'll get onto the rat fleas.""
The third prong is ""this oral-fecal"" contamination, he said. ""Which is typhoid fever, three cases. One confirmed, probably three.""
""This is unbelievable. I can't believe I live in a city--this is not third-world, Laura. This is medieval."" he said. ""Third-world countries are insulted if they are accused of being like this. No city on earth tolerates this. The entire population is at risk.""
Making matters worse, if you can believe it, the population in L.A. is what Dr. Drew delicately phrased as ""sub-optimally immunized,"" and therefore at huge risk for additional diseases making their comeback, like measles.
""I just have this vision of myself on my knees in the gutter tending to people,"" he said. ""This summer is likely to be a very profound problem.""
And then to make maters even worse than worse, if you can believe that , the city and state will be taking in thousands of refugees, who they won't be able to handle with city services that are already failing the existing population.
""We can't handle our situation such as it is,"" he said. ""And there's a very bizarre thing going on where the government is somehow somehow insisting that housing is the problem, when in fact we have chronic mental illness, we have addiction, we have people who don't want to leave the streets,"" Pinsky said. ""They literally won't take the housing if we give it to them. And that's the population that's vulnerable, and is going to get so ill this summer. It scares me for their well-being.""
""This is disgusting, it is reckless negligence,"" said Dr. Drew. ""We have to have a solution to this.""
Watch:
(Video may take a second to load from Fox.)
Watch the latest video at FoxNews.com At the Daily Wire, Joseph Curl points out that the contributing factors to this health crisis were not unknown in the city, or even elsewhere in that bluest of states. For example, with regard to feces:
The piles and piles of garbage, and the subsequent rat problem, have been a problem literally growing before the city's eyes for months .
In the Fox clip, Ingraham says this is not a political issue, but a public health crisis. But the question of whether political positions lead to this health crisis should be examined. And soon. Before a quarter of the world's population is wiped out, maybe?
It took 200 years for the earth's population to recover from the devastation of the black plague. Let's hope it doesn't take that long for Los Angeles officials to wake up.
Hey maybe if celebrities could take some time out from telling Georgia how to law, they could spare some time for the city that's home to their entire industry. You think?"
WATCH: Jake Tapper grills Cory Booker over gun control vision after Virginia Beach tragedy - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/jake-tapper-cory-booker-gun-control,"After the massacre in Virginia Beach last week, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) completely overhauled his speech at the California Democratic Party convention on Saturday, using the day-old tragedy to push his plan for comprehensive gun control .
By Sunday, Booker deflected questions from CNN host Jake Tapper, who hammered the Democratic presidential hopeful over the plan's nuances and questioned how it would have prevented Friday's tragedy.
What happened? Appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Booker dodged numerous questions over how gun control — which typically advocate for restrictions on semi-automatic rifles, like the AR-15 — would have prevented Friday's tragedy given it was carried out with two legally purchased handguns.
""How would your plan have stopped this tragedy, if at all?"" Tapper asked.
Booker, however, completely ignored Tapper's question, instead focusing on generalized gun violence in America.
""Well, Jake, again, this is a tragedy today, but you know that every single day in the United States of America, in the aggregate, we have mass shootings that go on in neighborhoods like mine,"" Booker said. ""We are not helpless to stop this. This is a uniquely American problem.""
""We have carnage in our country at levels that no other nation sees, more people dying in my lifetime due to gun violence than all the Americans that died due to gun violence in every single war from the Revolutionary now — war until now,"" he continued.
As Booker continued to advocate for his vision of gun control in America, Tapper did not relent.
""I'm sorry to interrupt, but ... what would have prevented this tragedy?"" Tapper asked. ""What steps specifically would have stopped the massacre in Virginia Beach?""
The New Jersey senator never answered Tapper's question, instead only talking about his gun control plan.
Finally, Tapper had enough.
""I hear you not talking about this specific massacre, but talking about gun violence in general,"" he said, shifting the interview to a different gun control question.

Pentagon sends stern message to White House over USS John McCain debacle,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/contributors/pentagon-message-uss-john-mccain,"The Pentagon sent a stern message to the White House over the weekend after it was confirmed officials directed the United States Navy to minimize the presence of the USS John McCain during President Donald Trump's recent visit to Japan.
What did the Pentagon say? Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan directed his staff over the weekend to reaffirm that the U.S. military will not be ""politicized,"" Reuters reported .
""Secretary Shanahan directed his chief of staff to speak with the White House military office and reaffirm his mandate that the Department of Defense will not be politicized,"" Pentagon spokesman Lt. Colonel Joe Buccino said. ""The chief of staff reported that he did reinforce this message.""
While traveling to Seoul on Sunday, Shanahan reaffirmed his message to reporters accompanying him on the trip.
""There is no room for politicizing the military,"" Shanahan said.
What is the background? On Saturday, the U.S. Navy confirmed the White House requested the USS John McCain be moved during Trump's visit to Japan, NBC News reported .
""A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President's visit,"" Rear Admiral Charlie Brown, chief of information, told NBC.
According to Reuters, the request originated in the White House military office. Apparently, staffers believed the optics would not be good for the president since McCain was one of his biggest political rivals.
However, as Brown confirmed, senior Navy leadership refused comply with the request.
What is the White House saying? On Sunday, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney downplayed the incident, calling the request ""not ... unreasonable."""
"YouTube 'looking into' Steven Crowder after Vox writer asks them to, and Crowder responds... via YouTube",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/youtube-investigating-steven-crowder-after-vox-writer-asks-them-to-and-crowder-responds-via-youtube,"YouTube is now investigating conservative comedian, BlazeTV host, and YouTube star Steven Crowder, after a Vox writer who frequently targets conservatives for de-platforming asked them to. And Crowder has a response.
It started - well the current scuffle started - when Vox's Carlos Maza took his case to his Twitter feed to complain that Crowder was harassing and bullying him. In his Tweet thread, he included a heavily edited montage of excerpts from Crowder's shows, where he made fun of Maza.
Since I started working at Vox, Steven Crowder has been making video after video ""debunking"" Strikethrough. Every single video has included repeated, overt attacks on my sexual orientation and ethnicity. Here's a sample: pic.twitter.com/UReCcQ2Elj
— Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 31, 2019 In that thread, Maza not only targets Crowder for crowd-sourced flagging and reporting, he repeatedly places blame and responsibility on YouTube for allowing a ""monster"" for allowing ""bullying"" of its ""LGBT creators.""
Anyway, if you want to help, I guess you can go to this dude's videos and flag them? But @YouTube isn't going to do anything, because YouTube does not give a fuck about queer creators. It cares about ""engagement,"" and homophobic/racist harassment is VERY ""engaging.""
— Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 31, 2019 YouTube responded to the Vox writer personally on Twitter.
Thanks so much for outlining all of this–we're looking into it further. Sending you a DM now.
— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) May 31, 2019 So personal attention for the liberal writer at a site backed by a major corporate entity.
And that is exactly what Steven Crowder talked about in this response. Watch:
""This is corporate censorship, and this is yet another giant company trying to lean on this channel, your channel, and the content that you've created,"" says Crowder. ""And this is a war ... we will fight to the absolute bitter end both legally and publicly.
He also made an interesting point about viewership. Without being featured, while being in general shunned by YouTube as a company, his channels subscribers and views dwarf those of places like Vox, who on the other hand get all sorts of love and attention from YouTube, he says.
Crowder characterizes this as a David vs. Goliath battle. It is also yet another example of how there is a fine line between corporate freedom to select their content, and coordinated censorship of one point of view by the culturally acceptable other side."
Dem running for pres denounces socialism. This San Fransisco crowd makes him pay for it.,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-hickenlooper-booed-socialism,"In the not-too-distant history, the pronouncement of socialism in America would be immediately met with stern rebuke and denunciation.
However, the exact opposite happened Saturday when Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), amid progressive Democrats, denounced socialism.
What happened? While speaking at the California Democratic Party convention, Hickenlooper told the San Fransisco crowd that if Democrats want to defeat President Donald Trump in 2020, they will need traditional Democratic values in their corner — not socialism.
""If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer,"" Hickenlooper said.
The denunciation was met with immediate blowback, including a sea of boos lasting more than 30 seconds .
But Hickenlooper — a moderate Democrat who worked with Republicans during his years as Colorado's governor — took his socialism criticism one step further. He warned that if the Democratic Party is not careful with its embrace of quasi-socialist ideas, then they will singlehandedly ensure Trump is president four more years.
""You know, if we're not careful, we're going to end up re-electing the worst president in American history,"" he said, according to the Washington Post.
After his speech, Hickenlooper told The Hill that Republicans will use the Democratic Party's embrace of socialism to paint all Democrats as outside the mainstream of American orthodoxy.
He said:
If we don't draw a clear distinction between Democrats and our candidates and socialism, the Republicans will paint us into a corner that we can't get out of. Massive government expansions may not be strictly speaking socialism, but trust me Republicans will make it seem like socialism. In places like Ohio and Michigan and North Carolina and Wisconsin, places we have to win to beat Trump, we'll be starting out ten yards behind.
We need to be laser-focused on winning this election, and that's going to mean focusing on kitchen table programs that will actually improve people's quality of life. Meanwhile, Hickenlooper told CNN he did not expect his message to be well-received.
""We had no illusions that everyone was going to embrace the message. We thought it was important to say, right? Not everyone in the party is going to rally to that perception but I feel that it needed to be said,"" he said."
"Media says Trump called Meghan Markle 'nasty', he just denied it, and there's actual audio",www.theblaze.com,Caleb Howe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-markle-uk-nasty-state-visit,"The media has had big news about a big feud the last few days, with blaring headlines and clicky tweets shouting that President Trump called Meghan Markle ""nasty.""
Reading those headlines one would be sure that he made some Trumpian comment about the Duchess of Sussex, unprompted and unwarranted, ahead of his big state visit. A regular ""own goal"" attempt to score on someone for no reason.
On Twitter, though, the Trump War Room disputed that story, calling it false and fake news in a slew of tweets. One, which included the actual audio (below), said this.
Fake News CNN is at it again, falsely claiming President Trump called Meghan Markle ""nasty."" The media, particularly CNN reporters, pushed back, there was back and forth, and on Sunday morning, Trump weighed in himself.
I never called Meghan Markle “nasty."" Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN , @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2019 So what really happened? Well if you read the headlines, you may be surprised by the context.
Here is a transcript:
REPORTER: She can't make it because she has maternity leave. Are you sorry not to see her, because she wasn't so nice about you during the campaign. I don't know if you saw that?
TRUMP: I didn't know that, no. I didn't know that. No, I hope she's OK. I did not know that, no. pic.twitter.com/JEjIFPYDy6
— Official Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) June 1, 2019 And here is the audio:
Fake News CNN is at it again, falsely claiming President Trump called Meghan Markle ""nasty."" Here is what he actually said. Listen for yourself! pic.twitter.com/kLuPXBLMhf
— Official Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) June 1, 2019 After the Trump War Room tweeted, the MSM treated it as their own goal for having proved Trump said what they said he didn't say.
But if we can be real for a second, there is an obvious material difference between the implication that Trump went out of his way to insult the Duchess as nasty, and what actually happened.
Trump was confronted with her past criticism. He said he didn't know that she was nasty toward him.
If you say something ugly behind my back, and I don't know, and someone tells me, and I say ""I didn't know so-and-so was ugly that one time"", I'm not calling you ugly. I'm saying I didn't know you said something ugly.
That's more than obviously what happened here. Pitching a headline like ""Trump calls Markle nasty"" is disingenous at the least. At the most, it's clickbait.
Trump characterized Markle's prior behavior as nasty. ""I didn't know she was mean [to me]."" The ""to me"" or ""like that"" or ""in that instance"" is not only very overtly implied as part of the sentence, he makes it even more plain whwen he says he thinks it's nice that there's an American princess and that she'll ""do excellently.""
""She will be very good,"" he said.
It's not really something that should require this degree of explanation. The media obviously tried to blow it up into some slam on Markle that it obviously wasn't, and then played a game of Twitter dunking on the War Room for tweeting the context.
That is, again, not being a journalist. It's being an activist, perhaps, or a click-monger.
Trump said ""nasty."" It's on tape. That's a fact. The media characterized it as something that it wasn't. That, too, is a fact. If there's a media person out there reading this, instinctively siding against Trump and thinking to yourself ""that's exactly what he said, so we're right"" … I suggest you really look deep and ask yourself whether you're being a journalist or a hater."
Veterans set record straight after Ocasio-Cortez spox denies they left politicized meeting - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/veterans-ocasio-cortez-meeting-set-record-straight,"Two veterans who walked out on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) last week for politicizing a community meeting, disparaging President Donald Trump in the process, are setting the record straight.
Speaking on ""Fox and Friends"" Sunday, the veterans hit back after Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent denied they left the meeting.
""The only person that left the meeting while it was underway was someone who had to go pick up their children,"" Trent told the New York Post .
What did the veterans say? Army veteran Anthony Vitaliano, 78, and Vietnam War veteran Silvio Mazzella, 74, confirmed they walked out of the meeting despite Trent's claims.
In their interview, Vitaliano recounted what happened during the contentious meeting in which Ocasio-Cortez denounced ""American bombs,"" President Donald Trump, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Vitaliano also hammered Ocasio-Cortez for being noticeably absent from her district while her national profile has exploded.
""It was a prepared agenda for the — let's put in this way, she is our congresswoman from January, we haven't seen her in our area until May 28, Tuesday at 5:30. Everybody else in the United States has seen her except her own district,"" Vitaliano said.
Mazzella said Ocasio-Cortez's comments reminded him of the negative treatment he received upon coming home after fighting in the Vietnam War, which inspired him to walk out of the meeting.
""Didn't feel good. It actually reminds me when I came home from 'Nam and we had the protesters here,"" he said. ""You know that's not the way to treat people.""
Vitaliano explained the straw that broke the camel's back for him came when Ocasio-Cortez blamed Trump for increasing tensions in the Middle East, specifically with Iran, because he withdrew the U.S. from the Obama administration's Iran nuclear deal.
""I said, 'That's it, I gotta get outta there. It's best for me to leave.' And I picked my umbrella up and walked right out,"" Vitaliano explained.

President Trump makes surprise stop at Virginia church. Watch what happens next. - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/david-platt-donald-trump-prayer,"President Donald Trump made a surprise visit to McLean Bible Church outside the nation's capital on Sunday, where he met with lead pastor David Platt following the tragic shooting in Virginia Beach last Friday.
What happened? Video from Trump's visit shows the president onstage at the church. With hat in hand, Trump bows his head while Platt prays.
Here are some of the highlights from Platt's prayer:
""Oh God, we praise you as the one universal king over all. You are our leader and our lord and we worship you. There is one God and one savior — and it's you, your name is Jesus."" ""We stand right now on behalf of our president and we pray for your grace and your mercy and your wisdom upon him. And God we play that he would know how much you love him — so much that you sent Jesus to die for his sins."" ""Lord, we pray, we pray that you would give him all the grace he needs..."" ""Wisdom, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction. Please, O God, give him wisdom and help him to lead our country."" After Platt finished his lengthy prayer, his congregation erupted in applause and cheers. The president shook Platt's hand, thanked him, and thanked the church before exiting the stage.
Trump, however, did not make any remarks.
""President Donald J. Trump is visiting McLean Bible Church in Vienna, VA, to visit with the Pastor and pray for the victims and community of Virginia Beach,"" the White House said in a statement, according to the Washington Examiner .
Here is Platt's full prayer: Oh God, we praise you as the one universal king over all. You are our leader and our lord and we worship you. There is one God and one savior — and it's you, your name is Jesus. And we exalt you Jesus. And we know we need your mercy. We need your grace. We need your help, we need your wisdom in our country.
We stand right now on behalf of our president and we pray for your grace and your mercy and your wisdom upon him. And God we play that he would know how much you love him — so much that you sent Jesus to die for his sins, our sins. So we pray that he would look to you and that he would trust in you, that he would lean on you, that he would govern and make decisions in ways that are good for justice and good for righteousness and good for equity, every good path.
Lord, we pray, we pray that you would give him all the grace he needs in ways that we just saw in 1 Timothy 2 that lead to peaceful and quiet lives, godly and dignified in every way. God we pray for your blessing in that way upon his family. We pray that you would give them strength, we pray that you would give them clarity, wisdom — wisdom, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction. Please, O God, give him wisdom and help him to lead our country.
Alongside other leaders, we pray today for leaders in Congress, we pray for leaders in courts, we pray for leaders at national and state levels. Please, O God, help us to look to you, help us to trust in your word, help us to seek your wisdom and live in ways that reflect your love and your grace and your righteousness and your justice.
We pray for your blessings on our president toward that end. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen."

What did he say? During Monday's broadcast of ""Good Morning Britain,"" Morgan spoke out against the hundreds of thousands of protesters across London, calling them ""disrespectful"" and the protests unnecessary.
""I think, actually, indeed, they ... are a little bit disrespectful to be waving baby balloons all around the place at the President of the United States,"" he explained. ""When we needed the Americans in World War II, they were there for us.""
""And if our response [to that country] is to have bigger protests against the leader of United States, than it ever was against the leader of Saudi Arabia ... or China ... or Russia ... There's something a bit warped about our values,"" Morgan said.

But now Dia'mon Dallas is suing First Coast Technical College in St. Augustine along with its principal and assistant principal, the station said.
""Everything has just gone down the drain,"" she told WJAX. ""I really was trying hard in school. I was making As.""
What's the background? Dallas said her fiance's cousin, a veteran, was showing them how to use guns at a shooting range, the station reported. Anfernee Royster, her fiance, added to WJAX that he posted the photo on Facebook with the caption, ""She's my Bonnie and I'm her Clyde.""

""What I mean is like, we're together forever,"" Royster told the station. ""And I feel like the main thing was that we were getting stereotyped because of the color of our skin.""
Dallas told WJAX an administrator wouldn't even allow her go into a classroom to get a crock pot she brought for a party — and that the administrator said she didn't know what Dallas would do to other students.
""I can't get a job, and I have a baby I have to support,"" Dallas told the station. ""I've been out of work long enough, and I wanted to do this to be able to provide for my family. And now I can't.""

"Dem. presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand repeats lies about the NRA, dodges questions about gun control",www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kirsten-gillibrand-lies-nra-fox-news-town-hall,"Democratic presidential contender Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) repeatedly lied about the National Rifle Association during a Fox News town hall Sunday while arguing for stricter gun control regulations, yet failing to offer real solutions.
What did Gillibrand lie about? The New York senator, in attempting to paint the NRA as heartless, repeated one of the most common, yet completely false, talking points about the NRA: that ""they care more about their profits"" and ""selling guns.""
""The NRA is the worst organization in this country. They care more about their profits than the American people, they care more about selling guns to someone on the terror watch list or with a grave mental illness or who has a violent criminal background,"" Gillibrand claimed.
Both claims, however are false. The NRA neither collects profits — though the organization collects hundreds of millions of dollars per year in revenue — because it is a non-profit, nor does the NRA sell guns.
The NRA is an organization that promotes the Second Amendment and firearm safety. The organization also lobbies lawmakers nationwide for expanded access to firearms, while promoting legal challenges to gun control laws.
Meanwhile, organizations like the NRA oppose banning people on ""the terror watch list"" from owning or possessing firearms because they believe it unconstitutionally deprives individuals of their Second Amendment rights without due process. Additionally, those with a ""violent criminal background"" or ""grave mental illness"" are already legally barred from owning or possessing firearms.

Later, Gillibrand claimed the NRA ""wants to make sure an abuser who has a restraining order against him can buy a weapon."" However, in most cases, those with a restraining order against them are legally barred from possessing a firearm. The NRA does not advocate for this federal regulation to be overturned.
Gillibrand also claimed that President Donald Trump did not impose a ban on bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre, despite promising to do so. This, of course, is also false. The Justice Department implemented the ban last year .
Did Chris Wallace push back? Network anchor Chris Wallace, who moderated the town hall, asked Gillibrand how her vision of gun control would have prevented last week's tragedy in Virginia Beach, which resulted in 12 deaths. Police have said the perpetrator used two legally purchased handguns to carry out the massacre.
Gillibrand did not answer the question. Instead, she used the opportunity to attack the NRA and Trump.
""Is there anything you could have done that would have stopped this terrible incident?"" Wallace asked.
""Yeah, stop being beholden to the NRA like President Trump is,"" Gillibrand said."
Pentagon sends stern message to White House over USS John McCain debacle,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-message-uss-john-mccain,"The Pentagon sent a stern message to the White House over the weekend after it was confirmed officials directed the United States Navy to minimize the presence of the USS John McCain during President Donald Trump's recent visit to Japan.
What did the Pentagon say? Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan directed his staff over the weekend to reaffirm that the U.S. military will not be ""politicized,"" Reuters reported .
""Secretary Shanahan directed his chief of staff to speak with the White House military office and reaffirm his mandate that the Department of Defense will not be politicized,"" Pentagon spokesman Lt. Colonel Joe Buccino said. ""The chief of staff reported that he did reinforce this message.""
While traveling to Seoul on Sunday, Shanahan reaffirmed his message to reporters accompanying him on the trip.
""There is no room for politicizing the military,"" Shanahan said.
What is the background? On Saturday, the U.S. Navy confirmed the White House requested the USS John McCain be moved during Trump's visit to Japan, NBC News reported .
""A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President's visit,"" Rear Admiral Charlie Brown, chief of information, told NBC.
According to Reuters, the request originated in the White House military office. Apparently, staffers believed the optics would not be good for the president since McCain was one of his biggest political rivals.
However, as Brown confirmed, senior Navy leadership refused comply with the request.
What is the White House saying? On Sunday, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney downplayed the incident, calling the request ""not ... unreasonable."""
Another Trump win? Mexican president signals immigration deal over Trump's trade war threat,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mexico-immigration-deal-tariff-threat,"President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a stiff tariff on Mexican goods if Mexico does not implement controls to hamper the flow of migrants from Central America to the United States.
And it appears the threat might be making progress.
What are the details? Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador hinted over the weekend that he is prepared to ""tighten migration controls"" and reach a deal with Trump to prevent the tariff implementation, Reuters reported .
Mexican officials will begin negotiations with the Trump administration in Washington, D.C., this week. López Obrador said he expects ""good results.""
""We're doing all we can to reach a deal through dialogue,"" he said, according to Reuters. ""We're not going to get into a trade war, a war of tariffs and of taxes.""
""The main thing is to inform about what we're already doing on the migration issue, and if it's necessary to reinforce these measures without violating human rights, we could be prepared to reach that deal,"" he explained.
What is the Trump administration planning? The president said he will implement a 5 percent tariff on Mexican goods ""unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory.""
The tariff would go into effect on June 10. If Mexico does not take effective action, the tariff will increase by 5 percent each month until it hits a crippling 25 percent on Oct. 1.
The administration said the tariff will only be removed ""if the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment.""
Ahead of negotiations with Mexican officials, Trump said over the weekend that he wants ""action, not talk."""
Sephora to close US stores for diversity training after R&B singer SZA says she was racially profiled,www.theblaze.com,Jana J. Pruet,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/sephora-diversity-training-following-sza-incident,"Sephora beauty stores will close all of its U.S. stores, offices, and distribution centers Wednesday to hold a day of diversity training.
The news of the company's training day follows an incident involving R&B artist SZA. The singer claimed that she was racially profiled while shopping at a Sephora store in April, Reuters reported.
""We have been informed of an incident at our Calabasas store and in addition to reaching out to SZA directly, we are gathering more information about the incident in order to take the proper next steps,"" Sephora spokeswoman Emily Shapiro told Reuters in an email. ""We take complaints like this very seriously, profiling on the basis of race is not tolerated at Sephora.""
What's the story? SZA tweeted that an employee, whom she identified as ""Sandy,"" had called security to make sure she wasn't stealing from a store in Calabasas, California. The singer reportedly worked at a Sephora store in the past.
""Lmao Sandy Sephora location 614 Calabasas called security to make sure I wasn't stealing . We had a long talk. U have a blessed day Sandy,"" the Grammy-nominated singer tweeted April 30.
The LVMH -owned company responded to SZA on Twitter.
""Hi, SZA. We're sorry to hear about your experience at our Calabasas store and appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We want to let you know we take complaints like this very seriously and are actively working with our teams to address the situation immediately,"" Sephora tweeted at the time.
""You are a part of the Sephora family, and we are committed to ensuring every member of our community feels welcome and included at our stores,"" Sephora wrote in another response.
Shapiro told Reuters that the inclusivity workshops weren't scheduled in ""response to any one event.""
The training is part of the company's ""We Belong to Something Beautiful"" campaign and had been in the works for several months, she added.
What else? Last year, Starbucks closed about 8,000 stores in the U.S. to hold racial-bias training after two black men were arrested for defiant-trespassing at a Philadelphia store.
The store manager said she had called police on the men who didn't order anything and refused to leave the store when asked. The location reportedly had problems with loiterers.
The men claimed the issue was based on their race."
Louisiana Catholic school principal resigns after being arrested at a strip club during DC field trip,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/la-catholic-school-principal-resigns-after-being-arrested-at-a-strip-club-during-dc-field-trip,"A Louisiana Catholic school principal has stepped down after being arrested at a strip club while chaperoning a field trip to Washington, D.C.
What are the details? Michael Comeau, 47, then-principal of the Holy Family Catholic School, was picked up by police outside Archibald's Gentleman's Club near the White House early Friday morning. Officers were responding to call about a patron who was ""intoxicated"" and ""refusing to pay his bill,"" WAFB-TV reported.
According to the incident report, Comeau ""was observed standing in the roadway, refusing to move,"" and was arrested for suspicion of public intoxication and possession of an open container of alcohol after refusing multiple requests to get out of the street. Witnesses claimed Comeau had a service dog with him in the club, but the police report did not mention the animal being with the suspect at the time of his arrest.
The principal — who was supervising a school-sponsored trip to the nation's capital for Holy Family's seventh and eighth graders — resigned via text hours later.
A spokesman for the Diocese of Baton Rouge confirmed Comeau's arrest and subsequent resignation through a statement, clarifying that ""The incident occurred when the students on the trip were in their hotel rooms for the evening under the supervision of other chaperones,"" the Monroe Daily Star reported.
According to WAFB, Comeau also worked as a part-time reserve officer for the Brusly Police Department in Brusly, Louisiana, and has resigned from his position there, too.
Anything else? The Advocate reported that before his arrest, Comeau was ""seen as a rising star locally and nationally,"" after being ""named one of the 20 outstanding teachers honored by USA Today and received the prestigious Milken education award, which comes with a $25,000 stipend.""
But this isn't the first time the principal has come under fire. In 2006, Comeau stepped down as assistant principal at Baton Rouge's Prescott Middle School over accusations that he mishandled $120,000 in Hurricane Katrina recovery donations."
The State Department has started requesting social media information from 'most' new visa applicants,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-state-deparment-has-started-requesting-social-media-information-from-most-new-visa-applicants,"The U.S. State Department has announced that it has begun requesting social media information from ""most"" new visa applicants. Previously, this information had only been requested for applicants who had already been identified as cases that needed to be more closely inspected.
Here's what we know This move to request social media information was expected, and had first been announced in a public notice from the department on March 30, which allowed for 60 days of public comment before the policy would be implemented.
According to this notice, a new question on visa applications ""lists multiple social media platforms and requires the applicant to provide any identifiers used by applicants for those platforms during the five years preceding the date of application."" Additionally, ""the applicant will be given the option to provide information about any social media identifiers associated with any platforms other than those that are listed that the applicant has used in the last five years."" This information would then be used as part of the vetting process.
A State Department official told Hill.TV that visa applicants could choose to say that they did not have any social media accounts, but if they were caught lying they could face ""serious immigration consequences.""
On Friday, the State Department announced that the new policy was officially going into effect. The department said that this would help with ""vetting these [Visa] applicants and confirming their identity."" This will apply both to visa applicants who hope to pursue citizenship, and those requesting visas for tourism.
""National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications, and every prospective traveler and immigrant to the United States undergoes extensive security screening,"" the State Department said in a statement. ""We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes to protect U.S. citizens, while supporting legitimate travel to the United States."""
"During anti-gun rally, Baltimore mayor suggests that boxing matches settle arguments",www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/baltimore-mayor-boxing-matches-settle-arguments,"Baltimore Mayor Bernard ""Jack"" C. Young said over the weekend that people with disagreements should duke it out in the boxing ring rather than bring weapons into the fray.
Oh, yeah? During an anti-gun rally in Baltimore on Sunday, Young — who replaced former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, who resigned amid scandal — said that these young people with ""beef"" can box their differences away.
Young, along with Baltimore state's Attorney Marilyn Mosby and Baltimore City Councilman Robert Stokes Sr. attended the ""Bmore United"" rally, which was held at Parkside Shopping Center. Members of the city's Walk by Faith Ministries also appeared alongside the lawmakers.
""There's mediation,"" he explained. ""If they wanna really settle them, we can have them down at the Civic Center [now called Royal Farms Arena], put a boxing ring up, and let them go and box it out, those kind of things.""
If that were a choice, ""the best man [could] win, and the beef should be over,"" he said.
""Those are some kind of things that I'm thinking about, and hoping that we can get these people to put these guns down,"" Young added.
During remarks, Mosby pointed to six youths who were arrested during a ""ruckus"" that took place in Baltimore's Inner Harbor on May 25.
""We saw what happened last week with the young people in our city, and we want to make sure we are supportive of them,"" Mosby told the people gathered at the rally. ""It's time for us collectively to come together and change the trajectory and find productive activities for our young people, especially when we know they're getting out of school.""
What else? WBAL-TV reported that Young's comments come on the heels of 11 people being injured and one killed during eight separate shootings that took place in Baltimore over the weekend.
The station reported that the Bmore United rally is helping to usher in National Gun Violence Awareness Day on Friday."
A Scottish family had a missing piece of an ancient chess sitting in a drawer — now it be sold for more than $1 million,www.theblaze.com,Mike Ciandella,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/ancient-chess-piece-worth-1-million,"One of the missing pieces from a more than 800-year-old famous chess set is expected to fetch up to $1.3 million at auction . It is being sold by a private family who owned the piece for decades, with no idea what it was.
Why is this discovery significant? The game of chess was invented roughly 1,500 years ago . It was based on an older game from India, that was itself based on an even older game from China. It spread to Europe after it was brought there by the Muslim Moors who invaded what is now Spain in the 700s A.D.
The Lewis Chessmen were discovered on the Scottish Isle of Lewis at some point before April 11, 1831, the exact date is unclear. Between November of that year and January 1832, they were sold to the British Museum.
Experts who analyzed the chess pieces determined that they were likely made in Norway sometime around 1150 to 1200 A.D. To date, 93 pieces had been discovered, enough for four sets with five pieces missing: one knight and four ""warders,"" an early version of a rook.
The piece that turned up now was one of the missing warders.
So what happened now? The missing chess piece wasn't discovered buried at some archaeological site — it was found in a drawer in a private residence in Edinburgh where it was stored for 55 years. A spokesperson for the family who owned the chess piece said that the person who brought it to Sotheby's London auction house described it as ""Antique Walrus Tusk Warrior Chessman,"" because they had been unaware of its true identity and value.
The unnamed current owner of the chess piece said that it had originally belonged to his grandfather, an antiques dealer who had bought the chess piece from another antiques dealer in 1964. Then it passed to his mother and ""[f]or many years it resided in a drawer in her home where it had been carefully wrapped in a small bag. From time to time, she would remove the chess piece from the drawer in order to appreciate its uniqueness.""
This is the only one of the Lewis Chessmen known to exist that is not currently owned by a museum."
Border Patrol apprehends group of 116 African nationals illegally crossing into the US from Mexico,www.theblaze.com,Breck Dumas,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/border-patrol-large-group-of-african-illegals,"A large group of 116 African nationals was picked up by Border Patrol last week, after being caught on video wading across the Rio Grande River into Texas from Mexico.
What are the details? U.S. Customs and Border Patrol announced its agents at the Del Rio Station apprehended the group Thursday night around 10:30 p.m., posting video footage on Twitter showing men and women carrying children — arms linked — through waist-high waters.
Chief Raul Ortiz issued a statement the next day saying, ""Large groups present a unique challenge for the men and women of the Del Rio Sector. This group from Africa further demonstrates the complexity and severity of the border security and humanitarian crisis at our Southwest border.""
CBP said agents have encountered 182 large groups (defined as 100 individuals or more) of illegal immigrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico so far this fiscal year, but that this is the first consisting entirely of people from African countries. The individuals were purportedly from Congo, Angola, and Cameroon.
The White House also shared the news to its Twitter feed, declaring, ""Our southern border is now a magnet for illegal immigration from all over the world. It's time for Democrats to help close the loopholes!""
Late last year, Border Patrol Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Roy Villareal told Fox News that for the first time in the agency's history, a majority of arrests at the U.S. border now consist of people from countries other than Mexico. In the past, most illegal aliens apprehended at the southern border were Mexican nationals looking for work. Now, large groups of families and unaccompanied children are making the trek together from mostly Central American nations.
It is unclear how the group of African nationals ended up at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Anything else? President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on Mexico to do more to prevent its own citizens and migrants from other countries from pouring into the U.S.
In the past he has threatened to close the U.S. southern border entirely. Last week, he announced week that his administration would soon impose a tariff on Mexican goods ""until the illegal immigration problem is remedied."""
Social media takes actress to the woodshed after she tweets debunked fake news about President Donald Trump,www.theblaze.com,Sarah Taylor,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/social-media-takes-bette-midler-to-woodshed-for-fake-trump-news,"Social media trashed actress Bette Midler after she shared an anti-Trump meme that's been proven to be a fake depiction of his remarks.
What happened? Midler, a rabid Trump protester, shared the meme Sunday on Twitter, featuring a very dated photo of President Donald Trump with the caption, ""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""
Midler captioned the tweet, ""He certainly knew his crowd.""
The now-debunked meme made rounds on the internet in 2015, but Snopes fact-checked it and revealed that it was fake.
According to Snopes, the photo and Quote: , purported to be pulled from a 1998 edition of People magazine, could not be found anywhere in People's archives.
The outlet's Kim Quote: :
Despite People's comprehensive online content archive, we found no interview or profile on Donald Trump in 1998 (or any other time) that Quote: d his saying anything that even vaguely resembled the words in this meme. Trump appeared somewhat regularly in the magazine's pages before he came to star on The Apprentice, but the bulk of the magazine's celebrity-driven coverage of him back then centered on his marriages to, and divorces from, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples. Midler, at the time of this writing, has yet to address the circulation of the fallacious meme.
Entertaining responses to Midler's tweet ""Really ironic that someone peddling a widely-known fake Quote: would call other people stupid ..."" ""This is a blatant fake and a blatant lie. Even left wing fact checking site Snopes had debunked it."" ""As believable as it is, he never said this. I appreciate a lot of your tweets about the current political climate but I encourage you to verify facts before spreading misinformation."" ""You're stupid . #FactCheck FALSE. you Hollywood pigs have no clue how to beat Trump. LOL"" ""I can't believe someone this famous is so gullible! Weird- I thought Hollywood was noting [sic] but the intellectual elite. Just kidding - I'm smarter than all of you jibronis...as well as most of America"" ""Nice try loser , who are you again?"""
5th graders at public school vote to put cross on yearbook cover — and it gets printed. You already know what happens next. - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,Dave Urbanski,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/5th-graders-at-public-school-vote-to-put-cross-on-yearbook-cover-and-it-gets-printed-you-already-know-what-happens-next,"A Nebraska public school that made big headlines in December when its then- principal banned Christmas-related items is weathering yet another religious controversy.
Turns out fifth graders at Manchester Elementary School in Omaha voted to place words in the shape of a cross on the school's yearbook cover, the Omaha World-Herald reported .
Oops But while the Parent-Teacher Organization worked with a company to produce the yearbook, a spokeswoman for Elkhorn Public Schools indicated last week that PTO leaders and the school's principal first saw the cross cover a couple of weeks ago after the books were printed, the paper reported.
It's unclear if any adults authorized the printing or oversaw the voting, the World-Herald reported.
The cross cover is one of at least 50 free designs from Memory Book Company, a yearbook vendor, and the ""Love & Faith"" cross cover is described on company's website as a ""beautiful cover perfect for parochial schools,"" the paper said.
Another vote But once the powers that be got a gander at the cross, the paper said PTO leaders voted to remove it from the front cover in a yearbook reprint.
PTO President Andrea Abrahamson told the World-Herald that the PTO has let fifth graders select the cover for several years.
Possible explanation It appears, however, that when then-Principal Jennifer Sinclair was placed on leave last December after banning Christmas-related items — even candy canes, as their ""J"" shape stands ""for Jesus,"" she wrote in a memo to staff — the yearbook cover approval process may have been compromised.
District spokeswoman Kara Perchal told the World-Herald in a separate article that principals typically approve cover art in the winter, but the cover didn't go through usual approval process since Sinclair was on leave at the time. She stepped down as principal in January, the paper said.
Perchal added to the World-Herald that PTOs are responsible for creating and publishing the yearbooks with money from their fundraising, and that PTOs don't get district funds.
Here's a news report that aired after Sinclair was placed on leave:

Expert who correctly predicted last 9 presidential elections says there is only one way Trump could lose 2020,www.theblaze.com,Chris Enloe,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/news/allan-lichtman-donald-trump-2020,"Professor Allan Lichtman, an American historian who correctly predicted the previous nine presidential elections, says President Donald Trump is heading to almost certain victory in 2020 — and there is only one possible roadblock to his second term.
What did Lichtman say? The American University professor, who has correctly predicted every presidential election since 1984, predicted last week that Trump will win re-election.
Lichtman said on CNN that Trump's only re-election roadblock will come if ""Democrats grow a spine and do their Constitutional duty, and move into an impeachment inquiry.
""It's a false dichotomy to say Democrats have a choice between doing what is right and what is constitutional and what is politically right,"" Lichtman explained. ""Impeachment is also politically right.""
Lichtman went on to debunk the idea that impeachment would backfire against Democrats, explaining the road to George W. Bush's presidency — a major Republican victory — was paved by Republicans pursuing impeachment against Bill Clinton.
What do others say? Politico reported last month that multiple election prediction models and election experts believe that if the election were held today, Trump would likely win in a ""landslide"" victory. The experts and their models analyze the economy and other factors — not political polls.
Yale economist Ray Fair, a leading expert in modern political predictions, believes Trump will win in 2020 by a ""non-trivial margin.""
""Even if you have a mediocre but not great economy — and that's more or less consensus for between now and the election — that has a Trump victory and by a not-trivial margin,"" he told Politico.
Donald Luskin, who works at a research firm that correctly predicted Trump's 2016 victory, said the strength of the economy is too much for Democrats to overcome.
""The economy is just so damn strong right now and by all historic precedent, the incumbent should run away with it,"" he told Politico. ""I just don't see how the blue wall could resist all that."""
WTF MSM!? Daily Beast doxxes a President Trump supporter over viral Nancy Pelosi video,www.theblaze.com,Rob Eno,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/wtf-msm-daily-beast-doxxes-a-black-man-who-supports-trump-over-viral-pelosi-video,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here .
Get him ...
On Saturday, the Daily Beast reported that it found the guy who had the temerity to upload a video of Nancy Pelosi to Facebook. The outlet then proceeded to doxx him by giving the President Donald Trump supporter's name, occupation, town, and criminal record for all the world to see. This is just the latest attempt by the media to intimidate Trump supporters by doxxing them.
The Daily Beast claims the man uploaded two videos. One was clipped, and the other was allegedly slowed down. It is the slowed-down video that the Daily Beast and others in the media relied on to justify the article.
The Daily Beast's editor-in-chief, Noah Shachtman, appeared on CNN media critic/cheerleader Brian Stelter's ""Reliable Sources"" program . Stelter fed him softball after softball and agreed with his arguments. At one point, Stelter tried to say that, because the man got about $1,000 in ad revenue from Facebook, there was a ""monetary motivation."" Shachtman said that no, the man actually likes Trump.
Big League Politics writes that the reporter who did the doxxing spent five years in jail and is a convicted felon . That didn't stop Facebook from working with him on this doxxing, according to the Daily Beast .
This whole affair is reminiscent of the time CNN sent a reporter to a elderly woman's house to put her on television for having the temerity to share a post about Trump on Facebook. This time, however, the target of the media's derision plans to sue .
There were some lefties who were also taken aback by this story. But for the majority of the left, you will toe its line or you will be outed for all the world to see.
Wild mischaracterization …
Another ""controversy"" raising its head over the weekend is over audio of Trump saying, ""No, I didn't know that she [Meghan Markle] was nasty."" And then Trump ""denying"" that he called Markle ""nasty."" As TheBlaze's Caleb Howe pointed out on Sunday, when you see the full context of the quote, it is obvious that Trump was saying Markle's comments toward him were ""nasty.""
But that didn't stop the media from full-bore attacking the president. And, of course, CNN was the worst offender in its mischaracterizations, selectively editing the clip .
This fit nicely into Stelter's obsession with Trump. Stelter noted in his Sunday email he wouldn't have mentioned it on his TV show "" until Trump tried gaslighting everyone ."" He even said it was shades of George Orwell. The only people acting like George Orwell in this whole kerfuffle are CNN and other media outlets.

London pub renamed 'The Trump Arms' in honor of the president's state visit to the UK,www.theblaze.com,Jana J.

The Trump Arms, which is normally called the Jameson, is decked out in American flags, Trump 2020 campaign shirts, an ""Oval Office,"" and even a cut out of Trump, ABC News reported.
The president and the first lady Melania Trump arrived Monday in London for an official state visit.
What's the story? It's the second time Damien Smyth has made the gesture to the president. The 53-year-old Irish pub operator renamed the pub during Trump's visit last summer.
""We did it last year when President Trump visited the U.K.,"" Smyth told ABC News. ""We've done it again now because he's coming here on Monday. We must mark the great relationship between the British, the Irish and the American people.""
Trump described the renaming of the pub as ""wonderful,"" according to The Sun newspaper in July 2018. ""I love those people. Those are my people.""
Smyth turned Trump's Quote: into posters, which are hung all over the walls.
The pub owner said he welcomes Americans to his establishment and that he expects many to stop in for a pint during Trump's visit.
He told ABC News that the president has a lot of supporters in the U.K. and that his previous trip to London was unfairly represented in the media.
""There has to be another side to the story, you know,"" Smyth said. ""We have to show the American people that the British, the Irish and the Americans are family friends. We're old friends and this can't be forgotten.""
What else? Smyth said that renaming the pub is a sign of ""respect"" for the U.S. president that celebrates a trans-Atlantic bond that dates back to World War II.
""They had no qualms about helping this country or the country next door,"" he told ABC News. ""It's about showing respect. The Americans, the Irish and the British are great friends, and now we're family.""

Glenn played a clip featuring Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) telling the convention crowd that "" socialism is not the answer. "" The audience can then be heard loudly booing for an extended period.
Next, Glenn played a clip showing former Maryland Rep. John Delaney getting booed after saying, ""Medicare for All may sound good, but it's actually not good policy, nor is it good politics.""
""I want to show you the civil war that is happening in the Democratic Party,"" Glenn surmised. ""The Democrats decided to play fast and loose with people's emotions and they have promised them ... the moon.""
He noted that the Democratic Party's move toward socialism is so out of touch with what the average American believes, it will likely push more voters toward President Donald Trump in 2020.
