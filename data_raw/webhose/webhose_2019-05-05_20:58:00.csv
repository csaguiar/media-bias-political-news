We are now collectively beginning to see what takes place when a society is in the grip of a mass delusion. This is not the first time in history that mass delusion has swept through a civilization, but it is undoubtedly the severest case. Elderly women and young mothers are being bullied by the police for insisting that biological men are men.
New genders -- and I cannot find a single person who can actually name more than a half-dozen of the apparently 50-plus that now exist -- multiply almost weekly. Women can have penises. Men can get pregnant. Children should be taken at their word if they are confused about their gender.
Some of the manifestations of what we will one day see as a cultural insanity would be almost funny if totalitarian transgender activists didn't insist that those of us who chuckle painfully at their hysterics be immediately prosecuted.
Like the example of Jessica Samson, a biological man identifying as a woman who made the news in January because he is ""regularly reduced to tears"" because the UK's National Health Service is having trouble scheduling him for laser hair removal surgery. (The news articles on this tragedy, of course, all obediently refer to Samson as a ""she."")
This surgery, says Samson, is essential, and the inability of the healthcare system to get him this purely cosmetic treatment is ""mucking around with people's lives.""
The 39-year-old Samson's major complaint is that he has to shave twice a day, which is difficult because he identifies as a woman. ""It is difficult to explain why this is a big issue to anyone who hasn't had trans-thoughts,"" he noted. ""But I've been on hormones long enough for my body to start changing. But I still grow a beard every day and I have to shave twice a day to maintain some sort of normal lifestyle.""
Did you catch that? Samson has to shave twice a day because otherwise his face will betray the truth about his sex -- that he is a man. That is what he unironically refers to as ""some sort of normal lifestyle.""
The National Health Service has come under massive strain attempting to catch up with the range of transgender services that are suddenly being demanded, especially over the past several years. Last week, the Daily Mirror reported that a leading British surgeon is now saying that ""transgender women"" -- biological males -- are ""entitled"" to womb transplants so that they can carry a child.
Recently in Brazil, doctors announced the arrival of the first baby that was born using a ""donor womb,"" which had been transplanted from a deceased donor to another woman. Now, Christopher Inglefield of the London Transgender Clinic says such transplants could quite easily be done for a biological male identifying as female as well.
More than that, Inglefield and several other experts are stating that free wombs for transgender people should be an inalienable right. ""(O)nce the medical community accepts this as a treatment for cis-women with uterine infertility, such as congenital absence of a womb, then it would be illegal to deny a trans-female who has completed her transition,"" Inglefield stated.
""There are clearly anatomical boundaries when it comes to trans women, but these are problems that I believe can be surmounted and the transplant into a trans-female is essentially identical to that of a cis-female.""
Further, the Mirror reported, ""The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority confirm there are no regulations in place to prevent a trans woman who has received a uterus transplant from having IVF treatment.""
A handful of trans advocates in the medical field, by the way, have been advocating for free wombs for transgender people (funded by you, the taxpayer!) for a couple of years now. Human rights in 2019 are whatever transgender people demand to bend biological reality to their will and transform children into a commodity that people can demand as a right.
People often ask me when this delusion will stop pushing further, but it has become increasingly clear that this train has no brakes, it is picking up speed, and it is heading directly toward a sharp curve. We are being told that we must disbelieve our own eyes and suspend common sense in favor of a new ideology that has not yet finished evolving.
As I've noted before, one of the interesting things about the transgender delusion is that it is an ideology being imposed from the top-down. Go onto any construction site and start asking the workers there if men can get pregnant, or if women can have penises.
Even better, try asking some farmers at a livestock auction whether men can have vaginas or whether a man identifying as a woman should be able to demand a free womb, funded by the taxpayer. You will search long and hard before you can find anyone who actually believes this stuff. Some of them may actually commit the heresy of laughing out loud."

SUSAN BERRY 5 Apr 2019 LGBTQ lobbyists are working to achieve control of mental health professionals in Maine as a means to crush the notion that children who claim to be a gender that is incompatible with their biological sex are psychologically impaired. The activists are hoping Maine will be the 16 th legislature to succumb to their gender ideology, which requires the government to acknowledge biological status as male or female is subservient to gender identity.
As the Journal Tribune reported, Maine state Rep. Ryan Fecteau and state Sen. Linda Sanborn, both Democrats, introduced a bill that aims to control what mental health professionals say to their child clients who express unwanted sexual attractions or gender confusion in their private sessions with them.
LD 1025, introduced by @RyanFecteau , Senator Linda Sanborn, and 94 other cosponsors – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – will protect Maine kids from the harmful practice of conversion therapy. We can’t wait to send this bill to @GovJanetMills ! #mepolitics
— EqualityMaine (@EqualityMaine) February 28, 2019
The legislation, if signed into law, would make it illegal for any mental health professional to respond to children who express unwanted sexual attractions or gender confusion by helping them to explore these conflicted feelings or perceptions.
“The ‘conversion therapy’ bill is a proposed gag order on counselors and therapists who treat minor children for mental health issues related to gender identity and sexual orientation,” Maine Rep. Lawrence Lockman, a Republican, told Breitbart News. “Under the proposed statute, therapists would not be allowed to offer any counseling that deviates from the prevailing progressive orthodoxy on these matters.”
The intent of the legislation is based on what LGBTQ activists claim to be “social science consensus” that individuals who, through counseling, have discovered they are not gay, or that their gender is, after all, compatible with their biological sex, have been “harmed.”
“A wide range of major health and mental health organizations in the United States recognize being [LGBT] and having same-sex sexual attractions as normal variants of human sexuality and gender identity, rather than an illness or a developmental disorder,” states the bill.
In Massachusetts, where a similar bill has been approved by the state legislature and sent to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s desk, lobbyist Arline Isaacson, co-chair of the Massachusetts Gay & Lesbian Political Caucus, said she is “100 percent confident” such legislation is constitutional.
“We’re banning a therapy that essentially says being LGBTQ is sick, it’s an illness, and it needs to be cured,” she said, according to the Boston Globe . “And that’s baloney.”
However, a review of the issue of gender dysphoria in young people in 2018 in the Atlantic highlighted the problem that arises when legislative “bans” on mental health treatment are lobbied by LGBTQ rights organizations that seem to know little about the psychological development of children:
The Human Rights Campaign’s “Transgender Children & Youth: Understanding the Basics” web page … asserts that “being transgender is not a phase, and trying to dismiss it as such can be harmful during a time when your child most needs support and validation.” Similarly, parents who consult the pages tagged “transgender youth” on GLAAD’s site will find many articles about supporting young people who come out as trans but little about the complicated diagnostic and developmental questions faced by the parents of a gender-exploring child.
ICYMI: ⁦ @bangordailynews ⁩ endorsed our bill to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Maine from the harms of conversion therapy. This bill will have a hearing soon! #mepolitics https://t.co/Rh39CKUASO
— EqualityMaine (@EqualityMaine) March 25, 2019
Lockman explained the effects of the proposed legislation on mental health professionals should it become law:
Therapists who treat minor children will be required to walk a tightrope, and be careful not to say anything that contradicts the Leftist progressives’ Fake Science dogma as enshrined in the proposed statute.
For instance, a therapist treating an 8-year-old boy who dresses as a girl and believes he is a girl trapped in a boy’s body would be in legal jeopardy if the therapist advised the patient against puberty-blocking drugs and sex-change surgery. Licensed counselors will have to keep their professional opinions to themselves if they are even mildly skeptical of the notion that an 8-year-old is capable of making informed decisions about transgender issues. Violators of the gag order would be subject to being stripped of their license to practice.
Requiring mental health counselors to provide “gender affirmation” means they could be the first professionals who can guide parents of a gender-confused child first toward outward expressions of gender transition — such as clothing, name change, and pronoun use, then toward puberty-blocking drugs and surgical treatments. Ultimately, the child can be made sterile.
In July 2018, former Republican Gov. Paul LePage vetoed a bill that would have placed the same constraints on mental health professionals in Maine.
In a two-page veto announcement , LePage wrote of his concerns for already licensed mental health practitioners should he have signed the bill into law:
This is so broad that licensed professionals would be prohibited from counseling an individual even at the individual’s own request. We should not prohibit professionals from counseling an individual even at the individual’s own request. We should not prohibit professionals from providing their expertise to those who seek it for their own personal and basic questions such as, “How do I deal with these feelings I am experiencing?”
LePage also went on to voice his concerns that such a bill might be interpreted as a “threat to religious liberty.”
“Parents have the right to seek counsel and treatment for their children from professionals who do not oppose the parents’ own religious beliefs,” he asserted. “Because the standard of practice for these professionals already prohibits any practice or therapy that would amount to physical or mental abuse, what we are really trying to regulate are the private, consultative conversations between a licensed provider and a client.”
Lockman said Fecteau’s bill in Maine — and similar legislation throughout the country — are “part of a much larger campaign to shut down reality-based free speech.”
“In the modern era, heretics won’t be burned at the stake,” he added. “But they will be muzzled, publicly shamed and driven to the poor house.”

Kennedy on Dem Seeking Trump’s Taxes: ‘It Must Really Suck to Be That Dumb’ PAM KEY 5 Apr 2019 Friday on CNN’s “The Lead,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) criticized House Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) for requesting President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
Kennedy said, “I will be very blunt. Chairman Neal, powerful man, head of Ways and Means, I know he’s an adult, but I don’t think he’s like a real adult. He says that he needs Trump’s tax returns. He says it’s policy, not politics. He has said, I think on CNN, that the reason he needs them is that he needs to determine how well the IRS is auditing taxpayers. I can’t believe he really thinks the American people are going to fall for that. It must really suck to be that dumb.”
He continued, “Look, this is very simple. Mr. Neal wants to screw with the president. He doesn’t think the president ought to be president. Well, you know, words can’t express how much I don’t care. It’s not Mr. Neal’s call. The American people have chosen Donald Trump as president. If you don’t like it, in two years, you can vote against him. In the meantime, don’t screw with him, let him try to be president.”
He added, “Now, Mr. Neal is not in good faith. Nobody believes he’s in good faith. This is wildly dishonest. This is thoroughly in bad faith. And I don’t blame the president for pushing back. There’s no requirement that he turn over his taxes. If I were running for president, would I turn over my taxes? Yeah. But there’s no requirement. And Trump said, ‘I’m not going to turn over my taxes, they’re being audited.’ The American people knew that when they voted for him or didn’t vote for him. He won the election. And Mr. Neal, you know, I don’t mean any disrespect, but he’s not fooling anybody. He just wants to get these taxes to screw with the president.”
Host Jake Tapper said, “You said you don’t mean any disrespect, but you said, ‘It must suck to be that dumb.’ Let me just take the opportunity to say to Chairman Neal, if he wants to come on the show, he is more than welcome to come and defend himself.”

This is an excellent article from Damon Linker. I’m only just now finding it :
“These are ideologically disorienting times.
Partisan polarization is severe and increasing. Compromise has become a dirty word. Democrats fear Republicans have become fascists. Republicans accuse Democrats of embracing socialism. The center of the ideological spectrum, over which presidential candidates once fought to the electoral death, has become the political empty set, with leading members of both parties fleeing it at top speed and a self-proclaimed independent and centrist (potential) candidate for president, businessman Howard Schultz, pulling an anemic 4 percent in the polls.
But what if the problem is less that voters have abandoned the center and want politicians to embrace extremism than that their preferences no longer coincide with where the political lines have been drawn over the past several decades? …
Put it all together and we’re left with a Trump campaign firmly situated in the upper-left quadrant of the chart — somewhere in the vicinity of a new, post-Reagan center. Which perhaps helps to explain why 2016 voters tended to view Trump as a moderate.
They don’t view him that way anymore, no doubt in large part because his rhetoric and actions on immigration and other issues have been so harshly polarizing. But it’s probably also because for most of the past two years Trump has governed as far more of a traditional Reaganite Republican (situated in the upper right quadrant) than one might have guessed he would from his campaign. Paul Ryan set the policy agenda, with the signature achievement of the first two years of Trump’s presidency a massive tax cut for corporations. …”

Very true.
We’re not “isolationists” who are opposed to the rest of the world or disinterested in foreign affairs. Instead, we look at foreign countries like China which are rapidly moving forward into the 21st century, investing in infrastructure and the industries of the future and avoiding destructive, interminable foreign interventions and ask why our leaders busy Making Israel Great Again?
“Writing in 1949, in the aftermath of a cataclysmic world war against fascism and confronting another totalitarian challenge in the form of Soviet communism, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. proposed that a new “vital center” of American politics could be forged out of the effort to foster freedom at home and abroad. On the domestic side, this meant expanding on the liberalism of the New Deal. When it came to foreign policy, it meant using American military, economic, and diplomatic power to build and defend a liberal international order that could stand up to and push back against the imperial and ideological ambitions of Stalinism around the world.
To an astonishing degree, Schlesinger’s outlook still describes how leading members of today’s center-right and center-left view America’s role in the world — though it’s long past feeling vital. …
The ideology of American primacy is also what leads a bipartisan coalition of foreign policy experts to the astonishing conclusion that the biggest danger facing the United States today is that we aren’t nearly powerful enough.
That is what the American center believes — at least the center in and around Washington, D.C. What’s believed by members of the real American center — the one constituted by the public opinion of the voters at large — is far less obvious.”…
Once a new center coalesces on domestic affairs, a new foreign policy consensus will begin to form along with it. With any luck, it will favor not systematic withdrawal, but realism, restraint, and wisdom about American interests and the limits of any single nation’s power to control and dominate the world.”

I’ve been told my entire life that my politics are “Far Right” by “journalists” in the media when I am equally distant from the Charlie Kirks and Koch Brothers, Hannity and AOC.
“The culture war divides Americans more deeply and more sharply than anything else. Read The New York Times or most other outlets of the mainstream media and you’ll get the distinct impression that those on the conservative side of the conflict are ignorant bigots and quite possibly theocratic fascists. Read or listen to right-wing media, and you’re likely to hear that those on the progressive side favor infanticide and are anti-religious fanatics just steps away from enacting an American version of Mao’s murderous cultural revolution.
Thankfully, we have reason to think that most Americans are less polarized on these issues than the pronouncements of partisans and activists on each side would lead one to believe. We also have reason to suspect that public opinion on social issues and questions of national identity tilts somewhat to the right — and that this stance, when combined with a pragmatically progressive economic program, could well constitute a new American center.
That will sound outrageous to many. For much of the past four decades, the American center has been defined by its broadly libertarian outlook on both economic and social issues. To be a centrist Democrat, a centrist Republican, or a centrist independent has been to favor keeping taxes relatively low, regulations relatively minimal, international trade relatively free, and government services and benefits intact and in place while not expanding them very far into new areas. It has also meant supporting abortion rights and eventually gay marriage and transgender rights, and favoring, for both moral and economic reasons, high levels of immigration.
Yet a comprehensive survey of voters in the 2016 election has revealed that very few people actually support this combination of libertarian policies — and that lots of people favor the ideologically opposite position: relatively progressive on the economy and relatively conservative on social issues.
That is where the new center of American politics can be found. …”

Lots of good ideas in this article. I’m so tired of Hannity vs. AOC takes. I want to congratulate Damon Linker who is really pushing forward to a new consensus in this series of articles.
“Ever since the Reagan administration, the political center has been personified by the corporate executive. This white-collar worker has some socially liberal leanings, but his number one priority is seeking profits that benefit himself and his company, and that enable him to hire workers who earn salaries, pay taxes, and contribute to overall economic growth. In other words, he combines a moderate version of the Republican Party’s economic libertarianism with a slightly tempered variation on the Democratic Party’s libertarianism on social issues and questions of national identity.
But does this person really exist in sufficient numbers to be considered the political center anymore? A comprehensive survey of voters in the 2016 presidential election suggests not. Indeed, this research shows that while there are very few voters in this old center, there are quite a few in an alternative center where very few political candidates place themselves. Instead of combining a Republican position on economics with a Democratic position on social issues, this alternative center does the reverse — combining, roughly speaking, a Republican position on social issues with a Democratic position on economics.
Donald Trump appeared to position himself somewhere in this new center during his 2016 campaign for president — which probably helps to explain why voters tended to view him as a moderate. They don’t see him that way anymore, in part because the president has governed far more like a Reaganite Republican than one might have expected or hoped.
But if Trump has mostly abandoned the new center he once haltingly and temporarily staked out, what would it look like for a presidential candidate to embrace it in 2020? What policies would this candidate champion? What arguments and appeals would she use to persuade voters to rally to her campaign and agenda? And what vision of the country’s past, present, and future would she invoke to lend it weight and urgency? …”

The American Conservative has a new article along these lines :
“The Penguin Encyclopedia of Popular Music described the politics of Pete Seeger, the folk-singer, songwriter, and antiwar activist who died last week at the age of 94, as “naïve but honest.” They were certainly honest—not even Seeger’s worst enemies would dispute that—but what was naïve about Seeger’s socialist conservatism?
Seeger was the authentic voice of the old American left and understood that conservatism, far from being inimical to socialism, was actually an essential component of it. In an interview with the New York Times in 1995 he declared, “I like to say I’m more conservative than [Barry] Goldwater. He just wanted to turn the clock back to when there was no income tax. I want to turn the clock back to when people lived in small villages and took care of each other.” …”
George Fitzhugh knew 150 years ago where free-market capitalism was headed and that conservatism and socialism were more compatible than lots of people think. Share this:"

There is a grain of truth here.
If you read the woke supremacists at Far Left sites like BuzzFeed and The Huffington Post , it is easy to see why Trump supporters believe the media is the enemy of the people. Demonizing these poor NEETs because they want girlfriends seems like the wrong approach? I am an INTJ.
— Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) April 5, 2019
Yang has a plan to fix this problem though.
He is going to detoxify the mainstream media by paying leftwing journos to chill out and go cover local news in Bumfuck, NH instead of whipping up vicious social media outrage mobs all day on Twitter . He is also going to address the mental health crisis on the Far Left that sees “hate” and “racism” and “white supremacy” in the most friendly, mundane encounters in life .
Virtually the entire mainstream media bought into the narrative that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election because of a Russian conspiracy when it was really their own toxic rhetoric. LMAO!
Note: If the violent apocalypse that is being fomented by political correctness is averted , I’m optimistic that everyone will calm down. Even Trump’s Boomers will take the $1,000 a month and finally retire and relax once they realize that Yang isn’t coming to get them. Share this:"

I’m feeling a bit nostalgic.
No, I am not feeling nostalgic for the War Between the States, a devastating period of our history in which nearly 30 percent of White Southern men of military age died while many more were maimed for life in hideous ways. It is depressing and stomach churning to think about that carnage.
This is a much better story from another epoch of Southern history:
“When the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was created in 1935, less than 4 percent of farms in the southern states had electricity. Without it, many of the comforts of modern life were unavailable, and for that reason the South enthusiastically welcomed the REA. In 1936, when Congress gave the REA statue authority, southern congressmen were among the agency’s most ardent supporters. The Southern Policy Association, a group of southern congressmen eager to promote southern development, endorsed the REA bill and regarded electrification as an important step in that direction.
As the REA began operation, southern farmers quickly established electric cooperatives, and the percentage of farms with service slowly grew. By 1941 the national average had climbed to 30 percent, and, although the southern percentage was lower, the South moved steadily ahead. At the end of World War II, the REA started a massive construction program to finish the job, and by 1955 virtually 90 percent of the South’s farmers had electrical service. Although the effects of electrification were evident nationwide, they had the most dramatic impact in the South, owing probably to the region’s higher number of substandard homes when the REA started.
By providing running water and indoor toilets, the REA finally helped bring an end to the hookworm that had ravaged the south for over a century. Refrigeration had a similar beneficial effect on diets through the storage of perishable foods. In some small towns, cold-storage cooperatives were started. Incandescent lighting improved the quality of life in homes and schools, and radio became a regular feature in southern homes. Electification stimulation diversification: the Bureau of Agriculture Economics reported an increase in dairy farming, and the South became a major poultry producing region. Most important, however, was the great comfort and sense of satisfaction that southerners felt as they began to enjoy the numerous conveniences provided through electricity. Electification must be considered one of the most significant reasons for the modernizaiton of the rural South”
Now, my friends … THIS WAS PROGRESS.
Look at what was accomplished by our ancestors in such a short span of time … a mere 20 years in which infrastructure was built all over Dixie . Contrast it with what has been accomplished over the past 20 years with all of these dumb, sterile debates in our hyper polarized political system .
Why aren’t we doing great things like China and South Korea? Why do we have this shitty infrastructure which was built by our grandparents and great-grandparents? Are we incapable of even maintaining that infrastructure? Are we incapable of achieving even a fraction of their accomplishments?
According to free-market theorists, the entrepreneur should have responded, but … sigh. Anyway, next time libertarians tell you “the state” has never accomplished anything remind them of the TVA, mass literacy, splitting the atom, NASA putting a man on the moon, eradicating the boll weevil, ending malaria, polio, pellagra and hookworms in the South, taming the Mississippi, ending sharecropping and abolishing child labor and bringing electricity, highways and investment to the rural South. Remind the progressives of what got done when they weren’t arguing over transgender pronouns.
If FDR had simply avoided World War 2 and given people the money through direct deposits into their bank accounts instead of “earning” it at Normandy, it would have been even better.

Woke Supremacy: Christopher Mathias Finds Another Racist Heretic,www.occidentaldissent.com,Hunter Wallace,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2019/04/05/woke-supremacy-christopher-mathias-finds-another-racist-heretic/,"Christopher Mathias is a sad Antifa blogger who is employed by The Huffington Post who seems to have made it his mission in life to persuade White Nationalists that violence is the answer to their social and economic marginalization in our society :
“A teacher in Texas has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into his alleged ties to a white nationalist group, school officials confirmed to HuffPost Thursday.
Stephen Arnquist, who teaches Japanese at Skyline High School in Dallas, will remain on leave “pending the outcome of an investigation” into comments Arnquist allegedly posted online, a spokeswoman for the Dallas Independent School District said in a statement.
Earlier Thursday, anonymous anti-fascist activists from an Oregon-based group called Eugene Antifa posted an article alleging that Arnquist is a member of the white nationalist group Identity Evropa. …” Is this a very, very, very MORAL person or rather another Brooklyn-based self-righteous asshole?
CHECKMATE, HATERS!
This is really dumb and counter-productive. This guy was teaching a bunch of black and Hispanic children in Texas. Surely, that makes him an evil, wicked hater!
The more likely answer is that Arnquist’s career in public education simply turned him on to the persistence of racial differences in intelligence and academic performance. Those racial differences have endured for literally centuries in spite of the trillions of dollars which have been spent trying to eradicate them in our current futile quest to create a racial utopia.
What has been accomplished here? Christopher Mathias has probably succeeded in further radicalizing this poor guy. He has succeeded in making reasonable discussion of a taboo subject in our public discourse even more toxic. He has succeeded in convincing more people to perceive “journalists” as commissars and to hate them. He has excited all the Antifa fanatics on his Twitter feed with another “Nazi scalp.” He has almost certainly convinced this guy to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 as well!
The Fringe Left is one of Donald Trump and the GOP’s strongest allies . They probably saved the Senate for the GOP in 2018 simply by convincing people in Florida that the alternative was Antifa.
Note: I’d like to thank American Mind for coining the new term “Woke Supremacy.” We’re currently going through another shameful episode of witch hunting and zealotry in our country. One day people will look back on this like the Chinese and regret going down this road. Share this:"
Michael Brendan Dougherty: Nationalism Is a Chameleon,www.occidentaldissent.com,Hunter Wallace,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2019/04/05/michael-brendan-dougherty-nationalism-is-a-chameleon/,"— Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) April 5, 2019 The only thing standing between me and the White House is popularity.
— Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) April 4, 2019 Someone today asked me how a mother of 4 should think about the Freedom Dividend. I responded “As a parent imagine if you knew every one of your children would start receiving $1,000 a month at age 18. That’s over a million dollars. That’s a gamechanger.” She liked that answer.
Very true .
“Last week our fearless editor Rich Lowry and departing colleague Jonah Goldberg tried to settle the question of nationalism for the attendees of the National Review Institute Ideas Summit. Lowry defended the American tradition of nationalism, pointing to the accomplishments of Republican nationalists such Lincoln. But, strangely, as the person who wears the “nationalist” label with the least discomfort, I found myself agreeing with Jonah Goldberg. He emphasized the variety of nationalisms and its hard-to-pin-down character.
That is a point that Kevin D. Williamson picked up in his commentary. “As -isms go, nationalism is pretty loosey-goosey,” he observed. Indeed. Historically, nationalist movements tend to be opportunistic when it comes to ideologies. Some pick up on socialism, others on capitalism. Some go communist, and some go democratic, depending on their place in situ. That opportunism is especially found in nationalist movements that are seeking to establish independence or sovereignty from some great power. Their full embrace of capitalism or communism may be a way of heightening polarization with the imperial power they want to eject, or a way of attracting a powerful ally. …”
I’ve already observed that national populism can look like this in 2016 :
or this in 2020:
Populists value social cohesion and economic fairness . If they are forced to choose between their values in a hyper polarized electorate, well, they can and often do swing either way. Donald Trump can win them by promising to build the Great Wall of America and bringing back the 1950s. Andrew Yang can win them with Universal Basic Income and student loan debt forgiveness.
Believe me, I’m down with this:
What’s the opportunity cost?
Four more years of Conservatism, Inc? The MIGA agenda? Blompf’s Twitter feed?
Yes, even a TINY GESTURE of respect like Andrew Yang simply acknowledging that there is a raging suicide and opioid epidemic in White America can pay a huge political dividend:
“Personally, I think America’s liberal elites would be surprised at how easy it would be to mollify the nationalist passions out there, how small the adjustments have to be, how satisfied nationalist constituencies would find themselves if they were offered even tiny gestures of respect. My worry is that even small sacrifices are impossible for people who believe they possess so much merit.”"

“In his State of the City address that March [2015], Mr. Buttigieg said it was “time for South Bend to begin talking about racial reconciliation.”
“There is no contradiction between respecting the risks that police officers take every day in order to protect this community, and recognizing the need to overcome the biases implicit in a justice system that treats people from different backgrounds differently,” Mr. Buttigieg said, according to a transcript of the speech published by The South Bend Voice.
“We need to take both those things seriously, for the simple and profound reason that all lives matter,” he added.
Four years later, as Mr. Buttigieg pursues the Democratic nomination for president, his use of the phrase “all lives matter” — which has often carried the connotation of ignoring the specific grievances of black Americans — has come under scrutiny. …

The media doesn’t understand this.
None of the other Democratic candidates understand this either. Frankly, there are a lot of people in our circles who still don’t understand it either, which is fine. It is only April 2019.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the latest progressive hearthrob, isn’t going to flip White populist voters who voted for Trump . Neither is Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren or Beto O’Rourke. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have the potential to flip some of them with populist economic appeals. While Bernie and Biden can peel off the occasional normie Trump voter, Yang’s secret weapon is he doesn’t talk down to them in political correctness and he offers universal basic income .
Why is this such an enticing combination to White populist voters who backed Trump? It is because populist voters value social cohesion and economic fairness . Yang is appealing to them with messaging and policy proposals that addresses their social and economic concerns and their sense of order. Whereas every other Democratic candidate alienates populist voters with political correctness by pandering to the toxic sensibilities of the Far Left, Yang has been very careful not to do so. He doesn’t come across as a SJW while all these other candidates are written off for using that language.
Yang is cleverly dissolving the the primary social issue that aligns White populists with conservative voters. Political correctness is the Great Wall that alienates White America. I would go so far as to say it is now a far more important social issue for younger people than abortion or LGBT rights. Progressives are just written off by huge swathes of the electorate for being miserable, humorless scolds. No one wants to grab a beer and have a conversation with someone like Hillary Clinton.
White populists are voting for Republicans like Donald Trump in spite of their views on economics . They don’t agree with the GOP at all on economics, but are hounded into the GOP by people who are full of resentment, bitterness and hatred of White America.
VELSHI: “But you got a lot of people, it feels populist. Not that part, but your following on social media feels populist, it feels like people think that you are part of a movement, or leading a movement that can gain attention and capture the attention of the American public. How you manage that in the Democratic nomination is going to be interesting, but if you were to become the Democratic nominee, what’s your argument against Donald Trump?”
YANG: “What I would say again is that we need to solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected, and the best person to beat Donald Trump is someone who can peel off 10, 20, 30 percent of his voters. Because I’ve met now hundreds, thousands of Trump voters who’ve said to me, I voted for Donald Trump and I’m going to vote for you. So I can get the progressives, I can get the Democrats — ”
He is breaking through with his dog whistles.
Solving major social and economic issues …
joking/not joking
… requires reaching unusually huge amounts of voters locked up in the other party. Yang is neutralizing concerns about political correctness while luring populist voters away from the GOP by focusing on economics. There is a strong interplay between these two issues because $1,000 a month is basically FU money for any wage slave to his employer, “journalists” and to SJW social media lynch mobs. It will have the effect of emboldening employees in a free society to resist both exploitation and political correctness by making them more financially independent under capitalism.
If Yang is right and he is uniquely flipping thousands of Trump voters as a candidate with his messaging and policies, then he is winning over populists and moderates. If he is succeeding in doing that, then he is competitive with Trump in unusual places like … Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Arkansas, West Virginia. Stupid labels don’t matter because populism reaches those voters. Share this:"

Giuliani also dismissed claims of obstruction by political opponents of the president.
“[F]irst of all, you don’t have obstruction by hope,” Giuliani said. “You have obstruction by coercion, threat, ‘I’ll break your legs,’ ‘I’ll take your food away’ or ‘I’ll kidnap your children.’ I prosecuted a lot of obstruction cases. Nobody ever started an obstruction sentence with ‘I hope.’ And nobody did obstruction by putting out a legal memo for the whole world to see.”
“We’re going to find out in a week or two how accurate Bill Barr’s summary was,” he continued. “And I’m going to tell you – it’s going to be 100% accurate. Bill Barr is a great lawyer, and he is an extraordinarily honorable man. I can’t say that for the congressmen who are making all these wild, crazy, insane threats. Their claim of obstruction against the Attorney General of the United States is no better than the two-year claim of obstruction by the angry Democrats that tried to claim the president was obstructing. The president didn’t obstruct anything, and the best evidence of that is they completed their darn investigation. How the heck was it obstructed? Nothing was obstructed.”

Saudi Arabia Detains Women's Rights Activists Including 2 U.S. Citizens,www.breitbart.com,breitbart.com,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/04/05/saudi-arabia-detains-womens-rights-activists-including-2-u-s-citizens/," Saudi Arabia Detains Women’s Rights Activists Including 2 U.S. Citizens FAYEZ NURELDINE/AFP/Getty EDWIN MORA 5 Apr 2019 Authorities in Saudi Arabia launched a crackdown on supporters of two American, one of them pregnant, and nine other local women activists who drew the ire of the Sunni kingdom for fighting for their right to drive and to end the country’s male guardianship system, several news outlets reported Friday. The New York Times (NYT) notes :
Brushing back pressure from Washington, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia escalated his crackdown on even the mildest forms of dissent with the arrests this week of at least nine intellectuals, journalists, activists, and their family members, according to rights groups and a Saudi associate of the detainees.
Among those held are two dual Saudi-American citizens and two women — one of them pregnant, the groups said. Many of the detainees are suspected of having complained to Western journalists and rights groups about the treatment of imprisoned women’s activists, according to a Saudi national briefed on the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss confidential information.
The crackdown came amid allegations of torture and sexual assault at the hands of authorities in some of Saudi Arabia’s detention centers, holding a range of individuals from hardened criminals to women accused of activism and supporting women’s rights. Local law enforcement denies the claims.
Reuters notes :
Their [11 women] case has intensified criticism of Riyadh’s rights record, already in the spotlight after last year’s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. …The women on trial were arrested last May and branded as traitors. At least one of them has been charged under the kingdom’s cybercrime law and faces up to five years in prison.
…
Five men arrested at the same time [as the women] are not on trial. Rights groups say two of them have been released, but the others’ status is unclear. Another U.S.-Saudi national, Walid al-Fitaihi, has been detained since 2017 under Riyadh’s anti-corruption campaign. His son told U.S. senators last month he had been tortured in detention, including electric shocks and whipping.
Among the [11 women] detainees are “U.S. national journalist Salah al-Haidar, whose mother Aziza al-Yousef is among those on trial, and Bader al-Ibrahim, a doctor and author of a book about Shi’ite Muslim politics, the associate and London-based Saudi rights group ALQST said,” Reuters added.
The U.S. Department of State (DOS) reportedly confirmed the arrest of the two American women, saying President Donald Trump’s administration has “engaged the Saudi government in this regard,” without elaborating further.
Reuters attempted to extract a comment from the Saudi government communications office and the American embassy in Riyadh, to no avail.
Lynn Maalouf, the Middle East research director for Amnesty International, argued that Saudi authorities are “signaling to their entire people that there will be zero tolerance of any form of criticism, let alone questioning, of the state’s authoritarian practices.”
“The temporary release of three of the women on trial last week by a Riyadh court raised hopes of a more lenient approach after months of lobbying and pleading by Western governments, but the new arrests may signal that the authorities are resisting international pressure and seeking to pursue tougher penalties,” Reuters points out.

Chicago Sues Smollett After He Refuses To Cover Cost Of Investigating His Hoax,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/chicago-sues-smollett-refuses-cover-cost-investigating-hoax/,"April 5, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
After former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett cost the city of Chicago $130,000 in police overtime hours working on his allegedly staged racist and homophobic attack, they asked him to pay the bill. On Thursday, Smollett missed the deadline to pay up, so now officials are taking him to court.
“Mr. Smollett has refused to reimburse the City of Chicago for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his false police report on January 29, 2019,” said spokesman Bill McCaffrey in a statement. “The Law Department is now drafting a civil complaint that will be filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County.”
A week ago , a lawyer for the City of Chicago sent Smollett a letter asserting that the false police report caused Chicago Police to divert “resources from other investigations and undermining the criminal justice system.” After the city fined Smollett $130,000, Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos, responded saying his client “will not be intimidated into paying the demanded sum.”
Meanwhile, Chicago police are speaking out against Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx after she dismissed the 16 felony charges against Smollett. On Wednesday, the police chiefs of three Chicago suburban police departments and the head of the police union announced “no confidence” against Foxx. On Thursday at a press conference, they called for her resignation.
“What she is doing is enabling the offenders; bad guys are not being held accountable,” said Chief Steven Stelter, of the West Suburban Chiefs Association.
Foxx responded in a statement, saying that she will not resign: “I was elected by the people of Cook County to pursue community safety, prevent harm, and uphold the values of fairness and equal justice. I’m proud of my record in doing that, and I plan to do so through the end of my term and, if the people so will it, into the future.”
Foxx has been criticized for her ties to a family friend of Smollett’s, Tina Tchen, Michele Obama’s former chief of staff.

When Foxx announced Smollett’s charges had been dropped, she said his community service was a sufficient payment for his crimes. “Based on the nature of the offense and his background, this was a just outcome,” she said. “Justice takes many forms.” Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

"U.S. Statement: UN Commission on Population and Development, 52nd Session",usun.state.gov,stanforda,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://usun.state.gov/remarks/9011," April 4, 2019 AS DELIVERED
Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the United States, I thank you and the Bureau for your efforts in preparing us for the work of this year’s Commission on the theme of “Review and appraisal of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and its contribution to the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.”
We wish to join with other delegations to commemorate the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ICPD. The Programme of Action and the Conference’s report helped reframe the discussion of population and development issues, and has provided us with an updated view of global health, women’s equality and sustainable development, and contributed to the development of goals linked to these important issues.
The United States is the largest bilateral donor of foreign assistance to many programs that support the objectives set forth in the 1994 Programme of Action. We are proud of our contributions to expanding access to basic health care and promoting women’s health, including efforts to improve maternal and child health.
As highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report to the Commission, over the past quarter century the world has seen an increase in life expectancy, improved access to education, and advancements in the empowerment of women and girls. However, we also know that progress has been uneven -- particularly in the area of reducing maternal morbidity and mortality.
Identifying and addressing critical gaps in health care and education requires robust data-collection systems; therefore, my government strongly supports efforts to increase the availability of, and access to, high-quality disaggregated data, which is essential for measuring progress toward achieving our shared development goals.
My government is committed to helping women, their families and their communities thrive, and to promoting and preserving human life and dignity. Our bilateral maternal and child health programs focus on 25 high priority countries that account for two-thirds of maternal and child deaths worldwide. In the past 10 years, U.S. investments have helped save the lives of more than five million children and 200,000 women. Investing in the health of women and girls is essential to transforming communities and supporting each of our partner countries on their “Journey to Self-Reliance,” a new U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) program designed to strengthen each country's ability to fund, manage, and solve its own development challenges. We continue to insist that references to “sexual and reproductive health services” in the ICPD Programme of Action not include abortion or the promotion of abortion as a method of family planning.
When women and girls have access to education, health care, and economic opportunities, they are better able to fulfill their potential and contribute to the well-being of their families, communities, and nations, as well as to sustainable development efforts. When women do better, families do better, communities do better, and nations do better.
To promote prosperity and peace for all members of society, my Government continues to actively engage with the private sector, public sector, faith-based organizations and civil society partners. Through this, we can also help ensure women and girls have the opportunity to reach their full potential, both in the United States and around the world.
In conclusion, we look forward to productive discussions with the bureau and other delegations on these issues.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
Statement at the Conclusion of the First Resumed 73rd General Assembly,usun.state.gov,stanforda,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://usun.state.gov/remarks/9012," AS DELIVERED
Thank you, Madam Chair.
My delegation would like to express its sincere gratitude to you for your continued leadership as Chair of this Committee. This Committee continues to benefit greatly from your wisdom and guidance in facilitating important and responsible decisions. Thank you as well to Ms. Sharon Van Buerle and her team as well as those Secretariat officials who helped facilitate our discussions.
Madam Chair, at the outset of this session, my delegation highlighted the opportunity before this Committee to help make the UN a more nimble, responsive, and accountable organization, and one that can better deliver on its mandates. We are grateful to all delegations for their commitment to achieving progress on some of these important agenda items this session, including my own team. Unfortunately, we did not achieve consensus on all matters, and we look forward to continuing those discussions at the appropriate time.
Effective implementation of UN reform is not possible without a robust internal accountability system. Fittingly, this Committee reaffirmed its commitment to a strengthened accountability framework by highlighting results-based management initiatives, the value of the newly-created Business Transformation and Accountability Division, and improved senior managers’ compacts. The Committee additionally expressed its support for the Joint Inspection Unit and encouraged the participating organizations to meaningfully engage the Unit on its work.
Nevertheless, our work was not without its challenges. We regret that the Committee was unable to take a decision on a key reform to establish an appropriate number of shared service centers. The United States will continue to push for this reform and for realization of the associated efficiencies and cost savings. My delegation further regrets that the Committee could not reach consensus in improving the UN’s travel policies that perpetuate the outdated practice of first class travel for a number of UN officials. As the JIU and ACABQ has indicated, first class travel has no place in the UN. We look forward to correcting this measure, along with establishing a single threshold that produces efficiency and cost-savings for the Organization at the next opportunity.
In terms of positive outcomes though, this Committee managed to find common ground in several important areas, including responsible resourcing decisions in support of Security Council mandates for two new Special Political Missions, the UN Mission to Support to Hodeidah Agreement in Yemen and the Somalia Panel of Experts. Although we regret that the Committee did not grant the Secretary-General his request in full, we also ensured continued funding for the UN Monitoring Mechanism in Syria to provide life-saving humanitarian relief. This budget decision should in no way be interpreted as lack of support for the Monitoring Mechanism in implementing all aspects of its mandate. The United States underscores its unequivocal support for the Mechanism and its efforts in facilitating cross-border delivery of humanitarian aid, as authorized under Security Council resolution 2449.
As we conclude this session, we know that the second resumed session is just around the corner, where we will take up important items related to the resourcing of UN peacekeeping. In this regard, we encourage the ACABQ to continue to take a technical approach to the Secretary-General’s proposals, as called for by in its mandate, and to produce its reports as expeditiously as possible so that we can conduct our work in a timely and orderly fashion.
Madam Chair, in closing, my delegation would like to reiterate its gratitude to you and your able team for the leadership and support that made these outcomes possible. I thank you very much. ###"

"Over Parent Objections, Public School Teaches 6-Year-Olds About ‘Transgender Ravens’ And Gender Fluidity",thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/parent-objections-public-school-teaches-6-year-olds-transgender-ravens-gender-fluidity/,"By Helen Raleigh April 5, 2019
Should a six-year-old be taught to use transgendered pronouns and believe in so-called gender fluidity? The leaders of Superior Elementary School in Boulder Valley School District, Colorado, think so.
Last November, the school showed children from kindergarten to fifth grade videos from “Queer Kid Stuff” and a stage play about transgenderism to promote “acceptance and inclusivity” especially related to the transgender community. Some parents are outraged and are seeking possible legal remedies.
Superior is a small Colorado town with a population of 13,000. It’s about 20 miles east of the “Republic of Boulder,” which is known for being the home of University of Colorado and the most liberal city in Colorado.
On November 16, 2018, the day before Thanksgiving break, parents received an email from Jennifer Bedford, the school’s principal. Buried deep in all the other normal school updates was a “Save the Date” announcement. It stated that Phoenix, Colorado’s “Trans Community Choir,” would perform a play titled “Raven’s True Self” for children between first and fifth grade.
According to the memo, “This story is about a transgender raven in a community of animals … The story’s message is about the importance of being seen for who you are on the inside, rather than how you are perceived on the outside.” On the day this email came out, the same choir performed the same show for the first to fifth graders at Nederland Elementary School, another school of the Boulder Valley School District (BVSD).
But children at Superior elementary were promised more. The email included links to three videos that would be shown to kids prior to the musical performance: “ He, She, and They – What is Gender ,” “ No More Gender Roles ,” and “ Expressing Myself, My Way .” ‘Queer Kid Stuff’ Doesn’t Belong in Classrooms
These videos come from a YouTube channel called the “ Queer Kid Stuff ,” which bills itself as providing an “LGBTQ+ educational webseries for children ages 3+, hosted by a tie-wearing queer lady, Lindsay, and her non-binary best-stuffed friend, Teddy. Gender Studies 101 meets Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood!” Some other videos from this channel include “Dragqueen Makeup Transformation” and “Unicorns Are Queer Horses.”
Since the email came right before the holiday, many parents didn’t pay attention to it. After the holiday, a few parents finally clicked the video links and were shocked. For example, in the video “ He, She, and They – What is Gender ,” Teddy, the gender-confused teddy bear tells Lindsey, “I still don’t know if I am a boy or girl.” Lindsay responds, “Well Teddy, some people aren’t boys or girls. Some people are boys, some people are girls and some people are people.”
Teddy says, “I don’t feel like a ‘he’ or ‘she’ so I guess my pronoun is ‘they.'” Lindsay gives her wholehearted approval: “That’s really awesome, Teddy.” In the other video titled “ No More Gender Roles ,” Lindsay tells Teddy that “traditional gender roles are “mean, They are not fun and they are big problems.”
After watching these videos, outraged parents wondered why such highly controversial and divisive topics were forced upon young children. One parent told CBS 4 Denver that “[The lesson] goes beyond a simple message of tolerance and acceptance. We support tolerance and acceptance, but this is simply not age-appropriate.” But Randy Barber, a school district spokesman, insisted that these videos and the stage play were age-appropriate. “We really don’t believe that you can be too young to learn about inclusivity and differences in the community,” he said.
Still, after backlash from parents, Superior told parents they were allowed to opt out their kids only from the musical play by emailing the principal. Even though she insisted all videos were age appropriate for the youngsters, Bedford decided only “ He, She, and They – What is Gender ” would be shown to all kids from kindergarten to fifth grade. But she extended the showing of the video and in-classroom instructions from one to two days.
Although no permission slip or opt-out form was sent home, an estimated 30 percent of parents kept their kids home on the day of the scheduled transgender activities. Still, many parents sent their kids to school on the day of the musical performance, assuming since they had opted their children out, their kids wouldn’t attend either the play nor watch any of those videos but do some other learning-related activities in a different classroom. That didn’t happen either. Parents Discover What Really Went On
One dad went to school to find out what was going on. He walked into his daughter’s regular first-grade classroom and saw kids whose parents had opted them out remaining in the classroom and watching the video “ He, She, and They – What is Gender .” After the video, the teacher had the kids partner up to talk about how they felt inside and what pronoun they each preferred.
Even more shocking to many parents is their discovery that BVSD has been trying to indoctrinate their kids for years. BVSD reportedly pays about $19,000 annually for its staff to be trained by “A Queer Endeavor,” a program in the CU-Boulder Department of Education, on how to embed LGBTQ worldviews into curriculum—a process they call “Queering the curriculum.” Their founder states, “Our approach moves beyond the anti-bullying discourse and works toward systemic change.”
After learned the school had ignored their demand to keep their kids out of such controversial and age inappropriate topics, many parents are angry but too afraid to speak up in fear that they and their children might be labeled transphobic. Still, on November 27, 2018, a few brave families filed a formal discrimination complaint against Superior Elementary School on several grounds, including that the school had violated its own policies regarding how “sexuality information” should be taught and failed to provide all parents with appropriate notification and an opportunity to opt out.
The BVSD responded to parents’ complaint in February by insisting that the topic and content presented in the video and the musical focusing are not part of human sexuality, so they didn’t need to follow the school’s review and teaching policies related to human sexuality and controversial content. This is typical across the nation, as gender identity has been deliberately excluded from the “sex ed” label because of pre-existing laws giving children and parents extra information and opt-out possibilities for such classes. Another hearing is scheduled for April 9. Is Gender Indoctrination Really Necessary?
The school district insists that the transgender musical, the “queer” videos, and the in-classroom gender fluidity discussions are necessary to “ensure the safety, comfort, and healthy development of the students who are transgender or gender nonconforming while maximizing the students’ social integration and minimizing stigmatization of the students.”
State Sen. Paul Lundeen, a Republican, says, “Every student must be safe in school. Creating confusion for very young students erodes instead of promoting safety. Doing so without parent knowledge or consent is simply wrong.” He is right: promoting gender fluidity to young kids creates unnecessary confusion and some gender-confused youth may do things causing physical harm to themselves .
There is also no scientific evidence that promoting gender fluidity to young children helps develop their empathy and compassion. Rather, the school district and the trans activists’ typical approach, of only permitting their own ideological orthodoxy and loudly condemning anyone who disagrees, is a textbook example of intolerance and divisiveness.
Although both Colorado statute and Board of Education policies recognize the rights of parents and guardian to make decisions about their child’s education in health and sexuality, what has transpired in Superior Elementary is a prelude of where public education is heading in Colorado.
The Democrats in the Colorado State Assembly are pushing for a “Comprehensive Human Sexuality Education” bill, HB19-1032 . This bill will require schools to teach children specific topics such as “sexual experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals,” while the bill stipulates religious tenets or doctrines may not even be “implicitly” taught.
Parents’ opt-out options will be limited when gender fluidity topics are taught outside of direct sex-ed classes (that’s the exact argument BVSD used). And, of course, even if parents do keep their kids from school or manage to opt them out of specific classes or presentations, their children are still going to school with all the children who have seen that material and will likely readily transmit it just the same.
Many parents view this bill as the state’s attempt to turn public schools into ideological reeducation camps where schools take on the parents’ role in making decisions about their children’s education in sexuality. Concerned parents staged several protests against this bill earlier this year. Given what has happened in Superior, these parents are fighting an uphill battle in Colorado.

It’s Not Racism To Ask Judicial Nominees Tough Questions About Their Legal Philosophy,thefederalist.com,Kyle Sammin,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/not-racism-ask-judicial-nominees-tough-questions-legal-philosophy/,"By Kyle Sammin April 5, 2019
Accusing your political enemies of racism has become so standard in the Democratic playbook that Republicans hardly notice anymore. It’s a ploy that may have once been meant truthfully but now has become as common and meaningless as accusing Republicans of favoring only the rich — a political barb, not meant seriously or even backed up with facts.
One of the disappointing developments of our time has been conservatives copying liberal tactics instead of refuting them. One example of this popped up earlier this week as professor David E. Bernstein blogged at the Volokh Conspiracy that on the nominations of Neomi Rao and Jessie K. Liu, Republicans were “skating awfully close to identity politics on judicial nominations.”
Bernstein goes out of his way to say that he’s not “accusing them of conscious racism,” but he’s not not saying it either. In tarring senators Mike Lee (R–UT) and Josh Hawley (R–MO) with the brush of racism and anti-Semitism, Bernstein misses the chance to have a meaningful conversation about these senators’ opposition to Trump nominees for important offices. Instead, the explosive charge of racism crowds out all other discussion and reduces the conversation to the usual political bomb-throwing. What Happened With Neomi Rao and Jessie Liu
The first accusation comes after the rough road Rao suffered on her way to confirmation as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. That court is often called the second-highest court in the land, and has jurisdiction over many important cases. After being burned over the years by Republican nominees who have turned out to be inconsistently conservative, senators are right to scrutinize nominees closely, even those from their own party’s president.
Hawley did just this with Rao, who was appointed to the seat vacated by Brett Kavanaugh upon his elevation to the Supreme Court, and who is often mentioned as a future high court pick herself. Hawley had questions about her commitment to the pro-life cause, and wondered if she was, in fact, sympathetic to the abortion rights movement. He also questioned whether Rao supported the doctrine of “substantive due process,” which was part of the legal reasoning used to derive the pro-abortion holding in Roe v. Wade in 1973. After assurances from Rao and others, Hawley dropped his opposition and the nominee was confirmed.
Similar questions about pro-life credentials dogged Liu when she was nominated to be associate attorney general. Lee’s doubts about Liu’s opinions on abortion stemmed, as far as Bernstein or anyone else can tell, from Liu’s longtime membership in the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL), a group that has expressed support for the abortion rights movement in the past.
Did Liu share those views? Abortion rights was just one of many issues the NAWL advocated, but they did so fairly prominently, including their serious public opposition to Justice Samuel Alito’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Liu even served as the group’s vice president.
On the other hand, as Bernstein notes, “Liu personally expressed support for Alito’s nomination to the Supreme Court, signing a Yale Law School alumni letter on his behalf.” So it is possible that Liu’s membership in NAWL does not equate to endorsement of every one of the organization’s policy choices. Ultimately, the controversy, such as it was, cost Liu the job, as she withdrew her nomination. Bernstein Sees a Suspicious Pattern
Bernstein looks at these two troubled nominations and sees a pattern.
Rao is the daughter of Indian Parsi immigrants, and Liu is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. It seems as though their minority backgrounds may at least subconsciously raise suspicions that they aren’t on ‘the team.’ I suspect such suspicions might have been quelled if they belonged to “appropriate” churches—the Mormon church, a conservative Protestant congregation, a Catholic parish known for being actively pro-life. As it happens, while I can’t speak to either woman’s personal religious beliefs, I understand that their families are members of Jewish congregations.
That is quite a leap, especially the insinuation of anti-Semitism against two people who are not themselves Jewish by birth, although their husbands are. Opposition to two nominees by one senator each is a very small sample size from which to draw such a sweeping conclusion.
It also does not explain Republican senators’ enthusiastic reception of other Asian-American judicial nominees, including Amul Thapar, Jim Ho, and Ken Lee. Nor does Bernstein address the intense opposition to Rao by Democrats, who reserve their harshest fire for “race-” and “gender-traitors,” as they see them. Without any evidence of racism or anti-Semitism from Lee and Hawley, it is truly an inflammatory accusation, no matter how it is couched.
Like all such claims, it sucks the oxygen from an already limited room for the discussion of nominees. There are real issues with the way Rao’s and Liu’s nominations were handled: by promoting the incendiary arguments, Bernstein leaves us with little room to discuss the reasons the senators actually gave for their opposition. Why Did Lee and Hawley Object?
So let’s talk about them. Lee’s concern with Liu’s nomination was that she might not be solid on abortion. Most conservatives would not dispute that opposition to abortion is an honorable and morally correct position, and a belief shared by many of those who elect Republicans to office. But is it really necessary that every single officeholder in the administration be 100 percent pro-life?
Liu was not nominated to the federal bench, nor running for a seat in the legislature. She was nominated to a high-ranking job in the federal bureaucracy. The distinction is important, because a bureaucrat’s job is not to write laws but to enforce them, in accordance with the policies of the administration. The debate is a subset of that long-running argument of how the Constitution should be interpreted.
The laws on abortion are what they are, and the Trump administration has proven itself to be strongly pro-life. Liu’s job as the third-ranking member of the Department of Justice would be to enforce those policies, not to write them. Not every bureaucrat, even at the highest level, needs to agree with every point of administration policy in order to be effective at her job. That was an argument worth having during Liu’s nomination fight, but it is pushed aside by more sensational charges of racism.
Rao’s case is also interesting, but not for reasons that commonly make headlines. The debate over substantive due process is one that usually does not leave the realms of law schools and judge’s chambers, but it is nonetheless an important one. The question, essentially, is how the Bill of Rights’s protections are applied against the states.
The Fourteenth Amendment’s authors intended that the “privileges and immunities” protected by their amendment would include those in the Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court saw things differently, and incorporated those rights selectively over the years as a matter of what became known as “substantive due process.”
The debate is a subset of that long-running argument of how the Constitution should be interpreted. Are the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment those generally understood at the time of its passage, or those established piecemeal though meandering judicial leaps and jumps of logic through the ages?
The result is often the same, but the method matters. Consider Timbs v. Indiana , a recent Supreme Court case about civil forfeiture. The decision was unanimous in the result, but justices differed on the reasoning behind it, with some ending up on each side of the substantive due process question. Does that matter? Not for Mr. Timbs, but for future cases, and for the predictability of the law, it does.
This, too, is a debate worth having. It is a debate Bernstein and Hawley have already been having between themselves. But, again, with a media that flits from one hot take to the next, no time will be devoted to this important (if esoteric) debate when it is much easier to report on ill-founded accusations of racism, conscious or unconscious. Besides the damage done to innocent men’s reputations by wild accusations, we also must be mindful of the damage done to any chance of honest debate on these important issues.

"When A KKK Leader And Civil Rights Activist Get Together, This Is What Happens",thefederalist.com,Josh Shepherd,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/kkk-leader-civil-rights-activist-get-together-happens/,"By Josh Shepherd April 5, 2019
It’s a true story so unlikely, some critics dismiss it sight-unseen as wishful thinking, feel-good corniness, or even a smokescreen for Klansmen’s evil deeds. Yet the hard work of reconciliation did net results for Durham, North Carolina in 1971, ending school segregation and disbanding the local KKK chapter—as depicted in “The Best of Enemies” releasing this weekend.
Nearly two decades after Brown v. Board of Education , the city of Durham still refused to integrate its schools. Yet when a firebombing irreparably damages the school black children attend, community activist and mother Ann Atwater (Taraji P. Henson of “Hidden Figures” and TV’s “Empire”) calls for equal access and funding for all students.
The city council rejects this proposal, egged on by longtime Ku Klux Klan leader C.P. Ellis (Sam Rockwell, Oscar winner for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”). As unrest grows, city leaders agree to bring in reconciliation leader Bill Riddick. During this era, he pioneered a community meeting concept called a charrette to convene opposing sides to solve problems.
Sparks fly when Riddick gets Atwater and Ellis to co-chair his citywide summit. Speaking in a phone interview from Raleigh, North Carolina, elder statesman Bill Riddick says “The Best of Enemies” makes no apologies for the evils of KKK members, although it does have Ellis’s repentance and redemption at its core.
“We all have beliefs that we have changed,” says Riddick, age 81, who served as a consultant on the film. “I can’t hold a grudge against him because he was a Klansman. We all have biases to set aside, because our culture teaches us stereotypes about people not like us.”
Producer Dominique Telson has spent four years working on the film. “Ann Atwater had a goal,” she says. “To do the work that needed to be done, it meant going up against Ellis. She changed the trajectory of this man’s life—not just once, by getting him away from the KKK, but by saving he and his family’s livelihood.
“Really both their lives were better for it, and I love to tell stories like that.” Getting History Right
Today, any film centered on race relations and reconciliation in the civil rights era faces skepticism from diverse factions. Consider two recent Academy Award nominees who came under fire.
This year’s Oscar-winning Best Picture “Green Book,” about African American pianist Don Shirley, has been criticized by his living relatives, who say it tells an incomplete and ultimately inaccurate story. Meanwhile, reporting on the undercover cop biopic “BlacKkKlansman” revealed that the Spike Lee film trumped up significant characters and events to make its caricatured plot unlike the real-life events it ostensibly depicted.
From its inception, the team behind “The Best of Enemies” have sought to ground the film in firsthand and historical accounts. The eponymous 1996 book by reporter Osha Gray Davidson chronicles in detail Durham’s entrenched civil rights struggles. Featuring Atwater and Ellis discussing their two-week charrette, the 2002 documentary “An Unlikely Friendship” became another primary source for producers.
“We just told the truth,” says producer Telson. “We didn’t make up these events; it’s all what really happened. Ann was the catalyst [when] her daughter’s school burned down, and the fight became personal. As you see in the film, she went a little reluctantly. Ann didn’t really want to sit across from this guy—they hated each other for years.”
The award-winning producer of “The Hunger Games” and “Seabiscuit,” Robin Bissell makes his directorial debut with this historical drama. He adapted the script from Davidson’s book in addition to personally interviewing key players, including Atwater before her death in 2016. Riddick recalls that Atwater was thrilled when hearing Taraji P. Henson would portray her.
“I was involved with Robin from the beginning, before he wrote a word,” says Riddick, asked about the film’s historical accuracy. “My participation in the movie included reviewing the screenplay, then I went to the set to watch the filming—not all of it, but enough of it to make sure it told the truth. I would not be speaking to you today if it was not the truth.” Inspiring the Human Spirit Through Film
Hollywood production company Astute Films , launched in 2016 by former Sony executive Fred Bernstein, marks its second release with “The Best of Enemies.” Since he’d admired her work as an independent producer, Bernstein recruited Telson to head creative development.
“He said, ‘I’ve been listening to what you’ve been saying for a while now, and I can’t imagine doing it without you,’” recounts Telson, whose TV movies have aired on Showtime, Hallmark, Lifetime, and BET. “When I joined Astute Films, this was the first film that I wanted to make.”
The producer role involved her in casting (when Paul Giamatti had to bow out, they landed Sam Rockwell), scouting locations (they shot in Atlanta rather than Durham) and working on the film’s $10 million budget—which she calls the hardest part.
“When you’re producing a film, there are battles every day,” says Telson. “For a period drama, this was not easy to fit in what we needed for the amount of money this was made for. As project manager, the producer gets everything together until you get on-set and the actual artists take over: the director, set designer and the beauty of what they do.”
Director Bissell and his team had the benefit of having Riddick himself on set, who recalls the events firsthand. By 1971, the reconciliation specialist had hosted similar successful charrettes in Indiana, Pennsylvania, and other states. Yet upon entering the small town akin to Mayberry, Riddick is told off by Ellis, who uses the demeaning term “boy.”
“I was shocked when I got there,” says Riddick. “But for the charrette to be successful, you have to bring people together who have extreme ideas about the same problem. The co-chairs must have an audience and a following. Then when the charrette happens, they will bring those folks to uphold what it is they believe.”
He courted Ellis and Atwater, whose commanding presence drives the film. Her local nonprofit work reflects her passion for working across ethnic divisions that dominated during that era.
“One of the things I love about Ann Atwater is she wasn’t just an activist for African Americans,” says Telson. “She was an activist for all people in Durham through Operation Breakthrough, whose mission was to help the poor of the community. Ann fought discreetly for the well-being of others, but she was also known as ‘Roughhouse Annie.’ One way or the other, she would get it done!” Singing From the Same Hymnbook
The ensemble of characters brought together in Durham—notably Atwater, Riddick, Ellis, and his wife—were all professing Christians. It presents seeming contradictions, which “The Best of Enemies” explores. “If you’re going to tell this story, faith has to be a part of it,” says Telson. “It was a key element in the fiber of who Ann Atwater was.”
Riddick recalls his own faith journey. “I grew up in the church and never lost the faith that I had in Jesus Christ,” says the civil rights icon. “I wasn’t so much practicing it, but every time I got in trouble I would pray. When I came home from the first day of the charrette and dealt with my own biases, I really asked the Lord to guide me through the process.”
Atwater’s faith shows up throughout, even over lunch. The charrette hosted by Riddick used various tactics to challenge participants daily. Everyone involved had to dine and dialogue with a person of another ethnicity, including the stubbornly opposed co-chairs seated at a head table for two.
Producer Telson praises how the film’s lead brought her faith forward in big and small ways. “This is the beauty of Taraji P. Henson, who studied who this woman was,” says Telson. “Sitting across from C.P. at the table, she puts her hands up in prayer—reflecting her black church roots. That wasn’t written in the script! It’s Taraji channeling Ann Atwater.”
Late on a Friday, as Riddick wrapped up half of a planned two-week process, little progress seemed evident. A black clergyman had invited his church choir to close the time with a song. While some white participants left, Ellis stayed. Riddick recalls seeing Atwater lean over to Ellis as the energetic choir ramped up.
“He didn’t know how to clap in rhythm, how black people clap in rhythm,” says Riddick. “She was trying to teach him how to do that. It had an effect on him and was one of the parts of him starting to change.”
A father of four including a son with developmental struggles, Ellis attended church weekly with his family—where he also recruited for the local KKK Youth Corps. As the son of a textile mill worker, his economic situation differs little from Atwater, who was born to a family of sharecroppers. Gradually, he comes to realize how his actions contradict the biblical ethic of human dignity.
Telson recalls a favorite scene that boils down the core conflict. After a 12-hour day of emotional dialogue, the two co-chairs head to their cars. “Yeah, I go to church and have a Bible,” Ellis says offhandedly. “Ann replies, ‘Oh yeah—Do you read it?’” recounts the producer. “When you look at his face there, this sheepish grin that he has, it is portrayed exactly right.”
“She is challenging how he lives his faith,” says Telson. “You’re calling yourself a Christian, but isn’t being a Christian about loving everybody? That’s not really what you’re doing here, buddy.” Inspiration to Persevere for Justice
A father of three and grandfather of seven with his wife Delores, Riddick is optimistic for America to continue to better reflect racial equality and opportunity for all.
“I have lived long enough to see a lot of things change,” says Riddick. “I was born in the 1930s and have seen society improve tremendously. Obviously, over the last couple years, we have regressed a little bit especially on matters of race and class. But we will work through this.”
Recent years have brought several flashpoints affecting race relations, from policing incidents that ended in the loss of life, to the infamous August 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Va. that resulted in three deaths. The nation has also seen recent progress, such as criminal justice reform beginning to impact how mass incarceration disproportionately affects minorities.
“Alarm bells are ringing loud, but one of the things America is famous for doing is adjusting,” adds Riddick. “I think we will adjust and get back on the road to where everybody is valued in this country.”
Diverse voices have offered praise for “The Best of Enemies,” from TheGrio news portal serving African American readers to conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt . Filmmakers contend it speaks directly to the current moment.
“We began this film in 2015, and we thought we were making it that year,” says Telson. “But then ‘Empire’ just took off, and Taraji was really too busy to do anything else. She put the script in a drawer. We were kind of at a loss to figure out what to do.”
The producer recalls a conversation she had in late 2016 with Henson. The star said, “When the election happened, I remembered this Ann Atwater and pulled out my script. I thought: We’ve got to do this now. ”
As it opens this weekend on more than 1,700 screens nationwide, audiences will laugh, cry, cringe, and empathize with these strange bedfellows who work together for the common good. Producers foresee greater personal and societal shifts could result.
“I hope that people will be inspired by this film, to get out from behind your Twitter account, look somebody in the eye and have a conversation,” concludes Telson. “When C.P. and Ann got in front of each other, they stopped hating each other and saw themselves as people.”

A Funny Meteorologist Offers Advice On Weathering Personal Storms,thefederalist.com,Julie Gunlock,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/a-funny-meteorologist-offers-advice-on-weathering-personal-storms/,"By Julie Gunlock April 5, 2019
Fox News Meteorologist Janice Dean is genuine. The joy she feels mingling with the crowd assembled outside Fox’s New York headquarters as she gives the morning weather report is clearly the real deal. It’s the first thing she mentions in her new book, Mostly Sunny: How I Learned to Keep Smiling Through the Rainiest Days , calling those gathered “my friends that come to visit me.”
Although born in Canada, Dean’s autobiography starts off like a classic American success story. She writes about her happy childhood, growing up with her parents and brother in a comfortable home outside of Ottawa, Canada. From a young age, she’s eager to work and earn money. She’s ambitious and very driven, yet also clever and funny, which makes it easy for her to charm her coworkers. Dean jumps on every opportunity to grow professionally and eventually develops an interest in journalism, getting entry-level jobs and volunteering as often as possible to gain more experience.
Of course, it isn’t all sunny. Dean describes painful moments—her father’s abandonment of her family, a weight problem, being bullied in school, and a terrible experience working for shock jock Don Imus. But for the most part, things are pretty good for Dean early in her career. It seems like this will be a “small-town girl makes it big” kind of story.
Then, 40 pages in, the book takes a dark turn. It surprised me so much, that I read those pages with a hand firmly placed over my gaping mouth. Weathering the Storms
Completely alone and sleeping soundly in her apartment, Dean suddenly wakes to a man standing over her. He’s brandishing a knife and demanding she remove her clothes. Her survival skills kick in and she managed to distract him, keeping him talking, promised him money, expensive jewelry, and her new car. When a sudden noise outside startles him, he runs out of the apartment, leaving Dean stunned and trembling on the floor.
While the man didn’t physically harm Dean, the terrifying attack—and the obsessive thought of what might have happened if that sound hadn’t scared him off—left her fragile, questioning herself, dealing with crippling anxiety, and a fear of being alone. It also left her with survivor’s guilt after finding out other women had been attacked and one raped by the same man.
But Dean’s frightening Me Too moment (she’d have others) didn’t stop her. She reports the crime, which helps investigators eventually find him. She seeks counseling (a theme she returns to later in the book to explain how therapy has helped her throughout her adult life), takes time off work, and acknowledges that what she’s been through is significant. She seems to be at ease with the knowledge that such crimes change people.
It is perhaps because of this trauma that Dean navigates the Roger Ailes sexual harassment scandal so deftly. She’s in a particularly awkward place in that she gives partial credit for her own rise at Fox News to the very man who victimized so many of her friends and colleagues there.
Yet Dean is no Ailes apologist. In fact, when her Fox News colleague Gretchen Carlson went public and filed charges against Ailes, it was Dean who helped convince some skittish Fox News staffers to come forward with their own stories of how Ailes had harassed them.
Dean remembers Ailes as a deeply complex man—not a one-dimensional monster, but as someone with many demons and the capacity for both cruelty and kindness. She recalls how, on the one hand, he could be disarmingly kind and caring toward the women he hired. (Dean tells a particularly warm story about Ailes helping a woman who cleaned the offices rise to become one of the network’s head makeup artists.) On the other, he preyed on many women at Fox and inflicted terrible pain and professional uncertainty on them.
Dean even explains that it was Ailes she turned to, and who showed incredible sympathy and support, when she was first diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, or what she calls the “My, you look so well” disease.
Dean is at her funniest when talking about the process of being diagnosed. After seeing her family doctor due to concerns about numbing in her feet, Dean finds an “unemotional and very detached” neurologist she calls a robo-doctor, Dr. Feelbad, and Dr. Distant—a clear nod to the fact that Dean deals with stress by employing humor. At the end, she offers this zinger to the robo-doc, suggesting he should invest in “an acting class to at least look compassionate.” One hopes she sends him a dog-eared copy of her book. Here Comes the Sunshine
This is the subtle literary style that allows Dean to really connect with readers. Who hasn’t had that experience with a doctor who delivers bad news with the perfunctory style of a person repeating back a fast-food order in the drive-thru? Who hasn’t wanted to scream at a doctor: BE HUMAN!
But Dean’s medical problems don’t end with the MS diagnosis. In one of the book’s more raw chapters, Dean explains the horrible side effects she suffered after having a cosmetic procedure. Channeling Nora Ephron , Dean had become very concerned with her aging neck and was told by a doctor that a fast and easy procedure could tidy it up a bit.
Sadly, Dean was one of the 1-2 percent of patients who suffer bad side effects and experienced temporary nerve damage to one side of her face. Now, this would be horrifying for anyone, but for a woman in the media—the national media, no less—who is known for her expressive face and fantastic smile, this was not only upsetting, it was potentially harmful to her career.
Dean is honest in how she responded at first: not well. She jokes about the many tears and “vats of wine” consumed while she was forced to take a break from broadcasting to fully heal. But, soon, she also saw an opportunity to help others—a constant theme with Dean.
She wrote an article about her experience and then decided to discuss the whole affair—the surgery, the recovery and even the shame and embarrassment she felt, on “Fox and Friends,” the network’s popular morning program. The outpouring of support, especially at Fox, helped her healing process tremendously and brought new fans who loved Dean’s honesty and eagerness to help others.
Dean ends her book by reminiscing about acting as a back-up singer for a band that was playing on “Fox and Friends.” Here’s the interesting part: Dean wasn’t told by the segment director that she would be singing backup. It wasn’t even a part of the programming that day. Instead, Dean asked to join the singers. That takes a lot of guts, and she enjoyed it so much she declared it “one of the best things I’ve ever done in my entire life!”
Janice Dean has gained the confidence she didn’t have when first starting out in the tough business of journalism. But she’s there now, and she’s able to offer not just sunshine but a lot of inspiration to those still trying to find their way out of the storm clouds.

What Happens When Homeless People Memorize Abraham Lincoln’s Inaugural Address,thefederalist.com,Stevi Nichols,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/when-the-homeless-memorize-abraham-lincolns-inaugural-address/,"By Stevi Nichols April 5, 2019
The day of Abraham Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address, an “almost incessant rain” had turned the streets to mud. Some feared the weather would ruin the ceremony, but the large crowd stood silently, soaking in the gravity of the words Lincoln spoke.
The biblical imagery that filled the speech, the conviction with which it was spoken, and the gravity of the situation have made this speech one of the best in U.S. history. Lincoln’s timeless words contain truth that touches the hearts of all who hear it. Great or small, man or woman, slave or free, every American can recognize the importance of Lincoln’s message.
Perhaps this is why some have chosen to memorize it. By holding beautiful and true things in our hearts and minds, we provide a guide for our own thoughts and lives, long after we have ceased the work of memorizing them.
Memorization can sometimes be a hard task, especially for those no longer in childhood. Even to adults, though, memorizing is a very useful activity. Memorization helps to build a foundation of knowledge and skills that contribute to a person’s problem-solving capability. Memorization is an effective method in early childhood and elementary education, but it could also be a useful tool for an unexpected population: the homeless.
Nationally, homelessness has increased for the past two years. On any given night in 2018, 553,000 people spend the night in an emergency shelter, transitional housing, or on the street. The highest state rates of unsheltered homeless persons are in California, with 68.9 percent of their homeless unable to find shelter, and Oregon, with 61.7 percent. Texas had one of the largest percent increases of homelessness recently, with a 7.5 percent increase between 2017 and 2018.
To address this growing need, The Net, a nonprofit in Tarrant County, Texas, focuses on building relationships with those experiencing homelessness. Their mission recognizes that “poverty is more than material,” so every resource they offer is geared toward helping to “restore the sense of dignity and self-worth” in the men and women who regularly visit their location.
The Net’s model is structured to provide incentives to program participants, rather than simply issuing handouts. Participants can earn points to spend in the food pantry, the laundromat, or the clothing store by bringing friends, serving, and participating in events. On any given afternoon, The Net is full of men and women from all walks of life eating peanut butter sandwiches, using the computer stations, making arts and crafts, and simply hanging out and chatting with volunteers.
Last year, The Net began offering six-week classes as an additional way for program participants to earn points. Classes ranged from yoga to painting to sign language, all encouraging members to invest in their personal development.
This semester, The Net is offering an American history course. Most of the participants have not taken a history class in more than ten years, and many barely have a high school education. Even still, the students all express interest in history and are enthusiastic participants in the class. Learning about Hamilton and Lincoln
The first week, the students learned about Alexander Hamilton, particularly about his influence on the Second Continental Congress and the ratification of the Constitution through his writing in the Federalist Papers. After class, the whole center sang along to the soundtrack of the musical, “Hamilton,” in the common area.
Each student left the first class with a copy of Hillsdale College’s Declaration and Constitution booklet and was encouraged to bring it back each week, as it would be helpful in their later discussions of American history.
The next week, the class discussed Lincoln, popular sovereignty, and the 13th Amendment. For extra credit, they were given the last five lines of Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address to memorize. If they could recite it in class the following week, they would earn an extra five points to use at The Net’s store.
George Washington Carver was the subject of the following week. After a lively and hilarious discussion centered on his botanical genius and generosity, one woman raised her hand and demanded, “When am I going to get to recite my homework?”
Then, in a very loud voice, with her head held high and a slightly self-conscious look on her face, she declared, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right…” She looked down.
“I can do it… just let me think… Let us strive on to finish the work we are in — ” again she paused.
“… To…to bind… to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”
The class exploded into applause. The student grinned and then turned and fiercely declared, “Now none of y’all have any excuse! I got three of my other homeless friends to help me work on this in the park where we sleep. They would read a line, and then I would have to repeat it back to them three times. They did that with me. They were my fact checkers. And now, they know it too! So if we can do it, all y’all don’t have any excuse! You can do it too!”
Her tone was almost accusatory, but there was no mistaking the pride on her face. The other students looked slightly stunned. Then one asked, “Can we practice now?” A Challenge for All
For the remaining 10 minutes, the class worked together to memorize the five lines. Most students left promising to perfect and recite it the following week. After almost everyone had emptied the classroom, a quiet student who never spoke up in class approached the teacher.
“I can say it,” he said softly. Then, staring straight ahead, he recited all five lines, as if in a trance. When he finished, he started and looked surprised.
“I did it! I didn’t think I could do it, but I did it!” His eyes were bright and his smile was huge.
By itself, memorizing five lines of Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address is not going to end homelessness in Tarrant County or anywhere else. The amount of pride and accomplishment on those students’ faces after their successful recitations cannot, however, be overstated. The image of four homeless women learning Lincoln’s address in the park where they sleep is incredible.
Education is a tool meant to enable human beings to live fully human lives. Each lesson is a step upward. Many of these students can fit their possessions into a grocery sack and cannot keep a library of books, but memorization allows them to carry the good, true, and beautiful things they have learned wherever they go. Because they are doing the work to remember crucial pieces of their country’s history, they now have one more tool in their journey out of homelessness.

Harvard Students Vote To Send Student Money To Anti-Semitic Group,thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/harvard-students-vote-send-student-money-anti-semitic-group/,"By Melissa Langsam Braunstein April 5, 2019
If everyone admitted to a college is invited to campus, but Jewish students are made to feel less welcome, is the campus still everyone’s home? I never wondered about this as an undergraduate. But I absolutely did this week, after reading that Harvard’s Undergraduate Council (UC) funded Israeli Apartheid Week on campus.
When I arrived in Cambridge in the fall of 1996, Harvard felt like the Upper West Side’s northern outpost. That is, it was very culturally Jewish — Seinfeldian, if you like. Obviously, most students weren’t Jewish, but there was a decent-sized Jewish minority, and we were well integrated into campus life. It was an incredibly comfortable place for someone like me who was actively involved with the campus Hillel and kept kosher. But I’m not so sure I’d feel identically if I were a student there now.
This year doesn’t mark Harvard’s first IAW , but it appears to be the first one that’s received funding from the student government. And that seems like a notable change.
The UC, which is supposed to represent all Harvard undergraduates, recently voted 21-13-4 to grant $2,050 — serious money for student groups, and more than the UC’s typical grant — to fund the Palestine Solidarity Committee’s Israeli Apartheid Week. It is worth noting that part of the UC’s budget is funded by student activity fees charged to all enrolling students. UC Finance Committee Chair Noah Harris confirmed via email that “the rest [of the budget] comes from the administration to be allocated at our discretion.”
Discretion is crucial, because students are clearly split on whether IAW is an appropriate student government expenditure. One Hillel-affiliated student, Ilan Goldberg, emailed, “The grant was approved specifically because it relates to race relations . . . rather than because it works to improve race relations.” Now, it’s not my money, but if it were, I know I’d certainly prefer the latter to be the standard.
IAW has a history of not promoting open, honest, or nuanced conversation. It’s about slandering democratic Israel by comparing it to apartheid South Africa, while promoting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement on American college campuses. David Brog, executive director of the Maccabee Task Force , which fights rising anti-Semitism on American college campuses, told The Federalist, “Israel Apartheid Week clearly crosses the line from the legitimate criticism of Israel into the anti-Semitic demonization of Israel.”
The substance at the core of IAW is vitriolic. CAMERA ’s campus coordinators Liel Asulin and Zac Schildcrout attended multiple IAW events at Harvard over the past week, and Asulin told The Federalist, “Speakers such as Marc Lamont Hill and slam poet Remi Kanazi’s calls to end Israel as the Jewish State were met with enthusiasm and applause.” Schildcrout added “During the panel with Marc Lamont Hill, the moderator, Yamila Hussein, conflated Zionism with white supremacy.” IAW also includes a publicly displayed Wall of Resistance. Undergraduate Benjamin Rabinowitz emailed that the wall’s unveiling event included “hateful tropes like ‘Zionism is white supremacy’ [which] have been quite concerning to many Jewish students.”
This represents the crux of the issue. It’s not whether students should be allowed to criticize Israel’s government or specific government policies they find offensive; that’s protected speech. It’s that IAW has a tendency to stigmatize American Jews and other Israel supporters on college campuses.
Consider the restrained statement issued by student Rebecca Thau, on behalf of Harvard Hillel’s undergraduate steering committee. It’s worth reading the whole letter , but the most urgent passage may be this one: “The contentious nature of yesterday’s UC meeting underscores what we see as the troubling consequences of Israeli Apartheid Week itself: vilifying students for their commitments and even their heritages.”
Harvard administrators should pay heed. While undergraduates come and go, they remain and help set the tone on campus. This uncivil behavior may still be unusual for Harvard — both Goldberg and Rabinowitz reported that most students seemed unaware of IAW — but it echoes a disturbing nationwide pattern.
Last August, the AMCHA Initiative , which combats campus anti-Semitism, released a report on the subject. The organization found that “although classic anti-Semitic incidents outnumbered Israel-related incidents three to one, less than 25% of classic incidents demonstrated intent to harm, whereas 94% of Israel-related incidents did.”
AMCHA Initiative director Tammi Rossman-Benjamin told The Federalist that “at schools where there is anti-Zionist rhetoric, those schools are three times more likely to have acts of anti-Jewish activity, things that go beyond speech about Israel.” Rossman-Benjamin explained, “That speech leads students to turn on supporters of Israel on campus, whether it’s verbal denigration or vandalizing fliers or their dorm rooms, pushing or harassing them.”
That’s not behavior that Harvard — or any university — should tolerate. All admitted students should feel welcome on campus, regardless of the week’s name. For the sake of their Jewish students, it’s important that campus leaders and administrators do all they can to fight anti-Semitism, even, and perhaps especially, when it cloaks itself as some sort of righteous anti-Zionism. Because that’s not principle. It’s just another form of hatred.

Netflix’s ‘The Highwaymen’ Is a Balanced And Glamor-Free Take On The Bonnie And Clyde Saga,thefederalist.com,Ron Capshaw,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/netflixs-highwaymen-balanced-glamor-free-take-bonnie-clyde-saga/,"By Ron Capshaw April 5, 2019
When the Warren Beatty-Faye Dunaway film about Bonnie and Clyde premiered in 1967, actor James Garner, no conservative, criticized the film to Beatty. Garner hated how it glamorized and sanitized the outlaws who were, in point of fact, sadistic killers. By turns, the law enforcement officials who pursued them were fascist thugs in service to the banks.
The film was more a reflection of the late 1960s rather than early ’30s America. Bonnie and Clyde were transformed into fun-loving populists who robbed from the banks to give to the foreclosed poor. When they did engage in violence, it was against the “establishment” and the police who served it. The film depicted the pair as representing a way out of victimization.
A key scene that encapsulated all of the above was when the pair captured Texas Ranger Frank Hamer. Beatty’s Clyde worked himself up into frenzy when he blasted Hamer (played by Denver Pyle, whose previous work was as the bizarre mountain man on “The Andy Griffith Show”) as an Okie crusher. If not for Bonnie, Clyde would have gunned Hamer down on the spot. Instead, they tied him up and stuck him adrift in a rowboat.
For those offended by the 1967 film, “The Highwaymen,” a movie appearing this month on Netflix, will be applauded by the more historically minded who are less interested in polemics. In the film, the pair are not class levelers, but sadists hooked on violence. The actress playing Bonnie has none of the glamour of Faye Dunaway, whose clothing in the film inspired a fashion trend. Instead, she shoots downed policemen in the face.
In the form of Kevin Costner, Hamer has been rescued from the propaganda of the Beatty film. Costner, who once egotistically played on his surfer looks, allows his age to show through. He is a weathered and out-of-shape relic (unable to negotiate a wooden fence while pursuing a member of the Barrow gang) from a period when lawmen pursued criminals on horseback and felled them with a Winchester rifle.
Despite showing Hamer warts and all — for instance, frequently using fisticuffs to get information from those who work with the bandits or admire them — Costner is no less a justice figure. It is the sadism of the pair, and not a chance to prove his manhood, that galvanizes Costner into pursuit.
Costner is the “bad cop” to his partner Maney Gault’s “good” one. In a remarkable performance, Woody Harrelson shows how joining Costner is an attempt to prove his manhood. Like many men from the Great Depression, poverty has unmanned him. What Costner gets with his fists, Harrelson obtains with good ol’ boy charm. Of the two, Harrelson hates the killing and is in essence the “conscience” of the pair.
Historians of Bonnie and Clyde have said the pair was able to avoid the law with modern technology. That is, a souped-up car and the latest in weaponry: machine guns to the local cops’ single-action rifle. Hamer and Gault know this, and exchange their Winchesters for machine guns.
But they have to contend with Bonnie and Clyde’s popularity among those brutalized by the Great Depression. With their bank robbing, Bonnie and Clyde gave the downtrodden a vicarious thrill, taking the fight to the upper class. Regarded as Depression-era Robin Hoods, there is no proof they ever gave “from the rich to give to the poor.” Costner is clear-eyed about their history and regards them as “animals.”
Without condoning the vigilantism of Costner and Harrelson, the film clearly is on their side. Thankfully, unlike the Beatty vehicle, “The Highwaymen” doesn’t traffic in polemics. But it does depict the two aged lawmen as much better cops than the FBI.
They also have to battle the female governor of Texas, Ma Ferguson (an excellent Kathy Bates), who despises their vigilante tactics. At first giving them license to use any and all means to get Bonnie and Clyde, she eventually cannot stomach their vigilante tactics and demands they be brought in.
As with the performances, “Highwaymen” doesn’t depict Costner and Harrelson’s pursuit in glamorous ways. They live out of a car, eating restaurant food with little sleep. Nevertheless, the film holds the audience’s interest. Viewers in the know are aware that Bonnie and Clyde will eventually be riddled with machine-gun bullets, and it is this inevitable fate that gives the earlier scenes punch.
Controversy has always surrounded Hamer’s decision to fatally ambush Bonnie and Clyde on a Louisiana road. Some have said Hamer called out to the pair to give up. Others have asserted Hamer did not before the pair was riddled with at least 150 rounds of bullets. The movie weighs in on Costner asking them to give up.
“The Highwaymen” shows Costner and Harrelson in top form, honoring their characters while acknowledging their flaws."
Who Is To Blame For The Rise Of Radical Partisanship In Congress?,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/who-is-to-blame-for-the-rise-of-radical-partisanship-in-congress/,"April 5, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
When the topic of gridlock and tribalism in Congress arises, scholars often reflexively view the death of civility in terms of before and after the Newt Gingrich takeover. In Hillsdale College’s online course, “Congress: How It Worked and Why It Doesn’t,” Professor Kevin Portteus explains how the modern Congress has been equally shaped by Republicans, Democrats, and the changing American electorate.
Historians’ rose-colored glasses see the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s as times when members’ kids played baseball together and civility reigned. It’s the ’80s that are credited with the rise of temper tantrums and personal attacks.
“[Newt] Gingrich’s career can perhaps be best understood as a grand exercise in devolution—an effort to strip American politics of the civilizing traits it had developed over time and return it to its most primal essence,” writes McKay Coppins in The Atlantic. Gingrich’s arrival in Congress in the ’80s, and his infamous 1994 Republican Revolution, are often considered distinct events leading to the decline in bipartisanship and civility.
It was Gingrich and his allies who actively drove moderates out of the Republican Party. They were united in their unwillingness to compromise and opposition to anything Democrats proposed.
Portteus argues that evidence suggests the radicalization of Congress and more frequent ill treatment of the other side actually began a decade earlier than Gingrich’s arrival. After the Watergate election in the mid-1970s, the Republican Party was in shambles and Democrats gained one of the largest majorities in Congress any party had ever seen.
Democrats dominated Congress in a way that completely pushed Republicans out of participation. An insufficient number of Republican seats were made available on committees, and if Democrats did appoint a Republican to a committee, they wouldn’t tell the Republican members when meetings were held.
Even as Republicans won back seats after Jimmy Carter was elected president, the Democratic leadership maintained minuscule roles for Republicans. They used forceful tactics in exerting their power, like the time Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd sent Capitol Police to drag GOP Sen. Bob Packwood to the floor to keep a filibuster alive, or holding open votes until they were able to convince enough members to vote their way.
These events in the late 1970s led Republicans believe that not only did Democrats have no interest in working together, but they were also willing to steal elections to maintain power. Democrats were actually the original inventors of procedural tricks and stubborn sleight-of-hands that conventional wisdom now blames the Gingrich coalition for.
Scholars often imply that when Democrats are in control, they behave like civil moderates, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Blue Dog Democrats are essentially extinct, and the centrist moderates they claim to have are nowhere to be found.
But perhaps it’s not just the major parties who are to fully shoulder the blame for the radicalization of their tribes. The American people themselves have become polarized, and that is reflected in our legislature. We have two camps with fundamentally different views of justice, the role of government, and identity politics — and each camp sends representatives to D.C. to fight for their side. It seems Congress will not be to able find a middle ground until their voters do. Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour. Follow her on Twitter ."
"Revisiting ‘Batman, The Animated Series’: ‘Heart of Ice’",thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/revisiting-batman-animated-series-heart-ice/,"April 5, 2019
Spoilers ahead.
Following one of the show’s least successful episodes , “Heart of Ice” is a triumph on nearly every level, fulfilling almost all of the creative team’s ambitions. It is widely considered one of the best installments of the series, and often named as its best.
This episode was the first written by series co-creator Paul Dini and directed by co-creator Bruce Timm. Dini’s script earned the show an Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program. Timm’s direction provides the cinematic quality the script deserves.
“Heart of Ice” reimagines Mr. Freeze, lifting him out of the third tier of Batman villains. Freeze had appeared infrequently in the comics, originally under the name “Mr. Zero.” He was renamed and elevated by the 1966 live-action Batman series. These versions of the character usually portrayed him as a thief motivated by greed.
This episode provides the former Victor Fries with a tragic backstory which became canon in the comics for a number of years and in the disastrous movie, “Batman and Robin” (1997). Mr. Freeze seeks revenge on a vendetta which is not entirely unjustified. He now more closely fits the template of “ Two-Face ,” including a secondary heavy who is arguably less sympathetic.
Not that this version of Mr. Freeze is nice. Rather, he has become ruthless and indifferent to human suffering, save for the woman he mourns. Even his voice (Michael Ansara supplying the traditional European accent) is icy and filtered to sound slightly robotic through his life-preserving exoskeleton.
Speaking of which, “Heart of Ice” also redefines Mr. Freeze visually, courtesy of comics master Mike Mignola (the creator of Hellboy). Gone are the tights of the comics or the Apollo-era space suits of the live-action show. The new-model Freeze exoskeleton has a more retro look perhaps loosely inspired by Robby the Robot from the sci-fi classic “Forbidden Planet” (1956). The frozen head inside the helmet wears goggles which give him bright red eyes.
Freeze’s eyes are part of the way “Heart of Ice” tells its story with color. Much of the episode is awash in cool blues and grays; the few splashes of red really pop onscreen. The attention to all facets of production suggests this episode was a labor of love. The Plot
Our drama opens on a ballerina figurine in pink and red, pirouetting inside a large snow globe. Mr. Freeze holds the globe, promising the tiny dancer revenge—”a dish best served cold”—will soon be visited on the monster who took her from him. (Visually, the scene oddly echoes the rose scenes in Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” (1991).)
On television, Summer Gleeson reports on a series of thefts committed against GothCorp with a freeze gun. GothCorp CEO Ferris Boyle (a homonym of “boil”) professes bewilderment at the crimes. GothCorp is identified by its motto, “The People’s Company.”
Batman switches off the broadcast in the Batcave. Hacking into the police reports, he deduces the stolen items can be assembled into a freezing cannon. There is one component remaining and one GothCorp plant manufacturing it.
That night, Freeze busts into the GothCorp plant with an armored van—followed closely by the Batmobile. A freeze gun mounted on the van fires, causing the Batmobile to skid and crash.
Batman catches up and begins fighting Freeze’s henchmen. Freeze fires his gun, missing Batman and immobilizing a henchman’s legs. Freeze later scores a hit on Batman, encasing him in ice, if shielded from the full effect by his cape.
Freeze obtains the final component and directs his goons into the van. He abandons the half-frozen henchman, over the objections of the others and the pleas of the victim. Batman frees himself from the ice and saves the henchman instead of chasing Freeze.
In the Batcave, the henchman is treated in a tank recalling the one which heals Luke Skywalker in “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980). Batman, now nursing a cold, decides to visit to GothCorp in search of answers.
Bruce Wayne meets with Boyle, who says the only person who might want revenge on GothCorp is dead. According to Boyle, a research scientist died in an accident while using company funds for his own experiments. Boyle refers to his employees as wage slaves who must be kept in line, cynically noting that “The People’s Company” line is pure public relations.
As a disgusted Bruce rises to leave, Boyle mentions he is receiving a humanitarian award and extends an invitation. Bruce declines with the double-entendre, “I feel ill.” Going to GothCorp
Back at the Batcave, Batman researches the accident and suspects a cover-up. He decides to return to GothCorp and access the personnel files. Alfred gives the ill crimefighter a thermos of chicken soup.
Disguised as a security guard, Batman finds the file on Victor Fries, including a videotape. On the tape, Fries explains his cryonics experiments may save people with terminal illnesses like his wife Nora, who is frozen in a chamber behind him.
Boyle and security guards enter the lab. Boyle complains funding for the project was cut weeks ago and orders the guards to disconnect Nora.
Fries seizes a guard’s gun and trains it on Boyle. The oleaginous CEO convinces Fries to lower the weapon, then kicks Fries in the chest. Fries tumbles backward into a lab table full of volatile chemicals. As a cold cloud fills the lab, Boyle and the guards flee. Fries collapses on the cryonic chamber, moaning his wife’s name.
Batman stops the video, exclaiming, “My god.” (Kevin Conroy makes this simple line carry the emotional weight of someone who now pities his adversary.)
The video caused Batman to miss Freeze standing behind him. Freeze remarks the tape would move him to tears, if he still had tears to shed. Freeze then blasts Batman with his freeze gun.
At Freeze’s hideout, Batman’s utility belt is removed; he is hung upside down (not unlike Luke Skywalker in the Wampa cave in “Empire.”) Freeze readies his new freezing cannon to attack Boyle’s award ceremony. He confirms Batman’s deduction that his suit preserves the subzero temperature he now needs to live.
Batman invokes the innocents who may be killed in the revenge plot. Freeze replies, “Think of it, Batman. To never again walk on a summer’s day with a hot wind in your face, and a warm hand to hold. Oh yes … I’d kill for that.” Batman Frees Himself
After Freeze leaves, Batman free himself using a large icicle. Meanwhile, Freeze deploys his cannon to create a wall of ice climbing the high-rise where the awards ceremony is being held. Batman arrives, disabling the cannon and regaining his utility belt. Freeze opens a fire hydrant and uses his freeze gun to ride a pillar of ice to the top floor of the building.
Freeze confronts Boyle during the ceremony, freezing his legs. Boyle begs for his life. Freeze refers to his nightmares, where Nora begs him with frozen eyes. Freeze adds, “How I’ve longed to see that look frozen on you.”
Batman attacks Freeze but is viciously thrown against a window; Freeze’s exoskeleton triples his strength. Freeze lifts Batman slightly above him, but the Caped Crusader breaks Alfred’s thermos of chicken soup on Freeze’s helmet. The temperature differential cracks and shatters the helmet, paralyzing the villain upon exposure to room temperature.
Freeze sputters that he has been denied justice, but Batman tells the assembled guests what Boyle did to Fries. The Caped Crusader also provides the videotape of the incident to Summer Gleeson. He sarcastically calls Boyle a “humanitarian” before leaving without freeing Boyle from the ice.
Later at Arkham Asylum, Freeze sits in a cold storage cell, begging the Nora figurine to forgive his failure.
While “Heart of Ice” is an episode with few flaws, it is possible to nitpick. In the comics, Freeze likely would have killed the injured henchmen to prevent him from providing information; such are the limits of a show primarily targeted at young people. Also, for all of the quality animation in this episode, the accumulation of ice is achieved through dissolves, which is cheaper but not particularly elegant. But these are nitpicks, given the artistic achievement in almost every other respect. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois."

Sometimes, babies are born alive following an attempted abortion . According to the Centers for Disease Control and some states , it could be potentially hundreds of babies each year. And state laws don’t always fully protect them.
Now, some states are proposing laws to expand abortion and to remove existing specific protections for babies who are born alive after surviving an attempted abortion. Without these protections, more newborns could be killed or left alone to die.
Sen. Ben Sasse introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act in the Senate, to make sure babies born alive after abortion are treated the same as any other newborn baby.
But the Senate didn’t pass it.
And efforts to bring the bill to a vote in the House are being stonewalled .
But there is still hope that the bill could pass—with a gutsy move that only happens rarely in Congress.
Two representatives, Rep. Ann Wagner and Rep. Steve Scalise, filed a discharge petition Tuesday, which could force House leadership to move the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to the House floor for a vote.
Two-hundred and eighteen representatives, a majority of Congress, need to sign the petition.
That is why discharge petitions rarely happen. Because it’s hard to get most of Congress to agree on anything, or change the status quo.
But the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act bill has a chance. Because a lot of people are angry about little babies being left alone on a table to die.
If the House of Representatives votes on and passes the bill, it would put significant pressure on senators who voted against the bill to reconsider their vote.
And then it could pass the Senate—and be signed into law by the president.
And many little babies could be saved!
Maybe we could all take a page from the Delta Nus, and give our representatives a piece of our minds.
Republican or Democrat, everyone should speak up for babies in need!

In 2015, just 62 individuals possessed more wealth than the poorest half of all people on earth. Recently Credit Suisse stated that the richest one percent have now accumulated more wealth than the rest of all the other people on earth all added together.
Corporations of mercenaries are presently available for anyone to rent if you have the vast sums of money required. War is now for sale on the open market. War has become a commodity that any super rich individual can purchase. There are a lot of super rich billionaires who can purchase a mercenary military force to act in their behalf.
Private mercenary forces now allow all of the men and women listed as billionaires on Forbe’s list of billionaires to become the Supreme Commander of their own military. The World Bank states that the top one hundred economies consist of 31 countries and 69 corporations. Walmart has the tenth largest economy in the world. Can anyone really believe that the Central African Republic or Haiti have more influence in the world just because they are countries ?
Will ExxonMobil purchase its’ own military and take over smaller countries or regions of countries ? It makes great sense for ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP to have their own armies. After all, the corporations have been dealing with extremely corrupt governments for decades. Wouldn’t it be easier for these corporations to own certain countries ?
In 2013, terrorists attacked a gas facility in Algeria operated by two international oil companies. It would not have happened if the corporations had mercenary armies guarding their property.
By 2020, megacorporations and the elite global billionaires will own their own mercenary armies and it will be legal. Shareholders will demand this and expect this. A Chinese oil company has already hired mercenaries in South Sudan. Many other corporations will follow this trend.
Organized criminals can become superpowers by hiring mercenaries with attack helicopters and other advanced weapons systems. Narco states and regions exist throughout Latin America and West Africa. In Mexico, over 11 thousand people were killed in drug related violence in the first half of 2017 ! Terrorist groups like al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, and al-Queda will pay anti-Western mercenaries to help in their global jihad.
The British East India Company founded in 1600 became the greatest corporation in history. The company was a corporate raider and a corporate murderer serving the British Crown for 275 years.
By 2020, Mexico will be at war. There will be a number of mercenary armies fighting each other and the ineffective government of Mexico. The Sinaloa drug cartel was run by ” El Chapo ” Guzman. With Guzman in jail in the U.S. the bloody war for control of all of Mexico is getting bloodier.
Twenty-seven of Mexico’s 31 states recorded increases in murders. Farmers in Michoacán decided to fight back and won several victories over the cartel members. Vigilantes have become mercenary groups. It is estimated that by 2026, Mexico will be divided into six or seven separate states. Many will die in the Mexican Civil Terror funded by mercenaries, drug cartels, and elitest billionaires and megacorporations.

"State Rep. Sedrick Denson Pleads Guilty to Lesser Charge, Lawyer Claims It's 'Not a Sweetheart Deal'",tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/state-rep-sedrick-denson-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charge-lawyer-claims-its-not-a-sweetheart-deal/ ,"State Rep. Sedrick Denson (D-Bond Hill) pleaded guilty Thursday to having physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a lesser charge than the OVI he initially faced.
Under a plea agreement, charges of driving on a suspended license and driving outside of marked lanes were dropped. The freshman lawmaker will be required to complete a driver’s intervention program, pay a $250 fine and court fees, and will face an 180-day driver’s license suspension, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer .
Denson, who had a single Adderall pill in his car when he was pulled over, still faces felony drug possession charges.
“This isn’t a sweetheart deal,” attorney Brandon Shroy said of the plea agreement. “This is a normal outcome.”
“My advice to him was that this is a case I don’t believe the state of Ohio could prove,” Shroy added . “But in this case, he accepted the offer to get back to his work and stop being on the news for this.”
Denson maintains that he’s “not prescribed” Adderall and does “not use” the drug.
“The fact that it was in my vehicle is concerning and very serious,” he said. Denson will appear back in court on April 15 for the pending drug possession charge. If he’s found guilty of a felony, he wouldn’t be allowed to serve as a state representative.
As The Ohio Star previously reported , Denson was pulled over March 29 in the early morning hours and was charged with driving under the influence. Dash-cam video of the arrest showed Denson repeatedly telling officers that he was a “state representative.”
Denson released a statement on Monday to apologize to his constituents, but denied being impaired.
“I performed several tests during the traffic stop at the trooper’s direction. Although I felt I was not impaired, I was arrested for driving my car while under the influence. I regret refusing further testing that would have established that I was not impaired,” he said. “More than anything, I want to apologize and express my regret to people who feel disappointed by my actions. I share their disappointment.”

Smoking Age Will Jump to 21 Under DeWine Budget,tennesseestar.com,Andrew Shirley,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/smoking-age-will-jump-to-21-under-dewine-budget/ ,"In a move to improve health quality in the state, Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has included a provision in his proposed 2020-2021 Executive Budget that would increase the age for purchasing cigarettes from 18 to 21. The intent is to further discourage the use of cigarettes overall throughout the Buckeye State.
Governor DeWine’s proposed budget was officially released on March 15. Outlined in the Executive Budget:
The fiscal years 2020-2021 Executive Budget proposes an important change to the cigarette and OTP taxes. The Budget would change Ohio law by increasing the minimum legal age – from age 18 to age 21 – for purchasing cigarettes, other tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, and cigarette papers. Although the proposed age increase does not constitute a change in how these products are taxed, it would reduce the quantity of purchased items because of the age change and therefore result in a modest decline in cigarette and OTP tax revenue.
By the governor’s own assessment , the move would cut cigarette revenues by more than $20 million over the two year budget period. Despite this, a 2017 poll found that 58 percent of Ohioans favor this change. The measure has significant precedent throughout the country.
A report from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free kids revealed that, as of April 2, 2019, Arkansas, California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oregon, Hawaii, Maine, Utah, and Virginia have all moved the age to buy cigarettes to 21.
In addition, more than 450 localities have done the same. Currently in Ohio, 21 localities have made the shift, and those are: Akron, Bexley, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, Columbus, Dublin, Euclid, Grandview Heights, Green, Kent, Lakewood, Mogadore, New Albany, Norton, Powell, Richfield, Twinsburg, Upper Arlington, Wickliffe, and Worthington.
While smoking has been on the decline in recent years, the provision would also affect a new product whose demand is increasing exponentially. The ban specifically includes “alternative nicotine products,” such as vape pens, e-cigarettes, and other vaping products.
According to the National Institute of Health, teenagers and young American are using vape products in record numbers. Almost 20 percent of high school seniors are currently vaping. While vape users insist their product is a safe and healthy alternative to smoking, there is not a scientific consensus on its safety. The hope is that the hike will not only cut back smoking in the Buckeye State but also curb the use of vape pens.
An early 2019 report by the American Lung Association gave Ohio low marks for lung health. Specifically, it graded Ohio as follows:
Funding for State Tobacco Prevention Programs – Grade F
Strength of Smoke free Workplace Laws – Grade A
Level of State Tobacco Taxes – Grade F
Coverage and Access to Services to Quit Tobacco – Grade C
Minimum Age of Sale for Tobacco Products to 21 – Grade F
This gives Ohio a Lung Health GPA of 1.2. Should this measure be enacted, the Ohio GPA would jump to a 2.0. Still less than ideal, at least it would be a passing grade for the Buckeye State.

Ohio's Lt. Gov. Husted Named as Director of Another Top State Office,tennesseestar.com,Anthony Gockowski,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/lt-gov-husted-named-as-director-of-another-top-state-office/ ,"Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted was named director of the Governor’s Office of Workforce Transformation, a role he will take on in addition to his capacity as director of InnovateOhio.
Gov. Mike DeWine announced the appointment during a Thursday Cabinet meeting, saying he was “pleased” to have Husted “serve as the point person for Ohio’s workforce development efforts.”
“It is so important that we continue to invest in our state’s most valuable asset—our workforce, and Lt. Gov. Husted will ensure that our efforts in this area are focused and deliver results,” DeWine said, according to a press release .
In his new role, Husted will oversee 75 different workforce development programs across 12 state agencies, and will report directly to the governor. The position was previously occupied by Ryan Burgess, but he stepped down after being appointed director of cabinet affairs for DeWine.
“Ohio’s economy has a lot of things working in its favor right now, but if we are going to reach our full potential and make our state more attractive to new businesses, we have to close our skills gap,” said Husted, who worked as vice president of the Dayton-area Chamber of Commerce before entering public office.
“If we get this right, we will give job creators the talent they need to expand and we’ll give Ohioans more personal opportunity and the chance to grow their career,” he added.
As The Ohio Star reported , Husted’s role of overseeing InnovateOhio allowed him to take a $176,426 salary in lieu of the lieutenant governor’s $113,900 salary. The pay increase was made possible under a December 2018 bill. The bill stated that “if the governor appoints the lieutenant governor as an administrative department head or as the head of an office within the office of the governor,” he may “accept the salary for that office while serving as its head.”
Technically, this means Husted can accept the salary for whichever of his three roles pays the highest—lieutenant governor, director of InnovateOhio, or director of workforce transformation. It doesn’t appear that his new position will come with a pay raise.
