Collusion was ""admitted"" to by senior Trum Campaign personnel and Trump himself over a year ago... Just becaue it is not a crime does not mean it didn't happen... I will give you an easy example... Trump met with Putin and has kept what was discussed in that meeting a secret to this day... That is the basic definition of collusion... People collude all the time... People planning a surprise party for someone is collusion... WHY is it you people ""choose"" ignorace and refuse to acknowledge these facts... Collusion is not a crime and the Trump Tower meeting was a flop so there was no ""conspiracy"" (which is a cime) so Mueller let the collusion go, even though it was ""admitted"" to... Look up the definition of collusion and you will find that it did happen and that the Trump meeting with Putin makes it colludng with a Russian any way you choose to spin it..."

That group is composed of six former Trump advisers, 26 Russian nationals, three Russian companies, one California man, and one London-based lawyer. Eight of these people (including six former Trump aides) have already pleaded guilty. From phishing attacks to gain access to Democratic operatives, to money laundering, to attempts to break into state elections boards, the indictment details a vigorous and complex effort by Russia’s top military intelligence service to sabotage the campaign of Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton."

For lack of a better term, what we can call (Trump) Towergate* finally reached the point that Watergate did on the evening of the Saturday Night Massacre, albeit by different legal paths. While this did not flip public opinion overnight, it began the of process--the steady, then accelerating, drip, drip, drip of ever more serious revelations--that drove Nixon from office. The Mueller Report is a veritable cornucopia of bread crumbs that open up new avenues of investigation for the M$M, the internet, and interested citizens, to explore, which are being busily--if not franticly--pursued as i type and you read. And as with all such scandals--Bush's torture memos, Clinton's sexcapades, Reagan's Iran/Contra, and Tricky's Watergate--99% of what happens is never good for the sitting president. Buckle up, pumpkin; it's going to be a bumpy ride. *aka, 'stupid Watergate'"
