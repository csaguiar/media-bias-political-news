Trump Ready To Force Transparency In Healthcare Pricing With An Executive Order,www.forbes.com,Joshua Cohen,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2019/05/27/trump-ready-to-force-transparency-in-healthcare-pricing-with-an-executive-order/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Healthcare I write about drug value, market access, and healthcare systems Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin President Donald Trump answers a question from a member of the media during a signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 10, 2018. President Trump signed two bills, the Know the Lowest Price Act and the Patients' Right to Know Drug Prices Act, which promote greater transparency in pharmaceutical drug pricing. Photographer: Zach Gibson/Bloomberg © 2018 Bloomberg Finance LP The Trump Administration wants to make it easier for patients and employers to comparison shop for healthcare. On transparency, one can't fault the Administration for not trying.
So far, the measures implemented have mostly been baby steps. But, this is about to change as President Trump is expected to soon release an executive order on healthcare price transparency . If enacted, this executive order would mandate disclosure of prices throughout the healthcare industry, and be enforceable by federal agencies. It would provide patients and employers pricing data that reflect the negotiated rates between insurers, hospitals, and physicians.
In the lead-up to this week's expected announcement on the executive order, the Trump Administration has been gradually chipping away to uncover the murky world of healthcare pricing. For example, in October 2018, President Trump signed two bills into law, the Know the Lowest Price Act and the Patients' Right to Know Drug Prices Act. These bills removed pharmacy gag clauses , imposed by pharmacy benefit managers, which had prevented pharmacists from proactively telling consumers if their prescription would cost less if they paid for it out-of-pocket rather than using their insurance plan.
And, this month, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements of prescription drugs on television will soon be required to include price information.
Nonetheless, the pharmacy gag clause bills and requirement to include list price information in DTC advertisements only incrementally address prescription drug price transparency. A much bigger step would be to overhaul the prescription drug rebate system, as proposed by HHS. However, it's unclear whether and when that will happen.
Ultimately, drug price transparency alone won't be sufficient to create conditions conducive to a competitive market. It needs to be coupled with dissemination of information on which medications are the most effective for specific conditions or diseases. There have been a number of efforts in the commercial sector to address this issue; MedSavvy , for example, which is a Cambia Health Solutions company. Regence Blue Cross and Blue Shield offers MedSavvy to its customers. The federal government is also supporting initiatives to improve the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's publication of usable information on comparative effectiveness to consumers. But it's been a very slow process with few tangible results thus far.
The Trump Administration has also focused on disseminating information regarding the quality of physician practices that serve Medicare beneficiaries. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) established a website called Physician Compare . However, nearly 80% of physicians aren't included in the website database. Reporting is voluntary, and so there's selection bias when it comes to the performance data that do appear. Moreover, the website doesn't include a comparison of fees for physician services.
Beginning January 1st this year, the federal government is requiring every hospital in the U.S. to post lists of prices of services and technologies online. Such lists are known in the industry as ""chargemasters"" that comprise of prices of thousands of services and products for which a hospital may bill.
But, CMS acknowledges it is not yet enforcing the hospital pricing rule. Furthermore, implementation of the rules has sparked a debate about whether the price lists are creating more confusion than clarity among patients. Services and products are identified in acronyms, abbreviations, billing codes, and medical terminology that most consumers can't be expected to understand.
Additionally, the chargemaster lists don't normally reflect actual transaction charges because hospitals and insurers generally negotiate significantly lower prices. And, hospitals and insurers are resisting public disclosure of negotiated prices. This week's expected announcement of an executive order may make such resistance a moot point.
Most patients don't comparison shop for medical care. Some might not be in a position to do so. Others may simply balk. Perhaps this is due in large part to patients not being used to comparison shopping, or to the opaque character of pricing in the healthcare system. As more useful information becomes available, perhaps patients will begin to do more comparison shopping. which in turn will lead to a more competitive market.

How the Gulf's appetite for shisha is fuelling one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the world,www.forbes.com,Dominic Dudley,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2019/05/27/how-the-gulfs-appetite-for-shisha-is-fuelling-one-of-the-deadliest-terrorist-groups-in-the-world/,"Someone relaxing in a Persian Gulf café by smoking a shisha pipe may not realise it, but the burning coals carefully placed on top of the hookah to heat the tobacco are not just fuelling their pleasure; they are also helping to fund a campaign of violence in one of the world’s poorest countries. Globally, Al-Shabaab may not be as infamous as the likes of Islamic State, Al-Qaeda or the Taliban, but the Somali-based organisation is one of the four deadliest terrorist groups in the world.
The militant group first came to prominence in the summer of 2006, as an Al-Qaeda affiliate. Since then it has taken on an identity all of its own and been responsible for a campaign of deadly attacks in Somalia and in neighbouring countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda. In 2017 it was responsible for the worst terrorist attack anywhere in the world, when a suicide bomber killed 587 people by detonating a truck laden with explosives outside a hotel in the Somali capital Mogadishu.

Behind its campaign of violence lies a sophisticated financing network based, in part, on trade in charcoal. According to the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea, the charcoal trade continues to be “a significant source of revenue ” for Al-Shabaab, generating at least $7.5m from taxes at checkpoints in the Middle Juba and Lower Juba regions of Somalia where the charcoal is produced.
The charcoal in question comes from acacia trees and is prized in the Gulf because it burns for longer than charcoal from other sources. As well as helping to fill Al-Shabaab’s coffers, the trade risks environmental damage to Somalia, with millions of trees being felled to produce it.
Such is the demand that, according to estimates from the Somalia Water and Land Information Management project of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, a tree was cut down to produce charcoal at a rate of one every 30 seconds between 2011 and 2017. An estimated 3.6 million bags of charcoal were produced in 2017, with Al-Shabaab thought to levy a tax of around $2.50 per bag as it is transported to the port towns of Buur Gaabo and Kismayo (where each bag fetches between $9 and $11).
Export volumes from those two ports vary between 300,000 and 600,000 bags a month, attracting a further tax of $5 a bag levied by the authorities there, which generates more than $15m in annual revenue for the Jubbaland administration.
Gulf counties are the key export market and, by the time the cargo reaches the ports there, the wholesale price of the bags has risen to around $50 each, meaning the total market value of Somali charcoal exports was around $150m a year in 2017.
Restricting the trade
The trade has been evolving though. Between November 2017 and February 2018 most exports went to Oman, where they were unloaded at Duqm and Shinas ports. But since March that year, Oman has been clamping down on the trade. That month it seized the Al Azhar 3 dhow and its cargo of 37,000 bags of charcoal, a move which forced the dhows which are used to transport the charcoal to find other ports.
In place of Oman, the dhows have been sailing on to the Kish and Qeshm free zones in Iran. A complex process has developed there, with false certificates of origin being used to claim the charcoal comes from the Comoros, Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia or Ghana. It is then repacked in the Iranian free zones into bags labelled ‘produce of Iran’, given a second set of false certificates of origin and then reexported on Iranian dhows to Hamriyah port in Dubai.
The UN Monitoring Group said in its report released last year that it had written to the authorities in both Iran and the UAE to discuss the trade, but found them uncooperative.
Nonetheless, there have clearly been some improvements in restricting the trade and the Monitoring Group estimates that charcoal exports from Somalia have recently declined from 4 million bags a year to 3 million bags. Compared to figures from other sources, the Monitoring Group's latest estimates suggest a clear decline in the value of the trade. As recently as 2014, some were estimating the value of the trade at $384m . Back then, a single roadblock in the Badhaadhe district of Lower Juba was said to be collecting $8m-18m a year by taxing passing charcoal traffic, with Al-Shabaab believed to be retaining about a third of that.
Beyond the Omani efforts, there have been a number of signs of at least a partial clampdown in the Gulf. In May 2017, a consignment was also confiscated by the Kuwait Coastguard in what was believed to be the first such seizure in the Gulf. In March 2018, the UAE authorities seized the cargo of the Zazel 2 which had docked at Hamriyah port with what it claimed was a consignment of Gambian charcoal.
However, while there has been some cooperation from Oman and, to a lesser extent, the UAE, more needs to be done and the Monitoring Group reported last year that Iran “has been a weak link in implementation”.

Getty Financial controls
Charcoal is not the only source of income for Al-Shabaab. It has developed a sophisticated taxation system in areas it controls and it has also been involved in sugar smuggling .
While much of these things are fairly well documented, the response of governments from around the region and beyond has often been underwhelming. The UN banned the charcoal trade in 2012, but Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that international efforts to undermine Al-Shabaab’s finances have veered between half-hearted and non-existent.
However, he said in a recent commentary , that there are lessons to be learned from the experience in clamping down on the financial apparatus of Islamic State, which shares many similarities with Al-Shabaab. Among other things, both terrorist groups have tried to take and hold territory and Islamic State’s international trade was also focused on the sale of fuel, in its case crude oil and refined products (as well as looted antiquities ).
At the heart of the successful campaign against Islamic State’s funding was the decision by neighbouring countries to cooperate in the programme to identify and restrict the group’s funding sources. “A similar strategy is urgently needed in and around Somalia if the unchecked sources of funding of Al-Shabaab are ever to be addressed,” wrote Keatinge.
However, at the moment, that cooperation is in many ways missing. “The response of states to the group’s financing remains muted,” he added.
Among the measures he has proposed are for the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force and other global forums on counter terror financing to expand their current focus on Islamic Sate and Al-Qaeda to include the likes of Al-Shabaab. He also called for the UN’s Panel of Experts on Somalia to be given greater support from international powers and for a new taskforce to be set up with the job of disrupting Al-Shabaab’s finances."
Changing The Housing Debate Part 1: Housing Is Not A Right,www.forbes.com,Roger Valdez,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogervaldez/2019/05/27/series-1/,"No Smoking Sign
Getty “The work of epidemiology is related to unanswered questions, but also to unquestioned answers.” -- Patricia Buffler, University of California, “ Science, Skepticism, and Society: The Role of Epidemiology ”
ADVERTISEMENT More than a decade ago I was derisively called the “Tobacco Tsar” by a weekly newspaper in Seattle. The sobriquet was given because my job at the time was to manage the county’s efforts to reduce the use and resulting mortality from mass marketed corporate tobacco products. The antagonism was of the weird and disappearing bent that smoking is somehow a “right.” Of course smoking isn't a right except in the conference rooms of giant ad agencies that skillfully wedded the addiction associated with smoking to being a consumer choice and an excuse for inaction. In case you need more on the topic, read how the Public Health Law Center demolishes the notion that smoking is a Constitutional right .
I mention this part of my past because I’m now fighting the notion that housing is a “right,” an equally stubborn abuse of language but in the case of housing, deployed for a political not marketing purpose. Without engaging in an extended exposition above my skill set, it would be enough to say that there are rights established explicitly by law, those that are established by precedent by courts, and third, those behaviors and things that groups aspire to make one of the first two.
Even once so established, rights are attenuated by interpretation over time; speech, for example, the right most Americans would cite as bedrock, is limited to time and place by precedent. But still, enshrining something as a right — even if only rhetorically — has become the bullhorn of left leaning activists even while race remains a dog whistle for the extreme right.
But housing, like smoking and many other things, is not a right. The Fair Housing Act banned discrimination when providing housing or making housing policy, but it did not allocate a 500 square foot unit or guarantee automatic qualification for a mortgage. Housing has remained, to the chagrin of many, a commodity. And if it somehow ends up being the case that housing does become enshrined as an explicit right or a right by extension, one thing won’t change; when housing is scarce it’s price will go up. Markets solve this problem with innovation that is blind to winners and losers, while socialists rely on rationing to pick winners and losers based on criteria set by bureaucrats. Either way, when demand exceeds supply real people suffer from higher prices than consume their incomes, or waiting lists that consume their hope.
Setting all this aside, how do we comprehensively solve the problem of housing scarcity? First, we have to acknowledge that today’s housing debate, regrettably, isn’t about housing at all, but about many other issues and problems that housing policy didn’t cause and will never solve. At most, an efficient housing policy would contribute to ending generational poverty and provide respite for those trying to recover from addiction, mental illness, or incarceration while easing inflation for those with money to spend on housing. At a minimum, a good housing policy would maximize the benefits of private risk for public benefit, getting out of the way of buyer and seller so that price signals would push lower cost product while also creating attractive economic return for investors.
Today, housing policy is gripped by socialist views and deep suspicion of the profit motive. This gives inefficient non-profit producers an advantage; they are believed as the experts on all housing, even though they produce a very small portion of it at huge costs. Politicians also face anger from constituents who worry that their own private investment in their single-family home will be put at risk by a deregulated housing economy. Homeowners have a monopoly on land use, and non-profits on the imagination of policy makers. So politicians say we need more affordable housing, when what we really need is more housing so that it is affordable . Meanwhile, homeowners win while scarcity pushes up the value of their investment.
ADVERTISEMENT In the next few posts I’m going to describe the steps we need to take to restore appropriate expectations of housing policy and the debate about it and then offer some ideas that could actually help solve many of issues faced by people who are trying to make ends meet — including their monthly rent payment. I’ll include an idea to substantially address what we generally call homelessness. Finally, I’ll offer a path to shift the conversation away from using housing as a battle ground for protectionism by angry neighbors worried about change and socialists bent on seeing chaos in the housing market to show “markets don’t work.” Housing is, will continue to be, and should remain a commodity. The notion that housing is a right is a distraction from putting all our energy into production of more housing of all kinds, everywhere for people of all levels of income.
This may sound ambitious. But all the elements for good housing policy are in plain sight. We are missing political will, a curious press, and a real estate industry that can’t see beyond the edge of a spreadsheet. I can’t solve those problems with blog posts. Only real inspired leadership, or someone tired of the stasis of the debate, can accomplish that.
Today, it’s hard to find a bar or restaurant in the United States that allows smoking, even in red states. Even parks are smoke free, and the smoking age is rising to 21. That took decades from the Surgeon General’s report in 1964 based on the science confirming that smoking is a killer. I’m resigned to that same time frame for housing, but encouraged by the possibility I might live long enough to see that kind of change happen in housing policy.
Read more about it: The discussion about rights, what is or is not a right, and where rights come, from is a very American one. One way to approach this issue is to ask, ""Do we need a deontological framework for ethics and morals to be free, or can we rely on history and each other to 'do the right thing,"" and is that the same as being free?"" In the housing debate one often hears, ""housing is a human right"" or ""people are entitled to housing."" Why do we need this formulation? Rights and entitlements end up being about power, while the basic question of how do we lower prices is a far more pragmatic and simple one. One of the best articles I've read on this area is by Joseph William Singer, The Player and the Cards: Nihilism and Legal Theory . If you're interested in a long but spellbinding read about how we can be both ethical and pragmatic follow this rabbit.
ADVERTISEMENT Also, it is interesting to note that many of the Founders were dubious of the Bill of Rights. Consider Hamilton's Federalist 84.
"" I go further, and affirm, that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done, which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? ""

A Farm That Teaches Low-Income Kids About Food Deserts -- And Self-Sufficiency,www.forbes.com,Anne Field,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2019/05/27/a-farm-that-teaches-low-income-kids-about-food-deserts-and-self-sufficiency/,"When he was a grad student at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro a few years ago, Kamal Bell researched food deserts. And his work led him to vow that, after graduating from the school, which he also attended as an undergraduate, he’d try to do something about these low-income urban areas where residents can’t buy fresh, high-quality food—a problem, he realized, that was deeply rooted and systemic. “Instead of complaining about the issue, I wanted to give back, to help people alleviate the problem,” he says. Bell moved back to Durhamin 2015 and became a teacher, while also working on a plan. He’d start a farm, a real working establishment, but the goal would be to accept a group of middle and high school age male black students, whom he would teach all about growing their own fresh, healthy produce. “We’d teach kids heavily affected by the system of food deserts, giving them the power to learn how to create healthy food for themselves,” says Bell. He told Marcus Miller, a college friend who was in Atlanta, about it, and Miller agreed to team up.
So in 2016 they started Sankofa Farms , a 12-acre farm in Cedar Grove, NC., that grows a variety of produce and also cultivates chicken, quail and duck eggs. (They're currently working on two of those acres). And they developed a curriculum to teach students about everything from team work to the problem of food deserts, plus beekeeping, chicken coop mending, operating tractors, tilling the land and building animal pens, to name a few duties.
Miller, who works as a financial analyst at GE, takes care of business matters and makes quarterly visits to help with day-to-day operations and programming.
The farm was just awarded a $2,900 grant to increase their honey bee production and buy equipment with which they can grow produce year-round.
While Sankofa's approach to food deserts is unusual, it isn't the only enterprise trying to address the problem. For example, in West Oakland, Calif., entrepreneur Brahm Ahmadi has engaged in a multi-year effort to form Community Foods Market , a full-service grocery store.
The Sankofa program takes six 11-to-16-year old students, who work at the farm year-round — specifically every other weekend while the kids are in school, plus breaks. During summer vacation, they're there weekdays. Most, though not all, of the students are from low-income families.
Ultimately, Bell doesn’t expect the kids to become farmers; he wants to give them the tools to do what they want with their lives and also bypass the food desert trap, becoming self-sufficient. “They’re doing this because they love the work and they want to see changes in their community,” says Bell.
This year, for the first time, according to Bell, the farm has yielded enough crops for students not only to take the food home, but also to sell it. Miller is using the opportunity to teach the kids basic lessons in financial literacy. (Ultimately, Bell wants to start a school with an agricultural focus). In addition, word about the program has started getting around, and Bell and Miller have had to turn applicants away. A good problem to have.

The other all-Premier League final is set for Saturday, in Madrid, with Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur vying for the Champions League title. At stake for Chelsea is another European trophy to add to the other five won since 1971. For Arsenal, making it a hattrick of European trophies is very much secondary to the automatic qualifying spot to the 2019/20 Champions League group stage that goes with winning the Europa League.
Chelsea has no such pressure having finished 3rd in the Premier League, Arsenal was 5th, two points fewer than Chelsea.
It could be the last game in charge of Chelsea for Maurizio Sarri - whether he will be fired or he joins Juventus, ]}has still to be decided.

Chelsea striker Eden Hazard could also be bringing the curtain down on his Chelsea career. Hazard's contract is up in the summer of 2020 and so far he has shown no inclination to sign a new one.
Rather than losing Hazard to a ""Bosman"" transfer, a $120m move ]to Real Madrid this summer is a strong possibility.
The Arsenal squad needs new blood but who might move on is simply conjecture at the moment.
Given that the game is being played in far off Azerbaijan, both teams are well away from home. However, a home team in a game played at a neutral location is always designated, and in this case, it's Chelsea.
Where, when, and how can I watch
The game is being played in the Olympic Stadium in Baku, Azerbaijan on Wednesday, May 29, with an 11:00pm kick-off local time yes, one hour before midnight. That puts the start of the match at 3:00pm ET.
With a stadium capacity of over 68,000, there are tickets still available according to UEFA.com. Arsenal and Chelsea were allocated 6,000 tickets each, but the word is that it has not been an easy sell given the arduous trip and the costs. Nonetheless, local officials are confident of a good crowd.
In the US, you have a number of viewing options - TNT, UniMas, Univision Deportes Network, and fuboTV. Canadian viewers can watch on DAZN. First look inside Olympic Stadium Baku. Azerbaijan FA boss tells us:
- 60k crowd for #EuropaLeague final

Team news
Definitely missing for Chelsea through injury are Antonio Rudiger, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Midfielder and a World Cup winner with France, N'Golo Kante, is considered very doubtful after picking up a couple of injuries over the last few weeks.
Danny Welbeck is an unexpected addition to the Arsenal traveling squad having not played since breaking his ankle late in 2018 against Sporting Lisbon. Defender Rob Holding has missed most of this season after suffering a knee injury and won't return until the new season. Aaron Ramsey, Hector Bellerin, and Barcelona loanee, Denis Suarez are all injured and will not be considered.
Armenian Midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan has not made the trip on account of security concerns relating to the bitter political relations between his country and the host nation, Azerbaijan.
The biggest issue playing on the mind of Arsenal Coach Unai Emery is who to start in goal - Cech or Leno .
Chelsea and Arsenal in Europe
The two London clubs have only played each other once in European competition.
It was in 2004, the season of the Arsenal ""Invincibles."" Invincible in the Premier League but not in the Champions League.
After a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge in the first leg of the quarter-final of the Champions League, the aggregate score was 2-2 with extra time looking likely. But, up popped an unlikely scorer in the form of Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge to give Chelsea a 3-2 win. Chelsea went out in the semi-final round to Monaco.
Keep an eye on
Without Aubameyang or his striking partner, Alexander Lacazette, playing well it is difficult to see a way Arsenal can beat Chelsea. Lacazette and Aubameyang combined to score all of Arsenal's 7 goals in the semi-final against Valencia.
By the same token, the striking partnership of Aubamey and Lacazette could easily be undermined by an Arsenal defence that oft times is as useful as a chocolate teapot.
So for Arsenal to win Aubameyang, Lacazette and the defence need to play very well. If one or both doesn't turn up, the Europa League trophy will be adorned with blue ribbons.
Odds
Chelsea is the bookmakers favorite with odds from various sources coalescing around +140 (UK 7/5). Arsenal's odds are +200 (2/1) and a draw +225 (9/4). The over/under on 2.5 goals in the game is -117.65 (17/20).
FiveThirtyEight.com makes Chelsea the probable winner with a 60% chance.
Hold on, the goal is under review
Although VAR (Video Assistant Referee) has not been used in the Europa League to date, it will be up and running for the final. An all-Italian on-site officiating crew of Referee Gianluca Rocchi, Assistant Referees Filippo Meli and Lorenzo Manganelli, and 4th official Daniele Orsato will be in charge. The VAR crew is headed up by Massimiliano Irrati, also from Italy.
The Money
The legendary Swiss Ramble has crunched the numbers.
#AFC Europa League revenue is €36m for reaching the final, down from €38m last season.

The Trophy
The Trophy weighs 15kg so if there are any children around during the post-game celebrations, let's be careful. They may not get off as lightly as one of Cristiano Ronaldo's wee ones.

By the numbers
1 - Should Chelsea win, it will the first major trophy for Maurizio Sarri.
3 - If UEFA ever considers renaming the Europa League trophy they may want to ponder the name, Unai Emery. The Arsenal coach has already won the competition three times (2013–14 , 2014–15 , 2015–16 ) with Sevilla. Emery has been involved in 73 Europa League matches with the next nearest manager at 52.
5- Surprisingly, given the high-wire act that is the defence, it is the number of clean sheets posted by Arsenal in the Europa League this season.
7 - The number of assists recorded by Chelsea's Willian in this edition of the Europa League.
8 - The goals scored by Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in this season's Europa League.
10 - The goals scored by Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud, who is the joint top scorer in this season's Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt's Luka Jovic.
11 - The number of Europa League games this season won by both Arsenal and Chelsea. However, Chelsea is unbeaten having drawn 3.
17 - The number of games unbeaten in the competition by Chelsea and it is a record. The streak started in April 2013.
93 - The minutes on the clock when Ivanovic scored the winning goal for Chelsea in the 2013 Europa League final against Benfica.
What a journey it’s been so far…
Let’s go that one step further

"Have $10,000 Per Night To Spend On A Cruise Ship?",www.forbes.com,Debbi Kickham,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/debbikickham/2019/05/27/have-10000-per-night-to-spend-on-a-cruise-ship/,"The truth is, you can easily spend that much when you sail on the Regent Seven Seas Explorer , widely acknowledged as the most luxurious cruise ship in the world. If you have deep pockets, your money would be well-spent on booking the unique Regent Suite – which costs $10,000 per night. The indescribably beautiful suite comes with a bevy of beautiful extras, making it one of the world’s most superb accommodations at sea. It’s the crown jewel of the cruise line. Located on the highest deck, you will enjoy immaculate views of the horizon, whether you’re standing in your private garden – or just relaxing on your hand-crafted Savoir bed.
What’s a Savoir bed, you ask? They were first created for the Savoy Hotel in 1905, where for more than 100 years luminaries as diverse as Sir Winston Churchill, Giacomo Puccini and Marilyn Monroe experienced their cloud-like comfort. They are handmade in the UK, of the finest natural materials and skilled craftsmanship to create the ultimate sleeping system.
You heard that right. It’s a sleeping system . Each bed requires more than 120 hours’ of work. The mattress is filled with extra deep-pocket springs, masses of loose, curled horse-tail hair, and double layers of lambs’ wool. Along with the bed, your Regent Suite features a heavenly 100% down duvet crafted with eiderdown from Iceland. Then comes a set of “Double Touch of Down” bed pillows with small whole feathers on the inside for a comfortable touch. The feathers are what is known as Hyperclean Down, meaning that they are free of dust, dirt and allergies.
But it doesn’t stop there. Just to make sure that you are cradled in cocoon-like comfort, each Regent Suite guest can choose their favorite bed linens. These include a bamboo collection made with organic cotton; exceptionally soft bedding made from cotton and tencel; 100% linen crafted in Portugal; plus a collection crafted in Italy of Egyptian cotton sateen. (Just writing this I’m snoozing already.)
Then come the comfort pillows. These include styles made with gel; water; memory foam; buckwheat hulls; and a tri-sided anatomic pillow to reduce snoring, insomnia and lumbar pain.
Inside the suite, you can also take advantage of FREE, UNLIMITED spa services from the Canyon Ranch SpaClub on board. May I suggest the ageless oxygen boost facial; the Diamond Massage with Damask rose absolute; or a simple reflexology to soothe your toes after hours of sightseeing? (In fact, one Regent Suite couple once brought their own massage bed.)
Your 4,443-sq.ft. home-away-from-home also includes walls of windows, a grand piano, and your choice of aromatics to perfume the air inside with your selected scent. These are crafted by Antica Officina del Farmacista, and inspired by the fragrances of Florence and Tuscany. There are three to choose. Acqua contains notes of basil leaves and white musk. Aria consists of lemon and orange flowers. West contains green-tea essence. Your choice comes with an elegant reed diffuser to scent your surroundings. Just tell your butler – he also comes with the territory, and has been schooled by the Guild of Professional Butlers in London. He comes in very handy when you have dinner in your private restaurant on board. It’s called The Library, which can seat you and about eight more of your new-found friends on board. Now that's a party!
And let’s not forget the full-sized bath amenities, from your choice of Guerlain, L’Occitane, and Bottega Veneta. In the bathroom these is also a cream-of-the-cop Dyson hairdryer, so that hair styling is turbocharged and as easy as one-two-three.
And when it’s time to leave your suite – to take in the local sights – a personal car and a guide await you in port.
But trust me, with a suite such as this, the ultra-luxurious ship itself becomes the final destination."
Will Bermuda Be The New Hamptons This Summer?,www.forbes.com,Jordi Lippe-McGraw,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordilippemcgraw/2019/05/27/will-bermuda-be-the-new-hamptons-this-summer/,"How can the Hamptons compete with this? Hamilton Princess & Beach Club Memorial Day Weekend is here, and so is the start of summer vacation. For New Yorkers, that means heading out East on the weekends to soak up as much beach time and sunshine as possible. The only problem is, it can be a schlep to get there. But, one foreign luxury hotel is proposing a rather unique solution for the first time this year: book a summer share in Bermuda.
For the first time, Bermuda’s Hamilton Princess & Beach Club is launching a home sharing program this summer, a concept that’s very similar to what New Yorkers would do with the Hamptons. But, instead of dealing with agonizing Hamptons traffic and overcrowded share houses, you’ll jet out of New York City by 10 am, take a 90-minute flight, and can be on the beach by noon. You can get a summer share at the Hamilton Princess for under $1,000 a weekend. Hamilton Princess & Beach Club
Yes, the “Shades of Pink Suites,” program allows couples to book suites as their summer home for up to nine weekends of the season at a rate not offered ever before starting at $939 for a weekend. Also included in the one-of-a-kind share package is car service for arrival and departures, sunscreen and champagne upon arrival, reserved chairs at the pool and beach, and Exhale Spa barre classes.
Plus, so you don’t have to worry about lugging all of your beach gear each time you visit, the hotel offers luggage storage and full laundry services to leave behind what you don’t want to take home. And, no matter what room category you decide (the Gold Suite is the most expensive at $1,449 a weekend), you get lounge access where complimentary breakfast, coffee, and dessert. Get ready to gram. Hamilton Princess & Beach Club
And the hotel is a prime spot for FOMO-inducing social media pictures. Coined the “Pink Palace,” the Hamilton Princess has an iconic pink exterior, stunning views of the harbor (up to 60 yachts at a time dock there), and a world-class contemporary art collection featuring artists like Andy Warhol and Banksy.
Nearby at the Beach Club, you can lounge on a sandy beach that will put any Hampton’s beach to shame considering it’s located in a private cove with calm, crystal blue waters. There are even over-water hammocks that are perfect for an Instagram pic. The hotel is so confident they created something special, they coined the hashtag #HamiltonIsTheNewHamptons.

I Left My Kids in the Car Alone for a Few Minutes. You Won't Believe What Happened Next.,www.forbes.com,Art Carden,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/artcarden/2019/05/27/i-left-my-kids-in-the-car-alone-for-a-few-minutes-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next/,"Last night was taco night, and I had made a terrible mistake. I thought I had bought all the necessary provisions a few days before, but alas, I hadn't. My daughter reminded me that any taco night worth the name was going to require refried beans, so on our way back from an outing to the beach at Oak Mountain State Park, we stopped by Publix. I asked the kids if they wanted to go in with me or stay in the car. They all decided they wanted to stay in the car.
So I let them.
Now, if you form your ideas about risk based on what you read in the newspaper and what you see on the evening news, then you're perhaps rightly terrified about the risk we took. The streets and parking lots of America, after all, are crawling with kidnappers and sexual predators and murderers and worse just watching and waiting for you to let your guard down for just a second so they can come along and snatch up the kids. Media outlets are all too happy to recount every parent's worse nightmare in gruesome detail over and over and over again. It draws eyeballs and clicks.
I went into the store, found the refried beans with the help of a couple of people who were stocking shelves, paid for my purchase, and left. What I found when I returned to the parking lot will shock you.
The kids were still in the car. They hadn't been abducted. They hadn't even been approached by a stranger offering candy or asking for help finding a lost dog. They were telling each other spooky stories based in part on ""Goosebumps"" books we had been reading and videos they had been watching online.
The simple fact is that our kids are a lot safer than you might think based on what gets reported. Note the problem, though: people get their ideas about the risks they likely face from the news, but what makes something newsworthy is the fact that it's unlikely. The stories filling the headlines are ""man bites dog"" stories that are newsworthy precisely because they're rare. Could it happen? Yes, but that doesn't mean it's likely.
Is there some risk associated with leaving your kids in the parking lot while you run into the store to grab a couple of cans of beans? Of course there is, but it's so small that it's not worth much worry--and probably acceptable when one of the goals of good parenting is to help kids learn how to handle autonomy and independence. It's possible to be too careful , and indeed, driving to and from the beach and the store was almost certainly a much greater risk to the kids' health and safety--probably by orders of magnitude--than leaving them alone for a few minutes. So let your kids have some independence."
29-Year-Old Lorelei Ramirez Needs To Create,www.forbes.com,Rosa Escandon,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosaescandon/2019/05/27/29-year-old-lorelei-ramirez-needs-to-create/,"Lorelei Ramirez doesn’t mind pausing between jokes. In a performance taped last year for Paste Magazine, the audience hangs on the silence of each pregnant pause that Ramirez basks in. Ramirez doesn’t seem nervous, it’s quite the opposite. They control every moment on this stage. At 29, Ramirez, who uses they/them pronouns, has appeared on Vice, Comedy Central’s Up Next , and Adult Swim. Their comedy breaks formulaic norms and walks the line between comedy and performance art, likely because of their background in the arts. From Zines, to sketch comedy, to paintings, Ramirez has crafted a distinctive and striking style all their own.
Ramirez moved to New York to pursue art. They went to art school, originally for painting. “I'd always wanted to do comedy, but I was too shy,” Ramirez describes. In art school, they started becoming interested in performance art and video. Ramirez remembers, “I thought I'm a little bit more comfortable now. Maybe I should go and try [standup.]”
When they started comedy, it came at a point in their life when they felt they had nothing to lose. Breaking into the art world wasn’t working. “I came to New York to do painting and I found out later that you can only do this if you are a rich person or your parents are paying for stuff.” Ramirez continues, “I was dirt poor. So I thought I made a mistake. I got really sad about it and I was staying on friend's couches. I didn't have a place to live.”
In New York, Ramirez made a close group of friends from going to open mic nights. They also started directing and producing videos. While they started with sketch and comedy videos, they are currently directing a music video. Ramirez keeps busy. On top of the music video, they have an art show going up in Philadelphia, they are writing a solo show and they just accepted a new gig writing for TV, and working on their own pitches. It sounds overwhelming, but Ramirez doesn’t seem stressed about it. “I'm always working on a lot of things at the same time because I love it so much. It's the only thing that I know how to do,” Ramirez explains, “It's insane to me that I can make any money off of any of these things because I don't come from any money and I don't know how this happened, but I struggled a lot to get to this point. I’m very grateful about being in this position and I try to take advantage of it because there's really nothing else that I liked doing.”
Whether it’s art, poetry, videos, or comedy, creating things is highly important to Ramirez. “Just create because you want to and because you have to satisfy an impulse.”"
Bart Starr Defined True Greatness With Every Step He Took in the Game,www.forbes.com,Steve Silverman,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevesilverman/2019/05/27/bart-starr-defined-true-greatness-with-every-step-he-took-in-the-game/,"There have been quarterbacks with more yardage, touchdowns, completions, and even championships, but there has never been an NFL quarterback who led like Bart Starr. The all-time great quarterback who was the best player for the Green Bay Packers during their dynasty days under the legendary Vince Lombardi, died early Sunday.
I had the opportunity to interview Starr twice quite a few years after his playing career ended, and we talked on the subject of Lombardi, the great Packers’ teams of the 1960s and what it was like to rise from the ranks of a 17 th -round draft choice in 1956 and become one of the most memorable athletes of the 20 th century.
As a columnist and editor at Pro Football Weekly, I had a chance to talk to Starr and several of his former teammates about Lombardi, whom I have always looked at as the greatest coach in North American professional sports.
Much of that was due to my age, because the Packers engaged in their greatest football and achievements when I was just a boy who was falling for professional sports. In the mid-1960s, the Packers had my attention because they always found a way to beat the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, Los Angeles Rams, Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Colts and Dallas Cowboys, and any team that would dare challenge them.
There was something different about their preparation and their execution, and that always gave them the edge in the most important games. Lombardi got his team ready, and Starr delivered the biggest plays at the most important moments.
If that sounds a lot like Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, it should. Football may be much more complex and strategic than it was more than 50 years ago, but the parts about preparation and execution are the same.
When I spoke to Starr, I was hoping to gain his insight on what it was like to play for Lombardi, or at least to give me a bit more than the anecdotes that made it into popular culture.
Many know of Lombardi’s demanding ways during training camp and that he wanted his players to be in better shape than their opponents. While coaching during the 1960s, it was clear that Lombardi did not favor white players over black, and that was evidenced by defensive tackle Henry Jordan’s famous statement. “He treats us all the same – like dogs.”
Lombardi exerted his personality over every player on the team, but he only upbraided Starr in front of his teammates once.
Starr refused to allow Lombardi to criticize him, but he didn’t do it by challenging his coach’s strength, power or manhood. Instead, he used logic to convince him not to unleash any personal critiques against him.
Since Starr was the leader of his team, how could the other players respect him if he was criticized personally by the coach. His ability to lead would be compromised, and Lombardi realized his quarterback was right.
Starr did not have a problem with the great coach pointing out something he could have done better on the field, but he would not allow personal critiques.
Starr acknowledged his confrontation with Lombardi, but he downplayed it when I was talking to him. He pointed out how his coach listened to him, considered what he said and didn’t have that issue in further years.
However, guard Jerry Kramer explained that Starr had the guts and intensity to look his coach in the eye and tell him what he would not allow. “Lombardi would not have taken that from any other player, but he must have realized that Bart was right,” Kramer explained. “He never took anything out on Bart again.”
Starr led the Packers to the first two Super Bowl titles, but his most famous game and most famous play came in the Ice Bowl.
The Packers and Cowboys played the NFL Championship Game December 31, 1967 at Lambeau Field. The temperatures registered minus-15 degrees as the game got underway, and the conditions grew worse as the game progressed.
The visiting Cowboys played a brilliant game under the circumstances, as Tom Landry and the Dallas Doomsday defense had largely shut the Packers down after two early touchdowns. Dallas led 17-14 in the closing moments when Starr led Green Bay on a desperate drive that featured every bit of Lombardi’s preparation and Starr’s abilities.
Not his passing ability or his physical talent, but his ability to make plays under the most trying of circumstances. His ability to follow Kramer’s block over Dallas defensive tackle Jethro Pugh and into the endzone earned a place in NFL lore.
Perhaps the most exalted spot in the history of the sport.
The moment was about a team overcoming under the most difficult circumstances. It may have been the ultimate team moment, and Starr treated it that way. He never sought out any personal glory for his winning touchdown, giving credit to the team and his coach.
That was Starr all the way through. He was as decent and pleasant a man as you could meet in any walk of life, and he had every right to be proud of all of his accomplishments and his place in the game.
But he did not ask for personal glory that surely would have been his if that was his choice. Part of it was the time he lived and played, but more of it was simply the way he lived his life."
Box Office: 'Aladdin' Proves That Onscreen Diversity Matters But Online Controversies Don't,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/05/27/aladdin-box-office-will-smith-mena-massoud-naomi-scott-walt-disney-star-wars-solo-marvel/,"Walt Disney’s live-action remake of Aladdin earned a boffo $90 million Fri-Sun and $113 million Fri-Mon Memorial Day weekend debut. It'll end tonight with as much as $265 million worldwide. Whether you liked the movie or not, there are two distinct lessons worth noting. First, onscreen diversity is an asset and anyone who thought that folks here and abroad wouldn’t show up for a blockbuster fronted mostly by Middle Eastern and Indian actors in spite of or because of that demographic makeup were deluding themselves. Second, anyone who thought the endless online handwringing and manufactured controversies would move the needle were just as delusional. ADVERTISEMENT There were complaints almost from the word go, some understandable (Guy Ritchie coming off two big flops to get a mega-budget blockbuster about Middle Eastern heroes) and some more absurd. There was outcry based on a single Hollywood Reporter article that claimed Disney was having challenges finding Middle Eastern and/or Asian leads for the movie. Days later, during the annual D23 convention, they announced that Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott would be playing Aladdin and Jasmine. Scott is (no shocker if you’ve seen Power Rangers ) more than up to the task and Massoud was a charismatic delight.
There had been “ Oh no, Disney is gonna cast Tom Hardy as Jafar! ” rumblings as well. The Guy Ritchie flick still ended up with Marwan Kenzari, who is perfectly fine if a bit underused (he needed a song). The Internet lost its mind when Billy Magnussen was cast as a “new” character because the most logical conclusion wasn’t that it was a glorified cameo as one of Jasmine’s rejected suitors but that Disney was changing the story and letting the white guy marry the princess in the end. Huge spoiler: Sorry William, but Prince Anders amounts to a 120-second cameo and does not marry Princess Jasmine at the end.
When the first look at Will Smith’s Genie in human form debuted, the movie star had to take to Twitter and assure fans, that, yes, he would be blue and otherworldly during much of the movie. When we got our first look at the Genie in his “normal” form, via a TV commercial, the Internet mocked it almost unto death . Yet, this weekend, general audiences, kids and adults alike, showed up in droves around the world at least partially because Will Smith was offering a flashy star turn as a very popular character in an anticipated motion picture. Smith’s performance has received mostly positive notices, because, well, he’s a good actor who generally knows what he’s doing.
I’m surely missing a couple controversies, but you get the idea. Despite years of handwringing, the movie opened this past weekend to overwhelmingly positive audience feedback and best-case-scenario box office. Some folks went because of the source material, some went because of Will Smith and some went to see an all-too-rare mega-budget fantasy blockbuster featuring black and brown-faced actors in every major starring and supporting role (more on that below). No matter the reason, they showed up.
As much as I talk about how the trolls don’t reflect the majority opinion or affect the financial outcome of movies like Black Panther or Wonder Woman , the diametric opposite is true as well. The online handwringing about the alleged problematics found in the likes of La La Land, Bohemian Rhapsody, Green Book or Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri didn’t move the needle one bit in terms of what general moviegoers thought of those film or whether or not they became hits or won Oscars. Ditto for “problematic” blockbusters like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen , American Sniper , the Twilight Saga or The Blind Side .
The trolls didn’t sink Captain Marvel and the “social justice warriors” didn’t sink Aladdin . If Film Twitter represented the general public, Roma or BlacKkKlansman would have won Best Picture and Paddington 2 would have (sob) earned $1 billion worldwide. Oh, and poor Booksmart would have (sob again) opened a lot better this weekend too. If general audiences decide that they want to see an upcoming movie, for whatever reason that may be, they will probably show up.
ADVERTISEMENT Unless the reviews state that the film is both terrible and lacking in the components audiences want from a given movie, they'll show up. The worst Transformers pans tended to note that they still contained all of the bombastic action spectacle, sun-scorched visuals, bawdy humor and borderline lechery associated with the franchise, so those pans read like recommendations to fans. Ditto a 007 movie like Spectre (“Yes, it’s a $200 million James Bond movie with all the fixings.”) or a Freddie Mercury biopic like Bohemian Rhapsody (“Yes, it’s an energetic and big-scale jukebox musical about Queen.”).
Audiences interested in a live-action Aladdin got what they wanted. Aladdin is a big-budget, live-action adaptation with big, bright and colorful production values, a terrific batch of leading actors, most of your favorite toons and Will Smith in a rare over-the-top movie star turn doing his best to differentiate his Genie from Robin Williams’ iconic star turn. Everything else, the pacing, the “problematics,” and the artistic “necessity” of a live-action remake of a beloved toon that substituted animated magic for comparatively grounded realism, was just a distraction for our benefit in the media.
If audiences saw the previews or read the reviews for Aladdin and decided that it was something they wanted to see, nothing else mattered. The financial success of Aladdin was not going to be decided by a few folks online making fun of Will Smith’s Genie, or people who honestly thought that the movie would end with Jasmine marrying the white guy. It also means, and this is a biggie, that audiences had exactly 0.00% of an issue with the racial and ethnic makeup of the cast.
After years hearing about how Christian Bale had to play Moses or Scarlett Johansson had to play “The Major” because of the overseas box office, Aladdin debunks the notion that onscreen diversity is anything but an asset. I cannot presume more people showed up this weekend to Aladdin because it gave audiences who looked more like Mena Massoud as opposed to Billy Magnussen a rare chance to headline a mega-bucks Hollywood blockbuster. But it sure didn’t hurt . Aladdin opened higher than Solo: A Star Wars Story ($150 million) and will make oodles more money here and abroad than the likes of The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, Christopher Robin , Dumbo , Mary Poppins Returns and Alice Through the Looking Glass .
ADVERTISEMENT This shouldn't be that much of a shock. Solo: A Star Wars Story earned far less than Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (despite both films suffering severe post-production issues and reshoot-driven budget overruns). Coco made $807 million worldwide (including $187 million in China), or 2.2x what Cars 3 ($353 million) earned. And, yeah, Moonlight eared more overseas than in North America. Ditto 12 Years A Slave which earned $57 million domestic but $187 million worldwide in 2013.
If anything, diversity sells overseas just as well, if not better, than it does in North America. We've known this at least since Beverly Hills Cop II earned $156 million domestic and $299 million worldwide (a 51/49 split and 76% more overseas than the first Beverly Hills Cop ) way back in May of 1987. Whether or not Aladdin was more of an event than it would have been had it starred Brenton Thwaites and Bella Thorne, Disney mostly keeping its word about a more racially-accurate cast paid off accordingly.
This doesn't help non-event movies in terms of onscreen diversity. The Sun is Also A Star won't top $7 million. However, if audiences really are going to (mostly) see only the biggest event flicks (live-action musicals, horror movies, branded animation and superhero flicks), in theaters, then Aladdin proves (again) that the studios no longer have any excuse not to fill those specific sub-genres with inclusive casts for both social and financial reasons.
And yes, I would argue that creating a version of Aladdin with this cast, which in turn offers more evidence against conventional wisdom about who has to star in what movies for those films to be global blockbusters, does justify its existence. Your turn, Lion King ."
Fears Grow That 'Nuclear Coffin' Is Leaking Waste Into The ...,www.forbes.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/05/27/fears-grow-that-nuclear-coffin-is-leaking-waste-into-the-pacific/,"Aerial photo of the Runit Dome. U.S. Department Of Energy (public domain) The tropical blue skies over the southern Pacific Ocean were enveloped by towering mushroom clouds lingering over the Marshall Islands in 1954 as the United States continued its testing of nuclear weapons.
The United States conducted 67 nuclear weapon tests from 1946 to 1958 on the pristine Marshall Islands. The most powerful test was the ""Bravo"" hydrogen bomb in 1954, which was about 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.
The extensive nuclear bomb testing blanketed the islands in radioactive ash, covering it in the fine, white, powder-like substance. Children, unaware of what the radioactive ash was, played in the ""snow"" and ate it according to the Atomic Heritage Foundation. Runit Dome from above. U.S. Department Of Energy (public domain)
Today, there are growing concerns that the temporary containment of the nuclear waste resulting from those tests is leaking into the Pacific Ocean and could be cracked wide open from the next storm that rolls by. Specifically, the site is believed to be leaking one of the most toxic substances in the world, the radioactive isotope plutonium-239, a byproduct of nuclear bombs that decays with a half-life of 24,100 years.
In 1977 the United States worked to clean up the radioactive waste left strewn across the Marshall Islands. In total, an estimated 73,000 cubic meters of radioactive soil was collected across the Marshall Islands. The US used a crater from an especially large nuclear bomb test on Runit Island to stash away the radioactive soil. The 328-foot crater from a May 1958 test was designated the dumping ground. July 25, 1946 - A nuclear weapon test by the American military at Bikini Atoll, Micronesia. The explosion was part of Operation Crossroads. Getty
As this was considered a temporary solution, the crater bottom was not lined with impervious material, which would have prevented radioactive waste from entering the below aquifers and Pacific Ocean. After the material was piled into the crater, an 18-inch thick concrete dome was positioned on top of it as a temporary containment. Plans for permanent radioactive waste storage were never finalized and thus the temporary solution has sat as-is for nearly 40 years.
Shortly afterward, in 1983 the Marshall Islands agreed on their severity from the United States and with it, the islands released the United States of any responsibility for past nuclear testing.
Rising sea level, soil shifting, and storms have all caused new concern over the integrity of the ""nuclear coffin"" and its ability to contain radioactive waste. The dome is reportedly cracking and the local government fears the next big storm may split the concrete dome apart. In addition, groundwater models suggest that seawater is almost certainly accessing the crater. However, it is unclear how much nuclear waste is seeping from the unlined crater bottom into the Pacific Ocean and groundwater aquifers.
Despite recent awareness around the issue, the Marshallese government does not have the money or expertise to properly clean up and isolate the nuclear waste. Thus, the Marshallese are left helpless as their tropical islands continue to leak deadly radioactive waste across its coral reefs.

Helping Veterans Find Their Next Mission,www.forbes.com,Jill Griffin,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2019/05/27/helping-veterans-find-their-next-mission/,"Tweet This your boss and managers should care about your career. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin
Dr. Arthur Langer, Chairman and Founder of Workforce Opportunity Services
Arthur Langer Today is Memorial Day. At a time when the labor market is tight and manufacturers say they are losing millions of dollars because of job vacancies, programs like the one offered by Dr. Arthur Langer and Workforce Opportunity Services are a way to ensure that the talent potential in veteran communities is realized. In fact, over half of the 5,000 people WOS has trained were veterans.
Dr. Langer is the chairman and founder of Workforce Opportunity Services. He is also a professor at Columbia University.
The nonprofit Workforce Opportunity Services (WOS) works with over 60 companies in 40 locations throughout the nation including Prudential, Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, Merck and PSEG and many others.
I had the opportunity to interview Dr. Langer recently. Here are the highlights of that interview:
Jill Griffin: Where did you grow up? Describe your early childhood and its significance on your life.
Dr. Arthur Langer: I was born and raised in the Bronx, just a few blocks away from Yankee Stadium. Both my mom and dad were immigrants from Eastern Europe, neither went to college. Growing up I thought about joining the union and becoming a Teamster like my dad, but I ended up being mentored by a member of my community and my trajectory changed.
Griffin: Who was that mentor? How did s/he inspire you?
Langer: Mr. Ness. He gave art lessons at his furniture store in the Bronx, where I was one of several students. He saw my potential and encouraged me to create a portfolio. He advised me on how to put it together even offering me a scholarship if I would apply to the High School of Music and Art or the High School of Art and Design. He believed in me, which gave me the self-assurance to believe in myself. I got into both schools and went to the High School of Music and Art. After graduating, I went to Queens College to get my bachelor’s degree in computer science at night school. Eventually, I became a professor at Columbia University. If it wasn’t for Mr. Ness, I would have never left the Bronx.
For Mr. Ness, there was nothing in it for him other than his dedication to being a teacher. His influence and legacy lives on at Workforce Opportunity Services (WOS), the nonprofit I founded. It’s because of him mentorship is an integral part of the WOS model.
Griffin: What is Workforce Opportunity Services?
Langer: It is a nonprofit dedicated to recruiting, training and placing underserved and veteran job seekers into long-lasting careers at prominent organizations. Since its inception in 2005, WOS has worked with over 65 companies in over 60 locations throughout the nation. They include Automobile Club of Southern California, JetBlue, Prudential, United Rentals, General Electric and the Department of Transportation to name a few.
WOS works with veterans and their spouses, as well as individuals from underserved communities to develop their skills so that they can then be hired by major companies, often to fill job vacancies. Our model is multifaceted and starts when WOS receives a commitment from the company to fill a certain number of positions. We then recruit and prepare individuals for those specific jobs, by equipping them with both hard and soft skills and providing hands-on mentorship support throughout the duration of the training program. After these candidates complete the training and work study part of the program, they are eligible to be hired on by the sponsoring company. To date, we have served over 5,500 people through our various training and job placement programs. More than half are post-9/11 veterans.
We train for jobs across a number of industries; everything from IT to healthcare, claims processors to mechanics. For PSEG in Newark, New Jersey, and Long Island, New York, we are paying for individuals to attend coding classes at General Assembly, a tuition valued at $15,000, to develop the skills needed to become software developers. In partnership with United Rentals in Dallas, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia, and Charlotte, North Carolina, we have trained over 400 veterans for service technician roles. In Chicago, we prepared veterans for cybersecurity positions at the HR firm Alight Solutions.
Plus, these are good paying jobs. Five years after they complete our program, nearly 80% of our alumni are earning more than $45,000 a year.
Griffin: Why did you decide to zero in on veterans and individuals from underserved communities?
Langer: There’s great hidden talent in these populations. The skills are there, they just have to be discovered, honed and supported in their careers in Corporate America. WOS makes that happen.
I also feel a deep kinship with the young people and veterans we train and place. Their pathway to success is nontraditional, as was my own career trajectory.
I married young and became a father at 19, so I had to earn a living. While working at a computer operations company, I saw a lot of imperfections in senior-level talent. I began to realize that the greatest difference between me and them was their better upbringing and access to opportunities. I began to feel that with the right tools, I could do what they did and maybe even outperform them. That gave me a tremendous amount of confidence to go back to school. It took me 18 years of night school, but I got my MBA at Iona College and my doctorate in education at Columbia University. It was at Columbia, as a professor, where I offered free computer training for young people in Harlem that I developed my research about the role of self-esteem in predicting success in the workplace. This was the genesis of Workforce Opportunity Services.
Griffin: What’s a great piece of business or life advice you received, who gave it to you, and how has it enhanced your life?
Langer: A manager of mine when I worked at Coopers & Lybrand taught me an incredibly valuable lesson I still implement today: your boss and managers should care about your career. I always felt supported and cared for when I was there. They had my career in their mindset. Ask yourself this — does my boss care about my career? As a boss ask yourself this — do I care about my employees’ careers? I always felt my bosses at Coopers & Lybrand were interested in my future to become a partner. Sometimes that required them being critical, but I always felt that it was authentic.
Griffin: How has that advice influenced how you structured Workforce Opportunity Services?
Langer: We care about how our recruits are doing both in and out of the workplace. Aside from job training and placement, we also ""clear the path"" to make the integration and transformation process easier. We provide guidance in professional etiquette and networking strategies. We have been known to pay for our consultants’ (this is what we call the people we recruit, train and place) Wi-Fi, daycare, transportation, and college courses. We teach them how to balance school and work while giving them the support they need to thrive and succeed.
In other communities, parents may fill that role. But for many of our consultants, we are that support system. Mentorship is very much integrated into our development program.
From the beginning of a program participant’s training, to when they are hired by a sponsoring partner as a full-time employee, WOS mentors meet with our consultants on a regular basis. This process is incredibly critical for veterans, as the military is regimented. Soldiers know what they must do to advance, but the path is less clear in the civilian business world. So, we work with our corporate partners to give the veterans they hire a one to two-year plan that outlines how they can advance in the company and be a successful employee.
We work with military spouses as well. Through our WOS programs in El Paso, Texas, we train veterans and their spouses for careers in project management roles with Prudential.
Griffin: Please give me the top three bullet points in your Personal Leadership Credo.
Langer:
There is power in diversity of opinion.
Diversity is a mindset. It is not about having more representation for the sake of appearing diverse. If we don’t have more diverse voices in our companies, we may not be making the right decisions. Trust and honesty are critical to growth. While professional growth is often the impetus for mentorship, it is crucial to find a mentor you trust to be honest about your performance and areas that need to be improved. Transparency and open dialogue in a mentorship only strengthen performance. Be extraordinarily interested in helping other people. Low-income individuals or veterans can climb to higher levels of success if given a fair opportunity. We are simply leveling the playing field while systematically diversifying the workforce. At WOS our mission is simple: to create good citizens who will work toward the continuing, evolving growth and progress of our society. Griffin: Describe a painful setback in your life and what it taught you.
Langer: In my late thirties I started my first business and it failed. I made some mistakes, and I had to let the business go and ultimately go inside myself to think about whether or not I would be able to start another business. I started to think maybe I wasn’t as good as I thought I was. But I learned that I had the ability to pick myself up after a failure and have enough confidence to be bold and try again.
Griffin: What advice do you have for young, talented, ambitious people who want to rise?
Langer: They should find a mentor early, and when the time is right, become a mentor themselves. Having a mentor that is not a blood relative is crucial to effectively prepare you for the next step in your career. When you become a mentor yourself it is another way to continue learning because you will learn from your students or mentees and understand the changes that are occurring within your company.

"To Brexit, Or Not To Brexit? That Is Now The Question",www.forbes.com,Frances Coppola,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2019/05/27/to-brexit-or-not-to-brexit-that-is-now-the-question/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Banking & Insurance I write about banking, finance and economics. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin It’s been an exciting week in Brexitland. Prime Minister Theresa May was finally forced to admit that she hadn’t a snowflake’s hope in hell of getting her horrible deal through Parliament. Clean out of both ideas and support, she announced her resignation on Friday, May 24 – the day after the European Parliament elections, in which the U.K. participated only because of her failure to deliver Brexit. The Brexit and the Union Jack. Getty
May’s departure was suspiciously timely. Although the election results weren’t published until three days after the vote, it was evident from exit polls that the Government was going to do very badly. Like her predecessor, David Cameron, she resigned rather than face the inevitable backlash.
The European Parliament election turned out to be a bloodbath. Both the ruling Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party were trashed by an electorate thoroughly fed up with Brexit. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party soared, topping the polls with 32% of the vote. And the Liberal Democrats and Green Party, both of which campaigned on a “Stop Brexit” ticket, also saw enormous gains at the expense of Labour and Tories. In another form of protest, only 37% of eligible voters even bothered to vote. Many people simply didn’t want to vote in a election they saw as completely pointless.
But the two main parties have only themselves to blame for their trouncing. They barely bothered to campaign. This left the field clear for parties that identified themselves by their stance on Brexit. The election became in effect a second referendum. And it is proving every bit as divisive as the first.
Both sides claimed victory. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party ended up with the most MEPs, but Remainers said that this was largely due to the fragmentation of Remain parties: they claimed that collectively, Remain had beaten the Brexiters hollow. Electoral statistics didn't exactly clarify the situation. Europe Elects cheerily announced a large majority for Remain: Europe Elects announces U.K. results in the European Election Twitter
But Sir John Curtice, the BBC’s go-to person on British electoral math, said that on share of the vote, hard Brexit and Remain sides were neck-and-neck:
Overall, 35% of voters voted for parties comfortable with no deal (the Brexit Party and UKIP).
Equally, 35% backed one of the three UK-wide parties (Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK) that supported a second referendum.
Curtice omitted the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) and the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, both of which campaigned against Brexit, on the grounds that their supporters include Leave voters who want independence for, respectively, Scotland and Wales. Annoyed Leave voters pointed out on Twitter that this was perverse, since the Green Party also includes Leave voters with green consciences. On these grounds, they claimed he had overstated Remain support. Meanwhile, equally annoyed Remainers objected that by omitting SNP and Plaid Cymru he had understated it. Electoral math can never please everyone.
Farage claimed that his party’s success proved the British people want no-deal Brexit. He warned other British politicians that if the U.K. hadn’t left by October 31, the Brexit Party would fight the next General Election. This sounds terrifying until you realize that the Brexit Party has drawn most of its votes from the collapsing UKIP, which didn’t make much of an impact in the 2015 General Election despite doing extremely well in the 2014 European Elections. How people vote when they think the election doesn’t make any difference to their lives is a very different matter from how they vote when they think their future prosperity depends on the outcome.
Nonetheless, Farage’s warning will resonate with Conservative politicians. If it fought the next General Election, it could split the Tory vote and let in a Labour government. Ouch.
On the other side of the slate, Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK all insisted that the result showed people want a second referendum with Remain on the ballot. How they think this would achieve their goal of stopping Brexit is a mystery. If there is one thing this election has demonstrated, it is that a second referendum would resolve absolutely nothing at all. There is no clear majority for either hard Brexit or Remain, and everyone hates the only available compromise. The people are every bit as divided as the politicians.
Anyway, everyone’s a winner, it seems. Except for the main parties, which are licking their wounds and wondering what to do next.
It is blindingly obvious what they will have to do next. The people have told both Conservative and Labour in no uncertain terms that they must declare their real position on Brexit. And the choice is binary. Either Britain leaves the EU completely, or it remains, completely. The two parties must decide on which side of the fence they fall. Sitting on the fence is no longer an option.
The problem is that they don’t want to make this choice, because they fear the electoral consequences—which could be severe, as Sir John Curtice observes: ""Far from providing a clear verdict, the result simply underlined how difficult it is likely to be to find any outcome to the Brexit process that satisfies a clear majority of voters.""
But the two parties can no longer hope to maintain electoral support by avoiding or fudging the difficult questions around Brexit. Three years of political shenanigans have made both Leave voters and Remainers angry. In her resignation speech , May called for compromise. But her quest for compromise is what has destroyed her premiership. People have seen what compromise means, and they don’t like it. They want Brexit either done or stopped.
The real loser in this election was any form of soft Brexit. Public opinion is much more polarized than it was in 2016: the only viable outcomes now are no-deal Brexit or Remain. Indeed, in my view, this was always going to be the eventual position . We have reached the end game. The U.K. Parliament must now decide which of these it will back.

This Scandinavian Wants America To Fall In Love With Licorice,www.forbes.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2019/04/21/this-scandinavian-wants-america-to-fall-in-love-with-licorice/,"Johan Bülow, founder of Lakrids by Bülow Lakrids by Bülow The Nordic region’s love affair with licorice shows no sign of slowing. I recently called out the black, salty variety as one of Scandinavia’s weirdest foods , but one Danish entrepreneur believes there’s much more to licorice than first meets the eye. ADVERTISEMENT
After achieving success back home, Johan Bülow with his brand Lakrids by Bülow (lakrids simply means licorice in Danish) has now signed a distribution deal in the United States with New York's Chelsea Market Baskets . But is America and the rest of the world really ready to fall in love with real licorice?
What we’re talking about here isn’t the mass-produced artificially-red strings of candy popular in the USA. Kelila Jaffe, Food Program Coordinator for the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University explained the difference to the Huffington Post :
""Black licorice candy is flavored with the extract of the licorice plant. Red licorice, or other colors, are usually fruit flavored by artificial or natural means, and do not contain licorice flavoring.""
A love for real licorice
As a Scandinavian, Bülow had been brought up on licorice yet wasn’t happy with the products on the market. He compares the licorice root, from which the end product is made, to the chocolate or coffee bean.
“The licorice we know comes from the root of a plant. It’s 100 per cent natural and sourced primarily from the Middle East, South Italy, and China. People understand the differences in the coffee or chocolate depending on growing conditions, but few people have looked into the same differences for the licorice root,” he says.
After several years of trial and error, he opened his first store in 2007. The initial product proved popular, but the real breakthrough came two years later. Together with his production manager, Bülow developed the idea to coat the licorice with chocolate. They were told that it couldn’t be done. ADVERTISEMENT
From Denmark to the world
Fast-forward to 2019, and Lakrids by Bülow has brand recognition of up to 60 per cent in the Danish capital Copenhagen. That’s quite an achievement for a product that Bülow freely admits is premium priced and aimed squarely at the luxury buyer. But despite this success, he wants to approach the American market differently. Johan Bülow has opened stores in trendy locations such as Berlin's Bikini Lakrids by Bülow
On what’s in store for the American market, Bülow says he would love to make a premium quality, organic version of the popular red licorice candy: “We are already making an organic product today where we slow cook the licorice for up to four hours. I would like to do a premium version by sourcing organic strawberries and going from there. Simple works best.""
A versatile product
Aside from the limited edition and country-specific products, Lakrids by Bülow has a signature numeric collection and a signature alphabetical collection. The former features the classic salty and sweet variety, while the latter includes various chocolate-coated lines. ADVERTISEMENT
Bülow is also keen to demonstrate the versatility of the true licorice flavor by taking the licorice root extract and spray-drying it into powder or juicing it. He invites experts from other areas to come up with their own creations. “We are the experts in the raw product, but we’ve worked with everyone from Michelin star chefs and leading bartenders to chocolate and ice-cream makers,” he says.
Recipes featured on the company blog include raspberry mousse cake with peach and licorice, meringue nests with licorice cream, and roasted almonds with licorice.
Those sceptical of Bülow’s chances of conquering America may want to cast their eyes to the Middle East, where his concept of adapting the core product to the market has worked wonders. Dubai is Bülow’s biggest export market and the treats are even served on board in the first class cabin of selected Emirates flights.
“One of our popular products in the region is made from dehydrated rose leaves. It’s not a typical Scandinavian flavor but it works there,"" he explains, adding, ""this is how we’re going to make the world fall in love with licorice!”

"Buy Denmark, Sell Greenland- Finding Value In Scandinavian Stamps",www.forbes.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardlehmann/2019/02/13/scandinavian-stamp-values/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Richard Lehmann blogs on Income Investing and Philately Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin For stock investors, Europe has been an underwhelming region for the better part of a decade. Vanguard's FTSE Europe ETF, for example, has logged an average annual return of only 6% over the last decade. Alas, there are some low-risk European assets that have been logging strong returns. Postage Stamps. Danish stamps, used or mint, for example have appreciated some 30% during the last decade.
Scandinavian countries have been among the more responsible postal authorities issuing in volumes geared more for need than for profit, i.e. collectors. This makes them a better candidate for consideration by those collectors who have more than a passing interest in their collection’s residual value. Still, price appreciation by country has been mixed both by country and by time period. A close study of the accompanying table tells a variety of stories.
The table reflects the performance of stamps cataloging $25 or more and issued through 1950. (Note: The 1950 cutoff accounts for why Aland Islands and Faroe Islands are not included in this analysis.) The 5 and 10 year appreciation numbers reflect the changes in catalog values over the last 5 and 10 years. The appreciations are calculated for all items values up to $500 and those valued at over $500. This breakdown is done because the higher priced items unduly distort the numbers and, generally, appreciate at a faster rate. This is because they have a larger audience of buyers, i.e. investors, and sell mostly at auction where pricing information is more transparent.
The top appreciation performers were Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Greenland mint stamps showed the steepest declines which is odd since their average stamp price is the lowest . In fact, it is the only country where the average used price is higher than mint. Iceland shows one of the highest per stamp values and additionally, sports huge premiums for mint never hinged material. This appears due to the low per stamp issuance volume. I would caution collectors about paying such premiums given their greater vulnerability to market declines and to re-gumming. Finland is unusual in that its used stamps are close to the average mint stamps which also have the highest per stamp value of all countries. Norway has the lowest ratio of used to mint prices which, combined with their overall performance makes Norwegian used stamps the sweet spot for future appreciation.
We show dollar values for each country to give an idea of how much it would take to build a complete collection for each country, less the over $500 items of course. While the stamp selections for each country represent about eighty percent of the catalog value for all stamps of that country, we can expect to buy at well below full catalog for the listed items, so the remaining stamps should not increase the total cost for a fairly complete collection (less the +$500 items) above the values shown.
The steady decline in most retail stamp prices reflects the effect of the Internet which has become the principal engine today for stamp sales, an effect that will only grow. Technological changes on the horizon will only accelerate this process, changes that will make stamp dealing more efficient.
However, I also foresee changes which will make it possible for collectors to achieve higher recoveries for their collections and that should prove to be the element that gives confidence to collectors to buy.

"With 'Aladdin' Out, Every Disney Live-Action Remake's Opening Weekend Ranked Worst To Best",www.forbes.com,Simon Thompson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2019/05/27/with-aladdin-out-every-disney-live-action-remakes-opening-weekend-ranked-worst-to-best/,"Aladdin made financial wishes come true at the box office for Disney over the Memorial Day weekend. However, the magic lamp could have done with a more vigorous rubbing if the plan was to be the most successful debut for a reimagining of one of the studio’s classic animated movies. With an expected four-day debut of $105 million, a three-day domestic gross of $86.1 million, it’s far from a disappointment and ranks among the most financially potent opening weekends of Disney’s live-action reimaginings - it also exceeded the projected domestic debut of between $75 million and $85 million.
Aladdin is Disney’s second live-action remake to hit theaters this year, after Dumbo but it won’t be the last of 2019 as The Lion King is on the way in July. With a few of these under the studio’s belt, it seems like to perfect time to check in and see where this latest opening weekend ranks.
You might notice that I haven’t included Alice Through the Looking Glass , 102 Dalmatians , Christopher Robin , and Oz: The Great and Powerful in this list – that’s because they aren’t remakes but prequels, sequels or inspired by an IP rather than a reimagining of a previous film.
All figures are domestic unless stated otherwise and are unadjusted for inflation.
9. Pete’s Dragon (Disney) 2016
Opening Weekend: $21.51 million
Total Box Office: $77.04 million
Personally, Pete’s Dragon ranks among my favorites when it comes to Disney’s live-action remakes. However, the original 1997 part live-action and part animated musical original leaves me cold. This 2016 reimagining got some strong reviews, but that didn’t translate into people turning out to movie theaters en masse. It grossed over $143 million worldwide against a $65 million production budget – domestically it’s the lowest grossing of the remakes.
8. 101 Dalmatians (Disney) 1996
Opening Weekend: $33.5 million
Total Box Office: $136.19 million
Made for $75 million, 101 Dalmatians grossed $320.6 million at the worldwide box office but didn’t exactly wow critics. That said, Glenn Close’s show-stealing turn as Cruella de Vil certainly proved popular with audiences and saw her nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and for a sequel to be greenlit. Disney’s continues to be struck by puppy love with a fresh live-action Cruella de Vil prequel, Cruella , on the way in 2020.
7. Dumbo (Disney) 2019
Opening Weekend: $45.99 million
Total Box Office: $112.7 million
The second live-action remake helmed by Tim Burton, and the first out of the gate in 2019, grossed over $348 million worldwide against a $170 million budget. Although highly anticipated, Dumbo got a mixed reaction from critics and failed to hit the projected opening weekend of between $50 million and $65 million instead debuting with $46 million – that didn’t stop it topping the box office that weekend though.
6. Cinderella (Disney) 2015
Opening Weekend: $67.88 million
Total Box Office: $201.15 million
Kenneth Branaugh directed the live-action adaptation of the namesake 1950 animated classic with Lily James in the titular role. Reportedly costing between $95 million and $100 million to make, Cinderella grossed $543.5 million worldwide - $201.15 million of that was at the domestic box office. Critics and audiences both approved of the reimagining giving it a warm reception.
5. Maleficent (Disney) 2014
Opening Weekend: $69.43 million
Total Box Office: $241.41 million
A retelling of Disney’s 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty from the point of view of the evil queen, played by Angelina Jolie, audiences flocked to Maleficent although critics gave it a more lukewarm reception. This is another of my favorite of the remakes and reimaginings. Unadjusted for inflation, Maleficent is Jolie’s highest-grossing film and the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a sequel is on the way.
4. The Jungle Book (Disney) 2016
Opening Weekend: $103.26 million
Total Box Office: $364 million
While the original 1967 animated film was more of a musical affair, this darker and far less song-orientated version proved to be extremely popular with both critics and audiences. Jon Favreau directed this retelling of the story of Mowgli and his animal allies and enemies. Made for $177 million, The Jungle Book grossed $966 million worldwide and, at the global box office, was the fifth highest-grossing movie of 2016 behind four other Disney movies.
3. Aladdin (Disney) 2019
Opening Weekend: $105 million
Total Box Office: TBD
Disney’s 1992 animated film of the same name is a true classic with an iconic turn from Robin Williams as Genie at its core – in the Guy Ritchie helmed redo, Will Smith steps into the lamp and limelight. Opening over Memorial Day weekend, it secured a three-day domestic debut of $86.1 million being nudged up to $105 million over the four-day weekend - Aladdin cost $183 million to bring to the big screen. Audiences took it to the top of the box office on its debut despite getting a mixed reaction from critics.
2. Alice in Wonderland (Disney) 2010
Opening Weekend: $116.1 million
Total Box Office: $334.19 million
Johnny Depp played Mad Hatter in Tim Burton’s first outing as the director of the reimagining of a Disney classic, this time inspired by the 1951 animated movie of the same name and Lewis Carroll’s fantasy novels, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass . Hitting theaters in February, Alice in Wonderland debuted with $220.1 million worldwide against a budget of $200 million – it went on to gross over $1 billion at the worldwide box office and spawned a less successful sequel.
1. Beauty and the Beast (Disney) 2017
Opening Weekend: $174.75 million
Total Box Office: $504.04 million
The film is a live-action remake of Disney’s 1991 animated film of the same name, Beauty and the Beast is a tale as old as time. Emma Watson played Belle opposite Dan Stevens’ Beast in a redo that got mostly glowing reviews for critics as well as a glowing financial endorsement from audiences. Grossing $1.26 billion at the worldwide box office it was the second highest-grossing movie of 2017 – losing out on the top spot to Disney’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi - and broke a slew of records including beating the take of the original film’s entire theatrical run in just six days. It’s a beast of a movie!
Aladdin is in theaters now."
Congress Fails To Push Through Gold Star Family Tax Fix Before Memorial Day,www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/05/27/congress-fails-to-push-through-gold-star-family-tax-fix-before-memorial-day/,"On Memorial Day, we’re supposed to honor our fallen soldiers. But some military families aren’t feeling very appreciated this year: Congress still hasn’t fixed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax hit impacting Gold Star families. Gold Star families are those with an immediate family member who died while serving in the military. The term has been in use since 1918 when President Wilson took up the suggestion of Women’s Committee of National Defenses to allow mothers who had lost a child in World War I to wear a black armband adorned with a gold star. In 1936, Congress officially designated the last Sunday of September as Gold Star Mother’s Day; President Barack Obama expanded the day to recognize all Gold Star family members. Today, the U.S. Department of Defense issues Gold Star Lapel Buttons to spouses, parents and children of fallen service members.
Gold Star families also receive survivor benefits. The death gratuity program allows a one-time tax-free payment of $100,000 to eligible survivors of service members who die while on active duty or while serving in certain reserve statuses. The purpose of the payment is to assist families with immediate expenses.
Since families will no longer be receiving a regular paycheck, there are also monthly amounts payable. The Department of Veterans Affairs is responsible for paying Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) . DIC is a tax-free monetary benefit paid to eligible survivors of service members who died in the line of duty or from a service-related injury or disease. The Department of Defense also pays under a Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). SBP is a lifetime annuity based on a percentage of pay (adjusted for inflation) and is paid to an eligible beneficiary.
Here’s the tricky part: There's an offset for Department of Defense benefits paid while also receiving Veterans Affairs benefits. The offset affects about 65,000 Gold Star families. The offset, which has been around since 1972, is sometimes referred to as the Widow’s Tax.
There is a way around the offset, however. Surviving spouses may opt to transfer their Department of Defense benefit to their children. Practically, this makes sense since surviving spouses are paying expenses on behalf of their children anyway—children who had previously benefitted from a parent’s military salary. And tax-wise, it worked out, too. The so-called “kiddie tax” meant that benefits paid out to children would be paid at the same tax rate as the parent so that the tax consequences were the same.
But that was before the TCJA. Now, benefits payable to children are subject to the new kiddie tax rules. Those rules tax unearned income payable to children at the same rates as trusts and estates, and those can be as high as 37%. And while that sounds as if the rates are the same as those for individuals, they’re not. Tax rates for trusts and estates “climb the brackets” much faster than individuals, which means that since the rates are compressed, kids hit the top rate much sooner. For example, a married couple didn’t hit the top tax bracket of 37% until income reached $600,001 in 2018, but taxable income hit the top rate of 37% for trusts and estates at just $12,501 in 2018:
TE rates 2018
KPE (You can read more about the kiddie tax under the TCJA here .)
This result meant that Gold Star families saw tax bills double (and in some cases triple) for the 2018 tax year. There appeared to be a simple fix: change the tax characterization of the benefits. And so, Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) introduced the Gold Star Family Tax Relief Act , which would treat survivor benefits as earned income instead of unearned income; earned income payable to children is taxed at a much lower rate. That bill, which was introduced on May 8, passed in the Senate on May 21, 2019.
Representative Elaine Luria (D-VA) also introduced a bill, the Gold Star Family Tax Relief Act, in the House on May 2, 2019. H.R. 2481 had 155 cosponsors.
Great, right? That’s the way this is supposed to work. The House and the Senate pass similar bills, they hammer out their differences and the bill moves to the President for signature.
Only, that’s not the way it happened. The House is supposed to take the lead on tax and revenue-related legislation, so if Luria’s bill had been identical to Cassidy's bill, no harm, no foul. But Luria’s bill wasn’t identical. It was tied to a retirement bill which would, among other things, make it easier for small businesses to offer retirement plans, allow long-term and part-time workers to participate in 401(k) plans and eliminate the age cap for IRA contributions. The bill also included the Gold Star tax fix. The revised bill, H.R.1994, Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019, or SECURE Act, was championed by both parties with ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee Representative Kevin Brady (R-TX) declaring, “It will greatly benefit our workers. It deserves strong support.” The bill eventually passed in the House by a vote of 417-3 on May 23.
If a similar version of the SECURE Act bill had passed the Senate, it was that the President would sign it into law. It never got that far. In the original version of the SECURE Act bill, 529 plans would have been expanded to include homeschooling expenses. That bit was withdrawn before the final vote after pushback, including from American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the National Education Association (NEA)—a move we've seen before under the TCJA . But in the Senate, the withdrawal of the homeschooling provision drew opposition from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). Cruz, who does not oppose the Gold Star tax fix, balked at the revised bill. He made it clear to the Senate that he would not allow for unanimous consent and the bill has now stalled. The matter is expected to be brought up again when Congress reconvenes in a few days, but for now there’s no tax fix for Gold Star families.
Separately, Senator Doug Jones (D-AL) introduced the Military Widow’s Tax Elimination Act , which would eliminate the offset provision altogether. There are 72 cosponsors of the bill, including Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), chair of the Armed Services Committee. The bill, which was introduced on February 28, 2019, remains in committee."
Trump's China Trade Drama Makes Keysight A Buy,www.forbes.com,Ken Kam,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2019/05/27/trumps-china-trade-drama-makes-keysight-a-buy/,"Ken Kam : Wayne, the trade war with China has led readers to ask whether it would be smart to take money out of the market until it is clear how Trump’s actions are going to play out. Do you think this is a time to invest or take money out of the market? Wayne Himelsein : I’m personally putting money into the market. Put simply, there is no wrong time to invest. Ever. I know this may sound like a flippant answer, but it’s well substantiated. Let me share all the reasons why.
I’ll start with the math, which by virtue of being mathematical, is irrefutable! I think anyone would agree with me that no person can successfully time bottoms, that is, enter the market at the exact low of every correction over the history of corrections. This is perfection, and clearly impossible. Given this truth, one is stuck waiting for a moment they feel is a “good” time, which we’ve just agreed will not be the bottom, so will either be “on the way down” or “in recovery”.
To estimate the price achieved at the time of investing, we can just scatter, randomly, all the moments of time one might have possibly chosen to invest, and find an average price over varying forward time windows. If we then view the relationship between the time one waits and the average price one pays for the market (the S&P500 index) at each point moving forward, what we find is stunning: the longer one waits, the more they lose by missing the market’s gains while waiting versus how much they’d save buying it cheaper.
While a profound result, the explanation is simple -- the market spends so much more time gaining then it does correcting.
Kam : So you are saying that just by the act of waiting, you are losing more because of the upside you more likely miss over the time you wait?
Himelsein : Yes, exactly, the biggest loss in waiting is missing upside because the market spends so long going up between corrections. You end up paying a higher price even at the perceived “bottom” because of how long time you waited for the correction. Consider that if one bought the exact bottom tick of the recent December 2018 correction, they would still have paid a far higher price for that “bottom” then had they bought the July 2015 “peak” which was followed by not one, but two 10%-ish corrections; one in August 2015 and another in January 2016.
This demonstrates that buying at a perceived peak, then going through two corrections, was still better for an investor then if they had waited for the Dec 2018 “bottom” because of the recovery in 2016 and fantastic gains of 2017. And, again, that assumes they were able to pick the exact bottom in 2018. Anything short of buying the lowest tick was an even greater “loss” then having bought at the July 2015 peak.
Kam : That makes so much sense. I had never really thought about it that way, but in hearing your take, and the mathematical substantiation, I am convinced.
Himelsein : But there’s more. I started out by saying that the mathematics had to be shared first, but following that, I’d like to talk about the psychology of timing, which is the second reason to give up on the dream of buying at the bottom.
Going back to the original problem in timing, one has to wait for a moment they feel is a “good” time (in the unrealistic hope of catching the absolute bottom, which we’ve established is only a perceived good price). As mentioned earlier, our fingers are on the trigger on the way down or else while in a recovery or growth phase; these are all the available regimes we can be in.
The psychological difficulty of “on the way down” is that we get scared, and can’t tell whether we’re at a bottom, so we wait. The mental walls we put up during a recovery is that we don’t know if its a real recovery, “is this just a bounce, or a bear market rally” we say to ourselves, and need to wait to see the turn-around “have legs” whatever that means. And, finally, the hesitation we have during growth spurts is that “the market is too high” or that a downturn is soon coming.
Kam : I know so many of those feelings well, and have actually talked through many of my clients whose words are uncannily those you quote. By the time January recovery “had legs” the market was making new highs!
Himelsein : That’s right, and then at that point, we say to ourselves “oh no, I’ve missed it” and then the inevitable “let me wait for another dip”, and the waiting goes on to miss another big upside leg that can never be caught up to.
The summary point is that our brains are always hesitating, and so we are always waiting. By the math, this means we are, on average, losing out. I say this not to reiterate the math, but to drive home the separate point that our psychology is our greatest enemy, for the mental walls we put up, quite literally, drive up our cost!
Kam : Well said. On the heels of that wisdom, can you tell us more about Keysight Technologies?
Himelsein : Sure thing. Keysight has many of the characteristics of those I’ve talked about before. After going public in late 2014, it had a very difficult time out of the gate, falling throughout the entire year of 2015 until finding its bottom in January of 2016. But from that point forward it has been, in a word, unstoppable.
The recovery was solid, not happening overnight, but taking the entire year of 2016 to reach the early 2015 levels. It looked like a giant “V” with a year-long down and then a year-long up, all to get back to its starting point. But then after breaking out in early 2017, it has just climbed, relentlessly, toward the skies. Its established a powerful trend.
Kam : I know you love those strong trending stocks, and they have served you well. Is there some reason why you like it more right now?
Himelsein : Yes, definitely. After having established itself as the kind of stock I’m interested in, I watched it handle the 2018 correction and January recovery; it was not like the rest of the market that waited till late April to make new highs, it was first. It led the charge in making new highs in January. By later April, it was, in fact, about 40% higher. This was explosive.
But then it took its hit. It stopped abruptly in very late April, said to itself, “phew, that was quite a run”, and fell off a small cliff, giving back a tad over 20%. This was ugly, to say the least. But somewhat expected simply because it went too far too fast, it got ahead of itself. But now it took a step back, and is settling down, calming itself, and re-energizing to continue its climb.
Going back to your question of timing, Keysight is another perfect example where it has just dropped 20%-ish but is still up almost 20% on the year. Had one “waited” during its January climb, they’d still be paying higher after its drop. So, while we cannot wait for “dips” because we miss out on gains, when we do get dips, when they are handed to us on a silver platter, on the stocks we like for broader reasons, we must use that gift horse to grab them.
My Take : The best time to buy stocks is when they are down for reasons that have little to do with the company, and this is one of those times. But don't make a big purchase of a single stock and don't wait for a more perfect time to invest. Make small investments in a portfolio of stocks that you won't need to disturb for at least 5 years.
It's better to make small buys rather than waiting until you think the market has reached the bottom before making a big purchase. If your brokerage firm charges a lot to make small trades, take a look at FOLIOfn, a brokerage firm I use for clients for precisely this reason, and in which I have no other economic interest.
Wayne’s Logica Focus Fund (LFF) has an 18+ year track record at Marketocracy. Over that period, Wayne averaged 11.67% a year which compares well to the S&P 500's 5.76% return for the same period.

Box Office: 'Avengers: Endgame' Has Now Sold More Tickets In America Than 'The Lion King',www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/05/27/box-office-avengers-endgame-star-wars-frozen-lion-king-aladdin-walt-disney-beyonce/,"As expected, Walt Disney was sneaky with their Aladdin estimates. Everyone and their sister were guestimating an over/under $113 million Fri-Mon total, but Disney came in with “just” $105 million. And sure enough, the final figures are out (including Monday estimates), and it’s indeed a $90 million Fri-Sun weekend and a $112.7 million Fri-Mon estimate. And they were a little low on Avengers: Endgame as well, with a $22.3 million Fri-Mon estimate for a new 32-day domestic total of $803.631 million. It also means that Avengers 4 has sold more tickets in North America, give or take 3-D bumps and IMAX/PLF upcharges, than Walt Disney’s The Lion King . For reference, The Lion King opened in wide release (after two weeks in just two theaters) on June 24, 1994. The much-anticipated and well-reviewed animated adventure, sold as “ Hamlet meets Bambi in Africa,” opened with a boffo $42 million debut weekend. At the time, that was the fifth biggest opening weekend ever, behind Jurassic Park ($50 million in 1993), Batman Returns ($47 million in 1992) and Batman ($43 million in 1989). It legged out all summer for a final $312 million domestic total.
At the time, that made it the fifth biggest domestic grosser of all time, behind E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial ($359 million before the 2002 reissue), Jurassic Park ($357 million before the 2013 reissue) , Forrest Gump ($330 million over that same summer) and Star Wars ($322 million, before the Special Edition release in 1997). And in terms of adjusted-for-inflation ticket sales, The Lion King ’s initial theatrical release earned $672.4 million in North America, a figure that Avengers: Endgame passed on its 15th day of release.
However, The Lion King has been reissued a few times over the last 25 years, specifically a 2011 3-D rerelease that netted an additional $94 million in North America. All in, The Lion King has earned $422 million domestic and $968 million worldwide. In terms of domestic inflation, that added up to around $803.3 million in adjusted-for-inflation domestic earnings. Avengers: Endgame just passed that, putting it in 19th place between The Sting ($803 million adjusted) and Star Wars – Episode One: The Phantom Menace ($813 million, counting its own 2012 3-D reissue).
All of this is mere trivia as we see how high on the inflation-adjusted list Avengers 4 gets by the end of its run (presumably 16th place between Return of the Jedi and Avatar ). The live-action remake of Aladdin just opened with $113 million in four days (and a global opening potentially as high as $265 million) partially based on the diversity of its onscreen cast. So, I’m curious to see how Jon Favreau’s Lion King plays with a mostly black cast (Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, James Earl Jones, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, etc.) in the main vocal roles.
Current early guestimates argue that it’ll open with an over/under $200 million launch, but reviews could push that figure up or down. As for repeat business and overall global grosses, much will depend on how different the new movie is from the 1994 flick. Favreau has promised that it won’t be a shot-for-shot remake akin to (my words, not his) Gus Van Sant’s Psycho , so that’s encouraging. Of note, The Lion King only sold (in 2019 ticket prices) $672 million back in 1994 when movies that popular played for months-upon-months and had little in the way of comparatively scaled competition.
I do have a history (partially due to witnessing movies like Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle , Pearl Harbor and Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows getting taken down by unreasonable expectations) of offering dialed-down expectations or worst-case-scenarios only to watch a given biggie earn best-case-scenario box office. So, yes, The Lion King could end up with over/under Jurassic World numbers worldwide. But let’s not panic if the movie only earns Beauty and the Beast money ($504 million domestic and $1.263 billion worldwide) or even The Jungle Book money ($366 million/$966 million). Unless Frozen II performs at best-case-scenario this Thanksgiving, I imagine the battle for second place is going to come down to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and The Lion King .

"A Stricken Dan Gilbert, Detroit's Unparalleled Benefactor, Draws City's Concerns",www.forbes.com,Dale Buss,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dalebuss/2019/05/27/dan-gilbert-detroits-unparalleled-benefactor-draws-the-prayers-of-a-city/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Cars & Bikes I am grounded in autos but range broadly. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin
Seldom has one man meant so much to the fate of a big American city, especially in the modern era. Thus have so many metro Detroiters been drawn to the unfortunate news that Dan Gilbert suffered symptoms of a stroke on Sunday and is being attended to at a local hospital.
Little public information has been forthcoming since the initial report that the 57-year-old Forbes 400 billionaire was admitted to Royal Oak Beaumont Hospital in suburban Detroit early Sunday morning. ""He received immediate medical attention and is currently recovering comfortably,"" said a statement issued by the Quicken Loans family of companies following inquiries from the Detroit News. ""Our collective thoughts and prayers are with Dan for a speedy recovery."" Details of his diagnosis and prognosis weren't released, the newspaper said, and the family requested privacy.
Gilbert is founder and chairman of Quicken Loans, which is headquartered in downtown Detroit, and head of an umbrella organization called Rock Ventures that oversees his hundreds of real estate investments and other business ventures from a sprawling nexus astride Woodward Avenue where the fabled thoroughfare feeds the increasingly robust heart of a glittering shopping, sports, entertainment and residential district.
And while local and state governments of course have played a role in Motown's renaissance since the nadir of the city's bankruptcy in 2013, the overwhelming private force in Detroit's comeback has been Dan Gilbert. He started the ball rolling by investing hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money, and his efforts, determination and capital finally got the city's rusty flywheel moving in the right direction again. Over the last decade, the Quicken Loans/Bedrock/Rock Ventures empire has sunk a total of nearly $6 billion into rebuilding the city.
Only Gilbert's willingness to stick his neck out -- way out -- has brought Detroit true renewal and has begun a new virtuous cycle of economic development that has been pulling the region out of a half-century of sloth and despair.
In many ways, too, he's just been getting started. Gilbert's signature real estate achievement is likely to be construction of Detroit's tallest building -- outstretching the iconic Renaissance Center -- on the Woodward Avenue location of the former J.L. Hudson's department-store building. And increasingly, Gilbert has gotten involved in trying to fix what else ails Michigan, such as in his efforts to lead legislative reform of the most expensive auto-insurance structure in the nation.
Sure, other sources of private capital, such as the Ilitch family who own the Detroit Tigers and Detroit Red Wings, and William Ford Jr. and Ford, which are resuscitating an old mid-town train station, have been pouring their own remarkable resources into the revival. And definitely, Gilbert has helped Cleveland as well, where he owns the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA and just poached its new coach, John Beilein, from his remarkable legacy as coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team.
But Dan Gilbert has individually carved his own visage into whatever might be Detroit's version of Mount Rushmore. He also has done so while his family continues to fight for the health of Gilbert's oldest son, who was born with neurofibromatosis, a rare genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow in nerves throughout his body; Gilbert and his wife, Jennifer, have pledged $64 million into research on a cure for the disease.
Thus the prayers of a city have converged around a man who isn't all that well known everywhere else.

AMD 16-Core 3rd Gen Ryzen: Is The Intel-Killer Delayed Or Just Fake News?,www.forbes.com,Antony Leather,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/05/27/amd-16-core-3rd-gen-ryzen-is-the-intel-killer-delayed-or-just-fake-news/,"If you've been watching the news from Computex this week, you'll likely have been sat watching reports such as mine regarding Lisa Su's 3rd Gen Ryzen and Navi keynote speech today wondering when that extra slide would arrive with the expected 16-core CPU. So far, it still hasn't. Shortly after the keynote, the Internet was awash with both positive and negative opinions about 3rd Gen Ryzen, with some of the latter focusing on the lack of a 16-core part. As usual, everything we knew up until that point was based on supposed leaks and rumors, such as Threadripper being canceled and various models that we're now fairly sure do not exist appearing at retailer websites .
However, there's plenty of evidence - some fairly convincing - that suggests AMD has simply delayed its launch rather than what could be called the Ryzen 9 3950X never existing in the first place.
There are two 8-core chiplet dies
AMD's 12-core Ryzen 9 3900X uses a chiplet design with two 7nm Core Chiplet Dies and one I/O Die
Antony Leather
We've already seen under the hood of the Ryzen 9 3900X and there are clearly two Core Chiplet Dies (CCDs) as well as the I/O die. If you were skeptical then that is fairly convincing evidence. It's highly unlikely that AMD has used one 8-core CCD and one 4-core CCD and has instead included two 8-core CCDs but disabled four cores on the Ryzen 9 3900X, dropping it down from 16 to 12 cores. Physically we're there and that's the important thing.
The CPU has been spotted behind the scenes
There has been just as much evidence the 16-core CPU exists as any other, but some even clearer news came from Tech YES city's YouTube channel , which claims to have gone behind the scenes at AMD's event today and seen a 16-core AMD CPU running at up to 4.25GHz. The score isn't dissimilar to the one I added to my CPU performance graph a few days ago, which you can see below, and is as you can see, a spectacular result for a mainstream desktop CPU.
Cinebench performance of AMD's Zen 2 16-core CPU has supposedly emerged
Antony Leather The Ryzen 9 3900X has a TDP of just 105W
There's more evidence that X570 motherboards can handle a little more power too. In an interview with Asus ROG's Andrew Wu, bit-tech teases some details where he all but confirms that there's another more powerful CPU waiting in the wings and that current motherboards will be able to provide enough power.
Model Cores/Threads TDP (Watts) Boost/Base Freq Total Cache SEP (USD) Availability Ryzen 9 3900X 12/24 105W 4.6/3.8GHz 70MB $499 July 7, 2019 Ryzen 7 3800X 8/16 105W 4.5/3.9 GHz 36 MB $399 July 7, 2019 Ryzen 7 3700X 8/16 65W 4.4/3.6 GHz 36 MB $329 July 7, 2019 Ryzen 5 3600X 6/12 95W 4.4/3.8 GHz 35 MB $249 July 7, 2019 Ryzen 5 3600 6/12 65W 4.2/3.6 GHz 35 MB $199 July 7, 2019 However, given that the Ryzen 9 3900X only has a TDP of 105W, adding four more cores would see that rise to 140W at most (that's bumping things up by 33%, but includes the power of the power of the I/O die, which clearly wouldn't increase), which is still 25W less than Intel's Core i9-9980XE, which certainly doesn't need more than a single 8-pin power connector to run properly. It may need some decent power circuitry to get there, but I consider power to be a non-issue too.
AMD is likely waiting to see what Intel's plans are with Cascade Lake.
While AMD might just have wanted to hit the Computex deadline and didn't quite have the 16-core CPU's specs nailed down in time, perhaps the most logical explanation for its omission thus far is to wait and see what Intel does with its next generation high-end desktop Cascade Lake CPUs. This is a very sound decision for the simple reason that the 16-core CPU has proven itself to be capable of toppling the current Intel desktop flagship, the Core i9-9980XE.
Intel's Core i9-9980XE
Antony Leather Now, AMD clearly doesn't know exactly what Intel will come up with, but with Intel expected to announce Cascade Lake with details in the near future, it would make more sense to wait and see just how much of Intel's CPU range it could slay for its marketing material. Launching now with plenty of headroom and missing that top spot would be foolish compared to waiting and pushing the clocks a little higher for victory once you know the other player's hand.
Needless to say, AMD already has a spectacular line up, which I can't wait to start testing, but be sure to follow me for more news on how this final little chapter plays out."
"You Should Try Sydney's Famous, Luscious Bakery Now In New York",www.forbes.com,Laurie Werner,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauriewerner/2019/05/27/you-should-try-sydneys-famous-luscious-bakery-now-in-new-york/,"On the day that Bourke Street Bakery opened in New York's NoMad in early May, the line to get in extended all the way down the block. Inside, it was standing room only and Australian accents filled the air as they examined the cases of sausage rolls, pastries, sandwiches and breads. They knew the quality of the products that fill those cases from the 15 year old iconic bakery with outlets throughout Sydney. And the same quality is guaranteed because the co-owner and baker Paul Allam, his wife Jessica Grynberg, who manages the front of house, moved to New York with their three children to open the first international branch. It wasn’t a calculated business move. “We just love New York,” Allam explains. “We traveled a lot. We first came to New York on holiday in 2007 and just fell in love with it.”
A selection of Bourke Street Bakery tarts.
Courtesy of Bourke Street Bakery ADVERTISEMENT In most regards, the offerings in the new bakery/cafe are similar to the ones revered by regulars back home—artisan breads produced with superlative ingredients such as organic miche sourdough and everything ficelle (think everything bagel for ingredient toppings), lamb& harissa sausage rolls and pastries such as pear Danish, pain au raisin and the ginger crème brulee tart that is apparently a favorite of star London chef Yotam Ottolenghi . Some alterations have taken place for the American debut, however: the fig and cranberry sourdough isn’t on the New York menu because Americans apparently don’t want figs in their bread and the prune sourdough is renamed dried plum (prune is apparently an unpopular name.) And some items have been added to appeal to Americans such as cinnamon buns and PB&J bunny rolls.
Baking times are listed so customers can get their signature breads fresh from the oven.
Courtesy of Bourke Street Bakery Allam is using ingredients mostly from the Northeast (the exception is lamb flown in from Australia for the sausage rolls because he couldn’t find a texture that worked from the U.S.), milling grains from Maine on site and starting to bake at 4 AM. The times that the bread will be ready are posted so customers can get them hot from the oven--from white sourdough available when they open at 7 AM every day and everything ficelle every day at 11 to specialty breads such as pain d’epices on sale on Mondays at 9 AM. There are also really delicious sandwiches and salads such as Wilbur’s sandwich (slow roasted fennel infused pork shoulder and broccoli with cheddar and dijonnaise on white sourdough) and smoked trout salad with Brussels sprouts, pickled cabbage, fennel, freekeh (a high fiber whole grain), arugula and lemon. There’s also a late afternoon/early evening menu including gnocchi and charcuterie. And if there is any bread left from the day’s baking, it’s a good idea to take a loaf home."
Is Barcelona's Lionel Messi Worth $84m per year?,www.forbes.com,Jason Pettigrove,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonpettigrove/2019/05/27/is-barcelonas-lionel-messi-worth-84m-per-year-2/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin FC Barcelona's Lionel Messi, centre, is often labelled as the world's best player, and whilst he should acquire a salary commensurate with that elevated position, can $84m annually be justified? (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) ASSOCIATED PRESS Unless you’ve been stuck under a rock for the last 14 years, the chances are you will have heard of Lionel Messi, even if your interest in soccer is fleeting.
The Argentinian has defied the boundaries of what is possible on a football pitch and at 31 years of age is, evidently, still getting better.
When the Catalans won the 2018/19 La Liga title, it meant that Messi extended his record of being the most decorated player in Barcelona’s history . His two goals against Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final gave him 600 club goals , 14 years to the day since he scored his first.
When you consider that second on the all-time list, Cesar Rodriguez, a monster of a soccer player for the Blaugranes in the 1940s and 50s, is way back on 232, it puts the Argentinian’s goalscoring achievements into perspective.
For that kind of talent, it’s obvious that big bucks will change hands.
Forbes’ 2018 ranking of the world’s highest paid athletes had Messi in second place behind Floyd Mayweather, with a salary of $84m per season. Add in endorsements of $27m and the No.10 banked a cool $111m in the period.
So how does one justify such an incredible spend?
Well, straight off the bat we must consider Messi’s standing in the game, both currently and historically. Although Juventus’ Cristiano Ronaldo can lay claim to sit at the same table, Messi is generally recognised as the best footballer around because he is, more often than not, the best dribbler, the best passer, the top scorer etc. etc.
These are all definable metrics which act as tools to measure his status as the world’s best. Once such a level has been attained, that invariably costs money.
Ronaldo certainly enters the conversation in terms of who can be considered top dog, but he’s largely considered to be an incredibly talented, voracious and incessant goal scorer as opposed to an all-rounder.
Indeed, many ex-professionals have no issue in anointing the Barca player in that particular argument, whilst tipping a hat in Ronaldo’s direction.
To that end, supporters want to attend the Camp Nou to see Messi, and sponsors want to have their brands associated with him. It’s no coincidence then to see that the Deloitte Football Money League 2019 has Barca second (only to Real Madrid) in terms of revenue; $690.4m.
The Blaugranes have leapfrogged Manchester United into that second spot, and one can be fairly confident that if Messi continues to perform at his present exceptionally high level, income from various sources will only increase.
His importance to his club side too is unquestionable. ‘Messidependence’ has become a watchword in Spain, denoting how different Barcelona are when they play with their talisman and without him.
Whilst it can’t be said that they are two ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ teams, there can be a noticeable difference on occasion. With him in the XI, Barca are often an attacking force par excellence, and without him they can look like any other team.
The winning of trophies is therefore more likely with him in situ, and with prize money for so doing at record levels (last season’s Champions League winners pocketed $101.2m in prize money), the value that Messi can bring is obvious.
Add in that his shirt is the most sold in club shops ( and the most sold worldwide in 2015 ), and social media interaction and engagement goes off the scale whenever Barca tweet/Insta or Facebook about Messi, and the $80m doesn’t seem so vulgar after all.

The other all-Premier League final is set for Saturday, in Madrid, with Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur vying for the Champions League title. At stake for Chelsea is another European trophy to add to the other five won since 1971. For Arsenal, making it a hattrick of European trophies is very much secondary to the automatic qualifying spot to the 2019/20 Champions League group stage that goes with winning the Europa League.
Chelsea has no such pressure having finished 3rd in the Premier League, Arsenal was 5th, two points fewer than Chelsea.
It could be the last game in charge of Chelsea for Maurizio Sarri - whether he will be fired or he joins Juventus, ]}has still to be decided.

Chelsea striker Eden Hazard could also be bringing the curtain down on his Chelsea career. Hazard's contract is up in the summer of 2020 and so far he has shown no inclination to sign a new one.
Rather than losing Hazard to a ""Bosman"" transfer, a $120m move ]to Real Madrid this summer is a strong possibility.
The Arsenal squad needs new blood but who might move on is simply conjecture at the moment.
Given that the game is being played in far off Azerbaijan, both teams are well away from home. However, a home team in a game played at a neutral location is always designated, and in this case, it's Chelsea.
Where, when, and how can I watch
The game is being played in the Olympic Stadium in Baku, Azerbaijan on Wednesday, May 29, with an 11:00pm kick-off local time yes, one hour before midnight. That puts the start of the match at 3:00pm ET.
With a stadium capacity of over 68,000, there are tickets still available according to UEFA.com. Arsenal and Chelsea were allocated 6,000 tickets each, but the word is that it has not been an easy sell given the arduous trip and the costs. Nonetheless, local officials are confident of a good crowd.
In the US, you have a number of viewing options - TNT, UniMas, Univision Deportes Network, and fuboTV. Canadian viewers can watch on DAZN. First look inside Olympic Stadium Baku. Azerbaijan FA boss tells us:

Team news
Definitely missing for Chelsea through injury are Antonio Rudiger, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Midfielder and a World Cup winner with France, N'Golo Kante, is considered very doubtful after picking up a couple of injuries over the last few weeks.
Danny Welbeck is an unexpected addition to the Arsenal traveling squad having not played since breaking his ankle late in 2018 against Sporting Lisbon. Defender Rob Holding has missed most of this season after suffering a knee injury and won't return until the new season. Aaron Ramsey, Hector Bellerin, and Barcelona loanee, Denis Suarez are all injured and will not be considered.
Armenian Midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan has not made the trip on account of security concerns relating to the bitter political relations between his country and the host nation, Azerbaijan.
The biggest issue playing on the mind of Arsenal Coach Unai Emery is who to start in goal - Cech or Leno .
Chelsea and Arsenal in Europe
The two London clubs have only played each other once in European competition.
It was in 2004, the season of the Arsenal ""Invincibles."" Invincible in the Premier League but not in the Champions League.
After a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge in the first leg of the quarter-final of the Champions League, the aggregate score was 2-2 with extra time looking likely. But, up popped an unlikely scorer in the form of Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge to give Chelsea a 3-2 win. Chelsea went out in the semi-final round to Monaco.
Keep an eye on
Without Aubameyang or his striking partner, Alexander Lacazette, playing well it is difficult to see a way Arsenal can beat Chelsea. Lacazette and Aubameyang combined to score all of Arsenal's 7 goals in the semi-final against Valencia.
By the same token, the striking partnership of Aubamey and Lacazette could easily be undermined by an Arsenal defence that oft times is as useful as a chocolate teapot.
So for Arsenal to win Aubameyang, Lacazette and the defence need to play very well. If one or both doesn't turn up, the Europa League trophy will be adorned with blue ribbons.
Odds
Chelsea is the bookmakers favorite with odds from various sources coalescing around +140 (UK 7/5). Arsenal's odds are +200 (2/1) and a draw +225 (9/4). The over/under on 2.5 goals in the game is -117.65 (17/20).
FiveThirtyEight.com makes Chelsea the probable winner with a 60% chance.
Hold on, the goal is under review
Although VAR (Video Assistant Referee) has not been used in the Europa League to date, it will be up and running for the final. An all-Italian on-site officiating crew of Referee Gianluca Rocchi, Assistant Referees Filippo Meli and Lorenzo Manganelli, and 4th official Daniele Orsato will be in charge. The VAR crew is headed up by Massimiliano Irrati, also from Italy.
The Money
The legendary Swiss Ramble has crunched the numbers.
#AFC Europa League revenue is €36m for reaching the final, down from €38m last season.

By the numbers
1 - Should Chelsea win, it will the first major trophy for Maurizio Sarri.
3 - If UEFA ever considers renaming the Europa League trophy they may want to ponder the name, Unai Emery. The Arsenal coach has already won the competition three times (2013–14 , 2014–15 , 2015–16 ) with Sevilla. Emery has been involved in 73 Europa League matches with the next nearest manager at 52.
5- Surprisingly, given the high-wire act that is the defence, it is the number of clean sheets posted by Arsenal in the Europa League this season.
7 - The number of assists recorded by Chelsea's Willian in this edition of the Europa League.
8 - The goals scored by Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in this season's Europa League.
10 - The goals scored by Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud, who is the joint top scorer in this season's Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt's Luka Jovic.
11 - The number of Europa League games this season won by both Arsenal and Chelsea. However, Chelsea is unbeaten having drawn 3.
17 - The number of games unbeaten in the competition by Chelsea and it is a record. The streak started in April 2013.
93 - The minutes on the clock when Ivanovic scored the winning goal for Chelsea in the 2013 Europa League final against Benfica.

The good news comes in jobs. Attention on hiring veterans seems to have helped. The unemployment rate for vets at the end of 2018 was at 3% while the nonveteran rate dropped to 3.5%.
Fast forward to the April 2019 jobs numbers . The unemployment rate for veterans was 2.3%, down from 3.7 percent in April 2018. There's good and bad here. The overall number is good, especially compared to the 3.6% overall rate.
Things look less rosy when it comes to gender difference. Female veterans have taken a significant hit. The unemployment rate was 2.1% for men in April, down from 3.9% the year before. But in April 2018, female veterans had an unemployment rate of 1.9%. This year it's 4.1%.
There's a disparity that runs first one way and then the other. Samples are in the millions with labor force participation rates topping 79%, far above the roughly 63% of the overall labor force. Gulf War I-era veterans and those from the Vietnam, Korean War, and World War II had gender unemployment rates that were roughly even. It was veterans from Afghanistan, Iraq, and other wars and actions from the same era where the unemployment saw such disparity. Men went from 5.2% to 1.1% year over year; women went from 3.2% to 5.4%. The numbers from those groups are significantly larger.
There's something going on with no explanation that I can see. The most recent examination by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is for 2018 but it misses the sharp difference new, only discusses relative numbers, and doesn't generally address such differentials. Explanations are typically left to macroeconomic figures.
As the George W. Bush Presidential Center notes, there is a lot that figures leave unknown .
The unemployment rate is certainly one indicator, but it alone is insufficient in addressing our warriors’ career interests, opportunities, and challenges. The number is derived from a questionnaire the Bureau of Labor Statistics sends out. However, the question is not specific in nature. Meaning a veteran could work a full-time job or it could mean they only work 10 hours a week or are a reservist and don’t have a civilian career. Finally, not counted are those who have just given up in trying to find work.
We need greater understanding in general of unemployment and under-employment, and specifically for veterans. Are they getting integrated back into society successfully enough after potentially putting themselves in danger and very possibly risking PTSD? To what degree does ""unemployment"" ignore those who are now incapable of working, whether due to physical or psychological reasons?
Another area that needs attention is veteran homelessness. This has been a topic of repeated releases from the Veterans Administration over the last couple of years, but there needs to be accurate data that is maintained to see changes over time. A list of quick facts about the topic mentions statistics through 2015.
The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness shows state-level estimates of individuals and families that are homeless. The last statistics showing are from the annual January homeless count from 2018. There are some states with large numbers of homeless vets, like 10,836 in California, 2,543 in Florida, 1,935 in Texas, or 1,636 in Washington State.
This should be unheard of, but it clearly isn't. There should be more attention in a practical way, as in solutions, not talk. Especially after unbroken years of war. And that might be the best way to end the problems of unemployment and homelessness among veterans: Stop spending money on wars that seem to do nothing but transfer more wealth to the manufacturers of weapons and military systems."
Summer Vacation Inspiration: The Top Three Destinations,www.forbes.com,Elva Ramirez,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/elvaramirez/2019/05/27/summer-vacation-inspiration-the-top-three-destinations/,"City Of Westminster, London. Photo: Getty Getty All it takes is one flight.
The change in the weather got you thirsty to take off on Friday for somewhere new? You're not alone. According to recent data from hotel booking app Hotel Tonight, users are looking into getting away to international destinations like London, Paris and Puerto Rico. ADVERTISEMENT
According to U.S.-based searches from Hotel Tonight's over 32 million users, between March 25 - May 27, the top three destinations are: London: 22% more searches than Paris Paris: 52% more searches than Puerto Rico San Juan, Puerto Rico: 16% more searches than Barcelona
London, with its vibrant food and drink scene, its glamorous royals and its historic sites, tops the list of most-searched locales for a reason. If you're going to London, the late spring-early summer is among the best times to visit. Expect temperate cool temperatures and a break from the famed British rain.

If you're a food and drink fan, be sure to put some of London's top bars on your list . The American Bar at the Savoy is a must. The famed bar's most recent menu features an industry first: An album, available on Spotify and Apple Music, that accompanies the signature cocktails. Other top bars include the newly debuted Lyaness, from the team behind the lauded Dandylyan; Coupette, which boasts some of the city's most buzzed about drinks; Satan's Whiskers; FARE; Bar Swift; and Bar Termini, which is rightfully famed for its Negroni variations.
London, unsurprisingly, is home to some of the most luxe hotels in the world. The Savoy, founded over 100 years ago, remains the definition of class and discreet, elegant service. Also consider The Gore London – Starhotels Collezione, which boasts a bar that was once a favorite haunt of the Rolling Stones. Nearby, in glamorous Hyde Park, you'll find the COMO The Halkin and the COMO Metropolitan London, two properties founded with a focus on wellness, sumptuous comfort and a retreat from the outside.

Paris, with its romantic allure and cinematic sights, is a close second in searches. June is the start of high season in Paris, which means now is the time to score deals on hotels, like the rarified Hotel de Nell, located in the 9th district.
Stroll down to the Marais, where you'll find boutiques filled with goods from emerging local designers, and bars like Little Red Door, Candelaria and Bisous, that are the toast of the cocktail world. San Juan, Puerto Rico. Photo: Getty Getty ADVERTISEMENT
If you want a beach vacation with a short flight time, there's few better options than Puerto Rico . The island nation, which is still recovering from a devastating hurricane, is welcoming the tourist economy, which is key to revitalizing its economy.
After a much-buzzed about January revival of ""Hamilton"" (featuring the return of Lin-Manuel Miranda), Puerto Rico is hoping the attention lingers on. Given that it's the third-most searched for destination on Hotel Tonight, the interest continues. There are many hotel options but for a luxe, pampered stay, look up the Ritz-Carlton Dorado Beach resort, with prime beach views, cabanas and four-star spa services.
Take a weekend off and wander in and out of bars Old San Juan, many of which are blasting dance music and hosting impromptu dance parties. Jungle Bird. Elva Ramirez
There are two bars that every Puerto Rico visit should include: La Factoria and Jungle Bird. These are two bars popular with the locals and the bar industry at large, and for good reason. You'll find some of the island's most inventive cocktails, which take on classic recipes and give them updated riffs. ADVERTISEMENT
Take a long walk in Santurce es Ley, an arts-centric neighborhood which commissions murals from local and international visual artists. You'll find block after block of gorgeous, lovingly crafted street paintings in a range for visual styles (even pointillism). A mural in Santurce es Ley, Puerto Rico. Elva Ramirez

'Deadpool' Could Be Heading In An Unexpected Direction,www.forbes.com,Dani Di Placido,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2019/05/27/deadpool-could-be-heading-in-an-unexpected-direction/,"The massive merger of Disney and 21st Century Fox left the future of certain franchises in flux, but the return of X-Men and Deadpool into the realm of Marvel Studios sparked excitement, with fans certain that the characters would eventually join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the only question being how, and when. An intriguing rumor at MCU Cosmic suggests the studio is considering ideas beyond a simple Deadpool 3 ; the merc with a mouth purportedly could star in his own Disney+ series, or (more intriguingly) even team up with Spider-Man in his third MCU film.
Combining Deadpool with Spider-Man is a very interesting idea - the concept has already been tried and tested by Marvel comics, the two characters proving to have great chemistry.
The idea also appears to feat neatly with the MCU incarnation of Spider-Man, which has always viewed the character in the context of a wider world, packed with superheroes, most of which he looks up to. The surrogate father/son relationship between Iron Man and Spider-Man in Homecoming , soon to be memorialized in Far From Home , could conceivably be followed by a brotherly bond between Deadpool and Spidey.
It’s not difficult to imagine Spider-Man tasked with keeping Deadpool in check, teaching the chaotic character how to be a hero, like a young brother attempting to keep a troubled older sibling from going off the rails.
And with Far From Home reportedly introducing the multiverse to the MCU, the interdimensional door is open for Deadpool to make a grand entrance from his parallel cinematic universe, intact. Well, almost.
A Disney+ series and a Spider-Man team-up would most certainly require a shift in tone from Deadpool, meaning no more excessive gore or adult language. While these aspects certainly separate Deadpool from his fellow family-friendly superheroes, they don’t define him; it should be possible to retain the spirit of the R-rated antihero within the confines of PG-13.
Of course, this is only a rumor, and should be taken with a heap of salt. But the possibility of taking Deadpool in a new direction is exciting, especially if it influences the story of Spider-Man, whose brand has taken so many dramatic twists and turns over the years that it requires near-constant reinvention, in order to stay fresh.
Tom Holland’s Spidey was thoroughly upstaged by Sony’s surprisingly terrific Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse , but teaming up with Deadpool might just deliver something special."
Nat Geo Series 'The Hot Zone' Highlights Threat From Diseases Of Poverty,www.forbes.com,Tony Bradley,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2019/05/27/nat-geo-series-the-hot-zone-highlights-threat-from-diseases-of-poverty/,"Ebola virus. The disease is a household name—synonymous with terrifying pandemics like the Bubonic plague , or swine flu . The Ebola virus had a fatality rate of 90 percent at one point—meaning 9 out of 10 people who became infected with the Ebola virus died as a result. “ The Hot Zone ,” a new series from Nat Geo, is a 6-part drama about the discovery and containment of the deadly virus on US soil. The series is based off of the book of the same name by Richard Preston, which is inspired by the true story of Lt. Col. Nancy Jaax (played by Julianna Margulies ) and others and the dramatic events that took place.
I’ve had the chance to watch the first three episodes and, so far, I recommend watching The Hot Zone. I have seen some early reviews whining about a lack of action—but that is silly. I’m not saying the show has an overwhelming amount of action. I am just pointing out that it is silly to expect or complain about a lack of action in a show about the real-life events of the Ebola virus.
I remember when these events happened, and the hysteria that it caused. There was a lot we didn’t yet know about the Ebola virus at the time, and a very real concern that an outbreak would spread rapidly and have catastrophic consequences for the US population.
Disease of Poverty I had an opportunity to speak with Dr. Michael Smit , science advisor to Nat Geo for this show. I was not aware of the relationship beforehand, but as we talked he informed me that Nancy and Jerry Jaax—two of the people who play a central role in these events—are also his aunt and uncle.
Smit had graduated from West Point and served in the US Army with a specialty in combat arms. When the book The Hot Zone was published, he felt compelled to read it because of the family connection and found his new passion—infectious disease. Now his life is dedicated to emerging infectious disease epidemiology, infection control, and pandemic response.
I asked about some of the characters in the show—and whether they are actual people. He explained that a pair of characters that are central to The Hot Zone—Trevor Rhodes and Wade Carter—are fictional characters that are an amalgamation of actual people, combined for the sake of simplifying the story and allowing the author—and subsequently the director—to provide some background on the Ebola virus.
Smit stressed that one thing you can see from the Nat Geo series is how the Ebola virus is a disease of poverty—in other words, a disease that is more prevalent and more deadly for poor people. The Ebola virus spread rapidly in parts of Africa and had a mortality rate of about 90 percent in large part because of the pervasive poverty in the region. For patients in more affluent nations, or patients who can be safely evacuated to countries with more advanced medical facilities, the survival rate for Ebola is over 90 percent.
Media Hype is Harmful When it comes to things like Ebola virus, media hype can do more harm than good. Media seems to either exaggerate the pandemic danger of the threat, or overestimate success in treatment or progress toward a cure. Smit cautioned against sensationalism in either direction, pointing out that the result is either panic disproportionate to the threat, or apathy in the face of a real and/or growing danger.
Ebola is mostly contained and manageable. However, that doesn’t mean the risk is gone entirely. It is still possible for an Ebola outbreak to occur, and Smit emphasized how crucial it is to be prepared if that happens.
Check Out The Hot Zone The Hot Zone premieres tonight, May 27, at 9pm Eastern. The 6 episodes will be aired as a three-night limited series. It is a compelling story. Mark your calendar or set your DVR."
High School Basketball Players Are Now Free To Roll Their Shorts,www.forbes.com,Bob Cook,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2019/05/27/high-school-basketball-players-are-now-free-to-roll-their-shorts/,"In October 2018, I wrote in support of high school basketball players (including, at the time, my own son) who were fighting for the right to roll their shorts . At the time, there were multiple Change.org petitions representing at least five states in which players demanded the right to fold down the waistband of their shorts, which on one level was an expression of style, but on another level was a practical expression of being handed shorts that were too big, so folding down the waistband at least made them fit better. Rolling one's short was technically not allowed, but if you could tuck in your uniform top loosely enough, it would cover up the evidence.
Judging by the high waist, I would guess the player next to my son is rolling his shorts, too. (This photo is from December 2017.)
Bob Cook But for the 2018-19 season, the struggle will be no more. In late April, the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), whose rules are generally adopted by the state high school associations who are its members, lifted the ban on rolling shorts:
A note was added to Rule 3-5-5 to permit folding or rolling the shorts at the natural waistband seam. The new language does state that the shorts have to be in compliance with Rule 3-4-5, which restricts uniform pants/skirts to one visible manufacturer’s logo/trademark/reference.
Theresia Wynns, NFHS director of sports and officials and liaison to the Basketball Rules Committee, said this addition to Rule 3-5-5 modernizes the rule and allows players to adjust the shorts in a manner that serves no harm to the game or its integrity.
One thing I tell my kids about adulthood is that, while it looks like fun, growing up means you go to college to end up in long meetings where you argue about seemingly pointless things like, does the tag on a waistband harm the integrity of the game of basketball. Also, you have bills.
Anyway, I can't imagine the dwindling number of referees are going to do waistband checks, so high school basketball players can feel free to roll their shorts without having to loosen their uniform tuck to hide their crime against the game.
(By the way, NFHS didn't just meet to talk about rolling shorts. In other uniform changes for the upcoming season, the Basketball Rules Committee also allowed headbands to be 3 inches thick instead of 2 inches, and allowed ""hair control devices"" to be in any color, not just the school uniform color. Oh, and for something of perhaps more importance to the dwindling number of referees, assistant coaches can join head coaches in coming onto the floor to break up player fights.)"
The EU Election's 'Green Wave' Is Set To Transform Energy Policy,www.forbes.com,Dave Keating,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davekeating/2019/05/27/the-eu-elections-green-wave-is-set-to-transform-energy-policy/,"Despite many predictions, Europe’s far-right Eurosceptic parties, recently galvanized by former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon, failed to increase their seats in this weekend’s elections for the European Parliament. But one political group was able to defy expectations and come higher than polls predicted – the European Greens. Though their victories were limited to Western European countries, the group as a whole, which combines national Green parties from across the continent, increased their number of seats in the European Parliament from 52 to 67.They had particularly shocking victories in Germany, where they came second, the UK, where they beat both Labour and the Conservatives, and France, where they went from virtually non-existent to the third-largest party. Ireland and Finland also saw huge gains for the Greens.
Initial exit polling suggests that these gains were due primarily to an increase in turnout among young people – though the Greens’ support was by no means limited to the young. Europe has been rocked by protests by young people demanding action on climate change in recent months, which has already moved the needle in the mainstream political debate. But even recent moves my mainstream parties to have more ambitious climate policies was not enough for voters tired of political inaction.
The two main political families which have between them controlled EU politics since these elections began in 1979 – the center-left Party of European Socialists and the center-right European Peoples Party, both lost about 40 seats each. For the first time in the history of the European Parliament, they will not between them have a governing majority.
That means they will have to ally with some of the other parties, and both have already made entreaties to the Greens. The leaders of both centrist camps congratulated the Greens on their victory and noted that voters were clearly asking for more action on climate change. Manfred Weber, the leader of the EPP, has been particularly eager to court the Greens – an unusual move from a conservative group.
But the Greens have already indicated that they will demand significant policy concessions as the price for joining an alliance with either of the main parties. At the very least, these can be expected to include increased 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets , a strengthened EU Emissions Trading System, and tighter targets on transport emissions.
If the Greens' support is necessary to secure confirmation of the next European Commission president and his or her college of 27 commissioners, it can be expected that they will demand that the Commission commit to some specific new emissions reduction proposals in exchange for their support.
“For us it’s a big task and a great responsibility to now put voters’ trust into concrete action to concrete climate protection, into promotion of the social Europe, as well as democracy in the rule of law – here into practice in the European parliament,” said Ska Keller, a German MEP who is the group’s co-leader in the European Parliament.
Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP who is the other co-leader, said that the result shows that recent conversions on Green issues by the mainstream parties was not convincing to voters. “We have begun to see that all of our competitors are beginning to speak about ecological policies and Green policies and so things have changed,” he said. “You all know that when citizens have a choice they often if not always opt for the original option and not any copycats.”
The Thunberg Effect
The past months have seen intense climate protests across Europe, in a movement led by the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. The effects are already being seen in the changing rhetoric of Europe’s parties on the right of the political spectrum.
Parties within the Party of European Socialists and the Green political families have for years called for stronger EU action on climate change. But now those calls are being matched by the European Peoples Party and the European alliance of economic Liberals (ALDE).
The lead candidates of both of these parties, who are in the running to become the next EU Commission president, have both given far more attention to climate change than politicians on their side of the political spectrum usually do. Both the EPP’s Manfred Weber and ALDE’s Margrethe Vestager said during the campaign they would greatly increase the EU’s action to combat climate change if they become president.
This is a distinct change compared to the EPP and ALDE’s stance on climate policy over the past five year term. A recent study by the environmental group Climate Action Network Europe evaluating the parties’ climate action in the current term deemed the EPP to be a “climate dinosaur” scoring just 14.3% - at the very bottom of the pack. ALDE didn’t fare much better, coming in the middle of the ranking at 38%. The Liberals were deemed to be “delayers, who generally support climate action, but do not act with the required urgency:.
“In the last five years conservative and centre parties in the European Parliament have not done enough to stand up for European citizens and protect them from the climate crisis,” says Wendel Trio, the groups’ director. “The youth climate strikes created the momentum for all politicians’ to acknowledge that climate change is a topic they can no longer ignore.”
The change in tone has also been seen from Europe’s national politicians. Although just a few months ago German Chancellor Angela Merkel was suggesting that the climate protesters might be being organized by Russia, last week she cited the protests as a motivating factor for her changing her mind about supporting a ‘net zero’ decarbonisation target for 2050 .
Environmentalists say they are going to work overtime in the weeks following the European election to make sure these politicians keep their climate promises – particularly when it comes to the delicate group formation process in the parliament in July and the commissioner confirmation hearings in September.
""After the European elections we will hold MEPs accountable and make sure that their promises are followed by concrete measures to tackle the climate emergency,” says Trio. “We need a broad alliance of MEPs across the political spectrum fighting for a cleaner, safer and more prosperous Europe.”"

"After A Year In Austin, Top Chef Kristen Kish Is At Home Anchoring The LINE Hotel's Eateries",www.forbes.com,Claudia Alarcón,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/claudiaalarcon/2019/05/27/after-a-year-in-austin-top-chef-kristen-kish-is-at-home-anchoring-the-line-hotels-eateries/,"The iconic mid-century modern building on the banks of Lady Bird Lake has been home to different concepts over the years, but the downtown landmark has finally found its groove with The LINE Austin hotel. Those familiar with the previous incarnations will be stunned at the transformation, which blends a modern aesthetic with the laid-back vibe of historic Austin. It may not be owned locally but does its best to embrace the city's history, art, culture and love for dogs. The hotel's three different dining and drinking destinations are anchored by Arlo Grey, the lakeside restaurant from Top Chef 10 winner and cookbook author Kristen Kish .
Top Chef 10 winner Kristen Kish brings her playfully refined cuisine to Arlo Grey, the restaurant that anchors The LINE Austin hotel.
Timothy Patrick Clancy Kish's culinary style is modern and playful, drawing from her ample experience and memories of dishes from her childhood. Kish focuses on using ingredients from Central Texas, but the flavors are international and eclectic. “I try to find balance between what I love and what is available,” says the young chef, whose passion and humble honesty -a trait rarely found in celebrity chefs -reflect in every single dish. Roughly 80% of ingredients used are sourced from Texas.
With the new open layout and floor-to-ceiling windows, The LINE Austin offers lovely views of Lady Bird Lake and downtown.

The restaurant’s name is “what I would have named my first child,” and in many ways, Arlo Grey is her baby – everything, from the plates and silverware to the flower vases and gorgeous water pitchers – was hand-picked. Decor includes artwork made from her cooking notebooks and childhood mementos, and the bathroom walls are covered in text from Korean Cinderella, which her mom used to read to her. A recording of the story, narrated in Korean, plays in the background.
“The menu items, their placement - everything reflects specific chapters of my life,” she says as she sips an iced coffee. “It’s all very personal.” In Kish’s capable hands, a simple fried broccoli dish turns sublime. Battered with chickpea flour so it’s gluten-free and extra crunchy, the florets sit atop a mirror of Mornay sauce. “One of my favorite things growing up was dipping chicken fingers into canned broccoli cheese soup. This is my grown-up version,” she says. A crispy rice cake served atop a bed of crab meat topped with crispy bacon and herbs reflects her Korean roots, her life in Boston and her new Central Texas home.
Kristen Kish's cooking style focuses on simple dishes that represent meaningful chapters of her life and pay homage to professional mentors.
Sydell Group Although she still pines for the plentiful seafood of New England waters, she is adjusting to what’s available here, building relationships with farmers, ranchers and other purveyors. A current seasonal dessert pairs a buttery almond cake with local peaches poached to perfection. “It’s not about being the best, but about building trust with guests and making them happy. After a year, I am feeling comfortable here.”
The building originally opened in 1965 as The Crest Inn which was home to Club Seville, a dinner and dance club that broadcast live jazz weekly on local radio. The hotel’s informal eatery, Dean’s One Trick Pony, pays tribute to popular nightclub host Don Dean , who managed Club Seville in the late 60s. Located on the ground floor, Dean’s has the look and feel of a Tiki-style dive bar and a menu that nods to the city’s diverse cultural influences. Tropical-tinged drinks and bar snacks are at its core, with highlights including the Dean’s Double burger – two juicy patties doused in queso, a Texas staple that may very well be the fuel with which this town runs.
The Dean's Double burger is the best selling item at Dean's One trick Pony for good reason.
Sydell Group Dean’s also offers two walk-up windows. One faces Congress Avenue so anyone can stop by for a quick to-go bite, which is a popular option for visitors heading to the Congress Avenue Bridge to watch the city’s famous bat colony emerge at dusk. The other window opens at a kiosk where hotel guests can order bites and beverages to enjoy poolside. The spicy Mexican shrimp cocktail served “michelada-style” with an ice-cold lager on the side is the perfect choice.
Beautiful P6 is the perfect spot to watch the Congress Avenue Bridge bats while sipping a refreshing cocktail.
Chase Daniel The recently opened rooftop lounge, P6, is located on the former top deck of the hotel’s parking garage (why previous occupants didn’t think of this is baffling) and offers an unrivaled spot to watch the nightly emergence of the bats. It is a bustling spot, yet the atmosphere is serene, with furnishings reminiscent of a European garden on the patio and a greenhouse-like setting on the inside, complete with picnic tables and wood and wicker bar stools. Bartenders are as skillful as they are amiable, and the menu features Mediterranean-inspired small plates and antipasti by the hotel's Executive Chef Justin Ermini , who oversees all culinary operations at the LINE Austin.

Chase Daniel Beverage director Brian Floyd is responsible for the programs at all three establishments, which posed a welcome creative challenge for the experienced bar manager. “I came up working in such a diverse spectrum of bars and restaurants – dive bars in Nashville and Michelin-starred restaurants in NYC - and found something to love in each of my experiences,” he says.
Dean's One Trick Pony purveys poolside cocktails and snacks in an atmosphere reminiscent of a dive bar.
Chase Daniel The different spaces are all equal to me in their value and importance. Each of the three concepts has their own kind of appeal, and I strive to anticipate what patrons will love in each setting. The All-Time High -the tequila and fresh watermelon cocktail at Dean’s - is perfect for sipping by the pool or enjoying with a cheeseburger. The cocktails at Arlo Grey reflect Chef Kish’s cuisine: elevated yet somehow familiar. At P6, we want people to relax in an elegant space, and the cocktails are designed specifically for that purpose.”
The hotel will host a monthly Poolside Cinema summer series in partnership with the Austin Film Society with poolside screenings to celebrate Texas cinema of the 70's."
"Digital Transformation Is Risky, But Not Transforming Is Even Riskier",www.forbes.com,Joe McKendrick,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2019/05/27/digital-transformation-is-risky-but-not-transforming-is-even-riskier/,"AI & Big Data I track how technology innovations move markets and careers
Some enterprises are embracing digital strategies and are roaring ahead. Others are, well, nervous about the consequences. You can’t blame the nervous Nellies — let’s face it: the digital journey isn’t all sweetness and enlightenment. It’s a messy and disruptive process. Existing products may be cannibalized. Witness the pain many publishers are going through as they move from paper-based subscription models to online models. Employees’ jobs may be re-structured, or even eliminated altogether. Consider the changes call-center staffs are seeing, as more inquiry-based tasks are handled by bots. Can organizations handle digital’s topsy-turvy disruptions? Photo: Joe McKendrick
Oh yes, and there are the executives in charge of it all. Their decision-making processes are likely to be upended, as they are asked to either show the data behind their decisions, or even defer more authority to data-driven decisions that may contradict their own.
Witness the pain General Electric is now encountering, which is now famously in the thick of transforming from an old-line industrial organization to software-driven enterprise.
With all the turmoil digital activities create, the risk managers in organizations — such financial officers, security managers, auditors — are likely to try to apply the brakes to slow down the digital journey. Is this a prudent thing? The folks at PwC have been thinking a lot about the inherent, obvious and not-so-apparent risks that come with digital transformation. They took a close look at the companies that learned to overcome the risks that come with digital activities, revealed in their recent survey of 2,000 executives.
The PwC team’s prognosis of companies that have overcome their fears of digital risks: “They’re digitally fit. They engage early in digital initiatives. And they’re digitally overhauling their own functions by staffing and equipping them with data-driven capabilities (including skills, tools and techniques), by serving up more real-time insights and by acting in concert with their functional peers to deliver a common view of risks.”
More than four in five of the risk-savvy executives, 83%, report they are “ahead or on track with their digital roadmaps” versus 57% of their more nervous counterparts, PwC finds. In addition, 72% of the risk-savvy enterprises are also “meeting or exceeding their expectations of improved customer experience,” versus only 45% of those less able to handle risks.
While the report is targeted at risk managers, the report serves as well-grounded guidance to those who need to overcome resistance and nervousness across their ranks as they step into the digital realm. The report’s authors outline six habits of successful digital risk-handlers:
They go “all-in” into their organization’s digital plan. For starters, there’s the question of what, exactly, “digital transformation” means. Beyond simply bringing in new technology or increasing efficiency, it means “new ways of solving problems, of creating unique experiences for customers and employees, and of accelerating business performance.” Companies ahead of the curve make their digital vision “actionable and measurable.”
They upskill and inject new talent to move at the speed of the organization. “It takes continual investment to keep skills fresh as technology evolves and to keep digitally skilled resources satisfied.”
They find the right fit for emerging technologies. “Emerging technologies such as AI, robotic process automation (RPA), and the Internet of Things are taking efficiencies to new levels.” Automate key functions to “free capacity and shift resources to be able to work on more value-added insights and analysis.”
They enable the organization to act on risk in real time. This requires well-governed, accessible and trustworthy data.
They actively engage decision-makers of key digital initiatives. “Continuously connect with stakeholders about the risks stemming from innovations.”
They collaborate to provide a consolidated view of risks . “The ability to correlate data points across existing and new data sources will lead to greater collaboration across the lines of defense and more dynamic risk identification, monitoring and testing.”
With digital transformation on the horizon for just about every organization, being aware of — and knowing how to deal with — its inherent risks is essential. Digital is risky, but shying away from digital transformation is even riskier.

7 Community-Building Lessons From Magento,www.forbes.com,Goldie Chan,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/goldiechan/2019/05/27/community-magento/,"Brent Peterson, Susan Peterson sport Wagento-themed jerseys with Amber Osbourne and author. Themed clothing around the Magento ecosystem is very popular.
goldie chan 2. Build a family.
A key part of growing a strong community is developing a strong bond with the demographic within it. Cooper Harris, CEO of Klickly, an official Magento Partner offers, "" During the opening night party of Imagine, I was chatting with Bob Schwartz, former CEO of Magento, and he explained that one of the key early successes of Magento was creating an amazing community or 'family' around their platform. Being a Magento Partner, we at Klickly have really run with this idea of community. In fact, some of our biggest growth has come from the organic relationships we’ve built with fellow solutions and agencies in the ecosystem. When it comes to growing a community, we’ve seen - in e-commerce - that it’s best to start close to home and let things build organically around a shared passion for innovation and empowering e-commerce efforts."" Growing an audience from a few to many requires a company to care about their community and build solid and real relationships.
Cooper Harris, CEO of Klickly prepares for a Magento-themed livestream with author. A Ron Burgundy impersonator looks on.
Amber Osbourne 3. Research trends.
While community-building is incredibly relationship-based, knowing statistical trends as they are happening is also helpful for growing a community.
Peter Sheldon, Adobe's Senior Director of Strategy about trends in e-commerce, suggests, "" In order to acquire new customers and to maximize customer loyalty, brands need to choreograph meaningful shopping experiences from start to finish. Brands must do the research and act now to ensure that they have the right platform to allow rapid growth, but to also ensure that they have a flexible platform that will allow them to adapt to unforeseen changes as e-commerce increasingly becomes the dominant channel for both B2C and B2B purchases."" Adaptation is part of growing a strong community that lasts and is able to change as trends change.

Jason Woolsey, VP, Commerce Product & Platform at Adobe during the opening speech for Magento Imagine (left) and Michael Fassbender, actor (right).
Riccardo Tempesta 4. Cooperate AND compete.
While it may seem counterintuitive to work with the competion, the Magento community has an incredibly friendly atmosphere that promotes ""coopetition"" - the idea of cooperation and competition built together. Magento businesses often refer work and clients to each other as well as educational resources.
Kuba Zwolinski, founder of Snow.dog, states, "" First two people I met at Imagine 9 years ago introduced me to the world of 'coopetition' and shaped my business approach. With every next Imagine and Meet Magento I was discovering how important is role of such community in running ethical business.""
Phillip Jackson, a key voice in the Magento community, lands on the floor during Imagine Sneaks, an insider look portion of Magento Imagine.
Phillip Jackson 5. Amplify each other.
The idea of building up others within a community is not a new idea. However, it makes sense for eCommerce brands that are often created in isolation to reach out to and connect with other brands to grow potential audiences and sales. Vincenzo Landino, Creator and Producer at creative video studio, Aftermarq Community, suggests, ""Building is so important for e-commerce brands today because it creates an identity where consumers can -- and will - support and amplify one another. The strength of a community is a testament to a powerful brand."" It is this amplification that helps any community grow stronger and any brand grow more profitable.
Speaker Gary Vaynerchuck speaks in detail about growth and trends at Magento Imagine.
Goldie Chan 6. Encourage the momentum.
The Magento community is incredibly special. Each year, meetups occur all over the world around the platform that are organized internally by the community, without brand support. TJ Gamble, CEO of Jamersan, knows the strength of the community, Gamble offers, "" The Magento Community is what makes the platform so special. The energy and momentum that it provides makes it impossible for other platforms to keep up.""
Magento Imagine party with the greater community and brand partners affiliated with Magento.
Guido Jansen 7. Be thoughtful.
The thoughtfulness behind the community is also clearly evident. Guido Jansen, Cognitive Psychologist and Digital Customer Experience Consultant, suggests, ""B ring some small treats/gifts from your home town/country to share with the people you connect with and they will help you stand out from the crowd. It's hard to remember all the different business cards, but they'll remember my stroopwafels."" So next time you would like to impress your community at an event, bring a special thoughtful gift - like stroopwafels.
The Magento community's dedication to each other is what has helped the brand grow meaningfully and thoughtfully over the past few years and will continue to help both the brand and the community flourish. It is this same real community that will allow the platform to continue to grow and thrive.

5 Vehicles To Test Drive This Summer,www.forbes.com,Robert Duffer,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertduffer/2019/05/27/5-vehicles-to-test-drive-this-summer/,"With auto show season over and all those hyped-up new vehicles heading to dealer lots, it’s time for driving season. In a recent drive program featuring 80 vehicles from more than a dozen automakers, several vehicles exceeded expectations and affirmed that you can still get a great car at a good price. And there were one or two that proved money can buy you happiness, at least behind the wheel.
In the sun and the fog, the heat and the rain, vehicles were tested on the streets of bucolic Elkhart Lake, Wisc., off-road, on autocross and controlled track laps at one of America’s greatest race tracks, Road America, for the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s annual spring rally.
If you’re in the market or just like to test drive new cars, here are five that impressed with overall quality and value, excluding the Jeep Gladiator Rubicon pickup truck covered last week. The only regret is being last on a line cut short to drive the 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350. Based on my love for the Bullitt Mustang and the reactions of a handful of other drivers who drove the Shelby, it certainly would have made this list.
Best affordable sports car: 2019 Hyundai Veloster N
2019 Hyundai Veloster N on the autocross grid at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisc., on May 23, 2019
Robert Duffer On two 4-mile track laps, once in the damp fog and once in the dry sun, two things held firm: it was easy to control in corners both wet and dry and the braking was outstanding. In fact, in back-to-back laps with the BMW M2, which has been a favorite since 2016, the Veloster N braked with greater control and harder inputs than the autocross master M2. Later, in trials on the tight, serpentining autocross course, the front-drive Veloster N never understeered, and was easier to control than the Nissan 370Z, the Volkswagen GTI, the M2 and other available vehicles. There are quicker cars than the 275-horsepower 2-liter turbo 4 Veloster N, and the M2 was the autocross champ with its hearty acceleration and willingness to rotate. But the Veloster N impressed everyone I spoke with who got behind the wheel. Most impressive thing? Fully trimmed out, the new Veloster N costs under $30,000. That’s less than half the price of the M2.
Base price: $26,900
As driven: $29,885 (including $885 destination)
Best family vehicle: 2020 Kia Telluride
2020 Kia Telluride tackles the off-road terrain off Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisc., on May 22, 2019.
Robert Duffer Kia’s large three-row SUV has Land Rover styling, American spaciousness, and Kia pricing. The roomy third row is easy to get in and out of with push buttons on the top of the mid-row seats, and there’s still room enough in the cargo area for a carry-on for all seven or even eight passengers. The premium SX V-6 I tested was smooth and quiet on the street, even with 20-inch wheels, but also had modest off-road capability. The AWD-system handled muddy ruts, the 8-inch ground clearance helped get it over the humps, and the center differential sends up to 252 pound-feet of torque equally to both axles, same as in the Kia Sorento. It’s great for slick conditions, and is capable for heading out to hunting grounds or down the long unpaved path to a lake house. At a loaded price just under $47,000, it’s hard to see why customers would opt for the Sorento over the larger, better Telluride. It’s not as hard to see why consumers would choose it over the Volkswagen Atlas and other three-rows crossovers.
Base price: $43,490
As driven: $46,860 (including $1,045 destination)
Most curious ride: 2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI
2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI queues up at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisc., on May 22, 2019.
Robert Duffer Unlike American automakers, Volkswagen is not shying away from sedans. It showed off the Audi-ish Arteon full-size sedan, which replaced the sleek but low-selling CC. The real curiosity was Jetta GLI. Consider it a budget alternative to the Golf GTI in sedan form. Everything about the GTI feels right, and most of that carries over to the GLI, including the 2-liter turbo four-cylinder with the effortless six-speed manual churns out 258 pound-feet of torque. In back-to-back autocross laps the front-drive GTI Rabbit plowed more than the GLI with the same sized wheels and all-season tires. It was most likely due to driver expectation. Even with the GLI starting $3,000 less than the $29,995 GTI, I would have to spend a lot more time behind the wheel of both to recommend the GLI over the GTI, and even then, I doubt I would due to hatchback versatility. But if you’re considering the GTI, a test drive of the GLI is in order.
Base price: $26,995
As driven: $27,890 (including $995 destination)
Best interior: 2019 Mercedes-AMG CLS53 Coupe
Interior of the 2019 Mercedes-AMG CLS53 Coupe.
Rpbert Duffer With nearly every model getting an AMG performance variant, including the boxy G-Class SUV, the Mercedes product lineup has never been more varied, confusing and pricey. Yet the AMG CLS53 might be that perfect balance of supersmooth cruising and gut-dropping power with exquisite interior design that is not ostentatious. The spartan black dash with natural grain grey ash wood extending to the doors and throughout the center console is the expression of luxury. It’s silvery, almost chrome looking, but textured so that if you rub your hand on it you feel the wood. On a quick street drive, it was so quiet and insulated it felt electric, but hammer the throttle and the 429-horsepower 3-liter turbo inline six cylinder with nine-speed transmission roars into a blistering sports coupe.
Base price: $79,900
As driven: $106,980 (including $995 destination)
Everyday supercar? Acura NSX
2019 Acura NSX waits in the fog at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisc., on May 22, 2019.
Robert Duffer Discontinued in 2005 and resurrected for 2018, Acura was touting this everyday supercar long before McLaren’s Sport Series and Audi’s R8. Acura’s oxymoron consists of an advanced hybrid powertrain featuring three motors and a mid-engine twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 with a nine-speed dual clutch transmission putting out 573 horsepower. Two motors power the front wheels for AWD hold, while standard Continental SportContact 6 tires upgraded for 2019 provide more grip. It gets 21 mpg combined, but not on the track. I got behind the wheel while the fog was still heavy, the course still wet, and the ride-along instructor less than enthusiastic. Despite the conditions, the NSX takes the breath away and leaves you shaking for more. The cornering and braking, enabled by carbon-ceramic rotors for $10,600, inflated my sense of ability. Just what you want out of an everyday supercar with $37,900 in options. With a base price of $157,500 including gorgeous Indigo blue leather with Alcantara seats standard, the NSX easily outperforms the BMW i8 as an everyday supercar and is more practical than the McLaren 570S. Is practicality a concern for two seats just under $200,000?
Base price: $157,500
As driven: $196,500 (including $1,800 destination)"
Rival Fishers That Cooperate May Ultimately Catch More (And Bigger) Fish,www.forbes.com,Priya Shukla,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/priyashukla/2019/05/27/rival-fishers-that-cooperate-may-ultimately-catch-more-and-bigger-fish/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.

In past years, illegal commercial trawlers parked off Somalia's coast and scooped up the ocean's contents. Now, fishermen on the northern coast of neighboring Kenya say, the trawlers are not coming because of pirates, leaving more fish. (AP Photo/Karel Prinsloo) ASSOCIATED PRESS Globally, billions of people rely on small-scale fisheries for their livelihoods and as a source of food. Yet, despite the important role that these fisheries play, they are currently unable to sufficiently contribute to food security and livelihood quality. This underperformance may be resolved by improving fisheries governance, resolving gaps in science-informed management practices, and directly engaging fishing communities. However, social networks among the fishers themselves can also have downstream ecological impacts. And, a recent study shows that rival fishers that maintain cooperative alliances with one another generally catch high-quality fish in greater quantities.
""The face-to-face contact they share helps them build 'prosocial norms', things like trust and shared visions and conflict resolution,"" says Eliza Oldach , a PhD student at University of California, Davis, studying coastal community adaptation who was not involved in this work, ""That’s a pattern we see in other fisheries, and cooperative situations of all sorts-- face time and communication create an incentive to cooperate and a disincentive to cheat (though other factors are important too!).""
The researchers found that fish abundance and quality were greater in areas where it was common practice for competing fishers to share information about community fishing norms, gear use, and fishing locations. Ultimately, this research shows that actively discussing and addressing concerns related to the fishing environment improves fishers' catches overall.

"" In places where social-ecological network closure isn’t happening-- in other words, where fishers using the same resource aren’t in communication ... building communicative ties between these fishers, [the authors] argue, can help promote those pro-social, cooperative, ecosystem-supporting behaviors, "" says Oldach.
For this research, led by Dr. Michele Barnes , a Senior Social Science Research Fellow at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (James Cook University) in Australia, the scientists gathered data from five coral reef fishing communities in Kenya. They combined interviews with 648 fishers, visual censuses of coral reef condition, and fisheries landings data to understand how the reefs' ecological condition was linked with the social network that exists among fishers.
"" Communication between people that use the same resource can build communities with shared values and rules for managing use of the fishery they share,"" says Oldach, ""And, according to this paper, you see the outcome in the status of the reef .""

Why The S.A.T. Adversity Score Is Worse Than No Score At All,www.forbes.com,Derek Newton,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2019/05/27/why-the-s-a-t-adversity-score-is-worse-than-no-score-at-all/,"The Wall Street Journal and others reported recently that the SAT, the bell cow of academic assessment, would add an “adversity score” to its results, providing more context for assessing the relative strengths of applicants. The new score will add a helpful sense of distance traveled to an otherwise flat assessment of the place of arrival. On the surface, the new policy is a major concession to the obvious, nasty correlation between impressive scores and affluence and other privileges. As such, it’s a probably a good, right-hearted idea and few would argue that knowing more about a student is a bad idea.
Nonetheless, the addition of the adversity score has many serious flaws. The most noted of which is that the information used to calculate the scores – reported to include factors such as neighborhood crime rate, neighborhood poverty rate and high school performance – cannot possibly be a serious proxy for any one student’s actual circumstances.
Conceding these flaws, my former colleague Rick Kahlenberg, argued in The Atlantic that, “even an imperfect adversity score is better than failing to account for the difficulty so many students overcome.”
I wish I could agree.
Kahlenberg and others see half a loaf, and there are a great many occasions in which half a loaf is better than none. But my issue with the SAT’s attempts to point out the legitimate struggles of some test-takers is not that it’s incomplete, which it is, it’s that even this unsatisfying meal will end up on the wrong table.
The New York Times , in reporting on the new score , quoted a college admissions coach saying “he had received emails from parents asking whether their children’s hard work in preparing for the SAT ‘would be completely negated just because we happen to have some means.’”
In other words, many families with “means” will see the adversity score as a slight, an attempt to undercut and minimize their advantages. They are not wrong. That is exactly what the new score aims to do. And if you think those families are going to just accept that, you should refresh your SAT vocabulary skills by listing every synonym you can think of for denial.
As sure as the path of the sun is known, wealthy parents will fudge their children’s enrollments and shade their advantages simply to boost their adversity scores. And based on what we already know about what the SAT will count in its scoring, that’s going to be embarrassingly easy to do.
If being enrolled in a below-average high school will boost your scores, what do you think wealthy parents are going to do days before the SAT registration deadline? If an official address in a poor neighborhood will get you a bump, there’s going to be a raft of suspicious and conveniently timed address changes. It’s only a matter of time before highly-resourced, expensive, elite prep schools establish satellites with official addresses in communities with high adversity scores.
If there’s anything at all that this year’s college admissions cheating and bribery scandal showed it’s that rich people will do anything, even illegal things, to protect their “hard work” and get their spoiled kids into elite colleges. And since changing addresses or enrollments is not even illegal, that’s absolutely going to happen; book it.
When that happens, the SAT adversity score will default to another way some families can game the college admissions system. Like private schools, tutors and SAT prep classes, it won’t be long before enrolling in a private school with an advantageous adversity address will be seen as an investment in success, not cheating.
But this will be even worse because carpetbagging for adversity scores will swipe the opportunities intentionally designed for those who cannot game the system already. And by not looking at student-by-student circumstances, which is probably impossible anyway, the SAT won’t be able to stop it because it won’t be able to see it.
The SAT folks are unquestionably right to recognize the outsized role adversity plays in the assessment process. But what they’ve probably done is hand another tool to people who already have an overflowing toolbox, dangerously underestimating the motivations of those with means to protect what they think they’ve earned."
3 Charts Show Trump’s Economy Is Weaker Than People Think,www.forbes.com,Chuck Jones,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/05/27/3-charts-show-trumps-economy-is-weaker-than-people-think/,"Last month the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that March quarter’s GDP grew a stronger than expected 3.2%. However, when you remove the positive impact from inventories and trade the underlying economy only grew at a 1.5% pace . Cass Information Systems along with Donald Broughton publish the Cass Freight Index on a monthly basis. It describes what it attempts to do, “As we try to navigate the ebb and flow of the economy, we don’t pretend to have any ‘secret sauce’ or incredibly complex models that have exhaustively analyzed every data point available. Instead, we place our trust in the simple notion that the movement of tangible goods is the heartbeat of the economy, and that tracking the volume and velocity of those goods has proven to be one of the most reliable methods of predicting change because of the adequate amount of forewarning that exists.”
In its April report it found that the Index was showing negative year over year growth for five months in a row. If this trend continues or starts to flatten out in negative territory this is not positive for the U.S. economy. This could be a situation as seen in 6 of the past 7 recessions that the economy was looking strong but turned negative in 7 months or less when most economic indicators were showing it to be positive.
The report includes, “Bottom line, the data in coming weeks will indicate whether this is merely a pause in the rate of economic expansion, a retrenchment, or the beginning of an economic contraction. Evidence is accumulating that this is more than ‘just a pause.’ If a contraction occurs, then the Cass Shipments Index will have been one of the first early indicators once again.”
Cass Freight Index
Cass Information Systems The chart below from Cass shows the relationship between its Index and GDP growth without the impacts from inventories and trade. While it does not always match quarter to quarter there is a fairly good relationship. As can be seen in the March 2019 quarter there was a large divergence between the reported 3.2% growth and the negative quarter to quarter change in the Cass Shipment Index.
With the second estimate for the quarter scheduled to be released on Thursday morning Broughton wouldn’t be surprised if it and the final report in June include downward revisions.

Throughout her vast career, which includes urban planning, the sports and entertainment industry and local politics, Laird has taken each pivot in stride and continues to build a legacy.

Woodline Dorcin Newark Symphony Hall’s rich cultural history has been earmarked as New Jersey's oldest and largest showcase for the arts, education and entertainment programming. “I sat on the board of Preservation New Jersey,” Laird explains, “and it was a site that has fallen, for lack of a better word, on hard times. It’s nearly 100-years old and had a lot of significant deferred maintenance. I felt like it was a jewel that had not been polished in some time.” The more Laird learned about the position and responsibilities, the more she wanted the role. The person who recommended her for the position told her she would have to campaign for the position as though it was a presidential campaign.
“It was the challenge,” she laughs, “but knowing that I had a certain set of skills that they probably could not find in one person. I knew economic development. I know how to go after public and private funds. When I was the head of the Division of Economic Development for the city of Trenton I managed a quarter billion dollars and development activity. I had been a grant panelist. I was a special government employee. Again, along the way, while doing Legacy [Laird’s LLC], I was appointed during the Obama administration to the National Endowment for the Arts. I had that experience.”
Before securing her role at Newark Symphony Hall, she served as the executive director at Arts Council of Princeton. While campaigning for the new position, she kept inquiring why she wasn’t being invited in for an interview. “The search firm was very frank,” Laird states matter-of-factly. “They said ‘we can't pay you what you make now. But, I told them that I want the job…I wanted to be part of this success story.”
This year Taneshia Nash Laird was the first recipient in the Innovation in Arts category of the Spectrum Circle Awards for women in Washington, DC.
Silvia Tergas Laird’s entrepreneurial mindset has been a driving force in how she’s conducted business from the beginning of her career. “My very first job I actually talked my way into was at the director of media relations for Planet Rock music,” she states, “which is a record label, an imprint, actually, of the record label Tommy Boy Records which Tom Silverman owned…That was sort of my first foray professionally into the music industry. But then there were all these sorts of twists and turns.”
As Laird’s career grew, she began working on sports marketing projects and even worked for a woman who did interior design for celebrities and athletes. Eventually, she and her now late husband, Roland, partnered up on projects. Together, they had an independent comic book company, published a book and even co-owned Harlem Mist. However, a little over seven years ago Laird’s husband unexpectedly passed away. At the time, they had two small children under the age of seven. “In losing Roland,” she shares, “is when I decided I did not want to go back to work at Mist where I was the head of marketing. And, literally just did not go back.”
Taneshia Nash Laird and her mentor author and philanthropist Danny Simmons co-founder of Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation and the Def Poetry Jam HBO and Broadway shows.
Delilah Peach Williams Prior to the opening of Mist, Laird had created an LLC, Legacy Business Advisors, to enabled her to take on Mist as a client. In the wake of the passing of her husband, she decided that it was time to make Legacy an actual business and bring on more clients. “I had a client that I had picked up here in Newark,” Laird explains, “who is a woman who's doing a dream project, and I realized that that was something that I could do. I could help people fulfill their dreams, whatever that was. I started getting calls about sports stuff, and I hadn't even really been doing sports stuff, and I said, ‘okay, well, let me try doing the sport stuff.’ I did a few things in that arena. But I definitely believe that it was losing my husband, that set me on this path. I just knew that I needed to do Legacy, and I needed to figure that out as a business because I wanted to spend more time with my children. My children went everywhere with me.”
Laird understood from an early age that networking was a major factor to success. She had built and cultivated a powerhouse Rolodex. After her husband passed away she turned to her network to help build her business. Two of her biggest champions were James Worthy and Danny Simmons. This past April, Laird partnered with Simmons to produce the Def Poetry Jam Final Friday night at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to reunite poets from the award-winning HBO and Broadway Def Poetry Jam shows.
Through all of her pivots Laird has learned that the following steps are invaluable to succeeding:
Network with people who are doing what you want to do. They will be able to guide you in the right direction. Be your own advocate. No one will market you better than yourself. You know what you’re capable of; let the world know. Keep going. Life is going to be hard at times but as long as you’re putting one foot in front of the other, you’re bound to get to where you want to be. “I just always followed the opportunity,” Laird concludes. “I want my girls to not be afraid of failure. We all fail at some point. I want them to model my behavior. They not only listen to what you say, but they learn more by what you do.”"
Bill Ford Jr. To Kick Off Israel-based R&D Center At Tel Aviv Mobility Conference Next Month,www.forbes.com,Doron Levin,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/doronlevin/2019/05/27/bill-ford-jr-to-kick-off-israel-based-rd-center-at-tel-aviv-mobility-conference-next-month/,"Ford Motor Co.’s executive chairman will visit Israel next month. He is expected to inaugurate Ford research and development center in Tel Aviv dedicated to autonomous driving and other advanced automotive technologies, based on sources in Israel. Ford declined to confirm the center. William C. Ford Jr., great grandson of Ford’s founder, will address a global gathering of automotive and Israeli technology companies and start-ups at EcoMotion, a four-day conference that begins June 10. Ford is one of many automakers that are prospecting in Israel for resources, partnerships and talent in the global race to meet regulatory and market demands for emissions-free, connected and self-driving vehicles.

This year’s EcoMotion conference marks the seventh year of the annual event, which is partially sponsored by the Israeli government. With a population of 8.5 million, Israel has emerged after Silicon Valley as one of the world’s leading centers for startups and innovation. The country’s high rate of educational achievement, in addition to cyber and other digital technologies employed by its military, have led to the creation of companies like Waze, which was sold to Google, and Mobileye, sold last year to Intel.
“I believe there is a culture in Israel for innovation, and since people see that many startups are being promoted and sold and doing great stuff, it gives you motivation to create more,” Asaf Toker, CEO of SeeVoov, a video-based trip-planning platform, told Apex. Apex is a trade organization for airlines.
In January, Ford announced an ambitious $11 billion progam of investments by 2022 to have 40 gas-electric hybrid and 22 battery-powered fully electric vehicles in its model lineup. Additionally, Ford has committed by 2021 to introduce a fully-autonomous vehicle “that can complete all aspects of driving without a human driver to intervene,” according to a company sustainability report.

© 2018 Bloomberg Finance LP The day when autonomous cars will operate on public highways and will be available for commercial or private use is still years or decades away, due questions about their safety and reliability as well as acceptance by the public. But Ford and other automakers believe that so-called “first-move advantage” could create a tremendous commercial opportunity – and they are in competition with Google and other global tech companies to capitalize.
General Motors was among the first automakers to see potential in Israel’s high-tech community and established a large presence just north of Tel Aviv in Herzliya, which employs several hundred. GM has sponsored hackathons and other activities designed to spot talented software engineers and developers, who are much in demand, as well as partners.
Israel’s Transportation Ministry has encouraged automakers to test autonomous vehicles to Israeli roads and highways, an initiative that has gone relatively smoothly so far.
“Our goal is to fill Israel with autonomous, efficient and electric transportation on demand, which will reduce traffic and congestion,” Anat Bonstein, director of the Fuel Choices and Smart Mobility Initiative at the Prime Minister’s Office told Haaretz last month.
Mr. Ford is an investor in Fontinalis Partners, a Detroit-based venture capital firm that owns a stake in the Israeli cyber security company, Karamba Security, which develops systems to protect vehicles."
5 Money Mistakes That Recent Grads Make,www.forbes.com,Dani Pascarella,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danipascarella/2019/05/27/5-money-mistakes-that-recent-grads-make/,"Since most universities don’t provide financial literacy education, college graduates are left with little to no knowledge when it comes to managing their money. ADVERTISEMENT But conquering your financial life is just as important as landing your dream job. If you’re not keeping any of the money you’re making, snagging a sweet salary isn’t going to matter in the long run.
For those of you that have recently entered the real world and are trying your hand at this adulting thing for the first time, avoid making these mistakes that most grads are guilty of and you’ll already be ahead of the game.
Mistake #1: Spending too much money on housing
Personal finance is far from one size fits all -- but there are a few popular rules of thumb that can serve as a great starting point. One is that you should spend no more than 28% of your salary on housing.
Since many of the most attractive jobs are located in cities that have a high cost of living, most grads end up spending way more than 28% on rent.
If your salary can’t compete with the pricey real estate near your office, you have a few options. The easiest and most common solution is finding a roommate to split costs with. If you prefer to live solo, you can usually find a spot outside of town that is less expensive and commute.
And last but not least, you can wait to relocate until you’ve moved up in your career. Staying local and living at home with your parents for a few years can actually give you a really solid financial foundation if done the right way .
Mistake #2: Not working student loans into your budget
If you have student loans (or any kind of debt), you may need to spend even less on housing. Financial experts recommend keeping your combined housing and debt payments under 36% of your salary.
ADVERTISEMENT Most student loans come with a grace period, so many grads make the mistake of finding a place to live before knowing when their repayment plan starts and how much they’ll actually owe each month.
Your student loans are a fixed cost and it’s important to factor them into your budget before signing a lease.
Mistake #3: Not saving for retirement right away
You’ve probably heard the old saying “time is on your side” and while it may sound cheesy, it’s 100% true. The math does not lie -- the sooner you start saving for retirement the better.
Let’s say two people save $100 each month for retirement, but one starts at age 25 and the other waits until they are 35 to start making contributions. With a 7% average annual rate of return, the person who starts at age 25 will have more than double the amount of money in their account when it’s time to retire at age 65. Even small contributions in your 20s will yield big results later in life.
ADVERTISEMENT On top of waiting to save for retirement, another piggy-back mistake that recent grads make is not taking full advantage of their employer’s match. If your company will match your retirement contributions, they are offering you free money. Don’t leave your match on the table.
Mistake #4: Not saving money from the start
Like drinking water or exercising, saving money is a habit. But 80% of working Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck because they can’t build up their savings.
It’s a dangerous game to say, “I’ll start saving later,” but so many grads make this mistake.
The better move is to start saving now, even if it’s a small amount, to get in the habit of paying yourself first. Set up an automatic recurring transfer on each payday to move some of your cash out of checking and into a high-yield savings account .
Saving shouldn’t be an afterthought or a “maybe later” thing. It should be the first move you make the moment you get paid.
Mistake #5: Not tracking your money moves
ADVERTISEMENT If you care about your finances and are making moves, you need to be tracking your progress. Otherwise, how will you know if you’re moving in the right direction?
The best number to use when tracking financial progress is your net worth. This is calculated by simply subtracting your liabilities from your assets. If your net worth is consistently increasing over time, that’s a sign of good financial health.
Most grads don’t pay attention to this number, but you should calculate it as soon as you start working so that you have a clear picture of your financial situation right now and can make sure you are continuing to improve over time."
Diamond Head Delights Hikers On Oahu,www.forbes.com,Erinne Magee,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinnemagee/2019/05/27/diamond-head-delights-hikers-on-oahu/,"When I lived on Oahu a decade ago, hiking Diamond Head was a means of exercise and the dazzling views from the top were the bonus. ADVERTISEMENT As I recently returned with my 9-year-old daughter, I was thrilled to ascend only to show her the view. The exercise was the bonus.
We took the short, complimentary trolley tide (one of the perks of staying at an Outrigger property) from Waikiki to Diamond Head and it felt nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the town’s center.
After we pulled through the tunnel leading into the crater, I couldn’t believe how much the base of Diamond Head (Hawaiian name: Le’ahi) had grown since I’d last been there. The line of cars and buses just to get enter was something I’d never encountered before. Dole has a mobile unit parked at the edge of the lot, selling the famous Dole Whips and other pineapple treats; at least three tour groups were gathered as their leaders went over history and general hiking information and a souvenir stand was set up.
Since the hike is short (0.8 miles one-way), my daughter and I only packed water bottles (and a snack, since kids have tendencies to suddenly feel a wave of starvation at any given moment). Under the blazing morning sun, I didn’t recall being so out of breath on this trail in my early twenties. I was thankful when my little photographer wanted to stop at a lookout point to take a photo.
The Northeast side of the island from a lookout point along the Diamond Head trail
Erinne Magee When we reached the steep stairwell, indicating the end was near, I didn’t realize until the descend that you can actually forego the steps for a more gradual path that snakes around to the peak. Another “new-to-me” feature. The stairs do lead to a 225-foot lighted tunnel, which is a fun feature for kids (and provides a few brief minutes of shade while you catch your breath).
The top is crowded but the view is just as I remembered: breathtaking. There isn’t much of the island you can’t see from this vantage point, especially on a clear day. During whale season, you may be lucky enough to see a humpback making an appearance above the Pacific. It’s hard to believe when taking in each piece of Oahu’s beauty, that the crater was formed 300,000 years ago. The trailhead was built in the early 1900s as part of the island’s defense system.
ADVERTISEMENT To make the most out of your visit to Diamond Head, consider these tips:
Check the weather
First thing in the morning is best as that’s your best chance to beat the heat. The gates open at 6 a.m. and close at 6 p.m., with the last hikers let in at 4:30.
Bring cash
If you’re walking in, the fee is $1 per person. If you’re driving, expect to pay $5 per car (more if you’re operating a van or other commercial vehicle). Credit cards are not accepted.
Leave Fido at home
Not that many vacationers bring their pets, but should you travel with animals, they are only allowed in the park if they are service animals.
ADVERTISEMENT Use caution in the tunnel
If you aren’t entering the crater in a vehicle, use caution if walking or biking through the tunnel entrance. All trolleys and tour buses do come inside, but if you plan on utilizing The Bus , the stop is outside.
Restrooms are available at the base of Diamond Head.

New Economic Report Shows Most Teachers Have Side Hustles To Make Ends Meet,www.forbes.com,Estelle Erasmus,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/estelleerasmus/2019/05/27/new-economic-report-shows-most-teachers-have-side-hustles-to-make-ends-meet/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Personal Finance I cover the steps and stories of side hustles and second careers. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Smiling school kids raising their hands to answer the question that teacher has asked on a class in the classroom. Getty The Economic Policy Institute just released a report showing that 59% of teachers nationwide—a mostly female-dominated profession— turn to moonlighting or side jobs to supplement their income. Often, the side gigs are not just to supplement their income, but to actually allow them to pay the bills, because they are not making enough at their jobs.
Nobody is saying that teaching—particularly, in public schools—is a high paying profession, but according to the latest report, the news is dire, and is creating a teaching shortage, when teachers quit once they find they can’t handle the stress of moonlighting to supplement their low base salary.
The research shows that teachers are paid a lot less than other college graduates. In fact in 2018 teacher’s weekly wages were 21.4 percent lower than their peers who didn’t teach. Most teachers who moonlit (44.1 percent) took on second jobs such as coaching, student activity sponsorship, mentoring other teachers or teaching evening classes—all during the school year. Teachers who quit, were likely to have low base salaries to start with, and were most likely in high-poverty schools, where they received smaller amounts from moonlighting.
Unfortunately, the current teacher shortage is not only because many teachers in high-poverty schools quit, but also because college graduates refuse to consider a career that offers such poor pay, low starting salaries, financial hurdles of certification and training, lack of funding for schools, and the rising costs of health insurance. Few people want to be in a line of work that gleans less pay and perks, due to a gender pay gap, than in other jobs. In addition, new teachers want to be provided with working conditions and professional development opportunities, found in other fields, and want their wages to reflect a teacher’s real value in the classroom.
Nor do they want the stress of dealing with financial insecurity.
In fact, the most recent MetLife Annual U.S. Employee Benefit Trends study found that the number one source of stress is personal finance; and when people take on a side hustle, which 1 out of 5 do, it is not because it’s a passion, but because of financial necessity. The study also found that 72 percent of employees would like unlimited paid time off, and two-thirds would like to have the option of a paid sabbatical.
Society needs to realize that underinvesting in the people who educate our children, building our human and social capital isn't right. Teachers need to be nurtured and supported. A good start is to offer them higher salaries, so that if they choose, they can moonlight out of passion for education, and not desperation to make ends meet.

The Box Office Failure Of Olivia Wilde's 'Booksmart' Is A Sadly Predictable Tragedy,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/05/27/booksmart-olivia-wilde-box-office-netflix-ghostbusters-avengers-aladdin-netflix-disney-fox/,"Despite the best efforts of Film Twitter, the film critic community and United Artist Releasing’s marketing departments, a movie like Annapurna's Booksmart didn’t have much of a chance in 2019. Sure, the release date wasn’t terrific. Lots of older teens were more likely to see Aladdin and John Wick 3. But it’s not like there is a current scenario where, absent a long and protracted Oscar season run, this one gets anywhere near the $49 million domestic gross of Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird . This isn’t 2009 and Booksmart wasn’t a Universal programmer. The good news is Olivia Wilde’s comedy may be the kind of movie that goes down swinging but results in its filmmakers and cast going on to other high profile/studio work. For example, Short Term 12 , a sweepingly emotional look at the foster care system, earned rave reviews and a cult following in 2013. It also earned a whopping $1.013 million in domestic grosses six summers ago. That said, its director, Destin Daniel Cretton, just signed up to direct Marvel’s Shang-Chi . And its cast, including Brie Larson ( Captain Marvel , Room ), Lakeith Stanfield ( Sorry to Bother You , Get Out ), Kaitlyn Dever ( Booksmart ), Rami Malek ( Mr. Robot, Bohemian Rhapsody ) and Stephanie Beatriz ( Brooklyn 99 ) has done alright. That’s just one example of a cult favorite that has become something of a modern equivalent of St. Elmo’s’ Fire or School Ties .
That’s not to say it’s not a big deal that Booksmart earned just $8.6 million in its Fri-Mon debut this past Memorial Day weekend. It’s yet another example of audiences getting the very thing they claim Hollywood won’t give them and looking the other way. Yes, this is a pet peeve, and yes Hollywood is to blame for taking so long to expand their demographic horizons that they let Netflix, Hulu, cable TV and VOD fill in the gaps among those who don’t want to see the tentpoles. But if you want movies like Booksmart , intelligent, funny, progressive genre flicks that revolve around girls and women, to be produced for theaters, you have to see them in theaters.
We know what's going on here. It's not that audiences are choosing to see Aladdin , John Wick 3 or Avengers: Endgame over Booksmart . It's that the audiences who have no interest in (or have already seen) those tentpoles/event movies are staying home instead of seeking out a different kind of movie. The general moviegoing audience that once saw both the big movies and the smaller movies (relatively speaking) has now turned to various at-home options (Netflix, cable, VOD, etc.) for their filmed entertainment needs. They see the biggest stuff in theaters, and everything else either waits for post-theatrical or gets ignored in favor of the next Netflix binge.
We've seen this over the last four years, as the emergence of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon as major forces for quality, adult-skewing, character-driven television shows (along with niche and often more progressive fantasy television on cable and streaming) has completely filled the vacuum that Hollywood left open in order to dedicate itself almost exclusively to four-quadrant global franchise fare. By the time Hollywood realized that The Avengers was a fluke and tried to get back to making more ""movie-movies"" (and more diverse genre fare) alongside the tentpoles, it was too late and the general audience had acclimated itself to watching what they wanted to watch on their HDTVs and/or laptops.
That's not to say streaming services are the villains (although One Day At A Time should teach you that Netflix is not your friend) or that audiences can be blamed for preferring to watch a movie at home for little-to-no money on a decent sound system and decent HDTV either right when it releases on streaming or when it debuts in post-theatrical 80-120 days after theaters. But when you don't see the kinds of movies you want Hollywood to make when those movies play in theaters, you can't blame Hollywood for no longer making those kinds of movies for theaters. When you ignore Only the Brave or All the Money in the World , you're partially to blame when Sony greenlights Jason Reitman's Ghostbusters 3 .
In 2019, if you're not a superhero movie, a high-concept horror flick, a branded toon or a live-action musical, you're a longshot for theatrical success. What used to be a strange phenomenon associated with YA fantasy properties ( Hunger Games , Twilight , Harry Potter ) is now the industry in general. Where once the fan-driven mega-franchises played so exclusively to their fans that everything else could thrive alongside them, now the fans of a given franchise or property show up for those films but otherwise don't bother. Merely going to the movies to go to the movies is a thing of the recent past, and it's the kind of films released by Annapurna, STX and 20th Century Fox (Fox200o or otherwise) that have suffered. You can complain that Disney is all about IP now, but they'd gladly make more like McFarland, USA , Tomorrowland or Queen of Katwe if folks showed up for those.
It’s not that we need to see them in theaters so that Hollywood keeps making them, although that’s always the fear. Honestly, barring a miraculous recovery, Booksmart will join a sadly long list of female-centric coming-of-age comedies or dramas from female writers and/or directors ( Real Women Have Curves, Whip It , The To-Do List , The Edge of Seventeen , The Fits , Before I Fall , The Miseducation of Cameron Post , The Diary of a Teenage Girl , etc.) that earned strong reviews but relatively poor box office results. Fortunately, these films do still keep getting made, if only because one or two breaks out ( Clueless , Mean Girls , The Fault in Our Stars, Pitch Perfect ) just often enough to keep hope alive.
Moreover, as long as Netflix continues to offer up the likes of The Kissing Booth or to All the Boys I’ve Loved , there will probably be a place for the next Booksmart, Before I Fall or (the surprisingly good-for-a-Netflix-movie) See You Yesterday even if theatergoers don’t do their due diligence. But, if we want the folks who made these movies to go on to have decent Hollywood careers, we kind of need them to be hits. Yes, Olivia Wilde is a popular/outspoken actress, so she may recover. But Whip It was 9.5 years ago and I’m still waiting on Drew Barrymore’s second feature. This is where gender-based imbalances/biases (and the “men get hired on potential while women get hired on history” things) come into play.
A (white) male director can make a well-reviewed indie flop and still get a blockbuster. Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed earned a whopping $4 million in the summer of 2012. But strong reviews and fans like Steven Spielberg and Brad Bird were enough to get Trevorrow the job helming Jurassic World . Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ solid The Kings of Summer earned $1.3 million for CBS Films in summer 2013, but he still got to make Kong: Skull Island for Warner Bros. and Legendary. Aubrey Plaza's terrific The To-Do List earned $3.5 million domestic for CBS Films that same summer. yet writer/director Maggie Carey has directed 20 TV episodes since then. For what it’s worth, Fast Color ’s Julia Hart will direct Stargirl for Disney+.
There’s no shame in TV episodics or streaming flicks (among other credits, Carey helmed the dynamite racial profiling episode, “Moo Moo,” of Brooklyn 99 ), and I liked both Jurassic World and Skull Island quite a bit, but there is a discrepancy. Yes, the whole “from indie darling to studio picture and/or blockbuster” pipeline is starting to slightly open up for “not a white guy” filmmakers. Chloe Zharo went from The Rider to Marvel’s The Eternals . Cathy Yan is going from Dead Pigs to Birds of Prey , while the Jordan Peele-produced Candyman sequel/reboot hired Little Woods director Nia DaCosta. But if you want the (female) filmmakers behind your favorite female-centric comedies, dramas and genre flicks to direct more studio pictures, you really have to support those films in theaters.
The folks behind Booksmart will survive. The rave reviews and likely strong word-of-mouth (an A from CinemaScore from women aged 17-34) will likely make it a generational cult classic. History shows that its relative failure won’t doom others of its ilk from getting made. But unless you really don’t care about movies of its ilk no longer playing in wide theatrical release, you still owe it to yourself to check it out over the next week or so. If you want to change the film’s “narrative,” it has to be in the next five days, so it can get that “miraculous” second-weekend hold. Because a movie as good as Booksmart shouldn’t have to merely settle for survival."
Qualcomm And Lenovo Unveil Snapdragon 8cx Powered Project Limitless 5G Laptop At Computex,www.forbes.com,Dave Altavilla,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2019/05/27/qualcomm-and-lenovo-unveil-snapdragon-8cx-powered-project-limitless-5g-laptop-at-computex/,"Qualcomm’s ACPC (Always Connected PC) platform solutions have been evolving for year now, with better native app compatibility for the Windows on ARM platform and more powerful processing engines, with the recent introduction of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx SoC. At it’s heart, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx is built on the company’s octal-core Kyro 495 architecture with an integrated Adreno 680 GPU, support for up to 8-channel LPDDR4x memory, as well as NVMe Solid State Drives and UFS 3.0 Flash storage, for significantly more robust platform IO throughput, processing horsepower and memory bandwidth versus Qualcomm’s previous generation Snapdragon 850 platform. Further, the platform will also offer native 5G connectivity with its companion Snapdragon X55 modem that supports both Millimeter Wave and Sub-6 connectivity, with backwards compatibility for 4G networks and peak 5G speeds of up to 7Gbps downstream and 3Gbps upstream.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Chip
HotHardware Of course it’s about what OEMs can actually build for laptop devices with the new Snapdragon 8cx that really matters, and today the company announced a partnership with Lenovo called Project Limitless which is the first formal announcement of a Snapdragon 8cx powered laptop 2-in-1 Windows 10 PC. “Our collaboration with Lenovo will deliver transformative PC user experiences for both consumers and the enterprise thanks to the platform’s performance and power efficiency, combined with the high speed, low-latency connectivity made possible by 5G,” said Alex Katouzian, senior vice president and general manager, mobile business unit, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
Looking at bit closer at the machine , it has Lenovo’s trademark shaped key-caps on its keyboard, a large trackpad, Lenovo’s signature matte black finish, a thin bezel display and of course Lenovo’s signature 360-degree Yoga-style hinge mechanism. It will be interesting to see how this machine performs in real world use cases. I’ve actually spent time for the past week or so, working on a Snapdragon 8cx prototype laptop. I would offer that performance feels crisp and responsive in standard office type applications, when web browsing, working with email and streaming HD video. My machine came configured with 8GB of RAM (2x4GB) and a 512GB NVMe SSD. In short, it feels just like any X86-based Windows 10 laptop that I’ve used currently, though I’m still working with different software apps to determine performance and compatibility in various uses cases. And battery life so far seems ridiculously good, with up-time for days before needing to recharge.
Lenovo Project Limitless Snapdragon 8cx 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop
Lenovo Also of note on performance, Qualcomm released some benchmark numbers pitting a similarly configured Snapdragon 8cx machine versus an Intel Core i5, 15 Watt, U-series, 8 th Gen laptop. The numbers over at HotHardware certainly look impressive with a new version of PCMark that runs ARM native Office apps along with gaming and graphics synthetic tests. In some cases, the Snapdragon 8cx machine was able to outpace its Intel competition by 10 to 15 percent.
“At Lenovo, we don’t innovate for the sake of technology alone. Everything we do is about improving people’s experience,” proclaimed Johnson Jia, senior vice president and general manager, Consumer Business of Intelligent Devices Group, Lenovo. “With real 5G in a PC, it’s all about satisfying users’ need for speed: faster file transfers and streaming in 4K, 8K and even AR/VR; faster and higher quality video chats on-the-go; even faster screen refreshes for mobile gaming. When we say limitless connectivity, we mean it – 5G PC users the world-over will save time, stay productive, or get online entertainment from nearly anywhere, at any time.""
ADVERTISEMENT We’ll have to keep tabs on Lenovo’s Project Limitless PCs in the weeks and months ahead. If these early performance figures, and my current experience with a Snapdragon 8cx prototype, are any indication of what’s to come, there may be some very competent, always-connected laptops with killer battery life in market in the not too distant future.

The Week Ahead: Will Stocks Decline Even Further This Month?,www.forbes.com,Tom Aspray,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2019/05/27/the-week-ahead-will-stocks-decline-even-further-this-month/,"The action in the stock market last week was not pretty even though stocks tried to stabilize on Friday instead of adding to Thursday’s losses. Once again was not an encouraging sign that the stock market gave up the early gains before a long weekend.
Tom Aspray- Viper Report.com For the week the Dow Jones Transportation Average ($TRAN) was hit the hardest down 3.38% followed by a 2.7% decline in the Nasdaq 100 ($NDX). For the month the $TRAN is down 8.7% followed by a 6.2% decline in the $NDX. Not far behind was the small-cap Russell 2000 which lost 4.70%.
The stock market was looking stretched in the middle of April so the recent weakness is not a surprise. So far the S&P 500 is down 3.5% in May but with just four days left in the month the key question is whether it will drop even further?
Since 2000, the S&P 500 has been down six years with the worst May coming in 2010 when it dropped 8.34%. That was followed by a 6.26% decline in 2012. Since 1950 the S&P 500 has been up in May for 41 years and down 28 years.
Tom Aspray- Viper Report.com The weekly chart of the Spyder Trust (SPY) shows that the 20 day EMA was tested again last week. There is further support at $277.64 and the weekly starc- band is at $276.64. The QPivot is a longer-term measure of support that stands at $270.44.
The weekly S&P 500 Advance/Decline line peaked the week of May 3 rd and has declined for the rest of the month. It is now getting closer to its rising WMA. The weekly On Balance Volume (OBV) also made a new high with prices in early May but has now dropped below its WMA which is warning of weakness.
Tom Aspray- Viper Report.com Though the weekly A/D analysis on all the key averages is positive as of Friday’s close only one of the daily A/D indicators is positive. On the daily chart of the NYSE, the 20 day EMA is clearly declining which typically means that it is likely to take time for a short term bottom to form.
The NYSE All A/D Line dropped slightly below its support, line a, on Thursday but turned up slightly on Friday. The NYSE Stocks Only A/D line does look weaker as it dropped below its support (line c) on May 13 th and made new correction lows last week. It now shows a clear pattern of lower highs, line b, which needs to be overcome to signal that the correction is over.
Even though the technical outlook does favor a further stock market decline as I discussed last week “ The Week Ahead: Double Top Or Not? ” there is no evidence to suggest that the stock market has completed a major top.
Tom Aspray- Viper Report.com The investor sentiment has changed significantly in the past three weeks according to the survey from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII). Many may recall my comments at the end of the year when the bullish % hit a low 21.56% on December 10 th , line a. The bearish % did not peak until two weeks later when it reached 50.3%.
Just three weeks ago the bullish % reached 43.12%, line b, and has declined over the past two weeks and was 24.71% last week. That is a change of 18.4% in just two weeks. Over the same period the bearish % has risen from 21.23% to 36.08%. The neutral % reading is 38.22%.
For the month, it has been even tougher for some of the key sectors as the Technology Sector Select (XLK) and the Energy Select (XLE) are both down 6.8% so far in May. These two ETFs do look much different technically as the monthly and weekly indicators are negative for XLE. In contrast, the monthly analysis is positive for XLK while the weekly analysis is neutral. The daily indicators are negative for both ETFs and do not yet show any signs of a bottom.
I pointed out the weak technical outlook for the Materials Sector Select (XLB) in my May 1 st analysis . So far it is down 6.4% this month. In that article, my analysis indicated that one of the industry groups in XLB, the Dow Jones US Steel Index ($DJUSST) looked especially vulnerable. It is down 11.2% so far this month.
Those who followed the four-week dollar-cost averaging plan I recommended before Christmas are still 75% long at an average value of 2497 based on the S&P 500. On February 25, 2019, my order to sell 25% of the position was executed when the S&P 500 moved above 2805. As a stop on the position, I would sell the remaining position if the S&P 500 has a weekly close below 2712, which is the current Quarterly Pivot.
In my Viper ETF Report and Viper Hot Stocks Report , I teach subscribers how to better understand the stock market while providing specific buy and sell advice twice a week. Each is only $34.95 per month."
Could 'Government By Code' Eliminate Special Interests As Restore Democracy?,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/27/could-government-by-code-eliminate-special-interests-as-restore-democracy/,"Getty Images. Getty GDPR reminds us that the best privacy laws were written before the social media era. Today there are simply too many powerful corporations seeking to exploit our personal data for there to be any hope of legislation that would actually enhance, rather than strip away, our privacy. Vested interests and their armies of lobbyists wield unimaginable power over modern society, from controlling legislation to ensuring lax enforcement of unprofitable laws. What might happen if our legal systems were codified into software algorithms that were immune from bribes and personal friendships, while new laws were put to a popular vote using e-voting? Could such “government by code” finally restore democracy?
The impact of special interests on the legal systems of democracies cannot be understated. From sweetheart financial deals to legislation favoring business over citizenry to selective enforcement of the law, it is money, power and personal friendships that win the day, rather than the popular will.
Enforcement of laws already on the books is an area particularly ripe for the influence of power. Every day city governments around the nation issue waivers exempting businesses from laws or decline to prosecute violations. Listening to a business the other day tout how the close personal friendships of its managers with city leaders made it immune to health ordnance enforcement and thus dramatically reduced its cost of operations compared with its competitors because it no longer had to invest in health safety compliance, reinforced just how powerful and dangerous these connections can be, especially at the municipal level.
Similarly, it is remarkable how often variances to municipal laws across the country are approved shortly after the requesting party makes a major campaign contribution. While politicians are quick to dismiss any connection between campaign funding and official action, such coincidences have been the subject of many a lawsuit.
What would happen then if our laws were enforced not by easily swayed humans but by the cold unflinching calculus of code?
As former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves is fond of quipping , one of the myriad benefits of digital government is that “you can’t bribe a computer.”
Friendships, family ties, lavish gifts and personal favors are of little use when laws are enforced by algorithms carrying them out to the letter. In a world of algorithmic government, it no longer matters if a local business CEO is an old childhood friend of the mayor, only what the explicit letter of the law states.
Each exception to the law would have to be explicitly codified with the full range of eligibility criteria. A law against unlicensed food vendors would therefore no longer fall to local law enforcement to decline to prosecute a 10-year-old child running a sidewalk lemonade stand in their front yard, while enforcing penalties against an older child engaged in identical activity in a different part of town.
The precise codification of exemptions would make laws more brittle and in need of more frequent revision but would ensure the public understands and agrees with each individual exception. Instead of a police officer or district attorney being required to decide at what age a child running a lemonade stand graduates from harmless fun to criminal fine, society itself would be forced to grapple with these issues and precisely define what it believes is the best approach to each problem.
What about the other half of the equation? Removing the influence of special interests in the creation of laws in the first place?
Despite its small size, Estonia has been a global leader in electronic voting , allowing its citizens to securely vote from their home computers and even verify their submitted votes using their smartphones.
What if the US were to adopt a similar secure digital voting platform, perhaps starting at the municipal level? Imagine if each town and city in America put every new policy up to a popular vote, allowing the public at large to vote on the issues that most directly affect them. Instead of a handful of officials with potential conflicts of interest lavishing legal exemptions on powerful and wealthy businesses while ignoring the needs of the public they serve, what might it look like for the public itself to wield democracy through their smartphones?
Of course, as Facebook’s transition from democracy to dictatorship reminds us, even when we have the rights of democracy and the opportunity to vote on the issues that affect us, it can be difficult to get the public to exercise those rights.
Putting this all together, what might “government by code” look like? What would happen if laws were enforced to the letter by computers that cannot be bribed and don’t care about family ties, childhood friendships or campaign contributions? What if every new policy were put to a popular vote, giving the people once again a voice in the issues that most directly affect them?
Rolling out such a revolutionary model at the municipal level, where there are often strong ties between the business community and civic leaders, would offer a powerful counterbalance to today’s special interest dominance.
In the end, rather than fear the machines taking over, perhaps we should embrace them, seeing their algorithmic purity as a path towards transparent and faithful governance that could finally restore faith in democracy.

DC Comics Set to Stop Double-Shipping Comic Books Next Year,www.forbes.com,Adam Rowe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamrowe1/2019/05/27/dc-comics-set-to-stop-double-shipping-comic-books-next-year/,"DC Comics told retailers this weekend that it would stop double-shipping as of 2020, reverting all of its double-shipped titles to single-shipped ones. The term ""double-shipping,"" for those not in the know, refers to any comic series that releases two issues in the same month, rather than just one. Multiple titles in DC's lineup began double-shipping following the American comics publisher's 2016 ""Rebirth"" relaunch. C urrently, f ive DC series are doubled-shipped : Batman , Detective Comics , The Flash , Wonder Woman , and Justice League . Now, starting in 2020, all of DC's titles will release a maximum of one issue a month.
The news comes from comics industry news site CBR , citing a tweet from retailer Ryan Higgins: ""DC told retailers yesterday (and told us it's OK to share today) that all the double-shipping books are going back to single shipping next year.""
The benefits of double-shipping are pretty obvious — twice the sales for must-see tentpole comic book series. There's a less obvious downside to double-shipping, though, which has kept most retailers and hardcore readers wary of the practice: It potentially cannibalizes other comic book sales. Assuming most reader have a set allowance that they're willing to spend per month, they'll be forced to put their extra $3.99 towards a second issue of Justice League in order to keep up with the main series, taking away a $3.99 that might otherwise go towards checking out a promising new series.
To make it a little easier on Batman fans who aren't sure what to do with their extra money once January 2020 rolls around, DC Comics will be launching a new 12-issue miniseries, Batman/Catwoman , written by Tom King and drawn by Clay Mann. Higgins has confirmed that this new series was at least partially responsible for DC's move away from double-shipping, saying on Twitter that ""They didn't want to lose the sales of two issues of Batman, so we get both the normal book and [ Batman/Catwoman ] by King (like [Batman and Robin] from Morrison).""
King also included a comparison to famed Batman writer Grant Morrison in his statement about the new Batman/Catwoman series: "" Batman and Catwoman is a chance to do what Morrison and Quietly did in Batman and Robin: launch an ambitious, accessible, beautiful, thrilling new series that concludes years of stories and defines what Batman is, can, and will be,” he said in a press release. “This will be a comic about what the best Batman comics are always been about, how our greatest hero turns fear into bravery, pain into hope, trauma into love. It’s the story I always wanted to tell, and I’m telling it with the man I consider to be the greatest artist in comics, my brother Clay Mann.""
Now, thanks to DC Comic's shift back to single-shipping, Batman's biggest comics readers are more likely than ever to turn Batman/Catwoman into a long-lasting success."
Apple's iPhone XR 2 Can Beat Google's Pixel 3A With Two Features,www.forbes.com,Jay McGregor,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/05/27/apples-iphone-xr-2-can-beat-googles-pixel-3a-with-two-features/,"The iPhone XR (left) and the iPhone XS Max. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) ASSOCIATED PRESS Despite the popularity of Apple’s iPhones - and products in general - and its unique ability to retain customers, its smartphone tech isn’t a cut above the competition like it has been in years past.
Every smartphone manufacturer has its own USP, but Google's Pixel range has comfortably overtaken Apple in both the camera and AI abilities. The premium customers pay for Apple products is becoming harder to justify, especially when you consider how brazenly OnePlus is dragging prices down .
The upcoming iPhone XR2 will likely be as popular as its predecessor (the iPhone XR wildly outsold all other iPhones last year), but what can Apple do to improve the device technically and stave off impressive competition?
Bundling the best
I’m not sure Apple will ever compete on price, even with the XR range. It’s just not how the company does business, nor does it need to (despite the introduction of the ‘budget’ range). Google’s Pixel 3A XL starts at $479, whereas the cheapest XR sells for $749. It’s a stark difference. Combined with trade-in deals, you could pick up the 3A XL for under $200 .
But Apple does have one thing over Google: a popular - and functioning - wireless headphone range. The AirPods have been the success story that Google dreamed about with its Pixel Buds. Given how well the AirPods sell, I’m not sure if Apple would bundle them in with an iPhone XR 2, but it should.
With Apple’s already decent trade-in offers, there are a few ways the iPhone-maker could compete on value without having to directly drop prices. Leveraging the popularity of the AirPods and combing its two of its most sought-after products is a way to do exactly that.
A more complete smartphone
I don’t know if the XR2 will compete with the Pixel 3A in terms of its camera skills, because Google is so far ahead of the pack . But the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3A are deficient in couple of areas - namely speed and design - which gives Apple an opportunity to capitalise.
The last two Pixel devices have struggled with performance. The 3A is better because the specs are less demanding, but there’s a noticeable syrupy sluggishness in day-to-day use that's clear if you’re used to top-end smartphones. That’s less the case with the XR, even though it has 1GB less RAM than the XS (it does slow down under heavier tasks, though). I hope Apple continues to offer fast performance for the XR2.
In terms of design, the XR is already streaks ahead of the Pixel. In fact, the Pixel range is quite far behind most of the competition when it comes to aesthetics. I suspect that’ll be the case with the XR2 as well, but I think Apple has some room to maneuver with thickness. Bulking out the device a bit more, to fit a larger battery, is something the Cupertino-based company should take slightly further than it already does and cross the 3000mAh line. Price, battery and camera are the most important features to consumers, so making a device that hits all three - even at the expense of Apple’s strict design principles - will probably be a wallet opener.

Spot The Rock Hyrax: Amusing Optical Illusions And Other Perfectly-Timed Photos From Across Africa,www.forbes.com,Mary Ann Anderson,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryannanderson/2019/05/27/spot-the-rock-hyrax-amusing-optical-illusions-and-other-perfectly-timed-photos-from-across-africa/,"The rock hyrax is an amazing little creature in that its closest living relative is the elephant. Kissing cousins close, in fact. The two share similarities – their teeth and tusks, skull structure, and even their toes – but along with the manatee and dugong, they all share a common ancestor, tethytheria, that mitochondrially evolved over the past 50 million years so that now its descendants now inhabit several continents, including Africa. Such is life on the rocks for the hyrax. Hyraxes, which live across Africa and beyond, are social creatures and can live with up to about 50 of their brethren in one colony. While there are nowhere near 50 hyraxes in this photo taken at Singita Pamushana in the Malilangwe Reserve in Zimbabwe, there are quite a few.
Start counting. How many hyraxes do you see? Photos that double as optical illusions tend to play tricks on our eyes, especially since the hyraxes blend in so colorfully and perfectly with the tapestry of rocks, boulders, and cliffsides that is their home. (By the way, scroll to the bottom of the article for the hyrax headcount.)
Photography, especially on an African safari, can be tricky in that wildlife loves to play hide-and-seek. That means the perfect shot taken at just the right moment is, at least for amateurs like me, either the luck of the draw or the magic of digital photography that allows for hundreds of shots in just a few minutes.
But it is the unexpected photo taken on safari, where the camera succumbs to the dynamic forces of nature and its utter surprises, that provides humbling reminders that nature is indeed more powerful that we ever will be.
Plains zebra provide an optical illusion at Singita Pamushana in Zimbabwe.
Mary Ann Anderson In another photo taken at Singita Pamushana , the stripes of these plains zebra, also known as Burchell’s zebra or the common zebra, meld together so that it’s difficult to tell where one begins and the other ends, providing the illusion of sometimes three, sometimes four zebra are posing for the camera.
The lioness and her cub were part of a 16-strong pride of lions on Kenya's Masai Mara.
Mary Ann Anderson Kenya’s Masai Mara teems with big cats that include not only the cheetah, but also the lion and leopard, two-fifths of the pentad comprising the Big Five that also numbers the Cape buffalo, elephant, and rhinoceros. Of the big cats, the lion reigns supreme. This lioness and her cub were a fraction of a super-pride of 16 mostly lionesses that came sauntering from out of a clump of acacia. Oblivious to the pride around them, they took a few moments for sweet nudging and one of those perfectly-timed camera moments.
Happy penguins make happy feet at Boulders Beach at South Africa's Cape Town.
Mary Ann Anderson This diminutive African penguin looks so happy he could just give you a big ol’ hug. African penguins, like humans, enjoy warm weather, and this little fellow lives at Boulders Beach , a series of hidden sea coves near Simon’s Town on the eastern coast of Cape Town’s Cape Peninsula. Even before you reach the beach where hundreds of the penguins live among the dunes, you can hear – and smell – them long before you see them. African penguins are sometimes called jackass penguins, because they, well, sound like braying donkeys.
Elephants hotfoot it to shade on a blazing day in Kenya's Masai Mara.
Mary Ann Anderson Move over! There is no heat like an African heat, and even elephants on the Masai Mara seek all the shade they can muster when the temperatures climb during the day to fricassee-hot. The crowded ellies kept bumping into one another in futile attempts to shield themselves from the blazing sun.
A male white lion and his tawny lioness warily watch safari guests at Sanbona Wildlife Reserve near Cape Town.
Mary Ann Anderson If looks could kill. At South Africa’s Sanbona Wildlife Reserve near Cape Town, I couldn’t decide if the tawny lioness, who locked her eyes on mine, was ready to pounce and have me for dinner or if she were simply submissive to the male white lion. In either case, Mama didn’t seem happy, and if Mama ain’t happy, then ain’t nobody happy. I was relieved that we drove away before I became her feline entrée.
Tanzania's Serengeti plains share about 250,000 zebra with Kenya's adjoining Masai Mara.
Mary Ann Anderson When a trio of plains zebra marched across Tanzania’s Serengeti , my driver and I both held our breath as we realized the moment was upon us when the three seamlessly lined up in conjunction with the acacia in the background. Some 750,000 plains zebra live in Africa, with some quarter-million of them living between the Serengeti and the Masai Mara.
Pumba - the Swahili word for warthog - poses for the camera in the Tanzania's Serengeti.
Mary Ann Anderson Here is the warthog – pumba in Swahili and Pumba in Disney’s “The Lion King” – a thoroughly funny and entertaining denizen of the Serengeti , where this photo was taken, as well as the African plains continent-wide. Warthogs are always good for a laugh as they graze on their front knees in a prayer-like pose, slide into their burrows hind-end first, and like their counterpart of farm hogs, enjoy a good wallow in the mud and sunshine.
Only 150 to 170 cheetah remain in Zimbabwe and those are found on wildlife reserves like Malilangwe.
Mary Ann Anderson Cheetah? What cheetah? This gorgeous and thoroughly sleek mama cheetah at Singita Pamushana stealthily moved from tree to tree, seemingly playing a game in trying to outwit our safari truck. The cheetah has largely disappeared from Zimbabwe, so it was thrilling to see this mother and her two cubs. According to Cheetah Conservation Project Zimbabwe , only 150 to 170 adults and adolescents are left in the country, primarily in wildlife protected areas.
AN elephant seems to dance the day away at Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve in Zimbabwe.
Mary Ann Anderson Well, shake it up, baby, now. At wildlife-rich Singita Pamushana , this girl knows how to twist and shout so that she looks so good dancing for the camera.
Hyenas aren't known for their playfulness, but this fellow seems to be enjoying the water in search of a hidden treasure.
Mary Ann Anderson The clever and cunning hyena is not normally known as being particularly amusing, but this one at Singita Pamushana obviously found something in the murky water to either entice or entertain him. Whatever he was fishing for didn’t bite, and he took off empty-handed, er, empty-pawed and empty-mouthed.
Giraffe are the world's tallest mammal but are also known for their mating antics.
Mary Ann Anderson Sniff, sniff. Wait. What? Well, pardon me! Here’s today’s giraffe courtship primer, very short version. The bull persuasion of the world’s tallest mammal begins the flirting game with his potential girlfriend by taking a whiff of her urine. If she’s in estrus, Daddy-O places his head on her backside and licks her tail and hikes up one of his front legs. If the lady likes him, then she’ll walk in a circle around him and just let passion take its course. About 15 months later, voila! And baby makes three.
Eleven hyraxes are hidden among the rocks and boulders of this Zimbabwean cliffside.

"Cycleway Building Boosts Bicycle Sales, Finds EU Body",www.forbes.com,Carlton Reid,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2019/05/27/cycleway-building-boosts-bicycle-sales-finds-eu-body/,"A bicycle sales forecast for Europe has been revised upwards because more money is being spent by the EU and national governments on cycling infrastructure. This is one of the key conclusions from strategists at the Brussels-based European Cyclists’ Federation and given at the launch of Cycling Industries Europe (CIE), a new industry body. CIE, billed as the “voice of cycling business in Europe,” was founded last October by Accell, PON, Shimano, SRAM and Cycleurope, along with 50 other bicycle businesses. Its formal launch took place on Wednesday 22nd May in the Scotland Europa conference center in Brussels, attended by over 100 business leaders and policy makers.
Matthew Baldwin, Deputy Director General, DG MOVE, European Commission, at the launch of Cycling Industries Europe in Brussels.
CIE
Attendees also heard that electric bike sales have been outperforming the rest of the bicycle market. In a 2017 strategy report from the European Cyclists’ Federation it had been estimated that 50 million e-bikes would be sold between 2018 and 2030. Because of stellar sales last year this figure has been revised to at least 150 million e-bike sales over the next eleven years.
However, CIE’s Chief Executive Kevin Mayne warned that the bicycle industry was ill prepared for the boost in e-bike sales:
The industry is not ready yet for sales on this scale. We must prepare by building new approaches, new business systems, be ready to compete for raw materials and resources like battery production and processing or we will lose out to other industries wanting our success.”
The increase in e-bike sales has not gone unnoticed by the European Commission, pleased that its recent provision of €2 billion to the sector is bearing fruit.
Matthew Baldwin, the European Commission ’ s Deputy Director of Mobility and Transport, said at the CIE event: “Cycling is the cleanest mobility solution on wheels and the best solution for air pollution and congestion in cities.”"
"Auto, Auto Parts Makers Still In Suspense Over Import Tariff Threat",www.forbes.com,Jim Henry,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2019/05/27/auto-auto-parts-makers-still-in-suspense-over-import-tariff-threat/,"Possible tariffs on imported autos and auto parts remain on the front burner this year for global automakers, even though the Trump Administration recently postponed a decision on tariffs for six months. That’s because President Trump declared at the same time that auto imports constitute a threat to U.S. national security, based on the conclusions of a Commerce Department investigation . The White House has been sitting on a report from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on the investigation since February, without previously disclosing the results.
“The [Commerce] Secretary found and advised me of his opinion that automobiles and certain automobile parts are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States,” the president said in a proclamation on May 17.

The White House used a similar argument earlier, to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which the auto industry also protested. Earlier this month, the Administration agreed to drop Canada and Mexico from the proposed tariffs in exchange for some concessions.
The global auto industry was expecting to hear the long-delayed report on the auto tariffs investigation no later than May 18.
Predictably, trade groups representing global automakers and U.S. auto dealers disputed the controversial notion that auto imports hurt U.S. national security .
“The case remains clear – cars are not a national security threat. We are deeply concerned that the administration continues to consider imposing auto tariffs,” the Washington-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said. Its members include both domestic and foreign-based automakers.
Tariffs amount to a “massive tax on consumers,” raising prices for cars and trucks across the board, not just imports, the alliance said.
Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. posted a statement that said in part, “Today’s proclamation sends a message to Toyota that our investments are not welcomed, and the contributions from each of our employees across America are not valued.”"
From Botox to Boeing: Korean start-up Air Premia plans to fly Seoul-Los Angeles,www.forbes.com,Will Horton,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/willhorton1/2019/05/27/from-botox-to-boeing-korean-start-up-air-premia-plans-to-fly-seoul-los-angeles/,"Hugel made its name in Korea as a manufacturer of botulinum toxin, and now founder Hong Sung-Bum is the flagship investor in Korean start-up Air Premia, which will receive new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2020 and plans to fly between Seoul and Los Angeles in 2021. Regional Asia, Europe and Australia are also target markets. “The Los Angeles route has more demand than supply,” an Air Premia spokesperson said in an interview in Seoul. Besides being a popular leisure destination for visiting Koreans, Los Angeles is home to the largest community of overseas Koreans and Korean-Americans, according to the Census Bureau.
Non-stop seat capacity between Los Angeles and Seoul has decreased in recent years as Korean Air deployed smaller planes while Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways ended fifth freedom flights.
Korean Air disclosed its North America yields and load factors in the fourth quarter of 2018 rose faster than the rest of its network, with 6.5% yield growth and a 2.5ppt load factor gain. The airline attributed this to its new joint-venture with Delta Air Lines. Delta's first quarter results said Korea was its best-performing Asian market. Blue Swan speculated American Airlines could start a flight between Los Angeles and Seoul.
Air Premia calls itself a hybrid airline. This term often implies the pay-as-you-go pricing of a low-cost airline, but Air Premia sees itself as a full-service airline without all features, such as business class.
“We’ll have good services from full-service carriers, but some services don’t meet the needs of all passengers,” the spokesperson explained. The airline plans for even its cheapest seats to have free luggage and a meal.
“There is already Korean Air and Asiana flying to Los Angeles but we have newer aircraft and lower fares,” the spokesperson said.

Air Premia Economy seats on Air Premia’s 787 will have 35” seat pitch (Korean Air is 34”) and 42” for premium economy. Korean Air and Asiana do not have premium economy. Air Premia expects its economy fares to be 80-90% of Asiana and Korean Air's economy. Premium economy on Air Premia will be 140% of Asiana and Korean Air's regular economy. This is perhaps below potential: United in a first quarter earnings call said its premium economy yield is twice that of regular economy.
Air Premia’s first three 787-9s are leased from Air Lease Corporation and will have 56 premium economy seats and 253 economy seats. That total of 309 seats gives Air Premia a density closer to full-service airlines (Korean Air: 271 seats, American Airlines: 285) than LCCs (Norwegian: 344, Scoot: 375).
The first Dreamliners are pegged for regional Asia flights, with subsequent aircraft opening long-haul routes. Besides Los Angeles, San Jose is also an early target, according to the spokesperson. There could later be service to Cairns, Honolulu, Munich and Vancouver.
Korea’s long-haul market has seen little evolution compared to LCCs bringing structural change and growth to short-haul markets. Korea has six LCCs and in March approved two more. The short domestic hop between Seoul and Jeju is the busiest route in the world while LCCs have quickly amassed 50% marketshare between Korea and Japan. Full-service airlines have decreased their presence, but the overall market has grown.
Short-haul has consistently grown, but long-haul has a more conservative outlook. Korean visitors to the US rapidly grew from 1.5 million in 2014 to 2.3m in 2017 but flatlined in 2018, according to the Department of Commerce. From 2017 to 2023, the Department projects compound growth of 3.0% from Korea, below the international US average of 3.7%.
New intercontinental airlines serving the US have not fared well, with Wow Air and Primera Air exiting the market while Norwegian restructures . Those airlines plied the trans-atlantic market, reckoning their mostly six to eight hour flights could bring competition in a segment largely controlled by three airline joint-ventures.
Although Air Premia is not low-cost, it will fly longer and in a more competitive market. It believes the growing trans-Pacific market can be stimulated with its hybrid business model.
The start-up is working through inflight service details, but the spokesperson said there is one certainty: “We won’t sell Botox onboard.”

This Fashion Brand Lets You Know Exactly Who Made Your Clothes,www.forbes.com,Lucy Sherriff,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucysherriff/2019/05/27/this-fashion-brand-lets-you-know-exactly-who-made-your-clothes/,"T he concept of Where Does It Come From? is self-explanatory. The clothing brand is driving for total transparency in the fashion industry, particularly in the wake of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh and controversy around a number of fashion brands’ workshop conditions. All the clothes produced by Where Does It Come From? come with a code on the garment label, so customers can trace the whole supply chain, getting to know the people involved in the production chain, as well as exploring the process.
“Essentially, every item comes with its own story,” explained founder Jo Salter. “We’re all about traceability, and we focus on ethically-created, eco-friendly clothing.”
“ We have three main social/environmental goals – to create employment and support livelihoods for marginalized workers; to develop eco-friendly, sustainable and traceable production supply chains; and to inspire people towards ethical consumerism. ”
The company sells adults and children’s clothing and accessories, both under its own name, and wholesale, working with businesses to create branded items - everything from scarves and shirts to drawstring bags.
Clothing from Where Does It Come From?
Where Does It Come From? “In terms of clothing, most c ustomers are still focussed on price and look for ethics as a secondary consideration or less. It takes some convincing for a customer to move from a brand that they are happy with, especially if they are used to shopping in a certain way.”
However, Salter added, a growing number of consumers are looking for ethical products, and are keen to know where their clothes came from and under what conditions they were made.
“This steady growth is already being reflected in mainstream brands changing their message to appeal to these customers.
“But their size and the legacy of their supply chains make it more of a challenge for them to show transparency and many are still approaching drops in market share by cutting their prices, rather than changing to a truly more ethical model.”
Salter founded her company in 2013, after she started asking “uncomfortable” questions about who made her clothes.
“I had two children and I wanted to know who made the clothes I was dressing them in. Were they being treated fairly? Were they children themselves?
“Increasingly we are pressured to be ‘on trend’, refreshing our wardrobes regularly so brands create cheaper and cheaper collections – often producing new lines every few weeks. But the prices of clothes in the UK are pretty much the same as they were in the 1980s, and the effect on the suppliers is to cut wages, working conditions and even safety for garment workers, 80% of whom are women.
“This change in shopping habits has also led to over production of cheap clothing with little consideration on any environmental impacts.
“I created Where Does It Come From? as a way of countering this over production, focussing on quality clothing that’s versatile enough to be worn in many ways and throughout the seasons. Our children’s clothing is designed with features to survive a growth spurt, and we only use natural fibers in all our clothing – it looks and feels fantastic but it will also biodegrade.”
There are a growing number of ethical clothing brands - Peopletree, Rapanui and Thought - to name a few, that are working with eco-friendly fabrics and fair trade principles, but Salter is confident her brand’s total traceability policy sets it apart. The business’ main challenge is offering competitively-priced clothing, yet still making enough margin to run the next production, paying its supply chain fairly, and continuing to source eco-friendly fabrics.
“The brand is slowly growing from startup stage to scale up. Currently all profits are invested back into the business to create new stock designs and production partnerships to really make a difference. For example our Indian clothing productions helped provide livelihoods for over 500 artisans last year. ”
Unisex shirts from Where Does It Come From?
Where Does It Come From? Salter has previously run crowdfunding initiatives to help cover the costs.
“Last year we ran a campaign to fund a new African production of organic, rain-fed cotton garments using Ugandan cotton with production taking place in Malawi. We raised enough funds in pre-sales to run the production, which is now nearing completion. The tunics and other items that have been created are absolutely stunning so we are feeling pretty confident that they will be popular.
“For our new African supply chain we are partnering with two social enterprises. One supports farmers in Uganda through teaching ecological farming techniques so they can grow organic cotton that is fed by the rain, and the other is a Fairtrade-certified workshop in Malawi run by African clothing brand Mayamiko.”
Salter is also keen to continue her commitment to the environment, and has recently moved to wooden buttons rather than plastic, uses hand printing to reduce water waste, plastic-free and recyclable packaging, and even hosts the company’s website on a wind-powered server farm.
“Currently customers only have access to minimal information about their garment and it is often misleading. How many times do you see a T shirt labelled ‘Made in the UK’ when we don’t even grow cotton in the UK?
“ We want to make traceability the norm. If customer expectations of transparency are raised then all fashion brands will have to follow suit.”"

Indie Game Development Pitfalls And Lessons From A Small Developer,www.forbes.com,Matt Paprocki,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattpaprocki/2019/05/27/indie-game-development-pitfalls-and-lessons-from-a-small-developer/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin The creative spark can come from anywhere. For Elaine Podosek, it came from teaching. Or rather, the lack thereof. “I had a brief stint as a high school computer science teacher before I realized how little of the job was actually teaching,” writes Podosek.
Becoming a student teacher, she created games to show her students what they could do, and in 2016, turned that into an indie development project. “I fairly flew through all the complicated programming but ran into a lot of trouble getting everything else, especially the artwork that I had to contract out,” writes Prodosek.
That game is now shelved because of its scope. Podosek wants to do this right. As such, she’s found a side gig: helping others. Podosek turned to mentoring, from a YouTube series on her preferred engine. “I've come to learn that a surprisingly large portion of my fellow indie devs on the programming side are self-taught, which often results in uneven knowledge where you're incredible at some things and completely inept at others,” writes Podosek. Can confirm: Elaine does indeed do coding Elaine Does Coding
Obviously, coding, art, and other knowledge matters, but so does team management. That’s become one of Podosek’s messages too. At a Game Jam event, she claims a certain member of her team became agitated, then took their work, leaving the team without that material. “I learned a lot about project management and how difficult it can be to keep everyone on task. ...The internet is a wonderful thing, but it makes it easier for people to be unprofessional without consequences. I have had and seen projects die or stall because someone simply disappeared without warning,” writes Podosek.
It’s something to consider when treating this as a business, and working as a team, consider the potential perils. Her other advice? Learn marketing. “It's not enough to just make a great game; you also have to make sure people know about it,” she writes. “There are not so few offerings out there that you can depend on people making accidental discoveries while browsing. Marketing and PR is a weak point for more devs I know than just about any other aspect of success.” A shot of Pour the Tea Elaine Podosek
Starting out, Podosek sees the challenges for new devs. Her advice is to keep it up, build a fanbase, and keep going. Also, have a hook. Podosek found hers in mentoring. “There are so many people all dreaming of being video game creators and struggling to make that happen, that almost everyone drowns each other out. You have to both stand out and continue to create consistently in order to truly create a fanbase. That kind of stamina is very difficult for people, especially those who haven't begun establishing themselves yet,” writes Podosek.
To gain that experience, Podosek recommends Game Jams. Her second game, Pour the Tea , came from one. Game Jams can teach basics, like working with teams and keeping up with the fast-paced development, all in a short time frame. While they don’t teach marketing, they’ll teach ground floor development. “They can be very hectic, but as I said before they push you to really perform beyond your limits. And unlike a longer jam, you can actually sustain frantic productivity for those periods,” writes Podosek.
In short, find a way to gain experience, learn from others, and don’t forget the marketing if this is to be a business, so says Podosek.

Deep Learning Algorithms Are Expected To Boost Liquid Biopsy Techniques,www.forbes.com,Yiannis Mouratidis,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/yiannismouratidis/2019/05/27/deep-learning-algorithms-are-expected-to-boost-liquid-biopsy-techniques/,"Liquid biopsies are cost-effective and reduce the sress of the biopsy procedure Getty According to Wikipedia, the earliest diagnostic biopsy was conducted by an Arab physician in the 11 th century. The term “biopsy” derives from the Greek word bios which means life and the also Greek word “opsis” which means sight. It was first introduced in the 19 th century and since then medical researchers and practitioners have developed several techniques to perform biopsies on living organs or tissues needed further observation. Modern instruments such as intestinal biopsy tubes can extract samples from parts of the body where it is difficult to have access or even hazardous.
In the cases described above, this histologic procedure is invasive and quite complicated putting a financial burden, not to mention the extra strain on the patient. Liquid biopsy is an emerging and very promising technique to perform biopsies. It detects and isolates the circulating tumor DNA and exosomes as a source of genomic and proteomic information in patients with cancer. As every new technique faces technical hurdles which affect effectiveness and accuracy. New technological developments and next-generation sequencing analysis allow a broad application of liquid biopsy in a wide range of settings. Initially correlated to prognosis, liquid biopsy data are now being studied for cancer diagnosis, including screenings, and most importantly for the prediction of response or resistance to given treatments. In particular, the identification of specific mutations in target genes can be detected more easily as liquid biopsies are easier to be taken. That translates to more data for the physicians to analyze in real time with a specific treatment and decide on the appropriateness of treatment or the identification of secondary resistance, aiming to diagnose disease progression early enough.
Since the first description of tumor cells in blood circulation in 1869, substantial progress has been made from biotechnological applications to isolate CTCs from heterogeneous blood components. However, the systematic application of liquid biopsy in real practice is still hindered by hurdles, such as unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity, lack of standardization, and high economic and human resource costs, and still offers many challenges. In fact, due to the low concentration of CTCs, ctDNA, and EXOs currently recoverable from the patient, the analytical results sometimes suffer from unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity.
We are already at the second stage of liquid biopsy methods
The initial methods applied for liquid biopsies focused on either ctDNA or protein. But as Nickolas Papadopoulos, Ph.D., Professor of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center explained in an article published in Technology Networks “The amount of ctDNA in the blood in early-stage cancer is very low and can constitute only 0.01% of the total cell-free DNA.” This can create stochastic events based on the amount of blood used for the test. In addition, many cancers do not ‘shed’ their tumor DNA into the circulation so some cancers would not be detected if only the ctDNA factor was assayed and the test, though specific, would not be sufficiently sensitive.
The first report of dual ctDNA and protein liquid biopsy research that combined blood tests for KRAS gene mutations with protein biomarkers to determine whether the combination of these markers was superior to any single marker , reports that the comparison between patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and healthy people led to a sensitivity of 64% with a specificity of 99.5%. This is far better from any test that analyzes one of the two factors. Promising two-factor liquid biopsy with less than $500, CancerSEEK is a promising solution for the liquid biopsy market CancerSEEK
Then a second report focused on other early-stage cancers, including ovarian, liver, stomach, pancreatic, esophageal, colorectal, lung, and breast. The test, named CancerSEEK demonstrated a median sensitivity of 70% (lowest for breast cancer at 33%, highest for ovarian cancer at 98%) with a specificity higher than 99% for all tested cancers. Applying a machine learning algorithm could even help locate the tumor, which would be able to be corroborated by conventional tests, such as mammograms or colonoscopy. “The test in effect is pan-cancer and we continue on this front,” explained Dr. Papadopoulos. The researchers believe that CancerSEEK could cost less than $500, similar to current screening cancer tests and that its specificity and sensitivity may be improved by combination with additional tumor biomarkers. “We have initiated prospective studies to test CancerSEEK. This is the way to really evaluate the clinical applicability of the test,” concluded Dr. Papadopoulos when discussing the test’s future prospects.
In 2016 the global liquid biopsy market size was valued at $23.49 million, but as money flows in the sector it is predicted to exceed $1.2 billion by 2023. Machine learning is an exponential factor for Next Generation Sequencing Getty
Next-generation sequencing uses machine learning as an exponential factor
In contrast to the detection of a single genetic alteration, NGS aims to record genetic alterations present across diverse cancer subtypes. Moreover, NGS can detect several mutations that could be responsible for driving tumorigenesis and identify resistance mechanisms that may have evolved from pre-existing clones after treatment. As Professor Nicola Normanno, Director of Translational Research Department of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Naples, Italy says “ctDNA detection by liquid biopsy is useful, and with the NGS platform, we would be able to obtain a more in-depth molecular characterization of the tumor.” But in a study of NGS liquid biopsy, he and his team highlighted some of the challenges they need to address. “The central point from our study is that we need to work more on specificity and sensitivity to move NGS liquid biopsy into the clinic. This is due to the low level of ctDNA in blood samples but also due to potential artifacts detected by NGS which are from clonal hematopoiesis rather than from tumor-associated DNA. So, we need to understand more about the biology of ctDNA in order to improve the technology.”
On the other hand, a key advantage of NGS liquid biopsies is the detection of mutations in the blood arising from the entire tumor, overcoming the problem of tumor heterogeneity. It can also be used to monitor treatment response and development of resistance. When asked about other potential uses of NGS liquid biopsy, Professor Normanno discussed the possibility of evaluating tumor mutational burden (TMB), which is being considered as a potential biomarker for response to immunotherapy.
Are we close to a turning point?
The size of the liquid biopsy market shows that we are at an early stage of development. The first commercially available tests will need to prove their effectiveness and convince physicians, clinical centers and international organizations for standardization that they can isolate the signal from the noise and create real value for all the healthcare sector.
The intensive use of machine learning algorithms raises the possibilities for more accurate test results connecting the specific cancer type with the patient’s unique gene identity and offering tailor-made treatment options. Additionally, the fact that it is minimally invasive allows tests to be repeated at the minimum psychological cost on people who bear a huge burden due to their condition.

"Tyler, The Creator Hits No. 1 For The First Time With His New Album 'Igor'",www.forbes.com,Hugh McIntyre,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/05/27/tyler-the-creator-hits-no-1-for-the-first-time-with-his-new-album-igor/,"After a week-long battle for the throne on the Billboard 200, a victor has been named, and it’s a musician who reaches the top spot for the first time in his career. Hip-hop musician Tyler, The Creator debuts his new full-length Igor at No. 1 on the all-encompassing chart, snagging his first leader, though he has come close before. Igor leads the way thanks to just under 165,000 equivalent units, according to Nielsen Music. Of that sum, 74,000 are pure sales, and the 12 songs on the collection racked up over 122 million streams.
Igor is the musician’s first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and his fifth top 10 on the list. All five of the rapper’s proper albums have broken into the highest region. He first reached the tier in 2011 with his debut Goblin , which hit No. 5. He’s reached toward the top every two years, with 2013’s Wolf lifting to No. 3, 2015’s Cherry Bomb placing at No. 4, and 2017’s Flower Boy missing the mark by one rung. So far, none of the songs featured on Igor have reached the Hot 100, though that will likely change when that chart refreshes in short order.
Tyler, The Creator’s Igor beats DJ Khaled’s Father of Ashad to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200. Khaled was vying for his third chart-topper, but he’s been forced to settle for second place. Igor replaces last week’s champion, Logic’s Confessions of a Dangerous Mind at the top of the all-genre tally.

Why Diversification Works: In Life And Markets,www.forbes.com,Brett Steenbarger,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettsteenbarger/2019/05/27/why-diversification-works-in-life-and-markets/,"When we create multiple ways to win, it becomes more difficult to lose. Getty In suburban Connecticut, near where I live, two towns sit next to one another. One is Greenwich, CT, a community known for its upscale homes and shops, as well as its concentration of hedge funds. Just a couple miles south on U.S. Route 1 lies the town of Port Chester, NY, a not-so-upscale community that has become a haven for immigrant groups. Recently, when my wife Margie and I went out to eat, we chose Port Chester. Yes, we could have had fine dining in Greenwich, but it's Port Chester where--in a few blocks--you can find native cuisine from the Caribbean, Brazil, Columbia, India, Mexico, Italy, Peru, Spain, Guatemala, and far more. There is always something new to try: something different and surprising. Much of the fun is the process of discovery. So many nationalities, so many new and interesting dishes: how can you not go away having a good time?
When we first moved to the area, we were surprised to learn that foodies from New York City flocked to Port Chester, not the affluent communities of Fairfield County, Connecticut. Having lived in the region for nearly a decade, I no longer find that surprising. It's not just the authenticity of the food, but the staggering variety within and across restaurants that brings people to the area. The sheer diversity appeals to most any palate.
We are familiar with the idea of diversification in financial markets. It has been called the only ""free lunch"" available to investors. By spreading our assets across a variety of markets and strategies, we are able to harvest a broad set of returns. Thus, when some of our investments perform suboptimally, others can bring profit. Our total returns may or may not exceed the returns from a concentrated bet at any point in time, but we win over the long haul on a risk-adjusted basis . Diversification smooths the equity curve, keeping the downturns of our portfolios relatively shallow and contained.
In his book Abnormal Returns , Tadas Viskanta provides a useful example of the value of portfolio balance. From 1926 to 2009, he notes, a 50/50 portfolio of stocks and bonds provided roughly equal real returns during periods of economic expansion and periods of recession. In other words, it was not necessary to try and time economic ups and downs; holding assets that would benefit from good and bad times provided superior risk-adjusted returns. Unfortunately, Viskanta notes, most individual investors don't approach asset allocation with an eye toward diversification. They concentrate their bets on what's been hot, which all too often becomes cold. ""A true asset allocation plan starts first with a scheme to deliberately invest in certain asset classes,"" Viskanta explains. ""Simply turning a haphazard process into a deliberate one is an important step for investors"" (p. 71).
Note that diversification is a dynamic, ongoing process, not just a one time selection. When one group of assets has performed well in a portfolio and others haven't, the portfolio's composition loses its balance. By rebalancing the assets--selling some of the winners, buying some of the losers--the diversified investor, in Viskanta's terms, becomes a ""contrarian"". When stocks have fallen and bonds risen during a recession, for example, the rebalancing can capture value during the subsequent rebound.
To be sure, diversification does not ensure continuous positive returns. As Barry Ritholtz notes , there are bear market periods that savage a wide range of investments. This means that it is important to look beyond the usual stock-and-bond mix. Ritholtz cites the very interesting work of Phil Huber , who has broken down assets into groups and assembled a ""periodic table"" to capture sources of return. From this array, the investor seeking diversification can ensure that returns will come from a variety of factors and strategies. What becomes clear from Huber's scheme is that investments are a kind of smorgasbord, not unlike Port Chester's restaurants . This is how dining is like investing: When we balance selections from an array of sound alternatives, we greatly increase the odds of a net positive experience.
As a psychologist, I am regularly impressed by the degree to which this insight is lacking in people's life perspectives. When we consider our various roles in life--our work life, personal life, relationship life, family life--it's clear that our total happiness and fulfillment can come from multiple sources. Rarely, however, do we put energy into balancing and rebalancing the sources of return in our lives . We double and triple down in our career concerns, only to lose returns from relationship and family life. We spend so much time trading markets in and out that we fail to invest in the rest of our lives. With our psychological eggs in few baskets, we become vulnerable when the areas of our focus--our careers, our market participation, our romantic relationships--stop yielding returns. The diversified life is one in which we seek a balanced personal portfolio , with some areas of life yielding satisfaction and fulfillment even when others fall short.
This perspective raises interesting questions: How balanced is your life portfolio? If one area of your life were to not work out, how vulnerable would you be? When is the last time you rebalanced your life's portfolio? When have you last expanded your life portfolio?
Consider a periodic table of life that includes relationship elements; career and achievement elements; spiritual elements; elements of physical well-being; elements of learning and creativity; communal elements; elements of fun and enjoyment; and much more. Imagine constructing a daily and weekly calendar that regularly draws upon a variety of those elements and a life plan that includes goals and plans across these multiple spheres. Such a rich balance provides a smorgasbord of opportunities, and that can yield a happy and meaningful life across a variety of circumstances.

6 Ways to Pitch an Editor And Get Noticed,www.forbes.com,Estelle Erasmus,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/estelleerasmus/2019/05/27/6-ways-to-pitch-an-editor-and-get-noticed/,"As the host/curator of the podcast for the American Society of Journalists and Authors called ASJA Direct : Inside Intel on Getting Published and Paid Well (a free ASJA member benefit), I’ve interviewed dozens of editors from Kyle Pope of the Columbia Journalism Review , to Donna Talarico, of Hippocampus Magazine (a literary publication), to James Taranto, of the Wall Street Journa l to Beth Dreher, Features Director for Woman’s Day . I’ve also been the magazine editor-in-chief for five national consumer publications, and I’m currently working as a guest editor for Narratively , a digital publication focused on ordinary people with extraordinary stories. I also teach online classes in personal essay writing and pitching for Writer’s Digest and I'm an adjunct writing instructor at NYU. Through the years, I’ve learned some tips on pitching editors that I’d like to share.
1) Plan on a Platform : When I was a magazine editor, I always looked at what a writer's platform was — particularly their website—which should have a section that displays their clips. I also googled them to see anything I might have missed that they have written, their books, and in many cases, any interviews or features on them based on their work or expertise. Twitter and Instagram and Facebook stats are becoming even more important, because a good social media reach can increase the reach of a piece, and editors are very aware of that.
2) Pitch to An Actual Editor
A lot of people send their pitches to a general email. Avoid doing that. It's always best to find an actual editor to submit to (unless the pub instructs you to use Submittable or insists on a general email). Struggling to actually find an editor? Twitter is your friend, as is LinkedIn and Google. Simply type in the publication you want to look up or type in 'editors' and the publication, and you will see the names of editors. Make sure you pick the right editor for the section you want to be in.
3) Make Your Pitch Stand Out
It's always a great idea to include statistics, new studies, the latest research, or something that makes your pitch stand out as timely and compelling and credible. So check out the key organizations relating to your topic. For instance, if it's about your struggle with adult-onset Type 2 diabetes, see if you can find recent research cited by The American Diabetes Association, or check out Google Scholar or Pub Med to get recent studies. Often you can find an organization with a fact sheet or report online (check the public relations part of the site) that gives you the background you need for your topic.
4 ) Come Up with Compelling Titles
Include a pithy title in your pitch and in the subject line of your email. I think it helped when I pitched the New York Times with the title: How to Bullyproof Your Child , or I Was Uncontrollably Angry After Giving Birth for Parents magazine, or The Doula Who Saved My Life for the Washington Post . A catchy subject line will always up the chances of a quick response.
5) Review Red Flags That May Stop You From Getting Work
If you are pitching a story that you have already featured on your blog or Medium , don't think that an editor won't find out. Most editors do google to confirm that the article is an original one, particularly if it is the first time they are working with you. You should also have a clean fan Facebook page: which means that you shouldn't be writing about anything that is too incendiary (stay away from politics, cursing and sex talk unless that is your brand ) on your public page. You should also make sure that your private FB page is locked down. Also, avoid getting into Twitter wars. Potentially, an editor could see it and think that you will be a headache that the publication can't risk betting on.
6) Sell Yourself with a Brief Bio
Make sure to include a brief (as in two to three sentences) bio, including your credits and other relevant credentials. Also, link to several articles of work relevant to your pitch. Here are a few bios that I think work well.

Mini-Microbes Thrive In Mars-like Conditions Here On Earth,www.forbes.com,Brid-Aine Parnell,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bridaineparnell/2019/05/27/mini-microbes-thrive-in-mars-like-conditions-here-on-earth/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Ultra-small bacteria can thrive in an environment very like a young planet Mars, according to a new study.
When you’re trying to figure out if there was ever life on Mars, one way is to spot the evidence on today’s barren planet, the other is to find some teeny-tiny microbes battling some seriously harsh conditions here on Earth.
In the extreme environment of Ethiopia’s Dallol hot springs, an international team of researchers has found a strain of the Nanohaoarchaeles Order bacteria embedded in a salt chimney, deposited by supersaturated water at temperatures of 89 degrees Celsius and at the incredibly acidic pH of 0.25. The sampling site at Dallol, Ethiopia (Credit: Gomez et al/Europlanet) Gomez et al/Europlanet
“This is an exotic, multi-extreme environment, with organisms that need to love high temperature, high salt content and very low pH in order to survive,” said Dr Felipe Gómez from Astrobiology Center in Spain (CAB (CSIC-INTA)), in a statement .
The samples were discovered on a field trip funded by the Europlanet 2020 Research Infrastructure in January 2017, The team scraped some of the thin layers of salt deposits form a yellow chimney stack and a pool of water around the outcrop to see what they could find.
Dallol looks like a science-fiction technicolour landscape as moisture in the air from superheated water is saturated with various salts including silver chloride, zinc iron sulphide, manganese dioxide and normal rock-salt. The chemicals turn the terrain vivid with yellows, reds greens and blues.
It’s not the sort of place you expect to find much sign of life, but the scientists found tiny, spherical structures in the salt with a high carbon content. They are just 50-500 nanometers round – as much as 20 times smaller than your average bacteria. In some cases, the microorganisms are surrounded by crystals, suggesting that they’re active in the geochemical cycle at Dallol.
This area, dominated by a volcano and the surrounding geothermal area, is one of the hottest places on Earth. Hydrothermal activity in the area is fuelled by water that is heated and infused with gases in a reservoir beneath the volcano and the whole place is inside the wide Assale salt plain.
The combination makes this unique and complex environment very similar to what Mars may once have been like.
“Deep investigation of the characteristics of this amazing site will improve our understanding of the limits of life on Earth and inform our search for life on Mars and elsewhere in the Universe,” said Barbara Cavalazzi of the University of Bologna, lead author of the review .

Inside The High Tech World Of Microbes For Crops,www.forbes.com,Jennifer Kite-Powell,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2019/05/27/inside-the-high-tech-world-of-microbes-for-crops/,"Pivot Bio is a data-driven company using technology - genome sequencing - to produce a biological microbial product for farmers to grow corn. Karsten Temme, CEO and co-founder of Pivot Bio, says farmers have had few fertilizer options and have turned to chemical fertilizers to give their corn crops the nutrition they need to provide an abundant harvest.
""While chemical fertilizers have been around for 100 years and are [..] responsible for about half of the world’s food supply, they have an environmental downside,"" said Temme. ""Farmers know that maybe half of the chemical fertilizer they apply is actually used by the crop. Chemical fertilizers are volatile – they don’t stay put. They will either decompose and volatilize into the air emitting harmful nitrous oxide, a GHG 300 times more potent than CO2.""
Temme says that chemical fertilizers also leach or runoff through the soil and end up into waterways. ""When chemical fertilizers end up in the water, they become nitrates, which significantly contribute to the 500 dead zones around the world , the largest is in the Gulf of Mexico. Dead zones are waters so low in oxygen that nothing can live,"" added Temme.
In February 2019, Pivot Bio issued a report citing that its nitrogen-producing microbe for corn had better ROI and superior harvesting superior yields. The data was based on research trials from 11,000 farms across multiple states in 2018. The farms were identified by a third party, IN10T that worked with the growers to gather harvest performance data from each of the farms.
Temme says that even in challenging soil types, their nitrogen-producing microbes had a close to a 17 bushel per acre average advantage against comparable fields using only chemical nitrogen fertilizer.
But to create microbes that increase corn crop yields, the company had to examine hundreds of soil samples they dug up from fields around the US.
""We were looking to single out microbes that had a mutualistic relationship with corn out of the billions that live in the soil. We call it 'shovelomics' because it starts and ends with the soil beneath our feet,"" added Temme.
Temme says it is essential to understand that certain microbes can produce nitrogen, but that its ability to produce nitrogen has been suppressed over time.
""When extra nitrogen is in the soil from years of applied chemical nitrogen is sensed by soil microbes, the microbes evolve and stop spending energy to produce nitrogen naturally.
Pivot Bio 're-awakens' the nitrogen-producing capabilities occurring naturally in soil microbes by using genomic sequencing to identify these crop-associated microbes with the natural ability to produce nitrogen.
""Pivot Bio builds on decades of research into the genes that produce the cellular machinery necessary to convert nitrogen in the air into nitrogen for plants. Our scientists fine-tune that molecular machine by editing the microbe’s genetic instructions to produce nitrogen daily, as the corn plant needs it,"" said Temme. ""The microbes go through rigorous testing in the lab and greenhouse to ensure they can perform under modern agricultural field conditions and once we’ve identified the most robust microbes, we advance the best microbe candidates to the field.""
Temme says that after the best microbe candidates are identified, the scientists move to real-life farming conditions and go out into the field again with a shovel to examine their microbes as they perform throughout the growing season - gathering data on colonization and activity.
Some of the traits they look for in a field-ready microbe is how well it produces nitrogen and how well it shares that nitrogen. In greenhouse testing (think of this as a beta trial) they learn about the way the plant and the microbe interact, examining the roots to ensure the microbe is the right partner for the corn plant and that it grows with the root system as the crop matures.
Temme adds that Pivot Bio’s microbes adhere to crop roots and feed nitrogen to the corn plant daily, no excess nitrogen is produced.
""Growers are confident the nitrogen they put down via Pivot Bio microbes stays with the corn plant, feeding it through the plant’s life cycle,"" said Temme. ""And, they stop wasting money on chemical nitrogen since they know that half of it never reaches the plant.""
Pivot Bio has $86.7M in funding to date and plans to create microbial solutions for wheat and rice in the future. Pivot Bio's initial funding came from t he Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
""Based on conservative calculations from the 2018 results of the trials on the 11,000 farms, the corn farmers using our biological microbial product over chemical fertilizers expands to just 35 percent of the U.S. corn market which is nearly 20,000 metric tons of nitrous oxide emissions could be reduced or prevented - and that is equivalent to taking nearly 1.5 million cars off the road,"" added Temme.
Temme adds that this could prevent up to 500,000 metric tons of nitrates leaching into waterways."
China Awaits Starter's Pistol For Period Of Epic Solar Deployment,www.forbes.com,John Parnell,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnparnell/2019/05/27/china-awaits-starters-pistol-for-period-of-epic-solar-deployment/,"China could be set to install as much solar power as Europe has in the past two years, inside less than six months. That’s the prediction among a number of the country’s solar panel manufacturers who are currently bracing themselves for the rush.
Deployment slowed to a near standstill around a year ago when the so-called 531 New Deal policy was announced (on the May 31). The new deal was not a great deal. Subsidies were halted overnight for the vast majority of projects. The hiatus on approvals for projects looking for a subsidy is ongoing.
An employee walks past photovoltaic panels at a solar power station operated by Huanghe Hydropower Development Co., a unit of State Power Investment Corp., at the Golmud Solar Park on the outskirts of Golmud, Qinghai province, China, on Tuesday, July 24, 2018. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg
 For comparison, in 2017, China installed more than 52GW , around half of all the solar installed that year. In Q1 of this year, it installed just 5GW. If it repeated that feat in Q2, which is about what is expected, it would be set for its poorest year since 2015. In a sector where disappointment greets any data point that veers from an exponential path, that’s really disappointing.
While the slowdown has been playing out however, Chinese officials have been meeting with the industry to build the new subsidy plan. As it stands, the expectation is that a pot of RMB3 billion, that’s currently just short of $435 million, will be made available.
The money will be split between different types of projects. Utility-scale sites will need to enter an auction with the lowest requested price premium, over and above that aforementioned coal benchmark, winning out. Estimates have suggested that the subsidy pot could support the construction of 30GW of projects this year .
But the policy is not yet formally enacted so work cannot commence.
In its formative years, when solar power was propped up by very healthy subsidies, there would often be late charges to get finished before deadlines. In the UK, the rush was pronounced . There were multiple stories of sought after grid connection engineers being flown around the country by helicopter to make sure more lucrative paybacks weren’t missed.
When Beijing provides the final policy confirmation, it will release the tightest, largest coiled spring the industry has ever seen.
At that point, the auction process will be established and bids prepared, that could take up to one month. That means approvals in July, according to one executive speaking at the recent Intersolar Europe exhibition in Munich. The best scenario for developers means in the space of five months, they will have to install a figure more akin to an annual total. Delays result in winning projects tariffs being reduced so nobody can afford to drag their heels.
The global impact, as Chinese demand ramps up, will be a spike in prices. A trio of executives of Chinese manufacturers put the increase at 10-15%. One, Eric Luo of GCL, has done so publicly and put his guestimate for second-half installs in China at 25GW.
Adding to the demand are 15GW of grid-parity projects approved last week . These installs, which can match their region’s benchmark coal power price, won’t all be built in 2019, fortunately.
Regardless, the message for anyone in the booming markets of Spain or Southeast Asia is clear, buy your modules right now."
"FTC Says That Within Reason, Retailers Such As Auto Dealers May Not Restrict Negative Reviews",www.forbes.com,Jim Henry,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2019/05/27/ftc-says-that-within-reason-retailers-such-as-auto-dealers-may-not-restrict-negative-reviews/,"Ever wonder what happens if you post a review of a business you’ve visited — especially if it’s a bad one? Retail businesses like auto dealerships legally aren’t allowed to restrict unfavorable consumer reviews, auto industry experts advised dealers and other interested parties, following recent actions by the Federal Trade Commission .
The FTC cited the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act, in settlements earlier this month with businesses in different industries. That suggests auto dealerships better look out, as well, the National Automobile Dealers Association told its members in a recent Q&A aimed at dealers.
Getty
In the FTC settlements, businesses were accused of violations like adding fine print to their contracts, which the FTC said was aimed at restricting consumers’ ability to post negative reviews, or complain to the Better Business Bureau .
“Under the CRFA, dealerships are prohibited from including provisions in any ‘form’ contract that seek to restrict people from posting honest reviews about the dealership, or penalize them for doing so,” the dealer association said.
Conversely, according to the Q&A, dealers don’t have to simply “live with” inappropriate or dishonest reviews, under certain circumstances.
For example, a dealership could contractually prohibit certain reviews, such as those that contain confidential or private information — for example, a person’s financial, medical, or personnel file; company trade secrets; or reviews that are libelous, harassing, abusive or obscene, the dealer association said.
For its part, the FTC added Consumer Review Fairness Act tips for businesses , which also make interesting reading for consumers.
“The Consumer Review Fairness Act makes it illegal for companies to include standardized provisions that threaten or penalize people for posting honest reviews,” the FTC said. “For example, in an online transaction, it would be illegal for a company to include a provision in its terms and conditions that prohibits or punishes negative reviews by customers.”"
Will The Ghost Of Daimler Haunt Fiat Chrysler's Merger Ambitions?,www.forbes.com,Simon Constable,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2019/05/27/will-the-ghost-of-daimler-haunt-fiat-chryslers-merger-ambitions/,"Not again? That should be the question following Monday's proposed merger between Italian-U.S. carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France's auto manufacturer Renault, best known for its eponymous brand of vehicles. The deal would create a mega-manufacturer of light vehicles with annual sales of almost $200 billion.
Apparently, the idea is that the two companies join forces to tackle the massive changes in the car business including the trend away from gasoline engines and towards battery-powered electric vehicles, an area being pushed by U.S. rival Tesla.
Bad history
The merger idea might sound great, but only if you choose to forget the ill-fated merger of German carmaker Daimler Benz with America's Chrysler.
DaimlerChrysler was formed from a so-called ""merger of equals"" in 1998, but it was a marriage that didn't last even a decade. The deal broke down in 2007. I followed this closely as for part of that period I worked in the auto business for GM, which was just down the road from Chrysler in Michigan.
The problem was that the two companies were incompatible. On the one hand, you had the engineering-focused Germans from Daimler known for reliable cars such as Mercedes Benz. And on the other, there were the design-led folks from Chrysler who birthed a series of love-em-or-hate-em models such as the Prowler (a two-seater sports car with an exposed axle) and the retro-looking PT Cruiser."
Online Toxicity Is As Old As The Web Itself But The Return To Communities May Help,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/27/online-toxicity-is-as-old-as-the-web-itself-but-the-return-to-communities-may-help/,"Getty Images Getty Social media platforms have come under increasing fire for failing to prevent the exploitation of their tools to spread online toxicity, from hate speech to terrorism incitement. Policymakers, pundits and the public in turn proclaim that social media is the reason for growing online hatred and the spread of digital toxicity. Citing everything from their emphasis on viral content to their gamification of sharing, social media has become the modern bogeyman. Yet a closer look back at the early days of the Web reminds us that online toxicity is as old as the Web itself but that our return to communities may help.
Over the past decade our social platforms have somehow devolved from the savoir of democracy to the destroyer of society. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook were lauded for their roles in the Arab Spring just under a decade ago, credited by many with helping tilt the balance against repressive dictatorships. Somehow in the years since they have been redefined as conveyors of hate rather than of freedom.
Have social platforms really unleashed a wave of hatred upon the world that never existed before?
Looking to the early days of the “Web” and its predecessors, there were always communities of hate and intolerance. In the Era of Usenet, there was a wealth of toxicity and falsehoods to be found. Even falsified imagery and video proliferated.
The difference is that in the early days of the Web and its predecessors, only a very small portion of the population was online and exposed to such content. Those that were online tended to fall into narrow demographic, cultural and lived experience backgrounds.
Technological limitations of the day meant most communities were relatively small and insular, focused on specific narrow interests or behaviors and having relatively small membership. The idea of hundreds of millions of people pouring forth their real-time thoughts into a torrential fire hose of social chaos was not yet even imaginable.
The small communities and similar demographics and cultural backgrounds of early Web users meant misogyny, racism, ethnocentrism and every other imaginable toxicity could find homes in like-minded communities that were largely invisible to the general public. The small size of most communities meant such content was more insular, shared among like-minded individuals, rather than broadcast to the outside world.
As the Web has grown over the years into a far more diverse community, these toxic issues have become more visible.
It is notable that Twitter has become in many ways the public face of bullying, hate speech, racism, sexism and other forms of toxic speech more than its peers. It is not that Twitter necessarily has more hatred than other platforms, but rather that other platforms' non-public nature and community structure means such hatred is compartmentalized among like-minded individuals, much as it was in the early Web.
In contrast, Twitter is a free-for-all in which every post is visible to the entire planet, meaning hateful speech can be directly published at and consumed by society’s most vulnerable. In contrast, platforms like Facebook envelope users in the protective bubble of community, making it harder for harmful actors to reach them.
Putting this all together, we see that online toxicity is not something new, borne out of social platforms that suddenly gave us all a voice. It has been with us since the dawn of the digital world.
The difference is that social media platforms have encouraged broadcast designs in which hateful individuals are able to reach beyond their own communities to target their horrific speech directly against those they dislike. In turn, those broadcast mediums offer few tools to protect users against such attacks beyond blocking or reporting individual users one at a time in a perpetual game of whack-a-mole.
In the end, returning the Web to the small communities from whence it came will not stop online toxicity, but may help contain it and restore the barriers that previously prevented its free flow. Most importantly, the shift away from broadcast mediums will deprive those who wish to harm others of the megaphone which they have so effectively wielded and offer a bit more protection to society’s most vulnerable.

NBA Draft: Atlanta Hawks Could Have A Set Core This June,www.forbes.com,Morten Jensen,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mortenjensen/2019/05/27/nba-draft-atlanta-hawks-could-have-a-set-core-this-june/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. SportsMoney I cover a wide variety of subjects within the NBA. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin ATLANTA, GEORGIA - MARCH 13: Trae Young #11 of the Atlanta Hawks draws a foul from Mike Conley #11 of the Memphis Grizzlies in the second half at State Farm Arena on March 13, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) Getty Usually it takes years for teams to build around their superstar, but in Atlanta, the team is already set up well for Trae Young, who wrapped up an impressive debut season in April averaging 19.1 points and 8.1 assists. The 20-year old point guard is flanked by one of the league's best hidden secrets, John Collins (19.5 points, 9.8 rebounds), as well as Taurean Prince and DeAndre' Bembry, with the rookie duo of Kevin Huerter and Omari Spellman rounding out the current young core. ADVERTISEMENT
That is not a bad start, and given that the Hawks own the rights to the eight and tenth selections in next month's NBA Draft, odds are that core will grow deeper real soon. In fact, the Hawks are absolutely guaranteed two of these presumed post-Top 5 picks: Coby White, De'Andre Hunter, Jaxson Hayes, Sekou Doumbouya, and Cam Reddish. Whichever two they choose, assuming they keep both picks, the organization will add quality talent to an already intriguing core.
While the NBA is going position-less, there are still certain needs players with a specific skillset are best suited to solve, such as rim protection.
Hayes, presumably, would be high on Atlanta's board given their need of a center to add to the core. The just-turned 19-year-old was about as effective a shot-blocker at Texas as one could hope for, swatting 71 shots in 741 minutes on the year, for an average of 2.2 in just 23.3 minutes of playing time. Hayes's defensive prowess, combined with his ability to slip screens and make himself an alley-oop target around the rim, will force opponents to make constant decisions whether to stick with Young on the outside, or rotate over to cover the basket when Hayes rolls, in which case Collins, a highly versatile scorer, could benefit from seeing less defensive attention.
The addition of Hayes could help Atlanta take a higher frequency of high-percentage shots around the rim, as Hayes converted on a ridiculous 72.8 percent of his shots this season. That is not just a random stat put together by dunks, but also further indication that Hayes doesn't rush shots. He shows patience in the paint and isn't afraid of taking contact, which resulted in him taking a free throw every seven-and-a-half minutes, which he converted at a very robust 74 percent. With the Hawks ranking 24th in two-point field goal attempts, in large part by design, it's crucial their offense don't end up predictive. Hayes will help add layers to that offense.
A future starting line-up of Hayes, Collins, Prince, Huerter, and Young could provide opponents with plenty of headaches for all the decisions on the fly they'd need to endure when running through screens, chasing guys off-ball, closing off the rim for lob plays, and so on. Selecting Hayes at #8 would seem like the safe choice, assuming White and Hunter are off the board to Phoenix and Chicago respectively.
That leaves Reddish or Doumbouya, the latter being french and plays internationally, after Washington has picked at nine. And frankly, both will come in as projects.
The Hawks could use another wing, especially if that wing has more upside than Bembry or Prince, and both candidates could end up fitting that description in a couple of years. Reddish is the better known commodity, even if his Duke tenure left more question marks about his game than coming into college in the first place, but Doumbouya is the most intriguing prospect of the two.
Reddish will be 20 by the start of the season, whereas Doumbouya won't turn 19 until the very end of the calendar year, which means Reddish comes in with a slight disadvantage in terms of potential, given how equally raw they both are. Both have great looking shooting strokes, Reddish more so than Doumbouya, and both are defensively inclined and should become at the very least average defenders on the pro level. Doumbouya has played a year amongst professionals in the french Pro A, a league often considered to be second-best worldwide in terms of sheer athleticism of its athletes, which should assist his transition into the NBA. His 19-minute average is impressive considering how strict international clubs are with young players and playing time, and it's not uncommon in Europe for star players to average minutes in the low 20's. ADVERTISEMENT
Doumbouya's numbers: 7.8 points and 3.3 rebounds, on 48.2 percent shooting from the field, 34.3 percent from three, and 79.3 percent from the line. Compared to NCAA standards, those numbers might seem minuscule for a future lottery pick, but in Europe that is putting tremendous trust in such a young player. Furthermore, his percentages indicate room for growth. Shooting near 80 percent from the free throw line at the tender age of 18 is no small feat, and is frequently an indicator of a player's future three-point success.
Reddish, for comparison's sake, had higher volume by playing over ten minutes more a game and enjoying a considerably larger role. His shooting, which isn't necessarily representative of what he'll do at the NBA level, was off all year which saw him end his college career hitting just 35.6 percent of his shots while turning the ball over 2.7 times a game as third-most frequent ball-handler. But while Reddish suffered through a statistical nightmare of a season, he did well defensively due to his size (6'8 with a 7'1 wingspan) and quick movement with both hands and feet. Should his jumper begin to drop at the NBA level, it's easy to see a scenario where he becomes a steady wing for the Hawks, if he's the one left on the board.
Whatever happens at #10, the Hawks have a lot of options to build a stable product for the future. They might not find a superstar with either of their picks, but if they locate two players who down the line can function as full-, or even part-time, starters that's a major win for a team already with a very solid young core in place. It's fair to assume that both Young and Collins will enter stardom within the next year or two, so having a small army of capable role players, some of whom might become more than that, could prove beneficial for depth purposes or trades, should Atlanta wish to consolidate talent.
That option is probably on the table too next month given that they hold two selections, but unless they can break into the Top 5 and grab Jarrett Culver, one of the most sure-fire players in this draft, there is little logic in trading up to settle for one spin of the bottle, when they can have two.

9 Most Beautiful Beaches In Europe You Should Visit This Summer,www.forbes.com,Cecilia Rodriguez,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2019/05/27/9-most-beautiful-beaches-in-europe-you-should-visit-this-summer/,"The 2019 list by European Best Destinations (EBD) of trendiest beaches in Europe includes some hidden gems as well as other, better-known, romantic and beautiful spots, from the 'secret' Cala Pregonda on Spain's Balearic island of Menorca to Vlychos Beach on the Greek island of Hydra. ""Come breathe the fresh air of pine trees on Nugal Beach in Croatia or Cala Sa Boadella in Spain, or treat yourself to a romantic break on the beautiful beach of Positano in Italy,"" invites the Brussels-based EBD organization that promotes the continent's best destinations while rewarding and spotlighting its most-visited places.
"" The best beaches in France, Spain, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Turkey, Montenegro but also England, Bulgaria and Romania are awaiting you .""
Working with the European Commission to promote sustainable tourism and in partnership with more than 300 European tourism offices, including 80 sustainable tourism destinations, EBD organizes tourism competitions in Europe based on the votes of travelers from around the world, such as Best European Christmas Markets, Most Romantic Destinations and Best European Ski Resorts .
Looking for a dream beach for your next holiday? Here are nine of the beautiful beaches that made it to the top of the list in the EBD competition for the title of ""Best Beach in Europe."" ""
The #1 spot was awarded to Pasjaca Beach in the Konavle Region, 10 minutes from Cavtat - which was also chosen among the most beautiful destinations in Europe - and a 30-minute drive from Dubrovnic, the pearl of the Adriatic.
With the Game of Thrones fever that has exponentially increased fan-tourism in Croatia and particularly in Dubrovnik, where several key scenes were shot in the Adriatic Sea town known in the series as ""King’s Landing,"" the region and some of its most popular beaches have suffered a tourist ""invasion.""
Pasjca beach in the village Popovići, on the other hand, has been described as ""one of the most mysterious, serene and pristine beaches,"" hidden below rocks at the foot of a cliff and not easy to reach. "" No music, no bars, no cars,"" according to EBD. ""We advise fans of loud music, beach bars and water sports to avoid the beach; there is nothing of that kind there but nature and quietness."" The beach is the product of nature and man: In 1955, a tunnel was created from the fields upstream to stop floods. The remaining rocks were left on the seaside. With time, the waves transformed the rocks into sand.
Nugal Beach, Tucepi, Makarska Riviera, Croatia.
European Best Destinations Nugal Beach, Croatia
Also in Croatia, Nugal Beach in Tucepi was voted on to the list of favorite European beaches.
A partly nudist beach on the Makarska Riviera ""could also be ranked among the best secret beaches in Europe; it takes more than 30 minutes to walk in the rocks to get there,"" explains EBD.
Apprehensive about nudism on the beach? ""It's like diving into the water, once you’ve dared you will not regret it. This beach is a small haven of peace with a family atmosphere.""
Porthminster beach, St Ives, Cornwall, England
European Best Destinations Porthminster Beach, England
Never thought of England for a beach holiday? Have you heard of Cornwall? Located in the country's far southwest, it's a beautiful county that boasts hundreds of sandy beaches.
Porthminster, part of the old fishing port of St Ives, is full of authenticity, charm, crystal-clear blue waters and fine sand. St Ives also attracts artists from around the world who come to find inspiration.
St Nicholas Island, Budva, Montenegro.
European Best Destinations St. Nicholas Island, Montenegro
The small island of St. Nicholas, 'Sveti Nikola', in Budva, has landed on the list of the most beautiful islands in Europe thanks to the votes it won in the European Best Destinations competition.
Home of some extraordinary beaches and of deer on its wild side, the island is located opposite the beautiful city of Budva, 30 minutes from Tivat airport in Montenegro and two hours from Dubrovnik's airport in Croatia.
Saleccia Beach, Casta, Corsica.
European Best Destinations Saleccia Beach, Corsica, France
The remote beach of Saleccia is located on the northern coast of the Mediterranean island of Corsica, which has been part of France since 1768 but retains a distinct Italian culture.
Saleccia's fine white sand and crystal clear waters are less accessible than other Corsican beaches and for that reason also better preserved.
""Courage and patience will be necessary to drive from the village of Casta to the beach (15 kilometers), the roads are in very bad conditions!"" warns EBD. ""You may feel all alone but not completely, though: There is a campsite and a small shop located 400 meters from the beach."" Don't miss the nearby village of Nonza, ranked among the most beautiful villages in France.
Numana Alta Beach, Numana, Ancona, Italy.
European Best Destinations Numana Alta Beach, Italy
Sun, good restaurants, delicious ice cream, a crystal-clear sea and an unspoiled beach with a delicate scent of pine trees in the air - that's the description of Numana Alta beach. And it's not the only such beach in the area.
Numana Bassa , for example, "" is perfect for children, with playgrounds, beach facilities and restaurants.""
Numana Alta is quieter and ""perfect for a rest with a good book or if you want, to dip into the sea."" It's protected from the wind by the reefs.
Positano Beach, Amalfi Coast, Italy.
European Best Destinations Positano Beach, Italy
Also in Italy, Positano beach is located on the famous Amalfi Coast, one of Italy’s ""postcard"" destinations as well-known as Portofino, Portovenere and Cinque Terre.
While for some it can feel like a tourist trap, it's still considered one of the most beautiful places on earth.
Positano is recommended for couples of all ages. ""It's hard not to succumb to the charm of this place that seems to have been created by gods.""
Cala Pregonda, Menorca Island, Spain.
European Best Destinations Cala Pregonda, Menorca Island, Spain
This "" paradise beach"" is located on the island of Menorca, one the four larger islands forming the Balearic archipelago in the Spanish Mediterranean Sea that includes Mallorca, Ibiza and Formentera.
Arriving to Cala Pregunda follows a half-hour walk along a stunning path. Pregonda is a c lear, scenic bay in a cove with a golden-sand beach and rock formations. "" Dive under the water, beautiful little fish are dancing in the clear waters: nature is everywhere around you,"" advises EBD. The parking lot is large (and free.) ""Do not stop at the first beach on your way; it is pretty but often stormed by the first holidaymakers.""
Vlychos Beach, Hydra Island, Greece.
European Best Destinations Vlychos Beach, Hydra Island, Greece
There are different routes for reaching the idyllic Hydra Island and the beautiful beach of Vlychos. You can go by car on a three-hour drive, plus a ferry crossing from Athens. Braver visitors go by foot (a 37-hour-hike plus ferry). The easiest method is by bus to Athens Harbour (the port of Piraeus) and then aboard a ferry to Hydra for a two-hour crossing. There are six ferries each day so no need to hurry or book in advance.
From Hydra port to the beach is a 30-minute walk.
Vlychos is one of the only sandy beaches on Hydra. The sand was shipped there by an Englishman, the owner of the bar. ""If you like music of the seventies, grab a stool, order a nice cocktail from the bar and enjoy that moment of pure nostalgia,"" recommends EBD. ""If not, rent a deck chair away from the speakers and enjoy this little slice of paradise.""

AAII Sentiment Survey: Neutral Sentiment Rebounds Strongly,www.forbes.com,Charles Rotblut,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2019/05/27/aaii-sentiment-survey-neutral-sentiment-rebounds-strongly/,"The percentage of individual investors describing their short-term outlook for stocks as “neutral” rebounded strongly. The latest AAII Sentiment Survey also shows declines in both optimism and pessimism. ADVERTISEMENT Bullish sentiment, expectations that stock prices will rise over the next six months, fell 5.1 percentage points to 24.7%. Optimism was last lower on December 12, 2018 (20.9%). This is the 14th time this year that optimism is below its historical average of 38.5%.
Neutral sentiment, expectations that stock prices will stay essentially unchanged over the next six months, rose 8.3 percentage points to 39.2%. The increase puts neutral sentiment back above its historical average of 31.0% for the 16th time in 17 weeks.
Bearish sentiment, expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months, pulled back by 3.2 percentage points. Even with the decrease, pessimism is above its historical average of 30.5% on back-to-back weeks for the first time since January.
Since setting a 2019 high of 43.1% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment has fallen by a cumulative 18.4 percentage points. At its current level, optimism is at an unusually low level. Such readings have historically been followed by higher-than-median six- and 12-month returns in the S&P 500 index.
Many individual investors have been monitoring trade negotiations, particularly between the U.S. and China. We’ve also heard from AAII members who are concerned about a drop in stock prices occurring, though there are other members who have been encouraged by this year’s upward run in stock prices. Also having an influence are monetary policy, Washington politics (including President Trump), geopolitics, valuations, corporate earnings and the pace of economic growth.
This week’s special question asked AAII members how, given the recent U.S.-China headlines, trade issues are influencing their outlook for stocks. Responses varied, though most respondents view the trade impasse as a near-term negative for stocks.
ADVERTISEMENT Nearly a quarter of all respondents (24%) say they expect stock prices to fall if the impasse continues. Just under 17% of respondents describe themselves as being more cautious or are otherwise postponing buying more stocks until there is more clarity. About 9% anticipate more uncertainty, while a similar proportion of respondents think trade issues will contribute to further volatility in the stock market. Slightly more than 12% expect the stocks to rise once a deal is reached, though many of these respondents say the stocks could be under pressure until then. Approximately 14% say trade issues are not influencing how they invest.
Here is a sampling of the responses:
“Definitely affecting it. I will continue to be cautious with new acquisitions until the issue is resolved.” “The lack of a trade agreement and imposition of tariffs will likely result in a drop in the stock market.” “I believe they will work something out, although in the short term there could be some slowing in the economy.” “I am taking advantage of the volatility; buying the dips and selling the peaks.” “They make my outlook for stocks definitely bearish. Without the trade war, my outlook would be neutral to slightly bullish.”
As of May 23, 2019
American Association of Individual Investors This week’s AAII Sentiment Survey results:

All 5 Major Equity Averages Have Negative Weekly Charts,www.forbes.com,Richard Henry Suttmeier,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2019/05/27/all-5-major-equity-averages-have-negative-weekly-charts/,"All five major averages ended last week below their five-week modified moving averages with declining 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastics. This defines negative weekly charts. Tech stocks have been hit by the China trade war. Bank stocks lag on worries about refinancing of corporate bonds. The energy sector slump as crude oil declines. Retail stocks fall hard on concerns of increased costs due to tariffs.
ADVERTISEMENT The unwinding of the Federal Reserve balance sheet is a tightening of monetary policy. When the Federal Reserve unwinds its balance sheet money is drained from the banking system in what’s called “quantitative tightening.” The Fed reduced its balance sheet by $27 billion during the week ended on May 15, then by another $5 billion during the week of May 22.
On May 22 the balance sheet was marked at $3.860 trillion, down $640 billion since the end of September 2017 when quantitative tightening began. The unwinding will end at the end of September but will not meet Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s stated goal of a $3.5 trillion balance sheet.
Here’s Last Week’s Scorecard
Scorecard for the Major Equity Averades
Global Market Consultants The Dow Jones Industrial Average (25,585.69 on May 24) is up 17.8% from its December 26 intraday low of 21,712.53 and is 5.1% below its all-time intraday high of 26,951.81 set on October 3. The all-time closing high of 26,828.39 was also set on October 3. Monthly and semiannual value levels are 25,251 and 24,340, respectively, with its annual pivot at 25,819 and weekly and quarter risky levels are 26,365 and 27,891, respectively. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading ended last week at 64.39, down from 77.91 on May 17, as the “inflating parabolic bubble” pops. The Dow is below its five-week modified moving average at $25,965.16.
The S&P 500 (2,826.06 on May 24) is up 20.4% from its December 26 intraday low of 2,346.58 and set an all-time intraday high of 2,954.13 on May 1. SPX is 4.3% below the high. The all-time closing high is 2,945.83 set on April 30. Monthly and semiannual value levels are 2,677.9 and 2,668.8, respectively, with its annual pivot at 2,867.1 and weekly and quarterly risky levels at 2,939.8 and 2,985.1, respectively. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading ended last week at 77.45, down from 87.45 on May 17, as its inflating parabolic bubble is popping. The S&P is below its five-week modified moving average at 2,863.18.
The Nasdaq Composite (7,637.01 on May 24) is up 23.4% from its December 24 intraday low of 6,190.17 and set its all-time intraday high of 8,176.0 on April 29. The Nasdaq is 6.6% below the high. The all-time closing high of 8,164.00 was set on May 3. Annual, semiannual and monthly value levels are 7,370, 7,274 and 7,013, respectively, with weekly and quarterly risky levels at 8,101 and 8,367, respectively. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading ended last week at 76.45, down from on May 17 as its inflating parabolic bubble pops. The Nasdaq is below its five-week modified moving average at 7,830.23.
ADVERTISEMENT The Dow Transportation Average (10,137.59 on May 24) is up 17.4% above its December 24 intraday low of 8,636.79 but is in correction territory, 12.8% below its all-time intraday high of 11,623.58 set on September 14. The closing high is 11,570.84 also set on September 14. Monthly and semiannual value levels are 9,627 and 8,858, respectively, with an annual pivot at 10,976, and weekly and quarterly risky levels at 10,891 and 11,372, respectively. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading ended last week at 62.06, down from 74.76 on May 17. Transports is below its five-week modified moving average at 10,535.98.
The Russell 2000 (1,514.11 on May 24) is 19.5% above its December 24 intraday low of 1,266.92 and in correction territory, 13.1% below its all-time intraday high of 1,742.09 set on August 31. The closing high of 1,740.75 was also set on August 31. Its semiannual pivot is 1,504.17 with a monthly value level at 1,345.23. Weekly and quarterly risky levels are 1,588.26 and 1,667.15, respectively. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading ended last week at 64.54, down from 78.01 on May 17. The Russell 2000 is below its five-week modified moving average at 1,554.07.
How to use my value levels and risky levels:
Value levels and risky levels are based upon the last nine weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes. The first set of levels was based upon the closes on December 31. The original semiannual and annual levels remain in play. The weekly level changes each week; the monthly level was changed at the end of January, February, March and April. The quarterly level was changed at the end of March. My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before its time horizon expires.
How to use 12x3x3 Weekly Slow Stochastic Readings:
My choice of using 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon back-testing many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years. The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows and closes for the stock.
ADVERTISEMENT There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading and I found that the slow reading worked the best. The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00 with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. Recently I noted that stocks tend to peak and decline 10% to 20% and more shortly after a reading rises above 90.00, so I call that an inflating parabolic bubble as a bubble always pops. I also call a reading below 10.00 as being “too cheap to ignore.”"

The Bruins are riding a hot streak into this matchup, having won seven in a row—including a sweep of the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final—to reach the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 2013. The Blues haven’t had as easy of a journey up to this point, going down 2-1 against the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Final—losing Game 3 on a highly controversial overtime goal—before racking up three consecutive wins and clinching the franchise’s first berth in the Stanley Cup Finals in 49 years. St. Louis was swept by Boston in that championship series nearly five decades ago, the third time in a row that the organization would lose the Stanley Cup Finals 4-0 during its first three years of existence. The Blues are still looking for their first “W” in a series with Lord Stanley’s Cup on the line, but oddsmakers don’t believe they’ll get it in on Monday evening. The books have installed the visiting team as a +135 underdog, while the Bruins are currently -150 chalk. The public likes Boston at this number, as 66% of all bets and 51% of total dollars wagered on the contest are on the home side. The Bruins are also drawing most of the action against the -1.5 goal spread, with 66% of tickets and 82% of cash on their side. The over/under for Game 1 has been set at 5 goals, with the over side slightly favored at -130 odds. The betting public is split 50/50 on that line in terms of betting percentage, but there more big wagers (71% of all cash) on the under side.
Will the Bruins come through for their supporters and go up 1-0 in this thrilling championship series, or will the Bruins find a way to pull off the upset for their first ever Stanley Cup Finals victory?

Boston Bruins vs. St. Louis Blues Game 1 Quotes
Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy was asked what Boston’s biggest advantage over the Blues is in this series (via ASAP Sports ):
Boy, that's going to be board material. Experience. I'll go the easy route. I just believe that our guys that have been there, that have won a cup, have lost a cup, that should give us an edge. Some people disagree with that once you're here, but I believe it will give us an edge. I think it's helped us a lot this week in the preparation, with all the down time. And hopefully going forward that is an advantage for us.
Blues head coach Craig Berube gave a quick scouting report on the challenges of facing Boston’s defense and believes the two teams are similar in that regard (via ASAP Sports ):
Well, the similarities I see is like they play -- they're a good defensive hockey team like we are. I think all year long they have been a very good defensive team. They got obviously that top line's a very good line, it can score goals. And I think both teams want to really get on the forecheck, be a physical team, be a hard team to play against. That's what I notice in the playoffs watching them. They're extremely hard to play against, they battle, they play hard. Again, their centermen, they play 200-foot games, like ours do. Defensemen-wise, we're obviously bigger back there, but they got the big guy, [Bruins defenseman Zdeno] Chara, he's the biggest one of them all. But they got some pretty good mobile D back there that move the puck well. So I see a lot of similarities in the team game more than anything. I think the way, their style of play and our style of play, there's some similarities there.
Boston star Brad Marchand spoke about what it means to be a leader for the Bruins (via BostonHerald.com ):
Our team has always instilled in the younger players, to play a certain way, to mature a certain way on and off the ice. The leadership group I had to follow is very easy to walk in their footsteps and try to be like them. You try and set that same example for the guys coming up. We have a culture in here that we want to grow and continue to instill in the young guys. And they’ve bought in. They’re all dialed in right now. They’re excited and they have been all year. It’s exciting when you don’t have to pull guys along, that they follow and the want to be part of the success and they want to grow as a group. We have that on our team this year and it’s been incredible to watch.
St. Louis center Ryan O’Reilly is excited to have a chance at lifting the Stanley Cup after battling back from the having the NHL’s worst record back in January (via STLToday.com ):
I think it shows the parity of the league, how we were able to stay in it. We weren’t playing consistent hockey. We’d have a good game, think we figured it out, and couldn’t come back the next one and we were able to stay somewhat in the hunt and we kept working at it and eventually we win 11 in a row and that was amazing to see. You look at the board, you think, We’re one of the better teams in the league now. We’re going to have a chance at this. It’s amazing how a season, the ups and downs of it, there are so many highs and lows, and to be able to stay even keeled and keep working at it. It’s crazy to see how it pays off.
Boston Bruins vs. St. Louis Blues Game 1 Pro Prediction
Pick: Bruins -150
Prediction: Bruins 3 – Blues 1"
Deep Learning Algorithms Are Expected To Boost Liquid Biopsy Techniques,www.forbes.com,Yiannis Mouratidis,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/yiannismouratidis/2019/05/27/deep-learning-algorithms-are-expected-to-boost-liquid-biopsy-techniques/?ss=healthcare,"According to Wikipedia, the earliest diagnostic biopsy was conducted by an Arab physician in the 11 th century. The term “biopsy” derives from the Greek word bios which means life and the also Greek word “opsis” which means sight. It was first introduced in the 19 th century and since then medical researchers and practitioners have developed several techniques to perform biopsies on living organs or tissues needed further observation. Modern instruments such as intestinal biopsy tubes can extract samples from parts of the body where it is difficult to have access or even hazardous. In the cases described above, this histologic procedure is invasive and quite complicated putting a financial burden, not to mention the extra strain on the patient. Liquid biopsy is an emerging and very promising technique to perform biopsies. It detects and isolates the circulating tumor DNA and exosomes as a source of genomic and proteomic information in patients with cancer. As every new technique faces technical hurdles which affect effectiveness and accuracy. New technological developments and next-generation sequencing analysis allow a broad application of liquid biopsy in a wide range of settings. Initially correlated to prognosis, liquid biopsy data are now being studied for cancer diagnosis, including screenings, and most importantly for the prediction of response or resistance to given treatments. In particular, the identification of specific mutations in target genes can be detected more easily as liquid biopsies are easier to be taken. That translates to more data for the physicians to analyze in real time with a specific treatment and decide on the appropriateness of treatment or the identification of secondary resistance, aiming to diagnose disease progression early enough.
Since the first description of tumor cells in blood circulation in 1869, substantial progress has been made from biotechnological applications to isolate CTCs from heterogeneous blood components. However, the systematic application of liquid biopsy in real practice is still hindered by hurdles, such as unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity, lack of standardization, and high economic and human resource costs, and still offers many challenges. In fact, due to the low concentration of CTCs, ctDNA, and EXOs currently recoverable from the patient, the analytical results sometimes suffer from unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity.
We are already at the second stage of liquid biopsy methods
The initial methods applied for liquid biopsies focused on either ctDNA or protein. But as Nickolas Papadopoulos, Ph.D., Professor of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center explained in an article published in Technology Networks “The amount of ctDNA in the blood in early-stage cancer is very low and can constitute only 0.01% of the total cell-free DNA.” This can create stochastic events based on the amount of blood used for the test. In addition, many cancers do not ‘shed’ their tumor DNA into the circulation so some cancers would not be detected if only the ctDNA factor was assayed and the test, though specific, would not be sufficiently sensitive.
The first report of dual ctDNA and protein liquid biopsy research that combined blood tests for KRAS gene mutations with protein biomarkers to determine whether the combination of these markers was superior to any single marker , reports that the comparison between patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and healthy people led to a sensitivity of 64% with a specificity of 99.5%. This is far better from any test that analyzes one of the two factors.
Promising two-factor liquid biopsy with less than $500, CancerSEEK is a promising solution for the liquid biopsy market
CancerSEEK Then a second report focused on other early-stage cancers, including ovarian, liver, stomach, pancreatic, esophageal, colorectal, lung, and breast. The test, named CancerSEEK demonstrated a median sensitivity of 70% (lowest for breast cancer at 33%, highest for ovarian cancer at 98%) with a specificity higher than 99% for all tested cancers. Applying a machine learning algorithm could even help locate the tumor, which would be able to be corroborated by conventional tests, such as mammograms or colonoscopy. “The test in effect is pan-cancer and we continue on this front,” explained Dr. Papadopoulos. The researchers believe that CancerSEEK could cost less than $500, similar to current screening cancer tests and that its specificity and sensitivity may be improved by combination with additional tumor biomarkers. “We have initiated prospective studies to test CancerSEEK. This is the way to really evaluate the clinical applicability of the test,” concluded Dr. Papadopoulos when discussing the test’s future prospects.
In 2016 the global liquid biopsy market size was valued at $23.49 million, but as money flows in the sector it is predicted to exceed $1.2 billion by 2023.

In contrast to the detection of a single genetic alteration, NGS aims to record genetic alterations present across diverse cancer subtypes. Moreover, NGS can detect several mutations that could be responsible for driving tumorigenesis and identify resistance mechanisms that may have evolved from pre-existing clones after treatment. As Professor Nicola Normanno, Director of Translational Research Department of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Naples, Italy says “ctDNA detection by liquid biopsy is useful, and with the NGS platform, we would be able to obtain a more in-depth molecular characterization of the tumor.” But in a study of NGS liquid biopsy, he and his team highlighted some of the challenges they need to address. “The central point from our study is that we need to work more on specificity and sensitivity to move NGS liquid biopsy into the clinic. This is due to the low level of ctDNA in blood samples but also due to potential artifacts detected by NGS which are from clonal hematopoiesis rather than from tumor-associated DNA. So, we need to understand more about the biology of ctDNA in order to improve the technology.”
On the other hand, a key advantage of NGS liquid biopsies is the detection of mutations in the blood arising from the entire tumor, overcoming the problem of tumor heterogeneity. It can also be used to monitor treatment response and development of resistance. When asked about other potential uses of NGS liquid biopsy, Professor Normanno discussed the possibility of evaluating tumor mutational burden (TMB), which is being considered as a potential biomarker for response to immunotherapy.
Are we close to a turning point?
The size of the liquid biopsy market shows that we are at an early stage of development. The first commercially available tests will need to prove their effectiveness and convince physicians, clinical centers and international organizations for standardization that they can isolate the signal from the noise and create real value for all the healthcare sector.
The intensive use of machine learning algorithms raises the possibilities for more accurate test results connecting the specific cancer type with the patient’s unique gene identity and offering tailor-made treatment options. Additionally, the fact that it is minimally invasive allows tests to be repeated at the minimum psychological cost on people who bear a huge burden due to their condition."
Nat Geo Series 'The Hot Zone' Highlights Threat From Diseases Of Poverty,www.forbes.com,Tony Bradley,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2019/05/27/nat-geo-series-the-hot-zone-highlights-threat-from-diseases-of-poverty/?ss=healthcare,"Ebola virus. The disease is a household name—synonymous with terrifying pandemics like the Bubonic plague , or swine flu . The Ebola virus had a fatality rate of 90 percent at one point—meaning 9 out of 10 people who became infected with the Ebola virus died as a result. “ The Hot Zone ,” a new series from Nat Geo, is a 6-part drama about the discovery and containment of the deadly virus on US soil. The series is based off of the book of the same name by Richard Preston, which is inspired by the true story of Lt. Col. Nancy Jaax (played by Julianna Margulies ) and others and the dramatic events that took place.
I’ve had the chance to watch the first three episodes and, so far, I recommend watching The Hot Zone. I have seen some early reviews whining about a lack of action—but that is silly. I’m not saying the show has an overwhelming amount of action. I am just pointing out that it is silly to expect or complain about a lack of action in a show about the real-life events of the Ebola virus.
I remember when these events happened, and the hysteria that it caused. There was a lot we didn’t yet know about the Ebola virus at the time, and a very real concern that an outbreak would spread rapidly and have catastrophic consequences for the US population.
Disease of Poverty I had an opportunity to speak with Dr. Michael Smit , science advisor to Nat Geo for this show. I was not aware of the relationship beforehand, but as we talked he informed me that Nancy and Jerry Jaax—two of the people who play a central role in these events—are also his aunt and uncle.
Smit had graduated from West Point and served in the US Army with a specialty in combat arms. When the book The Hot Zone was published, he felt compelled to read it because of the family connection and found his new passion—infectious disease. Now his life is dedicated to emerging infectious disease epidemiology, infection control, and pandemic response.
I asked about some of the characters in the show—and whether they are actual people. He explained that a pair of characters that are central to The Hot Zone—Trevor Rhodes and Wade Carter—are fictional characters that are an amalgamation of actual people, combined for the sake of simplifying the story and allowing the author—and subsequently the director—to provide some background on the Ebola virus.
Smit stressed that one thing you can see from the Nat Geo series is how the Ebola virus is a disease of poverty—in other words, a disease that is more prevalent and more deadly for poor people. The Ebola virus spread rapidly in parts of Africa and had a mortality rate of about 90 percent in large part because of the pervasive poverty in the region. For patients in more affluent nations, or patients who can be safely evacuated to countries with more advanced medical facilities, the survival rate for Ebola is over 90 percent.
Media Hype is Harmful When it comes to things like Ebola virus, media hype can do more harm than good. Media seems to either exaggerate the pandemic danger of the threat, or overestimate success in treatment or progress toward a cure. Smit cautioned against sensationalism in either direction, pointing out that the result is either panic disproportionate to the threat, or apathy in the face of a real and/or growing danger.
Ebola is mostly contained and manageable. However, that doesn’t mean the risk is gone entirely. It is still possible for an Ebola outbreak to occur, and Smit emphasized how crucial it is to be prepared if that happens.
Check Out The Hot Zone The Hot Zone premieres tonight, May 27, at 9pm Eastern. The 6 episodes will be aired as a three-night limited series. It is a compelling story. Mark your calendar or set your DVR."
Trump Ready To Force Transparency In Healthcare Pricing With An Executive Order,www.forbes.com,Joshua Cohen,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2019/05/27/trump-ready-to-force-transparency-in-healthcare-pricing-with-an-executive-order/?ss=healthcare,"The Trump Administration wants to make it easier for patients and employers to comparison shop for healthcare. On transparency, one can't fault the Administration for not trying. So far, the measures implemented have mostly been baby steps. But, this is about to change as President Trump is expected to soon release an executive order on healthcare price transparency . If enacted, this executive order would mandate disclosure of prices throughout the healthcare industry, and be enforceable by federal agencies. It would provide patients and employers pricing data that reflect the negotiated rates between insurers, hospitals, and physicians.
In the lead-up to this week's expected announcement on the executive order, the Trump Administration has been gradually chipping away to uncover the murky world of healthcare pricing. For example, in October 2018, President Trump signed two bills into law, the Know the Lowest Price Act and the Patients' Right to Know Drug Prices Act. These bills removed pharmacy gag clauses , imposed by pharmacy benefit managers, which had prevented pharmacists from proactively telling consumers if their prescription would cost less if they paid for it out-of-pocket rather than using their insurance plan.
And, this month, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements of prescription drugs on television will soon be required to include price information.
Nonetheless, the pharmacy gag clause bills and requirement to include list price information in DTC advertisements only incrementally address prescription drug price transparency. A much bigger step would be to overhaul the prescription drug rebate system, as proposed by HHS. However, it's unclear whether and when that will happen.
Ultimately, drug price transparency alone won't be sufficient to create conditions conducive to a competitive market. It needs to be coupled with dissemination of information on which medications are the most effective for specific conditions or diseases. There have been a number of efforts in the commercial sector to address this issue; MedSavvy , for example, which is a Cambia Health Solutions company. Regence Blue Cross and Blue Shield offers MedSavvy to its customers. The federal government is also supporting initiatives to improve the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's publication of usable information on comparative effectiveness to consumers. But it's been a very slow process with few tangible results thus far.
The Trump Administration has also focused on disseminating information regarding the quality of physician practices that serve Medicare beneficiaries. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) established a website called Physician Compare . However, nearly 80% of physicians aren't included in the website database. Reporting is voluntary, and so there's selection bias when it comes to the performance data that do appear. Moreover, the website doesn't include a comparison of fees for physician services.
Beginning January 1st this year, the federal government is requiring every hospital in the U.S. to post lists of prices of services and technologies online. Such lists are known in the industry as ""chargemasters"" that comprise of prices of thousands of services and products for which a hospital may bill.
But, CMS acknowledges it is not yet enforcing the hospital pricing rule. Furthermore, implementation of the rules has sparked a debate about whether the price lists are creating more confusion than clarity among patients. Services and products are identified in acronyms, abbreviations, billing codes, and medical terminology that most consumers can't be expected to understand.
Additionally, the chargemaster lists don't normally reflect actual transaction charges because hospitals and insurers generally negotiate significantly lower prices. And, hospitals and insurers are resisting public disclosure of negotiated prices. This week's expected announcement of an executive order may make such resistance a moot point.
Most patients don't comparison shop for medical care. Some might not be in a position to do so. Others may simply balk. Perhaps this is due in large part to patients not being used to comparison shopping, or to the opaque character of pricing in the healthcare system. As more useful information becomes available, perhaps patients will begin to do more comparison shopping. which in turn will lead to a more competitive market."
Time To Change Perceptions: Why Care Work Can Boost Countries' Economies,www.forbes.com,Ana Garcia Valdivia,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anagarciavaldivia/2019/05/27/time-to-change-perceptions-why-care-work-can-boost-countries-economies/?ss=healthcare,"For centuries care work have sustained the well-being of individuals and communities. Childcare, healthcare, and domestic work are indispensable and yet, they remain invisible and unrecognized tasks, generally carried out by women with no remuneration in exchange. As the International Labour Organization (ILO) has highlighted in its 2018 report "" Care work and care jobs ,"" the traditional separation between economic and non-economic work assumed over time has not only lead to the “marginalization, undervaluation and privatization of non-market work,” but has also made us forget about the contribution that care work makes to countries’ economies. Currently, there are around 647 million full-time unpaid carers worldwide, of which 606 million are women. It has been decades since women are part of the labor market but these kinds of non-economic activities, associated with motherhood and care, often prevents them from having a job. For example, in the report, the main reason given by women of working age for being outside the labor force was “ unpaid care work, ” while in the case of men it was “being in education, sick or disabled.”
By placing care work out of the productive sphere, the world is missing an opportunity to create employment, improve women access to the labor market, respond to the western demand for healthcare that is approaching with the aging of the population and, ultimately, to boost the global economy. According to ILO estimates, unpaid care work would amount to 9% of global GDP if a monetary value was given to the hours devoted to doing it. So, what can countries do about it?
A few Member States in the EU have already taken action to made formal employment of domestic workers more attractive to households. This is the case of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden, which are using income tax deductions and tax credits along with a strong regulatory framework to increase the levels of formal employment in domestic work.
Spain, on the contrary, remains one of the European countries where women do more hours of unpaid daily care, they dedicate on average 4 hours and 23 minutes a day compared to 2 hours and 6 minutes dedicated by men. At the current rate, the gender gap in caring tasks will last until 2054, having fatal consequences in fighting against gender inequality at work.
According to ILO, one in four Spanish women of working age cannot access the labor market because of their “family responsibilities or domestic chores.” In France only 10% of women do not find a job because of this reason and in Portugal, its other neighboring country, the percentage is 13%. This is a very worrying fact, especially since Spain is the fifth economic power in the EU and may become soon the fourth after Brexit. But is not just a gender issue, if care work was paid in line with the minimum wage, it would represent 14.9% of the Spanish GDP, so, if Spanish women lose out, the whole country does as well.
In recent years, organizations such as the United Nations have been raising awareness about the need to address the care economy as a decent and productive activity worldwide. For that, the presence of young children in households has been identified as a turning point of women’s lives that must be urgently approached in order to avoid the so-called “motherhood employment penalty.” In that sense, the best recipes are embracing policies to provide childcare facilities, including early childhood care, and focus on paternal leave.
On the other hand, long-term care services such as health care and social work will become key in future societies. With rising life expectancy, the aging of the population in the western world is about to become one of the biggest challenges for the next generations. As time goes by, more people will reach an age where they will become dependent on another person, so promoting paid healthcare services will not only become indispensable but also a window to create employment.
Even if for centuries care work has been a key factor of women’s economic disempowerment, it is possible to turn things around by changing the current perception towards a modern vision. For that, care work must be recognized as an economic activity with an extraordinary added value, the general welfare."
"3 Rat Lungworm Cases in Hawaii, What You Need To Know",www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/05/26/3-rat-lungworm-cases-in-hawaii-what-you-need-to-know/?ss=healthcare,"It's not just a rat disease. It's not just a worm disease. It's rat lungworm disease, and according to the Hawaii Department of Health , this is the disease that three separate people got when they visited Hawaii island not too long ago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) only recently confirmed that these were indeed rat lungworm disease cases. Such confirmation was necessary because, after all, it's not every day that someone gets rat lungworm disease. It's also not something to take lightly. You don't typically use it as an excuse to call in sick, ""oh, yes, couldn't make it to work today because of a bout of rat lungworm disease,"" or to back out of a date, ""sorry, you are so great but it's not you. It's just my rat lungworm disease acting up.""
No, rat lungworm disease can only occur after you eat rat lungworm larvae, which fortunately doesn't seem to be a common occurrence. R at lungworm larvae is not something that you would ever want to deliberately eat. It is not like avocado toast. If someone asks you if you would like rat lungworm otherwise known as Angiostrongylus cantonensis with your toast, say no. The same goes for live snails or live slugs.
Here's why. Snails, slugs, and, you guessed it, rats take turns hosting rat lungworms. A rat can acquire the larvae by eating a snail or slug infected with the larvae. The larvae then migrate to the rat's lung (hence the name rat lungworm), where they can lay eggs, specifically in the arteries that supply the rat's lungs with blood. After the eggs hatch, the resulting larvae then migrate up through the rat's lungs and airways up to the rat's throat. The rat then essentially coughs up these larvae and swallows them. Let that image percolate in your head for a bit. The larvae subsequently travel through the rat's gastrointestinal tract and exit the rat through the rat's poop.
So, rat poop, there it is. Ready for snails or slugs to munch on or rub against, because that's what snails and slugs do. The A. cantonensis larvae in the rat poop can enter the snail or slug either through their mouths or by penetrating their skin. After the larvae grow for a while in the snail or slug, a rat may then come along and see lunch. Thus, continues the circle of life for the rat lungworm. The first part of this CDC video shows this circle:
Wondering how humans can get in on this wonderful circle? Well, that can be accomplished by eating an infected raw snail or slug, something that has eaten an infected snail or slug (e.g., shellfish), or something touched by an infected snail or slug. Eating a live slug on a dare is what one of the adult visitors to East Hawaii did in December 2018. This slug apparently had the rat lungworm larvae in it. As a result, the adult grew ill in late December, becoming one of the 10 cases of angiostrongyliasis, the other name for rat lungworm disease, in Hawaii in 2018.
The other two of the three visitors became angiostrongyliasis cases during the first two months of 2019. Neither had eaten slugs on dares but instead ate fruits and vegetables that may have been contaminated by either snails or slugs.
Once the rat lungworm larvae make it into your gastrointestinal tract, various things could happen. You could end up having no symptoms and no real problems. The larvae could end up penetrating your intestinal walls and traveling to your central nervous system and your brain. There, they could potentially cause trouble.
One possibility is a rare type of meningitis (eosinophillic meningitis), which is when the membranes surrounding your brain get inflamed. Possible symptoms include severe nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, and headaches as well as abnormal sensations in your arms and legs. Such symptoms typically take one to three weeks (potentially up to six weeks) to appear and last from two to eight weeks.
Fortunately, your body doesn't tend to make a great home for this parasite, because you aren't a rat, at least in the biologic sense. Therefore, the infection and symptoms frequently resolve without any treatment.
However, this isn't always the case. In rare cases, the infection can result in permanent brain damage, especially if the brain itself gets inflamed, and even death. This is what happened to an Australian teenager, who also ate a slug on a dare, subsequently developed angiostrongyliasis, became paralyzed, and after a long eight-year struggle eventually tragically died, as described by Eli Meixler in Time .
Therefore, even though angiostrongyliasis is not very common, take proper precautions to prevent such an infection. T he Hawaii Department of Health recently tweeted the following warning to wash fruits and vegetables before eating them:
We received notification from @CDCgov that its laboratory confirmed three unrelated cases of angiostrongyliasis, or rat lungworm disease, in visitors to Hawaii Island. Learn more about the cases and how to protect yourself at https://t.co/kOqqhOFyHa pic.twitter.com/0bBfH5TYus

You also want to keep snails or slugs far away from your food and thoroughly cook shellfish or anything that may have eaten snails or slugs. Make sure that you thoroughly cook snails as well, before you eat them. If someone dares you to eat a live or raw slug or snail, don't. Just don't. You aren't Marty McFly from Back to the Future. You can walk away from a dare."
A Proven Way For Getting 50 Paying Customers This Month,www.forbes.com,Abdo Riani,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdoriani/2019/05/27/a-proven-way-for-getting-50-paying-customers-this-month/,"Getty Getty For many entrepreneurs, the thought of acquiring the first or next paying customers is an advertisement click away. Automation drove down many costs over the years including the cost of reaching an ideal customer. Today, many entrepreneurs strive to build a fully automated business where paid ads bring customers while the product is powerful enough to let the users serve themselves. But ads cost money and even if you have the funds, the return on investment may not make sense especially for a bootstrapped founder seeking to validate an idea or acquire the first paying users.
At a high level, you have two options : push your product or service to the customer through paid marketing or let the customer find you through referrals or resources you create such as articles and educational videos they find valuable. The earlier is costly financially while the latter is time consuming especially for an entrepreneur looking to quickly validate or reject a business hypothesis.
In between these two approaches, there is a simple and yet effective strategy for acquiring the first or next 50 or more paying customers relatively quickly. Follow these five steps no matter the product or service you offer. Identify Three Active Communities
Assuming you know your target , list three active communities they belong to. Those communities don’t necessarily have to be online on Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack or other groups. One of the biggest untapped acquisition channels is in-person groups through Meetups, local chamber meetings and other organizations. Engage Regularly
Chances are you are currently part of a community and aware of administrators’ strict promotion rules. Do not break those rules. Instead, help the administrator or group owner accomplish what they created the group for: engagement, branding and acquisition. If you focus on the first, you will indirectly help them accomplish the other two while building a brand and an acquisition channel for yourself.
Invest a minimum of two hours each day commenting on members’ posts, answering questions, sharing valuable content, facilitating discussions, inviting new members, etc. Soon, your contribution will be noticed by members and administrators and then, do this. Offer Help
Don’t ask for feedback, offer to help. For group owners, a post by a new member under the title, “reply to this post if you need help with X,” is a red flag. Asking to help is another way of saying, “I offer X, let me know if you’re interested in buying.” While this may also be true for members who have established their value in the group, it is well earned and administrators will help you reach more people especially if you ask for permission to “ask.” Many responders will seek your help and a few will hire you or use your product after talking to you. Rinse And Repeat
Follow the same process by leading with value and closing with an ask. Get creative in your “ask” and don’t do it too often. For instance, you can offer to review members' strategies, critique their plan, answer their questions, solve them a problem, etc. Anything that will help you strengthen your brand in the group and give you opportunities for one on one conversations with your ideal customers. Just like any marketing funnel , the more of the right people know about you and your products, the more leads with interest you will have. Build Your Own Community
Leveraging established communities to build your own is the quickest way to start yours. Running an in person and/or online community can be of great value for many reasons. First, it brands you as an authority in the room. Second, with only ten people that love what you do, you can easily build a network effect whereby your audience becomes your marketer. This network effect can quickly turn into a snowball effect thanks to their promotion and word of mouth. Third, it’s a great channel to test ideas, gather feedback and launch new products and services in addition to boosting revenue for existing ones.
Above all, remember, to start a successful business, you only need a few customers that truly need and care for what you do. To find those customers, first, you have to show the same level of respect and care. Leverage relevant and established communities to find them and then go above and beyond to help.

FINRA Pilot Test Obscures Bond Price Transparency,www.forbes.com,Marilyn Cohen,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2019/05/27/finra-pilot-test-obscures-bond-price-transparency/,"Who can possibly think nondisclosure of corporate bond trades for two business days is fair or that it’s a good idea? If the regulators insist on a pilot study to test this hair-brained idea, who exactly are the beneficiaries? I’ll tell you who—the big players; the brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds and to a lesser degree mutual funds. Clearly the biggest and most profitable players that go from the present reporting trades within 15 minutes to two days will be happy…cha-ching. For those of us who manage bonds but don’t trade in gigantic size, hiding large block trades leaves us with no market “context.” Oh, sure we’ll see the 10's, 20's, and sub-500 retail trades. But the large blocks are often the GPS system that enables us to compare and contrast pricing to ensure we’re getting the best execution for our clients. That’s our fiduciary responsibility. Plus, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires money managers to prove—with a documented audit trail—that we fiduciaries got the best prices for our clients. Trading $1 million bonds today may look like incompetence in two days when the $10 million block trades post.
This is a bad idea at every turn. So, the most profitable and largest dealers and bond managers that already make the most money may be able to increase their revenues even more. We might as well turn back the clock 60 years to a time when they posted trades on a blackboard using chalk. The wiggle room for dishonesty and “painting the tape” could be massive under this scheme. Isn’t that exactly why Main Street loathes Wall Street?
If this pilot program is initiated and becomes protocol, then FINRA needs to delete the word, transparency, appearing numerous times on its website when referring to bond prices and trading.

How To Get Rid Of Ants Without Poisons,www.forbes.com,Jeff McMahon,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2011/05/30/how-to-battle-ants-without-poisons/,"With the unofficial start of summer, the never-ending war resumes—as millions of armored and armed invaders break into our homes and endure devastating chemical counterattacks. “Endure” is just the right verb, scientists say, for the long-term response of ants to our frequently misapplied chemical efforts to kill and control them.
Pesticides have even given advantages to invasive ants that live in supercolonies—like the single colony of Argentine ants that covers most of California—by wiping out native competitors and by wiping out predatory species, like nematodes, that might have helped to keep them in check.
When a pesticide wears off, ants from the supercolony re-colonize the freshly cleared territory.
Ants remain the most successful creatures on earth. Scientists have estimated their number at ten thousand trillion—or, by another estimate—17.2 million ants per person.
And unlike persons, ants have been found to be resistant to both radiation and industrial pollution . Ants were here 80 million years before humans arrived and, dare I say, are likely to outlive us.
So how can we best avoid them during our stay on their planet?
A few years ago I wrote a story for The Weather Channel about the “ crazy rasberry ants ” then invading Texas (they now live comfortably in 11 coastal counties). In the course of that story and many others I’ve written about ants over the years, I’ve had an opportunity to ask myrmecologists how we might best keep ants out of our homes. This is what they always say:
1. “Try to identify what they're going after,” said David Holway of the University of California San Diego. “Is it food, is it some kind of nest site? If you can eliminate that, then that will largely eliminate their incentive for coming into your house.”
Chances are, the ants have come looking for one or more of three things:
“Like all pests, ants need food, water, and shelter to survive,” according to the National Park Service , which has found ants to be smarter than the average bear.
“By limiting these three essentials, you make it more difficult for ants to live in the infested area. Simply by improving sanitation you can often suppress existing populations and discourage new invasions.""
2. Cleanliness is next to antlessness: When myrmecologists — ant scientists — say ants will not be attracted to a meticulous house, they mean meticulous to ant standards. Those little nooks and crannies where crumbs elude us may offer a feast to ants.
“Frequent vacuuming, sweeping, or mopping of floors and washing of counter and table tops eliminates much of the food ants may be foraging on. Trash should be stored away from infested areas and monitored for spills.""
Enlist the aid of an anteater? Image via Wikipedia
3. Mind the gap : If cleaning isn’t your thing, sealing may do the trick, and there’s almost nothing better than petroleum jelly. Seal any cracks or crevices that ants can use to enter your house. In my experience, petroleum jelly will hold ants at bay for a year. You can use silicone caulk for a permanent barrier.
“Effective door sweeps that close the gap between the bottom of exterior doors and the door sill are essential,” said Thomas Green, president of the Integrated Pest Management Institute of North America.
4. Last call! If you live in a dry climate, ants have likely come looking for water. Scientists at UC San Diego were able to drastically reduce ant populations on irrigated land by shutting off the irrigation.
“In California, what I always tell people is stop watering your lawn,"" Holway said. ""Use less water and you’ll have less ants. People unfortunately don’t like to hear that, but it’s true.”
Remember that some water sources for ants can escape human notice. According to National Parks, “Ants can get their water from many sources inside a structure: condensation on pipes and air conditioners, leaky plumbing, aquariums, pet dishes, houseplant containers, floor drains, etc.""
5. Before you resort to poisons, try natural insecticides and repellants : The University of Florida maintains a list of botanical insecticides that have some environmental advantages, such as rapid breakdown. They include citrus oils, neem oil, diatomaceous earth and sulfur.
Some types of ants are also said to avoid Borax, basil, bay leaves, catnip, cayenne, cinnamon, coffee, camphor, peppermint, vinegar. Be advised not all may deter your invaders.
“Often that’s very species specific, so what works for one ant might not work for another,” Green said.
It’s worth trying natural deterrents before chemical not only because ants seem to thrive in the aftermath of poorly applied chemicals, but also because humans and other animals don’t.
Beyond Pesticides maintains a database of studies that link pesticides to human illnesses including cancer, asthma, autism and learning disabilities, birth defects and reproductive dysfunction, diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.
If you must use a chemical, look it up first in the Pesticide Action Network (PAN) Pesticide Database . In many cases, you may find that its effects are unknown."

The Bruins are riding a hot streak into this matchup, having won seven in a row—including a sweep of the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final—to reach the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 2013. The Blues haven’t had as easy of a journey up to this point, going down 2-1 against the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Final—losing Game 3 on a highly controversial overtime goal—before racking up three consecutive wins and clinching the franchise’s first berth in the Stanley Cup Finals in 49 years. St. Louis was swept by Boston in that championship series nearly five decades ago, the third time in a row that the organization would lose the Stanley Cup Finals 4-0 during its first three years of existence. The Blues are still looking for their first “W” in a series with Lord Stanley’s Cup on the line, but oddsmakers don’t believe they’ll get it in on Monday evening. The books have installed the visiting team as a +135 underdog, while the Bruins are currently -150 chalk. The public likes Boston at this number, as 66% of all bets and 51% of total dollars wagered on the contest are on the home side. The Bruins are also drawing most of the action against the -1.5 goal spread, with 66% of tickets and 82% of cash on their side. The over/under for Game 1 has been set at 5 goals, with the over side slightly favored at -130 odds. The betting public is split 50/50 on that line in terms of betting percentage, but there more big wagers (71% of all cash) on the under side.
Will the Bruins come through for their supporters and go up 1-0 in this thrilling championship series, or will the Bruins find a way to pull off the upset for their first ever Stanley Cup Finals victory? Pro handicapper Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has a take on Game 1 that you will not want to miss.

Boston Bruins vs. St. Louis Blues Game 1 Quote: s
Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy was asked what Boston’s biggest advantage over the Blues is in this series (via ASAP Sports ):
Boy, that's going to be board material. Experience. I'll go the easy route. I just believe that our guys that have been there, that have won a cup, have lost a cup, that should give us an edge. Some people disagree with that once you're here, but I believe it will give us an edge. I think it's helped us a lot this week in the preparation, with all the down time. And hopefully going forward that is an advantage for us.
Blues head coach Craig Berube gave a quick scouting report on the challenges of facing Boston’s defense and believes the two teams are similar in that regard (via ASAP Sports ):
Well, the similarities I see is like they play -- they're a good defensive hockey team like we are. I think all year long they have been a very good defensive team. They got obviously that top line's a very good line, it can score goals. And I think both teams want to really get on the forecheck, be a physical team, be a hard team to play against. That's what I notice in the playoffs watching them. They're extremely hard to play against, they battle, they play hard. Again, their centermen, they play 200-foot games, like ours do. Defensemen-wise, we're obviously bigger back there, but they got the big guy, [Bruins defenseman Zdeno] Chara, he's the biggest one of them all. But they got some pretty good mobile D back there that move the puck well. So I see a lot of similarities in the team game more than anything. I think the way, their style of play and our style of play, there's some similarities there.
Boston star Brad Marchand spoke about what it means to be a leader for the Bruins (via BostonHerald.com ):
Our team has always instilled in the younger players, to play a certain way, to mature a certain way on and off the ice. The leadership group I had to follow is very easy to walk in their footsteps and try to be like them. You try and set that same example for the guys coming up. We have a culture in here that we want to grow and continue to instill in the young guys. And they’ve bought in. They’re all dialed in right now. They’re excited and they have been all year. It’s exciting when you don’t have to pull guys along, that they follow and the want to be part of the success and they want to grow as a group. We have that on our team this year and it’s been incredible to watch.
St. Louis center Ryan O’Reilly is excited to have a chance at lifting the Stanley Cup after battling back from the having the NHL’s worst record back in January (via STLToday.com ):
I think it shows the parity of the league, how we were able to stay in it. We weren’t playing consistent hockey. We’d have a good game, think we figured it out, and couldn’t come back the next one and we were able to stay somewhat in the hunt and we kept working at it and eventually we win 11 in a row and that was amazing to see. You look at the board, you think, We’re one of the better teams in the league now. We’re going to have a chance at this. It’s amazing how a season, the ups and downs of it, there are so many highs and lows, and to be able to stay even keeled and keep working at it. It’s crazy to see how it pays off.

3 Stocks Up More Than 50 Percent That Still Look Good,www.forbes.com,John Dorfman,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2019/05/27/3-stocks-up-more-than-50-percent-that-still-look-good/,"When a stock jumps 50% or 100% in a year, you know something is afoot. Maybe the company is firing on all cylinders. Maybe the stock was radically mispriced a year ago. Perhaps both. Once a year, around this time, I select a few stocks that have exploded upward, and that I believe still have something in the tank.
In the past, I usually looked for stocks that had doubled in a year. But this year there are few of those--and very few that I like. So, I opened the field to stocks up 50% or more in the past 12 months.
Here are three that I think deserve a look.
Many companies' healthcare experience the possibility of “Medicare for All” as a threat, but for Molina Health Care (MOH) of Long Beach, California, it’s arguably a plus.
Molina runs managed-care programs in 14 states, catering to people enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. Over the past ten years, its growth rates for revenue and operating income have been in the mid-teens.
Since Molina already is used to have the government as its source of funds, the possibility of something resembling national health insurance isn’t a big threat to its margins. It might even be a competitive advantage.
Its shares are up about 57% in the past year, and currently sell for 11 times earnings and 0.5 times revenue.
For better or worse, I think national health insurance is a long shot in the next couple of years, even if Democrats consolidate their power in Congress. However, due in part to cost-cutting, Molina is showing its best profits in a long time, even without Medicare for All.
PCM (PCMI) sells computer products and services to businesses, especially retailers, healthcare companies, and financial companies. It’s a low-margin business, with profit margins hovering a little above 1% after tax.
What’s hot here is the growth. Operating income more than doubled in the past 12 months. The stock price zoomed from $12.20 at the beginning of May 2018 to about $26 now.
The stock sells for about 10 times this year’s estimated earnings, and less than 0.2 times revenue, so I suspect there is room for more gains.
Great Lakes Dredge & Dock (GLDD) has moved up from a little over $5 a share to a little above $10 in the past year. The company, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, deepens ports, channels and rivers, and digs trenches for pipelines and cables.
The stock is speculative. Its debt is rated in the junk range by Moody’s, although it was recently upgraded. Debt is 135% of stockholders’ equity, which is higher than I’d like.
But there are good things here too. If the two major political parties stop feuding long enough to pass an infrastructure bill, Great Lakes might benefit. Analysts expect earnings to jump this year. And the stock sells for just under 1.00 times revenue.
I disagree with momentum investing--the concept that a rising stock price, per se, is a good reason to buy a stock.
If a stock has a big gain, the company has probably established a competitive advantage. That advantage may be durable or merely transitory. That’s what makes securities analysis hard--and fascinating.
My view is that a big gain isn’t a reason to jump onboard, but it’s not a disqualifier either.
Past Results
This is the 12 th column I’ve written on stocks that have risen sharply and appear to have potential for continuing gains. Six of the previous 11 columns have beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
However, after two terrible years in a row, my average one-year return has fallen below that of the benchmark. It’s 8.7% against 11.5% for the S&P 500.
Bear in mind that my column recommendations are theoretical and don’t reflect actual trades, trading costs or taxes. Their results shouldn’t be confused with the performance of portfolios I manage for clients. And past performance doesn’t predict future results.
Last year’s results were hideous, with losses exceeding 40% in Micron Technologies (MU), HollyFrontier (HFC) and Daqo New Energy (DQ). Collectively, my May 2018 picks dropped 40.5%, while the S&P 500 advanced 7.2%.
Will I try again? If you know me at all, you know the answer is yes. We’ll see if this year’s picks put me back on the right side of the ledger.
Disclosure: I own Daqo New Energy Corp. personally and for a few clients."

Paul Talbot: What should the essential ingredients of an organization’s email marketing strategy be?
Brett Pinegar: The most essential ingredients are having a well thought out email list building strategy and a diligent list hygiene process. Everything else, whether it’s segmentation, messaging, or send-times, depends on the quality of the data in your program.
Talbot: How often should this strategy be reviewed, and what factors should be considered?
Pinegar: When it comes to list hygiene, start by looking at your most engaged users. Who opens the most? How often do they open?
Then use that as a benchmark to determine how long you should give to determine whether an email address in your system is worth having.
Whether it’s every month or every six months, it’s important to constantly be pruning your list to maintain higher open rates, engagement and deliverability. We’ve seen across our platform that publishers with a more diligent list hygiene process also see much higher CPMs.
When it comes to actual list building, look at where your best emails are coming from and invest more in those channels.
Talbot: When an organization attempts to monetize email by inserting an ad unit, how does this create value for the recipient?
Pinegar: For the recipient, it’s all about relevancy. People only tend to get annoyed by advertising when it doesn’t seem relevant to them. But if you can connect them with a brand that really speaks to them, that has a product or service that they care about, it’s actually a pleasant experience.
Talbot: How should the short-term gain of an ad unit be weighed against long-term considerations such as the relationship with the subscriber?
Pinegar: There is no trade-off. We hold the relationship that exists between a publisher and their subscribers as paramount, which is why we give them the controls they need to ensure that they can balance a reader’s experience with the revenue opportunities presented.
Talbot: Even with best efforts to provide relevance, why would an ad unit not be perceived by the subscriber as clutter, and risk diluting the core message of the email?
Pinegar : Due to the nature of the inbox, many of the loud and obnoxious ad units you might find on websites aren’t actually possible in email, because they rely on Javascript.
Talbot: Does the inclusion of an ad unit impact deliverability?
Pinegar: No. Not at all.
Talbot: What performance data do we have on email ad units? Is performance better for publishers than for retailers?
Pinegar: We tend to see much higher click-through rates on advertisements served across our platform than what you see with traditional web display, anywhere from 2-3X.
Performance doesn’t vary much based upon whether it’s a retailer or a publisher. It depends more on the placement of the unit in the email template.
Talbot: Are there data that shed light on the percentage of emails that include a targeted ad unit?
Pinegar: It’s impossible to know what the total percentage is, but I can tell you there are over 2,500 brands and publishers that leverage our platform, which totals 8,947 newsletters that contain ad units, serving roughly +6 Billion impressions per month.

"FACEIT To Host $50,000 'Apex Legends' Esports Tournament",www.forbes.com,Mike Stubbs,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2019/05/27/faceit-to-host-50000-apex-legends-esports-tournament/,"The Apex Legends esports scene is finally finding its feet. Credit: FACEIT FACEIT has announced the first ever officially licensed Apex Legends esports tournament, which will have a massive $50,000 total prize pool and feature some of the biggest organisations in the world.
The FACEIT Pro Series: Apex Legends competition will be a series of $5,000 tournaments that will run over eight weeks. The remaining $10,000 of the prize pool will go to the highest scoring team across the entire event.
The first event in the FACEIT Pro Series: Apex Legends kicks off at 2pm PST/5pm EST on May 31. After a brief break to allow for the ECS Season 7 CS:GO finals, the Apex Legends action will return on June 14, and continue on weekly until the final week on July 26. Each week’s tournament will last for four hours, with players having to secure more points in their matches than the other teams competing.
FACEIT will of course be broadcasting the event, with CS:GO casters James Bardolph and Daniel ‘DDK’ Kapadia talking you through the action, along with other broadcast talent that is yet to be confirmed. All the players competing will also be streaming on their own personal Twitch accounts, so if your favorite player is taking part you will be able to watch their perspective at all times.
Every week one of the teams in the competition will be playing live from the FACEIT studios in Los Angeles, with the others competing on the FACEIT online platform. The teams that have been invited to the competition are Cloud9, 100 Thieves, TSM, Team Liquid, CLG, Gen.G, Misfits, Immortals, NRG, Complexity, Dignitas, Fnatic, G2 and T1.
“This is the first event where these titans of the esports industry can really show what their Apex Legends rosters are made of and we’re thrilled to play a part in establishing the competitive ecosystem for one of the most exciting titles in the world right now,” said Michele Attisani, Co-Founder & CBO of FACEIT. “We’ve created a dynamic setup which will split the broadcast between the teams streaming online and the team and broadcast talent in our studio in Santa Monica for a seamless viewer experience for fans.”
While this is the first official Apex Legends competitive series it isn’t the first time that tournament organiser FACEIT has been involved with the game. Previously it organised the T1 x FACEIT Apex Legends Invitational, which saw top streamers and players compete in what was one of the first Apex Legends competitive events ever.

"Amazon Developing Wearable Gadget That Reads Emotions, Report Says",www.forbes.com,David Phelan,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2019/05/27/amazon-developing-wearable-that-reads-emotions-report-says/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Consumer Tech I write about lifestyle tech Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Talking to machines is now second nature, providing we remember to say “Alexa” or “Hey, Siri” before framing our questions. We can already talk to an Apple Watch, even without saying the magic wake word, if we raise the timepiece to our mouths first. There will be more updates revealed in the upcoming watchOS 6 operating software , which will be revealed on June 3 at WWDC .

Now, Bloomberg is reporting on the possibility of a new device from Amazon which will understand human emotions.
According to the patents and internal documents, the device will be wrist-wearable and voice-activated. The Alexa team is involved, apparently, as are people behind the Fire phone and Echo speakers.
But while other devices listen to the words spoken and react accordingly, telling you the time or the latest soccer score or whatever, this will respond to what it can read from your voice.
Not text comprehension, then, but subtext.
Well, that could be remarkable. I mean, speaking as someone who has deployed sarcasm repeatedly in my life and been misunderstood regularly, I’m amazed at the prospect that my watch could understand this when human beings haven’t. Perhaps the gadget could even tap me on the wrist and quietly say, “Not now, it’s not funny”. The Amazon Echo Plus, listening carefully for its wake word. Could Alexa listen out for our feelings, too? Amazon
Amazon’s intentions seem to sit somewhere between benign and creepy. Bloomberg says:
A U.S. patent filed in 2017 describes a system in which voice software uses analysis of vocal patterns to determine how a user is feeling, discerning among “joy, anger, sorrow, sadness, fear, disgust, boredom, stress, or other emotional states.” The patent, made public last year, suggests Amazon could use knowledge of a user’s emotions to recommend products or otherwise tailor responses.
A diagram in the patent filing says the technology can detect an abnormal emotional condition and shows a sniffling woman telling Alexa she’s hungry. The digital assistant, picking up that she has a cold, asks the woman if she would like a recipe for chicken soup.
Well, that seems a clever way to go, to be able to anticipate a user’s needs – something every good human personal assistant does as he or she gets to know the habits of their employer. But it could just as easily be unsettling at the same time as impressive.
The fact that the team that delivered the Amazon Fire phone is an indication that the company is eager to break into new kinds of device. We’ve already heard rumors of smart in-ear headphones with Alexa built in .
The possibility of a machine understanding human emotions is certainly intriguing. After all, many humans miss the subtleties of interaction, so perhaps the gadget can tip us off. The Amazon Echo Dot in charcoal finish. The current repository of Alexa and her listening skills. Amazon
Maybe Amazon’s gadget – if it ever reaches fruition, which is never certain at this stage of rumored plans – could help us when we’re not sure exactly how we’re feeling. Or put us right when we’re fooling ourselves: “What do you mean you feel fine? You’re deep-down miserable, I’d say.” It seems the device will be able to help advise us on how to interact better with others.
On the other hand, there will be many Echo and HomePod users, for instance, who feel that given the number of times their smart speakers think they’ve heard a wake word when they haven’t and leapt in with an unwanted comment, that smart listening has some way to go yet. "
