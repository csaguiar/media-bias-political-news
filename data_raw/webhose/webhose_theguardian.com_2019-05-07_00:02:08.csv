One thing all Liberal and National Politicians are absolutely loathe to do is spend their own money on anything. besides, I seem to recall prior to the Victorian State election all the talk about how the Victorian, N.S.W. and the Federal Liberal Parties were broke and in reality didn't have money to buy raffle tickets. so spending your (and my) money is so much easier for them than spending their own.
that's how the LNP generated an alleged $B7.4 Surplus (verifiable in 18 months time) by not spending money, on schools or hospitals or roads or the aged or anything that actually builds a nation. they will however, give your money, no strings attached to their mates, or masters, depending on how you look at it."

It does not take long to ruin a country.
One business cycle can do it.
And the Coalition has succeeded in doing just that.
No matter where one looks today, no matter the sector, the regulator, the governance or policy, the conclusion is the same.
Australia has quietly slipped from a liberal democracy run for the people to a ravening kleptocracy run for the white collar criminal.
The most obvious examples speak for themselves:
the energy sector is run by a government shielded gas cartel that is stealing many multiple billions every year from households and business;
the financial sector has lurched from appalling behaviour to castigation by royal commission to two months later being emboldened to attack regulators with impunity;
the mining sector long ago bedded down its rentier profits after rolling a prime minister and composing its own tax code;
small business is engaged in a gigantic wage theft enterprise run entirely around the margins of the mass immigration program;
the franchise sector is engaged in a gigantic wage theft enterprise run entirely around the margins of the mass immigration program;
the gig economy is engaged in a gigantic wage theft enterprise run entirely around the margins of the mass immigration program;
the tertiary sector is owned by international students that have destroyed pedagogical standards;
every sector has a lobby with media teeth that can bite pollies instantly;
housing markets have been horribly distorted by illegal foreign capital laundered with the blessing of governments;
regulators in every segment of the economy are overrun, underfunded, corrupt and captured;
a property obsessed reserve bank has destroyed its own mandate and has not gotten a single decision right since 2011;
governments themselves has completely lost due process, spewing pork and crazed ideas like village idiots;
the media is a realty-addicted parasite pre-occupied with culture wars and “businomics” that simply hides all of the above instead of holding it to account."

Newstart is not enough money to live on when it is the sum total of your income. It is meant as a supplementary income as you seek employment and are supported by your family.
If you are older (aging), single and have mobility issues, health and support needs, it is patently inadequate. It is ludicrous to think that we who rely on Newstart must swallow the system perception that it is enough for those of us unable to work.
It is time to acknowledge that there is a group of us who should be on the equivalent of the DSP until we are old enough to go onto the aged pension.

No matter how they choose to disguise it or manipulate the figures over a day, a year or decades to try to portray otherwise. Before an election they are a battler's friend. After an election they move to penalise those who they deem 'leaners'.
They stick to a philosophy that taxation is primarily bad for it reduces personal wealth, that services to community should only be minimally supported because the rich don't need them, that 'user pays' is always preferable to any burden or social responsibility to public services and that anyone who suggests the opposite to that philosophy is engaging in 'class warfare'.
So be it. It's time for them to be disarmed from that attack. A lot of us support increased taxation for social and essential services. We do not approve of individuals creating wealth from the disadvantage of others or the sense of entitlement that many of the Liberal supporters might have. If the right of politics can take aim at who they determine to be living in the age of entitlement, then it's fair to turn that around to argue that the entitled are actually those who benefit most from LNP philosophy.
How can it be so difficult to argue for an effort to claw back a lot of the inequality that has emerged and has continued to widen in recent years? The vast majority of voters are not in the top 10% of those who have benefited. How can arguing for better services and infrastructure by increasing taxation on those who are most able to provide it, be so derogatory? How do we allow the Liberals to win the argument about 'class warfare' when it is they that in reality enact it?"

“Flattening income tax reduces the tax take from high-income earners, which ultimately means either fewer government services or high taxes on middle and low-income earners if the government wants to maintain a surplus.

I share that frustration, though I think they should shoulder part of the blame, as the Labour leadership three-line whipped Labour MPs to support the triggering of the Article 50 bill unamended, despite knowing that it would start a timer, at the end of which the UK would be forced to leave the EU, with or without a deal, with the Tory party being in government, and not being politically able to countenance any outcome that envisaged a closer relationship with the EU without breaking apart.
But now, with so little time left, what is the point of objecting to May's deal? There's not much in that deal that wouldn't be forced on a Labour government (e.g. settling accounts, preventing a hard border in Ireland and protecting the rights of EU citizens in the UK). The political declaration is far from ideal, but the fact remains that Labour didn't win the last election, and won't be able to force another election before 2022, let alone before the Brexit deadline.
Her deal's rejection won't change anything for the internal disagreements in the Tory party, and they don't seem to want another general election, as their political minds seem to be more focused on the next Tory leadership race, while May seems only focused on trying to hold her party together. Have Labour now embraced the (previously dead) mantra of ""no deal is better than a bad deal""? The numbers in Parliament clearly seem to be stacked against a second referendum or a Labour deal, so I don't see how voting down May's deal can deliver anything other than a no-deal scenario, with all the chaos it will involve."

I've had psychotherapy myself and I'm fairly certain that it achieved what it was supposed to achieve without involving any transference (I suppose I couldn't comment on whether the therapist was experiencing counter-transference, but if he was I certainly failed to pick up on it). I think I'd consider it indicative of a lack of self-awareness if I were to 'project feelings, unconscious messages, on to a therapist'. I went to a psychotherapist to discuss the difficulties I was experiencing in my life and the likely causes of those difficulties, not to 'mirror a pattern of relating from key relationships'.
I can't help wondering whether the emphasis on transference and counter-transference has something to do with the origins of psychotherapy in the German-speaking world. There is surely something rather un-English about allowing oneself to unselfconsciously project one's feelings in a professional relationship (or, indeed, in any kind of relationship). That is not to suggest that there is anything inherently wrong about allowing oneself to become free of self-awareness and emotional inhibition, but it would perhaps go some way towards explaining why different cultures have different ways of interpreting the human mind. It is surely rather difficult to reconcile the principle that 'I am the master of my fate:|I am the captain of my soul' with allowing oneself to 'project feelings, unconscious messages'."

James Corden as Mr Darcy is more likely than a fat British politician taking high office | Catherine Bennett | Opinion | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Catherine Bennett,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/07/james-corden-as-mr-darcy-more-likely-than-fat-british-politician-taking-high-office,"Boris Johnson is only one of many striving to to shed the pounds to reach the very top. J ames Corden, the celebrity wit and actor, complains, with justice, of discrimination against “chubby” artists like himself .
They are never cast, straightforwardly, in romantic roles. A visiting alien could, he says, easily get the impression – supposing it relied on films for information – that “if you are chubby or fat or big, you never really fall in love, you never have sex”. He’s right. You’d need a heart of stone not to mourn the loss, assuming that more conventionally handsome actors can’t be made to step aside, of, say, James Corden’s Vronsky, James Corden’s Heathcliff and/or Mr Darcy, James Corden reminding us, in a remake of Brokeback Mountain , just how long audiences have had to tolerate the unconscionable tyranny, on screen, of the beautiful and muscular.
But as painful as it must be for Corden, as his romantic potential is dissipated in Carpool Karaoke , many older, homelier, shorter, scrawnier, speccier, greyer male actors (unless they are Woody Allen), as well as most female actors over the age of 35 and countless actors of colour, will have experienced something similar. Film studios can be culpably prejudiced and conventional.
Is there, the alien might ask, any evidence to suggest that a medically approved BM is indicative of superior probity?
Given, however, that audiences might not – equally culpably – have warmed to a sexual James Corden as they did, for instance, to Armie Hammer in Call Me by Your Name , or more recently to Andrew Scott creating havoc in Fleabag , fantasy specialists can possibly make a better case for their fattism than can those responsible for the swaths of public life, featuring no scenes of a sexual nature, where full chubby participation is likewise discouraged.
Corden’s visiting alien, were it foolish enough to risk a UK detour, might reasonably conclude, having compared our parliament’s obese component with that (26%) of the general population, that some sort of regulation restricts the number of overweight ministers. Is there, the alien might ask, any evidence to suggest that a medically approved body mass index is indicative of superior probity? On the contrary: Boris Johnson’s recent “spaffing” comments, though emanating from a more pristine (he assures us) physique, are, if possible, more degenerate than anything uttered before he took up porridge and water , under the alleged supervision of a recently acquired 30-year-old.
Exposed to national television, Corden’s busy alien will further discover that “chubby, fat or big” performers are similarly airbrushed from current affairs (unless they are male and over 70) – and even from programmes exclusively about cake – though they may still find a welcome in comedy or as the special “character” component in reality TV competitions.
But even these performers will find themselves better loved if, by getting thinner, they effectively confirm that an observable official aversion to weight is benevolent and not, as has been alleged, a contributor to the bullying and stigmatising of bigger people. It is routine for slimmed-down celebrities – the recently redeemed including Greg Wallace , Huw Edwards , Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay – happily to fat shame their weaker selves, from before they discovered self-denial or a personal trainer.
 Michael Gove on his morning run, 28 March 2019. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters
Nothing in the long career of Labour’s deputy prime minister, Tom Watson, generated the interest that followed his break-up with Hobnobs. “Every day I wake up happier and more relaxed, clearer-thinking,” he told the Guardian , after losing seven stone. Christ. Could bleariness explain why his former self believed the absurd allegations of sexual abuse invented by “Nick” and levelled against politicians? And how soon can we get rid of the remaining fuddle-headed, tense, unhappily overweight MPs who can’t, or won’t, follow suit? “I hate,” Watson adds, “going to bed at night not having done 10,000 steps.” It’s probably one way of not thinking about Brexit.
At this fractured time, ambitious male politicians can unite around, if nothing else, the delusion that a low resting pulse rate compensates for comprehensive unfitness for high office. Whatever our other faults, chorus Michael Gove, Johnson, Watson, Dominic Raab , Jeremy Corbyn et al, no one could accuse us of chubbiness.
Gove, with no expert to remind him what they said about Nicolas Sarkozy , thinks his schemes can survive the repeated trauma, for spectators, of his shorts. Corbyn’s staff believe that reports of regular runs will, like photographs of 72-year-old Mao in the Yangtze, inspire confidence, as opposed to further doubts about their 69-year-old leader’s priorities. It’s not as if we expect Corbyn to start reading books, not after all this time, but will no one think of his compost? His jam? Or are the exercise hours carved out of his occasional parliamentary commitments?
Could the plus-size Johnson even see what was written on the bus?
Meanwhile, Johnson advertises the coincidence that his midlife crisis diet should synchronise, so perfectly, with the needs of a similarly afflicted nation as it too plunges, ludicrously, into the unknown. “We know,” he writes, “that we have to get ready – to be lighter on our feet and more agile…”
Step forward Johnson, who, having dumped his former role model, the prodigious drinker and eater Winston Churchill, and mislaid an aversion to Jamie Oliver, now seems more closely aligned, philosophically, with fellow Brexiter and teetotal biscuitphobe Jeremy Corbyn. Notwithstanding his age, the Labour runner must surely, what with being so skinny and thin, have the agile edge so critical to leadership, providing he isn’t lost, beforehand, down a plughole.
“Is it working?” the dieting Johnson swanks, to no one in particular. “You bet it is. My sight is keener, the days seem longer and more full of interest and I have lost 12 pounds in two weeks.”
So he should probably revisit all decisions taken in the preceding decade or so, as much as he noticed it through his fat-dimmed eyes. Could the plus-size Johnson even see what was written on the bus? Could the garden bridge be attributed to a convocation of jaded fat cells?
However thoughtlessly it treats chubbier operatives, Hollywood has yet, unlike Westminster’s diet and exercise bores, to suggest that they are actually unfit for work.

It’s been a while since I picked up a hitchhiker. Like tapioca and lemon-favoured cola, they don’t seem to exist any more. But Chico was standing by the barrier at Luton airport, thumb extended. A photographer from Lisbon, he was hoping for a lift down the M1 into central London. He reckoned he’d been on British soil for less than two hours, but had already managed to get his luggage stolen. “I put my bag down to make a call,” he said, after gratefully clambering in, “and then booofff … gone!” All he had on him was his phone. He told me the name of his hotel and I decided to drive him there, to the actual door, as a sort of one-man, pro-EU, anti-Brexit statement.
It may have been a long time since I stopped for a hiker, but it’s been even longer since Chico spent any time in a modern, technologically savvy car. He exploded with delight at everyday features that many take for granted. Rear-view camera: “No waaaay !” Heated seats: “ Ha y !” Voice-activated satnav: “You are shitting me!” He seemed to speak in italics a lot of the time…
The vehicle that evoked such astonishment is more often castigated for being short on thrills. Honda’s CR-V is so unpretentious and so unassuming that it takes self-effacement to unchartered heights. And yet, here is the thing: the CR-V is quietly, sensibly, likably heroic.
For people who want a vehicle that will, without complaint, efficiently and effectively get on with the job of being a car, the CR-V is a no-brainer. As a result it is the world’s bestselling SUV – more than 9m have been sold in 150 countries. When it launched in Sayama in Japan in 1995, it pioneered a whole new type of car: the good-mannered, family-friendly, urban SUV was born. Back then we were told CR-V stood for “Comfortable Runabout Vehicle”. Over the years that has morphed into “Compact Recreational Vehicle” – both are true, but the first is closer to its nature, and sounds cuter, too.
This latest redesign, the fifth generation, brings significant changes, the biggest being that there is no diesel engine on offer. Instead, it’s based around Honda’s proven 1.5-litre VTEC turbopetrol unit. It’s smaller than previous engines, but it offers a winning blend of power and efficiency. For those wanting to further polish their green halos, a petrol-electric hybrid version has also just gone on sale.
For the first time, the CR-V is being offered as a seven-seater. This will make it even more in demand as a family load-lugger, but why’s it taken them so long to get round to it? It comes with either a six-speed manual gearbox or an all-new CVT shiftless auto gear system. Inside, you’ll find it’s comfortable, refined, spacious and unceasingly competent – though the infotainment system still feels dated. To drive, it’s smooth and biddable around town and it’s compliant and dutiful on the long haul.
In Japan, hard work and humility are both bedrocks of its culture. They’re qualities to admire both in its people and its cars – and Chico certainly did.

Over the past years, we’ve become more used to the idea of enthusiastic riders splashing out on seriously expensive, handcrafted bikes. They cancel the golf-club membership, sell the sports car and now the object of their desire is a stunningly lightweight racing machine. It’s a beautiful thing to be handled with cotton gloves and treated with respect. But imagine taking that glinting bike and hammering down a rocky mountain slope or through a boggy field. Is that any way to treat a work of art? No, but that is exactly what the designers behind the bespoke Mosaic MTB expect you to do. Built from titanium to your exact specifications – and in the colour of your choice – the MT-1 has just been named the best mountain bike at the North American Handmade Bicycle Show. The winning hardtail showcases Mosaic’s clean lines, exquisite welds and flawless paint and, of course, the custom-made JPaks bolt-on frame bags. It’s designed to smash down narrow tracks or for a week-long bike-packing adventure. The one thing you must never do to it is hang it on the wall, stand back and admire it.
