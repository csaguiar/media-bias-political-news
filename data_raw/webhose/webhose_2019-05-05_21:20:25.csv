"Ahead of Academy of Country Music Awards, Study Examines Gender, Age Gap Between Male and Female Artists",www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/country-music-1387987,"On 4/5/19 at 10:20 PM EDT Share Culture
The creative contributions of women often go underappreciated within the country music establishment, according to a new study from the University of Southern California. The analysis, released Friday , provides data to support what artists and industry onlookers have long decried as a pervasive gender and age gap in the Nashville music scene.
Working with the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, researchers examined the disparity by combing through five years of the YearEnd Billboard Hot Country charts. From that sample, they then tracked the number of women who received songwriting credits and subsequent award nominations at the Academy of Country Music Awards .
Led by Stacy L. Smith, they found that 16% of artists across 500 top country songs from 2014 to 2018 were women—translating to 5.2 male country artists for every 1 female country artist represented on the charts. Women who did find commercial success were also far younger than their male counterparts. In fact, none of the women who catapulted to the upper echelons of the Billboard chart during the surveyed period were over 40.
Men, meanwhile, enjoyed top honors later in their careers.
""The mean age for top performing male solo artists was 42 whereas the mean age for top performing female solo artists was 29,"" the researchers found. ""Women are not only disadvantaged in the country market, but their age illuminates a sell-by date that their male counterparts do not experience.""
University of Southern California
What’s more, only 12 percent of songwriters across the five years studied were women, leading the researchers to write that “the ‘bro culture’ is still alive and well in country music and things are not getting better.”
To correct the imbalance, researchers advised that industry influencers—from label executives to radio managers—internally assess recruitment, signing, and promotion strategies.
“The current reality in country music does not have to be the future of the genre,” the study reads. “By taking action as an industry, executives, programmers, advocates, and even consumers can leverage their influence to create a space that produces great music— by male and female artists.”
The research was prompted by a second consecutive year of all male nominees for the prestigious Entertainer of the Year Award at the Academy of Country Music Awards, the 54th iteration of which will be held Sunday.
Its unveiling also comes as Music City grapples with accusations that it’s exclusive to the voices of white men. Lil Nas X, a black artist from Atlanta, found cross-genre success with “ Old Town Road ”—a song that marries elements of country and hip-hop—but its removal from the Billboard country charts triggered an ongoing debate about race and inclusivity in the industry.

LDS Church Announces Policy Change Concerning Same-sex Marriage and Baptism,www.thenewamerican.com,Dave Bohon,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/faith-and-morals/item/31942-lds-church-announces-policy-change-concerning-same-sex-marriage-and-baptism,"Email
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS) — the Mormons — announced April 4 that it would no longer consider homosexual church members in same-sex “marriages” as apostate, and would allow for the baptism of the children of homosexual LDS Church members.
A statement on the LDS newsroom website explained that previous to the new ruling, “our handbook characterized same-gender marriage by a member as apostasy. While we still consider such a marriage to be a serious transgression, it will not be treated as apostasy for purposes of Church discipline. Instead, the immoral conduct in heterosexual or homosexual relationships will be treated in the same way.”
The statement noted that at the direction of LDS leadership, effective immediately “children of parents who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender may be baptized without First Presidency approval if the custodial parents give permission for the baptism and understand both the doctrine that a baptized child will be taught and the covenants he or she will be expected to make.”
The LDS statement referred to the new policy as “very positive,” and said the denomination desired “to reduce the hate and contention so common today. We are optimistic that a majority of people — whatever their beliefs and orientations — long for better understanding and less contentious communications. That is surely our desire, and we seek the help of our members and others to attain it.”
Religion News Service recalled that in 2015, “the LDS church announced that children of LGBT parents could not be blessed or baptized. Church President Russell Nelson reaffirmed the policy in 2016, calling it a ‘revelation from God,’ according to The Salt Lake Tribune.” No divine revelation was apparently claimed for the change in policy.
While LDS leadership emphasized that the church still considers active homosexuality a “serious transgression” and “immoral conduct,” many LGBT individuals and their sympathizers seemed to consider the policy shift an endorsement of the lifestyle.
Sam Brinton of the Trevor Project, a support group for young people claiming to be homosexual, called it “a move in the right direction that will make a real difference in the lives of LGBTQ Mormons. We hear from LGBTQ young people in crisis every day who struggle to reconcile being part of both the LGBTQ and faith communities, and decisions to end policies of exclusion can help LGBTQ youth feel seen, loved, and less alone.”
The Salt Lake Tribune quoted Tom Christofferson, the “gay brother of Latter-day Saint apostle D. Todd Christopher,” as applauding the move for “‘taking away some of the heartache for gay parents’ and dropping the ‘apostasy’ nomenclature.” Christofferson, author of the book That We May Be One: A Gay Mormon’s Perspective on Faith & Family , added, “My great hope and prayer is that congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will use this as encouragement to do more to love and welcome their LGBTQ brothers and sisters into their midst, to create a place of acceptance and appreciation for the gifts they bring.”
Utah’s Deseret News offered an extensive listing of favorable press over the move, along with tweets of tearful praise from joyful LDS members and their families and friends. “I’m sobbing,” tweeted one respondent. “These changes will save lives.”
“The implementation of these policies on November 5, 2015, was one of the hardest days in my life,” tweeted another, “so I’ll just say that I’m thrilled to see them rescinded.” Photo: Alysta/iStock/Getty Images Plus Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment

Ricochet and Aleister Black Have Final NXT Match at Takeover: New York; Triple H ‘Concerned’ During Finish,www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/ricochet-aleister-black-nxt-takeover-new-york-1388035,"On 4/6/19 at 3:37 AM EDT Share Sports NXT WWE
NXT Takeover: New York saw the final matches for Aleister Black and Ricochet on WWE’s third brand.
After weeks of competing as a tag team, winning the Dusty Classic tournament in the process, Black and Ricochet fell to the NXT Tag Team Champions, the War Raiders in arguably the best match of the night.
Aleister Black and Ricochet have their final NXT match at Takeover: New York WWE
Following the pin, the sold out crowd in the Barclays Center gave both men an ovation to cap off their NXT careers.
“It’s always a bittersweet thing,” Paul “Triple H” Levesque told the media in a post-show conference. “You want that next challenge and in many ways you look at NXT as college football and you’re leaving your school and teammates, and moving on to the next thing. You have to be able to step up... That’s where the real work starts. So far [Black and Ricochet] have done it amazingly well and their future is incredibly bright for both of them. I told them both when they were done that this is always their home.”
However, the end of their Takeover match left the audience and fans watching at home worried after Ricochet took the War Raiders’ finisher, Fallout. It seemed the high-flyer took the move awkwardly, which left him laid out on the floor as a trainer came to the ring to check on him.
Triple H would give a brief update on Ricochet’s condition after the show. “He’s fine. It was an immediate concern. That’s one of those things where we saw the landing and we all went into protection mode for him. Luckily he was good. We don’t like to take chances on that.”
But this isn’t the end of the line for Black and Ricochet’s WWE careers, both men will team up again in a Fatal Fourway tag match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania 35 this Sunday.
What did you think of the NXT Tag Team Championship match? How do you like Black and Ricochet’s chances on Sunday? Let us know in the comments section below."
Republican Sen. John Kennedy Slaps Request For Trump's Tax Returns as 'Dumb' and 'Wildly Dishonest',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/republican-sen-john-kennedy-slaps-request-trumps-tax-returns-dumb-and-1387969,"On 4/5/19 at 8:30 PM EDT Share U.S.
During an appearance on CNN's ""The Lead,"" Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana suggested that it was ""dumb"" and ""inappropriate"" for Democrats to go after President Donald Trump's tax returns.
Kennedy's ire was focused on Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, the House's Ways and Means chairman, who issued a formal request with the International Revenue Service to obtain six years worth of Trump's records earlier this week. In a letter, Neal wrote that he requested the documents “to ensure that the Internal Revenue Service is enforcing the laws in a fair and impartial manner.""
Neal cited a provision of the federal tax code that gives the chairman the power to request and examine an individual’s tax returns in a closed session.
""It is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials,"" Neal said in a public statement about the letter. ""To maintain trust in our democracy, the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly, as laws intend.""
Kennedy, clearly, was not swayed.
""I can't believe he thinks the American public is going to fall for that,"" Kennedy said. “It must really suck to be that dumb. This is very simple: Mr. Neal wants to screw with the president. He doesn’t think the president ought to be president. Well, you know, words can’t express how much I don’t care. It’s not Mr. Neal’s call. The American people have chosen Donald Trump as president.""
He also characterized Neal's attempts as ""thoroughly in bad faith.""
There is no requirement forcing a president or presidential candidate to release their tax returns, but doing so has become common practice in the years following Richard Nixon’s submission of the documents in 1973. An analysis of presidential elections over the last 40 years showed that all but one major-party candidate—Republican Gerald Ford, in 1976—released at least one year of returns. (Ford released a summary.)
Since securing the nomination, Trump has repeatedly said he won’t release his returns because he is under audit—walking back previous declarations made before he campaigned that he would release the documents. Technically, the president could furnish the documents at any time, as the IRS does not forbid a person under audit from releasing tax returns.
Political watchdogs, meanwhile, have long called for the president's tax records to be made public, arguing that it is in the public's interest for lawmakers to be transparent about their finances. The returns would reveal the president's charitable contributions, as well as how much money he's borrowed and from whom—both topics that have embroiled the Trump administration in controversies. An investigative report from The New York Times , published last year, found that Trump participated in so-called “tax dodges” and “outright fraud.” His charitable contributions have also been under investigation .
In a Friday letter to the Treasury Department, Trump attorney William Consovoy argued that Neal's request served no ""legitimate committee purpose.""
""Chairman Neal wants the President's tax returns and return information because his party recently gained control of the House,"" the letter stated. ""The President is their political opponent, and they want to use the information to damage him politically.""

The move toward more globalization is unstoppable, basically for technological reasons. For instance, constant improvements in transport and communication technologies lead to increasing direct contact between different individuals, families, tribes, cities and states. In a matter of 10 to 20 years, civilian supersonic travel will be back. This is not to speak of the indirect contact with other people and cultures by trade in goods. By and large, most young people look forward to it. They are not scared by change brought about by globalization; they are not even fatigued by constant change. Apart from age, the reason for this fearless attitude is that they are increasingly educated and acquiring a very important tool, namely knowledge of the English language. They are better equipped than previous generations to cope with globalization. As a matter of fact, many adults, including old ones who are naturally inclined to resist change, are also becoming computer literate. Research shows that people of the baby boom generation, including this author, are or at least feel younger mentally and physically than their parents when they were the same age. Globalization has not only technological reasons, but also political will to eliminate artificial man-made barriers to movement of goods, services, people and capital across national borders. The European Union is at the forefront of globalization. It has been an open trading block, largely thanks to elimination of man-made barriers to movement of goods and services through intensive participation in multilateral trade negotiations first in the GATT and then the WTO. But when that road was unavailable or did not go far enough, the EU did not hesitate to negotiate free-trade areas, including with Israel; or even negotiate inclusion of countries such as Norway in its single market. The degree of freedom of movement was always many steps ahead inside the EU. Since 1968, citizens of the member states can move across the entire EU territory to look for permanent work; for a place to retire long-term; to study in another EU member country for an unlimited time; and this list is not exhaustive. Almost all Israelis that by law are allowed by one of the EU member states to become citizens are slowly and discreetly availing themselves of this possibility, Zionism or not. GIVEN THE opportunity, most people prefer to be citizens of a supranational state than a purely national one. Those forecasting the unsustainability of the EU in the long run (Eurosceptics) as compared to the durability of the nation state have constantly had to revise their dire predictions. The eurozone is alive and kicking. Nobody questions the usefulness for the citizen of having an international currency that can be used in practice at least in the European continent (including Switzerland, Hungary, Montenegro and so on). Those UK citizens that voted for Brexit expecting the EU to collapse afterward must recognize now that this was not only fantasy, but that Brexit has energized the other 27 to integrate further. Some keen observers of what Britain will do after leaving the EU think that the former will ask again for EU membership in less than a decade. Who would have predicted several decades ago that the largest producer of civil aircraft in the world, Airbus, would be a consortium of different European firms working in harmony with Brussels eyes monitoring its development? Who would have said that a mega-national producer of aircraft like the American Boeing, with Washington behind it, would incur huge losses because of rushing the development of a new model, the Boeing 737Max, to catch up with Airbus and then having to ground the whole new fleet until the safety of the new aircraft is duly established?The advantages that educated young people in Europe see in economies of scale are self-evident. For instance, a much higher percentage of young British citizens favor the UK remaining in the EU than the rest of the population. Young European citizens love the EU because it opens to them 28 different labor markets; they benefit extensively from the successful introduction of EU educational programs such as Erasmus for education, training and sport. Low-cost airlines such as Easy Jet and Ryan Air have become European trademarks for vast amounts of young people that never dreamed two decades ago of visiting other European countries as they do know – and they like that.One of the taboos firmly engrained in European societies is being bypassed increasingly, namely mixed intra-European marriages. Traditional barriers such as language and religion are left aside. Children issued of these marriages are going to become the real Europeans. Quite ironically, among the first generations of real Europeans are, relatively speaking, many Jews. Not surprisingly, we don’t find many European Jews that are Eurosceptic.THE TRIUMPH of neoliberalism as an economic doctrine both at the supra-national level (the EU becoming an engine of globalization) and at the member-state level (creating EU single markets for goods, services, capital and labor) has had secondary effects that must now be reckoned with. They became glaring a decade ago with the onset of the Great Recession. Increasing income inequality and regional disparities, both at the domestic level and at the EU level are well documented. The political backlash is the emergence of Europopulism and the rise of extreme parties – both right- and left-wing. A common feature to all is hostility to neoliberal and cosmopolitan elites. This translates frequently into classic nationalism, protectionism, hostility to migrants and foreigners in general, but also to well-integrated minorities, such as European Jews. However, things must be put in perspective. The explosion of social media exaggerates the real impact of people with extreme, frequently badly informed, views. Let’s not overreact. If most Europeans think that globalization should continue and that on the whole it is a satisfying feature of their lives, then the right things to do is to hear the qualms of those left behind and try to bring them up to average as much as possible. This is what is expected to happen in a modern democracy. “As much as possible” will be a function of the place of the state in the political economy (from almost zero in the UK to quite a lot in France). In that task, the nation-state will play a central role for some time (for practical reasons, in most instances), but if it appears to most Europeans that some services can be provided more efficiently at the supra-national rather than at the national level, they will eventually go for it. The European University in Florence is a good advanced example of graduate teaching toward obtaining a PhD without renouncing to excellence.Paraphrasing Mark Twain, the news that the EU is cranking and moribund is premature. Europopulism can be addressed by adopting policy measures that can correct the worst side effects of openness and globalization, something that President Emmanuel Macron of France seems to have understood. In historical perspective, this period we are living now will be remembered probably as “much ado about nothing.”The writer is a professor emeritus of the Department of International Relations of the Hebrew University and co-president of the Israeli Association for Study of European Integration.

It was supposed to be an ever closer union in which Europe “whole and free” would stand alongside the United States in leading a liberal international order.This would involve exporting modernization to Africa and the Middle East and socializing Russia, Iran and China into rule-based multilateralism – serving as a shining model of successful post-national cosmopolitanism for the whole world to admire and emulate. After completing its “Big Bang” round of membership expansion to Central and Eastern Europe in 2007 and admitting Croatia into the club in 2013, the European Union of 28 states – democratic, prosperous and at peace – took its internal unity more or less for granted and thought of itself as a rising “normative power” in a largely benign global environment.Yet within a frighteningly short period of time, the European dream has morphed into a nightmare. The once ebullient Metrosexual Superpower is now entangled in a sticky web of internal fractures, too divided to generate a coherent vision of a shared European future and too fragile to determine its own geopolitical fate.Whether Brexit eventually happens or not, the old equilibrium that held the EU together for decades – one built around the Berlin-London-Paris triangle and embedded within the transatlantic community – is now irrevocably shattered. The Brits, always somewhat suspect in the eyes of committed integrationists, will never be trusted again to be reliable partners in the construction of the European Project.No new European equilibrium has emerged or is likely to be found in the foreseeable future. The loss of London has come just at a time when the continent is caught in a maelstrom of centrifugal forces and lacks a cohesive organizing idea that could restore a modicum of balance to an EU battered by migration, terrorism and economic crises.At the heart of Europe’s troubles lies a growing disconnect among European cultural and political elites, and between most of those elites and populations inside European societies. These chasms have insidiously eroded public trust in the basic efficacy of European political systems at the national and EU levels. It is a divide European elites are unlikely to be able to begin to repair any time soon since they themselves possess sharply diverging conceptions about what Europe is (and ought to be) and because none of them is strong enough to impose their vision on the rest.EU politics now resembles a scramble of interlocking conflicts and fractured alliances with no winning coalition in sight. The European Commission is fighting Hungary and Poland. Italy and Poland are conniving to form an anti-EU league in the run up to the May 2019 European Parliament elections. Germany, Austria, Finland and the Netherlands are increasingly unwilling to subsidize the poorer, more profligate southern Europeans, and everyone is resisting France’s beleaguered President Emmanuel Macron’s grandiose ideas for deeper European integration.For the time being, the EU is unlikely to unravel. Barring a major catastrophe – a full-blown Eurozone meltdown triggered by debt-laden Italy or a new tsunami of refugees escaping a failing Algeria or Nigeria, for example – Europe will sputter along in fits and starts, as aging empires have done throughout the ages. Like the Romans in the 5th, the Holy Roman Empire in the 18th and the Ottomans in the 19th century, the EU is more likely to gradually slouch toward paralysis and decay than to experience any form of dramatic collapse. The EU is now the sick man of Europe. Unless it is able to generate a convincing new equilibrium, built around an energizing and unifying centrist vision, we should not expect a lot of bangs from Europe, but perhaps quite a bit of whimpering.The writer is head of the diplomacy and conflict studies program at the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy, Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya.

A brief history of EU-Israel relations,www.jpost.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/International/A-brief-history-of-EU-Israel-relations-585673,"
The relationship between the EU and Israel is very close and deep-rooted. Israel was one of the first countries to establish relations with the EU (then the European Economic Community) back in the 1950s. And in 1976 we had our first trade agreement. Just think of how trade between Israel and the EU has gone from €2 billion to €36b. since then.The European Union is Israel’s largest trading partner. Bilateral cooperation is extensive in many areas, such as in transport, industry and agriculture, but also in justice and home affairs. Cooperation on security issues, antiterrorism and antisemitism is growing, and we have proposed negotiations allowing for Israel’s exchange of information with Europol. The depth of historic, political, economic, social and cultural connections between Israel and the EU is often overlooked or neglected in the discourse. Our common future is also sometimes disregarded, even as Israel and the EU continue moving toward each other.• Israeli exports to the EU in 2017 increased by around 20%. Thus the EU’s share in total Israel exports reached the historical high of 34%. Almost 40% of all Israeli imports are from the EU. This is not limited to hi-tech sector but applies also to Israeli agricultural exports, 50% of which are to the EU.• The EU is by far the biggest target for Israeli investment, accounting for 40% of outgoing investment.• Thanks to the Open Skies Agreement ratified in June 2013, passenger traffic since then between the EU and Israel has grown from 7.6 million to 11.9 million, making the EU the prime destination for Israeli tourists. There are now over 90 EU destinations to fly to from Ben-Gurion Airport, and Israelis benefit from visa waiver travel.• Half of Israeli higher education institutions have participated in Erasmus programs, while in 2018, for the first time, more Israeli postgraduate students chose to study in the EU than in the US, and Israel is looking at more closely aligning its qualifications system to the EU, offering greater future opportunities for young Israelis.• The EU has been fundamental in supporting the expansion of Israel’s research and innovation sector for over 20 years. In the Horizon 2020 program, over 1,245 projects received funding to the tune of €713 million.• As part of our Union for the Mediterranean, Israel sits with its neighboring countries at ministerial and governmental levels to promote cooperation and improve our shared Euro-Mediterranean region through concrete projects.IN SHORT, Israel and the EU are getting closer, and we feel there is still more to offer.A key example is the development of gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean, which places the EU-Israel relationship at a crossroads and is about to add a whole new strategic dimension to our cooperation. As recently expressed by Energy Minister Steinitz himself, Europe is the natural market for eastern Mediterranean gas. And the EU and Israel understand that our challenges are increasingly common, whether on climate change, contributing to economic growth and development in Africa, or managing global migration flows.We, of course, also have disagreements with the Israeli government, and we engage on those both privately and publicly. But the EU is united when it comes to Israel and its security. We all share a desire to keep Israel close to us, we are deeply engaged in efforts to stabilize the region, and at the same time we need to see an end to the conflict and the occupation, which put at risk Israel’s long-term interests.We are already engaging with both the Arab world and Israel to promote practical cooperation on issues of common interest, ranging from regional security to civil protection to climate change adaptation. We are ready to accompany both parties every step in the direction of a more cooperative regional dynamic.Yet we are also aware that full normalization of relations between Arab states and Israel requires addressing the conflict, and the two-state solution is the only viable option. Peace with the Palestinians would allow relations with the EU to naturally flourish even further, and the region to develop its unexploited potential.We don’t want to underplay the importance of our differences, but we cannot allow them to overshadow our entire relations, and we also need to clearly communicate the many positive aspects of our relations, which the overwhelming majority of Israelis would not want to abandon.For seven decades now, Europe and Israel have been good friends, partners and neighbors. We have joint interests, joint history and a joint future. As we always say, and I think that facts speak for themselves, these are disagreements between friends. Sometimes the older the friendship, the more you allow yourself to voice your differences.The writer is the European Union’s ambassador to Israel.

Unlike in the United States and in Israel, where the choice for liberal democracy was organic and rooted in the founding ideology, modern Europe’s arrival at democracy was reactionary.The French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic wars attempted to spread the revolution’s values to the rest of Europe. Yet upon France’s defeat, old monarchies were restored in most of the continent. Even in France itself, there were fierce debates throughout the 19th century about the proper form of government and monarchy was restored on a number of occasions. The debate ended artificially and without resolution with the unexpected outbreak of World War I. The winners of the war, led by US president Woodrow Wilson, forced democracy upon Europe. This did not go well; soon thereafter, it was reversed in much of Europe and war resumed. After World War II, democracy was restored in Western Europe and in subsequent decades, in reaction to the horror of wars, Europe developed a new twist to its long quest for the ideal form of government: post-nationalist pan-Europeanism.While there are various variations to such an approach, at its core lies a view that wars erupt due to nationalism, religion, particularity and ideology. Therefore, if one can fulfill the dream of a post-nationalist integrated Europe, along the line of the John Lennon song “Imagine,” peace would prevail. A new entity was created – the European Union – which has been amassing more and more power previously held by its nation-state members. It now seeks to garner even greater control of foreign and domestic policies and pivot toward a more federalized Europe. A growing number of Europeans feel that such a post-nationalist ethos is outright inconsistent with European values. Many Europeans who were previously happy with features of the European project such as free movement and common market, are now asking, “Why should Brussels dictate the laws of my own country? Why should the way I farm my land in Wales be determined by unelected bureaucrats of the European Commission who have never been to Wales?” Indeed, Wales, just as all of England with the exception of London, voted to exit the European Union.THE BATTLE for Europe goes well beyond a debate about law and jurisdiction – it goes to the core of what it means to be a European. Mischael Modrikamen, president of the Belgium People’s Party and executive director of The Movement, an organization that promotes right-wing populist parties, argues that the concept of Europe as a political entity is artificial. “Nobody really prepares to be first a European; to be in love with European flag or a European anthem,” he states.Yet one can argue that the same was true in France, Italy and Germany during the 19th century. In France, according to Prof. John Merriman of Yale University, half of the people did not even speak French at the beginning of that century. “In the north they spoke Dutch, in Alsace they spoke German, in the south they spoke Basque,” he explains. Yet the French were able to unite under the Paris-dominated government, love their flag and sing “La Marseillaise.” Similar unions occurred in Germany and Italy. Is the current prospect of European federalization simply the next logical step to the 19th-century federalization of its various sections? Even if one advocates the nation-state model, why could that nation-state not be Europe?According to Steve Bannon, US President Donald Trump’s adviser who joined Modrikamen in The Movement, this is already happening. Speaking in Oxford University, he claimed, “[French President Emmanuel] Macron is a nationalist, but the capital of his nation is not in Paris, it is in Brussels.” Indeed, the European Commission, the prototype European nation’s government, is comprised of commissioners that pledge to pursue the interests of Europe and not that of their own origin nation.Most Eurosceptics do not advocate abolishment of the EU, but rather reform and de-federalization. Yet the practical political process, such as in a yes/no referendum, pushes the debate into a perceived exaggerated choice: United States of Europe vs sovereign nation states. WHAT IS often missed by some Eurosceptics is that European integration provided stability in Europe in the last 70 years. For one, it shoved the national aspirations of minorities within European countries under the European rug. For example, German-speaking Tyroleans are okay living under Italian control (or occupation, per some narratives), as long as they feel European. Europe provides a sense of identity and reduces the requirement for a Tyrolean to artificially feel “Italian” (there is only limited integration between the German-speaking indigenous and Sicilian settlers brought to Tyrol by Mussolini). If the EU weakens, or outright abolishes, the risk of Italian disintegration rises. The situation is similar in various other countries where minorities have national aspirations or feel suppressed, including in Sweden, France and Spain. There is much more that is swept under the EU rug: From border disputes through Austrian-German competition (Austria was the flag-carrier of German culture and identity through history and some say, still should be), to outright intra-European animosities.The European fabric provided serenity, but such serenity was recently shaken. The battle for Europe was ignited by an exogenous event: immigration. The vast influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa, mostly Muslim, was followed by an increase in crime, terrorism and a growing fear among some Europeans of “replacement.” Integrationists dismiss such fears as Islamophobia, yet one thing is clear: European demography has changed forever and likely so is its character.Europeans blame this on the EU and its lead proponents – Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel – who adapted a seemingly delusional belief that immigrants will integrate and embrace European values and lifestyle. After all, who does not want to be Europeanized?Indeed, when the Europeans first invaded the Middle East 2,300 years ago, they brought European values and technologies to the locals, liberating them from their primitive ways of life (except the Jews who refused to be Hellenized). Europe did the same during the colonialist era and today, once again, Europe invests massive amounts of money to enlighten the new arrivals. Yet still, shockingly, many European Muslims follow the precedent of the Jews and refuse to be Europeanized. Indeed, just like the Jews since their earliest history, European Muslims chose to maintain their language, dress and names.Those two topics of debate – immigration and European integration – have been packaged together in a series of recent elections in European countries. Parties that are both Eurosceptic and anti-immigration made strong inroads and are expected to do well in the May 19 elections for the European Parliament. Some of those anti-immigration parties house Islamophobic and antisemitic elements. This allows integrationists to paint Eurosceptics as xenophobic and haters.The European divide has clear social-economic demarcations. For example, Europhiles are associated with Europe’s large metropolis, banking sector and academia, while Eurosceptics are linked with rural Europe. This leads to a clash of interests, as was on display during France’s ongoing yellow-vest political demonstrations for economic justice, sparked by high fuel taxes. France and the EU were perceived to “penalize” rural Europe for the use of such an environmentally unfriendly resource, and indirectly discourage the primitive habit of driving, as opposed to using public transportation. The EU and France, like Marie Antoinette, were perceived to send the message that if you do not have a Metro in your village, use the RER.But Euroscepticism does not just reside with the anti-immigration Right; it is also prevalent in Europe’s Left. In Italy, Eurosceptic populist parties on the Right and Left have joined forces to form a government. This is a demonstration that the battle for the nature of Europeanism is front and center and trumps other issues such as socialism vs. capitalism. Such coalitions could be a template in coming European elections.AS THE challenge from Euroscepticism strengthens, some feel that the European Union found a classic answer: unite the people against a rival – the United States of America. After all, in the last century, Europe was shocked not only by wars, but also by the humiliating fall from grace. Its colonies were taken away and global power and influence abruptly shifted to the United States.The Europe-US feud goes well beyond policy issues such as Iran and the environment. It is anchored in core philosophical differences: Europe’s universalism, post-nationalism, zealous secularism vs. America’s particularity, ideology and faith – one nation under God. Every century has its defining global philosophical divide. In the 19th century, it was monarchy vs. republicanism. In the 20th century it was communism vs. capitalism. It seems that this era’s divide is Europeanism vs. Americanism.In counter-Americanism, Europe seemingly found a flag to unite its people under and an anthem to spread its gospel to the outside world. Yet more and more Eurosceptics believe that Europe is on the wrong side of this 21st century divide. Just like with previous partitions, there are those in the United States who want America to be more like Europe and those in Europe who want the continent to adapt a more American approach. To escalate Europe’s counter-American stance, its leaders now stunningly call for the establishment of a European army, as Macron said, “to defend itself, including against the United States.” Some Eurosceptics view this as outright thanklessness: The United States saved Europe in World War I, World War II, the Cold War and continues to do so today in the war on terrorism. Another expression of Europe’s counter-Americanism is through Jerusalem, the Achilles heel of European secular fundamentalism as it represents religion. Europe’s official policy is derived from a 1949 United Nations resolution that calls for Jerusalem and Bethlehem to be taken away from Israelis and Palestinians alike and be turned into an international Corpus Separatum (a code name for a European colony). That was supposedly the legal basis for Europe’s passionate and angry reaction to America’s decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem.Europeans on the other side of the battle for Europe, many of which are still religious Christians, are emotionally hurt by Europe’s recurring opposition to Jerusalem, which includes European countries’ support or abstention on ludicrous UNESCO resolutions implying that Christian and Jews have no historic connections to Jerusalem. The EU has been exerting intense pressure on its member states not to move their embassies to Jerusalem, but those on the other side of battle for Europe are beginning to rebel: the prime ministers of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic defied the European Union and announced last month the opening of diplomatic offices in Jerusalem. Last week, Romania went even further and to the great dismay of the EU, announced that it will follow the US lead and move its embassy to Jerusalem as well. Similarly, while denouncing nationalism at home, the EU has been aggressively promoting Palestinian nationalism abroad, leading to the de facto EU policy of PNEP: Post-Nationalists except Palestine.Europe’s obsessive intervention in Israeli-Palestinian affairs has indeed been debilitating to the prospects to peace and damaging to Palestinians, such as through Europe’s relentless efforts to sabotage Palestinian employment in Jewish-owned businesses. The EU has been sanctioning such businesses and regulating unprecedented special labels as a condition for sales in Europe. This, the EU claims, is done to “help Palestinians.” Yet denying Palestinians employment, livelihood, mentorship opportunities and professional growth is no help – it is a profound expression of European supremacism and colonialism. On the other hand, members of 11 Eurosceptic parties have established the Friends of Judea and Samaria in the European Parliament to counter the EU boycott. WHILE THE European Union and Israel are allies and partners on a variety of economic and security matters, the EU’s criticism of Israel has turned into an infatuation that is hard to explain through rational reasoning.Indeed, European opposition to Israel is not just about the conflict or “punishment” for the Jewish state’s steadfast alliance with the United States – an unshakable bond maintained by successive US presidents and Israeli governments. Modrikamen explains that Israel stands in the way of the EU’s narrative that prosperity and peace will only be achieved through post-nationalism: “Israel is affirming exactly the opposite – that you can be a nation-state, that you can unite around common values and cohabitate perfectly in a democracy.” According to such views, the EU does not only have strong disagreements with Israeli policies, such as on settlements, but has a fundamental philosophical problem with the actual existence of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish nation. The only way to reconcile this is to de-Israelize Israel: to Europeanize it!This, of course, is done in order to help Israel. Some 2,300 years ago, the Jews ungraciously rejected the European invader’s generous effort to enlighten them, sparking 2,300 years of the European-Israeli conflict – history’s longest-running feud. Would Israelis finally accept European dictations of “imagine” and for their own good, abandon ideas such as particularity, ideology, faith in God and nationalism?Back-then it was the Europeans that eventually accepted the Jewish monotheistic narrative, in the form of Christianity – a stunning case where an invading occupying power succumbed to the narrative of the occupied. Rather than Europeanize the Israelites, Europe was Israelized.Modrikamen stresses that contemporary efforts to Europeanize Israel do not represent the views of most Europeans. “There are those in Europe who look at Israel as an aberration, but there are also those who look at Israel as a model. Israel is the example for Europe because it is a nation-state concept that fights for its values and concentrates on the future. It affirms exactly what we are and where we are heading.”Other Eurosceptic leaders echo similar messages. For example, Beatrix von Storch, leader of Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland, told the Magazine that Israel is a role model for Germany, as well as for Europe as a whole.While one camp in Europe wants to Europeanize Israel, other Europeans seems to want to Israelize Europe. To some, Israel represents a scion of true European liberalism.Indeed, when Theodor Herzl was crafting his vision for the Jewish state in the late 19th century, he viewed it as the most exact application of European liberalism. He spent years in Palais Bourbon carefully observing French democracy; he analyzed Bismarck’s audacious state-building efforts during German reunification and noted the challenges of Austria’s pluralism. Herzl studied political philosophers, internalized the imperfections of European liberalism and planted the seeds for a more perfect Europe in Israel.Herzl envisioned a Jewish state that will serve humanity. Indeed, Israel has been blessed with a string of astonishing successes. Nations in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East are now seeking to share this blessing and partner with the Jewish state. This is even the case among a growing number of Palestinians – some of whom are sick and tired of the European-sponsored dictation of conflict perpetuation.As the battle for Europe shapes up, more and more Europeans on both sides of the European divide are now calling for Europe to join the world’s nations, and rather than oppose the Jewish state, view Israel once again as a light to Europeans.The writer analyzes trends in Zionism, Europe and global affairs, focusing on long-term shifts and applying historical perspectives.

European Jewry: A perfect storm of challenges,www.jpost.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/International/European-Jewry-A-perfect-storm-of-challenges-585689,"World News European Jewry: A perfect storm of challenges This year, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker spoke out forcefully and movingly against antisemitism: “I did not think in my lifetime I would see again that Jewish citizens are afraid.

Across Europe, antisemitism is rising – and sentiment against Israel with it. The sources are a dangerous combination of a radical minority of the increasingly large Muslim population on the Continent, and the far Left and far Right of the political spectrum.The traditional threats to Israel’s security from the Arab world have significantly abated since US president Jimmy Carter negotiated the Camp David Accords and the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, which I recount in my new book President Carter: The White House Years, and which just celebrated 40 years of unbroken compliance. We also broke the back of the Arabs’ commercial cordon of Israel when Carter championed the 1977 law that prohibited American companies from joining the boycott. Israel today is one of the strongest economic and military forces in the world, and the only democracy in the region. Now Israel faces new challenges, and must recognize that its own policies in the West Bank and internal political developments aggravate its ability to overcome these challenges, with major implications for Diaspora Jews everywhere. Since 2015, a tide of more than a million Muslim refugees has emigrated to western European nations, from Sweden to Germany, as a direct result of the catastrophic civil war in Syria and the violence in Iraq, augmenting the continent’s already large Muslim population. Most of the Muslims in Europe want good jobs, a good education for their children and a secure environment that includes tolerance of their religion. But some of the new Muslim refugees, and others who came earlier, brought with them what they had been taught – a virulent hatred of Jews and Israel that did not distinguish between the Israeli government’s policies and the Jewish communities they encountered in Europe for the first time. Between 1993 and 1996, I traveled widely throughout Europe from my base in Brussels as US ambassador to the European Union. I could always tell where the synagogues and Jewish schools were located because they were protected by concrete barriers and heavily armed police. In Germany, the recipient of by far the largest group of these new refugees, some Jews are now afraid to wear kippot for fear of attack. The children of close friends in Brussels have moved to Florida because of persistent Muslim harassment of their children. A carnival float in a Belgian parade of a local club carried larger-than-life images of stereotypes of hook-nosed Jews. It caused an outcry, but the club insisted it was permissible satire. In Malmo, Sweden, home to a large Muslim population, a series of attacks culminated in the 2013 bombing of the Jewish community center there.There are many factors behind a resurgence of Europe’s far-right neo-Nazi parties – the stresses of globalism, economic trauma from the past decade’s financial crisis, and especially the new wave of Muslim immigrants since 2015. Greece has its Golden Dawn Party; Hungary its ruling Fidesz Party; Italy its Northern League, now in the government; Austria its Freedom Party, with neo-Nazi roots, now a partner in the government; and the Alternative for Germany Party is now the main opposition party, with particular strength in the depressed areas of the former East Germany. One of the AfD’s leaders recently declared that the Holocaust was a “mere speck” on Germany’s 1,000-year history.Resentment on the European far Right against Jews is partly connected to what they consider disruptive globalization. Nationalist parties that dominate or hold the balance of power in central and East European nations have threatened the democratic values of tolerance, the rule of law, a free press, and an independent judiciary – all of which are critical to the safety of Jews in Europe.IRONICALLY, SOME on the far Right combine antisemitism at home with support for Israel, a country they view as a symbol of nationalism. The Israeli government has made common cause with many of those governments and their leaders, most notably Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary, who fans the flames of antisemitism at home, yet tries to improve his reputation by being photographed at Yad Vashem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While it is necessary to deal with conservative governments as a matter of state, the Israeli government should use its influence with these governments to urge them to confront antisemitism in their countries. No longer is racial and religious violence a matter of some isolated lone madman. Internet-linked white-power advocates and neo-Nazis communicate with each other worldwide to murder Muslims in New Zealand, young Social Democrats in Norway, black worshipers at prayer in South Carolina, or Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue – anyone who in their eyes fits Martin Buber’s classic definition of “The Other.”This resurgence is not simply a phenomenon arising from a radical Muslim fringe or Europe’s ultra-Right. The far Left has joined in to idolize the Palestinians as victims of what they call Israeli “colonialism.” At both these extremes, the falsehood resonates that Jews control the financial strings of the world. Some cheered the September 11, 2011, attacks in New York as an attack on the center of Jewish power and globalization. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s Labour Party, regards as friends Hamas and Hezbollah, whose goal is the destruction of the Jewish state. A handful of Labour members of parliament have deserted their party, and Jonathan Sacks, Britain’s former chief rabbi, has called Corbyn an “existential threat” to British Jews. British universities have imposed a virtual boycott on exchanges with Israeli professors who have almost no connection with the West Bank. All this has taken a toll on European Jewry. In the largest survey of European Jews ever undertaken in 12 countries of the European Union last December, about a third said they avoid public events and venues in fear of their safety. And a similar percentage said they have considered emigrating in the past five years for the same reason.France is the crucible of this lethal combination as the home to half a million Jews, the largest such community in Europe, as well as about five million Muslims, many of them refugees from the Algerian war for independence, and many never successfully integrated into French life or were accepted by the French leadership. In 1980, in the first attack on Jews in France since World War II, the synagogue on Paris’ Rue Copernic was bombed, killing four people, including – in the obtuse words of Prime Minister Raymond Barre – some “innocent Frenchmen,” a phrase for which he was roundly mocked in a criticism that he blamed on the “Jewish lobby” to his dying day. Anti-Jewish terrorism intensified in the next decade, and in 2012, a Muslim attack against a Jewish day school in Toulouse killed a rabbi and three school children. In 2014, some 800 antisemitic incidents were reported in France, an average of two a day. The following year, a deadly attack on the Paris editorial offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo – for a disrespectful portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad – and simultaneously on the Hypercacher kosher supermarket brought antisemitic violence to a new height. In 2014 and 2015, a total of about 13,000 French Jews made aliyah. During one march, banners were hoisted saying “Jews, France is not yours.” In 2018, the volume of antisemitic incidents in France increased dramatically, prompting Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to declare them “a daily occurrence.” For years, the authorities denied the problem, but now emigration has dropped significantly as the French police have begun to target antisemitic incidents. THERE ARE now some 15 million Muslims in Europe, and only one million Jews, and the gap is certain to widen in the years ahead. European politicians can count, and are likely to take more anti-Israel positions to court the growing Muslim population. French President Emmanuel Macron has refused to visit Israel because negotiations with the Palestinians have stalled, thereby discounting Palestinian obduracy and placing the blame largely on Israel. The BDS movement has particular resonance in Europe; it is grounded in public opinion. A BBC survey of 17 EU member states in 2013 found Israel’s impact on the world “mainly negative,” and standing fourth to last, just ahead of the pariah states of North Korea and Iran. Last December, a CNN poll of citizens in eight nations across Europe found that while only 10% viewed Jews unfavorably, roughly a third believed traditional antisemitic stereotypes that Jews have too much influence in government and finance; that Israel uses the Holocaust to justify its rule over the Palestinians, and accusations of antisemitism to block criticism of its policies. However, more than two-thirds of those surveyed supported commemoration of the Holocaust to help ensure genocide was not repeated. Buffeted by these political crosscurrents, the EU and many of its member states have taken critical positions on major issues of importance to Israel, ranging from relations with Iran to labeling requirements for imports from the West Bank into Europe. The bloc also restricts research and development grants to Israeli universities and institutions that have no contact with the West Bank. Meanwhile, the conservative Israeli government has moved increasingly close to the Trump administration on such policies as pulling out of the nuclear agreement with Iran that is still supported by its European signatories. It has also made a political alliance with the Jewish Power Party, a successor to Rabbi Meir Kahane’s virulently racist Kach Party, creating further tensions between Israel and Europe. All is not bleak in Europe. Europe is Israel’s major trading partner. Most Western European countries have an annual Holocaust Memorial Day. The European Union has gotten serious about combating antisemitism. The European Parliament has established a working group on antisemitism, formally condemned it, and outlawed Holocaust denial and antisemitic hate speech. The European Commission encouraged its 28 member states to combat antisemitism through its educational programs and established a code of conduct.This year, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker spoke out forcefully and movingly against antisemitism: “I did not think in my lifetime I would see again that Jewish citizens are afraid to express their support for their religion.” And this February, there was a huge rally in Paris against antisemitism. In the Clinton and Obama administrations, and as special negotiator for the Jewish Claims Conference, I have negotiated billions of dollars of Holocaust-related compensation agreements with the Swiss, French, Germans, Austrians, with European insurance companies, and negotiated the Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. We cannot give up on Europe and European Jews. They deserve more support from American Jews and from Israel, which gives them almost no attention except as potential recruits for aliyah. The EU stands for respect for all religions, even when trends toward intolerance and worse are troubling and must be fought at every turn.The writer served under various US presidents including Lyndon B.

"Apple beats Spotify in US subscriptions, plans to sell more services - Recode",www.recode.net,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.recode.net/2019/4/5/18297334/apple-spotify-music-subscription-services-plan-netflix-hbo-showtime-starz-oprah-winfrey,"Oprah Winfrey onstage at the Apple event in Cupertino, March 2019. Michael Short/Getty Images If Apple wants to sell services, Apple can be very good at selling services. That should be, but isn’t, the headline for today’s Wall Street Journal article , which is technically about Apple surpassing Spotify in the race to acquire US subscribers for their respective music services. For the record, the Journal’s sources think Apple Music has 28 million paid US subscribers and that Spotify has 26 million. But the real story is buried several paragraphs in, where the Journal says the quiet part out loud: If Apple can sell a lot of music subscriptions — after starting years after Spotify entered the market — by using offering free trials to its huge installed base, imagine what it can do when it starts selling other subscriptions. The growth of Apple Music is one of the strongest validations yet of Apple’s strategy to increase revenue by selling services across its devices — a shift after decades of focusing on hardware sales. Last week, the technology company announced new subscription offerings for magazines, TV shows and videogames. Or, if you don’t trust the Journal, maybe you’d like to hear it from Oprah Winfrey, onstage at Apple’s services launch in March:
via GIPHY There are two different audiences for this argument. Apple is aiming part of this messaging at investors, who are much money Apple can make by selling things like its gaming service, its news service, and whatever its video service is going to be . The other group is the people and companies Apple needs to partner with to make these services work, by supplying content and support for said services. Whether it works or not seems to depend on the audience. Magazine publishers for instance, seem happy to let Apple sell a bundle of their titles for $10 a month, and then divide up half of that fee among themselves. The theory is that the magazines have been unable to sell many digital subscriptions on their own, and that Apple could convert many millions of customers into subscribers, and that owning a small piece of a very big pie could be meaningful. Some back-of-the-laptop math I’ve been doing can illustrate the best-case scenario: Say Apple is able to find 10 million subscribers for Apple News Plus — around 20 percent of the paying audience it has signed up for Apple Music. After Apple took its cut, participating publishers would have $600 million in annual revenue to share among themselves. For context: Time Inc., which used to be the biggest magazine publisher in the US, probably generated around $800 million in subscription revenue in 2017. “A few hundred million dollars of incremental revenue for the publishers, if it scales, is worth the cannibalization risk,” says an industry executive who’s bullish on Apple’s plan and not very worried about people trading individual magazine subscriptions for Apple’s bundle.* On the other hand: The New York Times and the Washington Post are unswayed, for now, by Apple’s argument and are not participating.* You can see their logic: They are building meaningful digital subscription businesses on their own — the New York Times now has 3 million digital-only subscribers — and they’d rather keep all (or nearly all) of the money those subscriptions generate. (The papers have other reasons to sit out, too, including a reluctance to let Apple come between them and their customers.) You can see this playing out in other industries, too: Some very big, very successful video services, like HBO, Showtime, and Starz, are willing to let Apple sell subscriptions to their services directly to consumers. But Netflix, whose 139 million paying subscriber total is bigger than all three of those rivals combined, has no intention of participating in Apple’s bundle. “ Apple’s a great company. We want to have people watch our shows on our services ,” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in March. A totally separate question is whether Apple should be able to use its size to push out its own services, at the possible expense of rivals like Spotify and Netflix. Spotify doesn’t think so and has filed an antitrust complaint with European regulators. In the US, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren says she would stop Apple from running a store and selling its own services . But for now, doing both things is the core of Apple’s strategy. * Vox.com, which like this site is owned by Vox Media, is selling some of its content via Apple News Plus. recode_divider"

As the deadly disease appears in Congo, Sierra Leone is still counting the cost of its 2014 epidemic. Submit
Freetown, Sierra Leone, 2015. Image: Simon Davis/DFID, CC BY 2.0.
During the day, the streets of the Kissi district of eastern Freetown are perpetually crowded with pedestrians, as if a concert or soccer game has just finished. On either side of the road, in every available space, there are makeshift stalls selling mangos, grilled chicken feet, SIM cards, and second-hand clothes. There is a ceaseless soundtrack of trucks, animals, people and radios. The air is heavy with pollution from ancient taxis, and rubbish is heaped in rancid piles.
It is hard to imagine these streets empty and silent. Yet, for three days at a time, during the Ebola crisis of 2014-16, they were deserted. On several occasions, every one of Sierra Leone’s six million citizens was ordered to stay home, while 28,500 trained community workers and volunteers went door-to-door. They warned people to abandon their dangerous burial practices, thought to spread the disease, and they identified new cases. While the nation is no longer in a state of emergency, normality has not been fully restored.
There has been almost no coverage of the dismal legacy left by Ebola, or of how west Africa’s public health systems could cope in the event of another epidemic. Of those Sierra Leoneans who contracted it, 27% died. Many of those who recovered will endure problems with their hearing and vision for the rest of their lives. Moreover, they are stigmatised in a culture where superstition is widespread.
Four years after the outbreak, the disease has appeared in Congo, two thousand miles away. At the time of writing, nineteen people have died in the country’s Équateur province. Once more, international emergency response agencies are on alert, and the Western media is paying attention.
Sierra Leone government officials interviewed for this article are confident that their public health campaign has been effective, and that people will not be hesitant to seek medical advice for afflicted relatives, as some were four years ago. They say that the moment DRC reported the re-emergence of Ebola, Sierra Leone began a renewed “sensitization” effort. But, by the new president’s own admission, the country has an adult illiteracy rate of 60%, and a massively underfunded health system. How well will it cope?

In the aftermath of the outbreak, many have found themselves ostracised from their communities. Foday, 28, had to move away from his home district when his girlfriend, who he has a daughter with, died of Ebola; his family and neighbours shunned him because of what had happened to her. He is still struggling to find a job, despite his qualifications, because the shadow of Ebola hangs over him. Yet Foday is determined to help others. He is among a group of social workers, police and government officials being trained by Network for Africa, the NGO I started, to counsel traumatised survivors of Ebola and the country’s long-running civil war (1991-2002).
His colleague, Amadu, comments: “There isn’t a family in this country that wasn’t affected in one way or another by Ebola and the civil war.” His gap-toothed smile falters for a moment. “Actually, my dad died of malaria when he was 45. He worked so hard all his life, and I guess he didn’t have much resistance. He was gone within a few days.”
Also attending the counselling training is Marie, an official from the ministry of social welfare. Each day during the Ebola crisis, she collected children from the hospital green zone, where survivors were moved once they were well enough to leave the red treatment zone. The epidemic made orphans of thousands of children. Marie would trace any surviving relatives, assessing how likely it was the child would prosper with their extended family. In too many cases, she said, distant relatives regarded surviving children as either potential domestic slaves, or as possessed by evil spirits. Marie said it is still not unusual to find Ebola orphans hawking bottles of water on the streets of Freetown, having been sold to traffickers, or handed over to strangers who promised to provide education and lodging for the children.
The epidemic left the health system, such as it was, shattered. Before Ebola struck, there were only 136 doctors and 1,017 nurses serving six million people in an area the size of Scotland or South Carolina. It is thought that 488 health professionals died during the crisis. Emergency aid agencies left behind equipment, new clinics and more efficient systems. However, tackling harmful superstitions will require more than capacity building programmes and increased official accountability and transparency, to use the current aid industry jargon. Moreover, Sierra Leone’s other, less sensational, health challenges have not gone away.
Sierra Leone’s other, less sensational, health challenges have not gone away
Throughout the epidemic, there was often more international media coverage of the prospect of Ebola coming to the privileged white world, than of the horrors being faced by west Africans. The news mirrored our skewed view of Africa. Even at the worst points of the epidemic, more people in Sierra Leone were dying of malaria, TB, diarrhoea or pneumonia. For instance, there were 4,326 malaria deaths in 2013 alone, a typical year in Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), whereas 3,955 died of Ebola during the entire epidemic. The US Centers for Disease Control believes deaths from malaria actually rose during the crisis because people were afraid to go to health clinics for fear of contracting Ebola. Staff were also drawn away from ordinary duties leaving vulnerable people even more susceptible.
However, this “normal” death toll from tropical ailments, ravaging children younger than five in particular, is less newsworthy and dramatic than a spectacular haemorrhagic fever; just as war-torn Congo’s millions of displaced people get less attention than its new cases of Ebola. Why? Because there is less chance that we Westerners will be directly affected by either of those crisis. In addition, being reminded that devastating illnesses like malaria are easily and cheaply preventable might prompt some guilt and discomfort on our part.
Four years after the outbreak, international health agencies have understandably moved on to new emergencies elsewhere. Yet, what is clearly required is a long-term commitment to improving public health facilities and educating the population. A desperately poor country like Sierra Leone, its economy battered by the epidemic and the dwindling supply of minerals it exports, cannot achieve this by itself.
A draft World Health Organization report, leaked to the Associated Press , admitted that they had underestimated the difficulties caused by superstitious beliefs around Ebola. Development officials in the wealthy white world may resist acknowledging the power that belief in evil spirits still has in many countries receiving their aid; perhaps they are concerned that their taxpayers might be less sympathetic or tolerant. But our ubiquitous “sensitisation training” will fail if we ignore the fact that many people think Ebola (or disability for that matter) is a consequence of angry ancestors or an enemy’s curse. The further one travels from Freetown, to villages off the beaten track, the greater the need for sustained public health education and schooling in critical thinking.
Yusuf Kabba, of the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors, told the Christian Science Monitor that although massive resources poured in during the 2014-16 epidemic, most of them were taken away again afterwards. There are more ambulances now, but he believes the health system is still poorly equipped to handle the burden of a further outbreak. It is questionable whether the country can return to the war-footing necessary of its own accord.
Sierra Leone has recently elected a new government, committed to stamping out corruption, while building a sense of national identity and civic responsibility. A new communal rubbish collection day is wildly popular, and it is hard to find anyone expressing cynicism about the future direction of the country. President Bio promises to provide school uniforms and books, which may increase the number of children attending and staying in education. In the meantime, Sierra Leone’s people cannot be faulted for their resilience, resourcefulness and grace under pressure. Share this"
