Grammy-winning rapper Kanye West has announced he will be bringing a distinct Gospel twist to this year’s Coachella music festival. Announcing his “Sunday Service” show on a recent flight, West took the opportunity to reveal that the gig would coincide with Easter Sunday — something that will likely excite Ye’s church-going fan base.
Kanye’s music has, at times, contained a deep spiritual meaning. In the opening track of his 2016 album “The Life of Pablo,” a song titled, “Ultralight Beam,” West declared “Yes, God, We don’t want no devils in the house, God. We want the lord (Yes, Jesus) And that’s it.” The song featured well-known Gospel artist, Kirk Franklin.

West has opened up about his own faith journey in the past.
“If you start thinking about love and start feeling love and thinking about forgiveness, then you can overcome things … I think love conquers all,” he said previously, according to GodTV . “I know from the bottom of my soul, of my gut, of my spirit and my subconscious that love is the strongest force in the universe and right now we need love.”
One thing is for sure: those who are lucky enough to obtain a ticket to Coachella’s Sunday line-up are in for quite a treat. Variety Magazine describes West’s Sunday Service as “where spirituality and exclusivity meet.” COACHELLA 2019 SUNDY SERVICE EASTER SUNDAY pic.twitter.com/YxY86gguft

“We were out in Palm Springs and they took us to a little campground because we were thinking about a little performance in Palm Springs, just a little one,” Kanye said in a clip shared by the festival.

“Then they had a mountain, he had a mountain waiting for us,” Kanye added. “He had a date waiting for us. Only one date that mountain would be available to us: Easter Sunday at Coachella. That confirmation was confirmed last night.”"

Pleasant Baptist Church Thursday, April 4, 2019, in Opelousas, La. (Leslie Westbrook/The Advocate via AP)
The FBI, the ATF, and Louisiana state authorities are investigating a string of three ""suspicious"" fires at three historic African American church buildings in Louisiana's St. Landry Parish.
The first fire occurred on March 26 at the St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, and the second happened Tuesday when the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas caught fire. Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas caught fire on Thursday.
All three buildings, home to African American congregations, are located in rural areas and the fires happened at night. They were uninhabited at the time the fires occurred and no injuries were reported.
During a news conference Thursday, Fire Marshal H. ""Butch"" Browning said it wasn't clear whether the three fires are connected and he declined to get into specifics of what the investigation had yielded so far but described the blazes as ""suspicious.""
He asked if anyone saw anything to notify authorities.
""It's all about what people see,"" he told reporters. ""The best witness, the best evidence is an eyewitness. And I think that's what we want people to be, is aware of their surroundings and aware of something that might look suspicious that they don't think is suspicious.
Pastors from 10 area churches gathered Thursday to discuss the fires and show support for the affected churches, The Advocate newspaper reported. The pastors said all of the three buildings damaged by the fires were each over a century old.
Louisiana Congressman Clay Higgins posted this message, calling on the perpetrators to repent:
The Rev. Harry Richard of Greater Union Baptist Church told the newspaper that he doesn't want people to panic"".
""I don't know who's doing it or why they're doing it, but I don't want to be the one to inject race into it,"" he said.
The Rev. Gerald Toussaint of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church said he was crushed to see so much history go up in flames.
""It was heartbreaking,"" he said.
Rick Swanson, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette professor and civil rights researcher, told the newspaper if the St. Landry Parish fires turn out to be racially motivated, ""It would be very consistent with a pattern of terrorism used against black churches"" and black movements in the past.
The pastors all echoed one another in their support of each other, saying their congregations will only grow stronger through this tragedy.
""The church is still alive,"" Toussaint said. ""The building is gone, but we'll be back because we can't let the enemy win."""
US to Designate Iran Revolutionary Guard a Terrorist Group | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/us-to-designate-iran-revolutionary-guard-a-terrorist-group,"US Designates Iran Revolutionary Guard a Terrorist Group 04-07-2019 In this Sept. 21, 2016 file photo, Iran's Revolutionary Guard troops march in a military parade marking the 36th anniversary of Iraq's 1980 invasion of Iran.

The Trump Administration declared Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “foreign terrorist organization” on Monday.
The unprecedented move is the first time the United States has labeled another country’s military a terrorist group.
""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" President Trump said in a statement.
The IRGC was established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979.
According to the Council on Foreign Relations , Iran’s military numbers 125,000, is in charge of the nation’s missile and nuclear programs and controls a large slice of Iran’s economy.
The Trump administration hopes the declaration will diminish the IRGC’s financial resources and presence in the Middle East.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the designation comes with sanctions against the Islamic state, including a freeze on assets the IRGC may have in US jurisdictions and a ban on Americans doing business with the Guard.
The WSJ also reported that national security advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed for the move.
In February, Pompeo attended a US-led security conference in Poland that focused on deterring Iran’s influence in the region.
""You can't achieve peace and stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran,"" Pompeo said during the conference. ""It's just not possible (with) their malign influence in Lebanon, in Yemen, in Syria and Iraq.""
Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) said he supports the move in a statement.
“A formal designation and its consequences may be new, but these IRGC butchers have been terrorists for a long time,” Sasse said. . @BenSasse ’s statement on news that WH is preparing to designate IRGC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. pic.twitter.com/ne2Nin5ayF

Iranian leaders threatened to blacklist the United States as a terror entity if the US follows through on Monday’s designation.
“If the Revolutionary Guards are placed on America’s list of terrorist groups, we will put that country’s military on the terror blacklist next to Daesh (Islamic State),” Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, Iran’s head of parliament’s national security committee, said on Twitter.
The WSJ report said that senior Pentagon officials were uneasy about the move, fearing it could endanger US troops in the region.
The UC Central Command, which oversees US forces in the Middle East is reportedly planning to alert US troops in the upcoming days, just in case Iran or Shiite militias try to retaliate.
Reuters reports that Central Intelligence Agency and military officials are concerned the designation will open the US up to similar actions by hostile governments abroad.
It is unclear what impact the declaration will have on America’s activities in countries that have close ties with Iran."
Trump Accepts Resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen,www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/homeland-security-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-is-resigning,"Trump Accepts Resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen 04-07-2019 Associated Press Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 6, 2019, before the House Homeland Security Committee.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned on Sunday amid the administration’s growing frustration and bitterness over the number of Central American families crossing the southern border, two people familiar with the decision said.
President Donald Trump thanked her for her work in a tweet and announced U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would be taking over as acting head of the department. McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well-respected by members of Congress and within the administration. The decision to name an immigration officer to the post reflects Trump’s priority for a sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.
Though Trump aides were eyeing a staff shake-up at Homeland Security and had already withdrawn the nomination for another key immigration post, the development Sunday was unexpected.
Nielsen traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with Trump to participate in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed Trump’s comments on the situation at the border, though she ducked out of the room without explanation for some time while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers, Nielsen was at Trump’s side, introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward on a Coast Guard Gulfstream, as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.
But privately, she had grown increasingly frustrated by what she saw as a lack of support from other departments and increased meddling by Trump aides, the people said. She went into a meeting with Trump at the White House in Sunday not knowing whether she’d be fired or would resign, and she ended up resigning, they said.
Her resignation later, obtained by The Associated Press , had not a whiff of controversy, unlike others who have left from the administration.
“Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age, I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside,” she wrote. “I hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America’s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation’s discourse.”
There have been persistent tensions between the White House and Nielsen almost from the moment she became secretary, after her predecessor, John Kelly, became the White House chief of staff in 2017. Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides, particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller, both on matters around the border and others like protected status for some refugees. Once Kelly left the White House last year, Nielsen’s days appeared to be numbered. She had expected to be pushed out last November, but her exit never materialized. And during the government shutdown over Trump’s insistence for funding for a border wall, Nielsen’s stock inside the White House even appeared to rise.
But in recent weeks, as a new wave of migration has taxed resources along the border and as Trump sought to regain control of the issue for his 2020 re-election campaign, tensions flared anew.
Arrests all along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months. Border agents are on track to make 100,000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border this month, over half of which are families with children.
Nielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense and often said she believed the next major terror attack would occur online — not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following Russian interference during the 2016 election.
She dutifully pushed Trump’s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall, and defended the administration’s practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens “in the United States every day.” But she was also instrumental in ending the policy.
Under Nielsen, migrants seeking asylum are waiting in Mexico as their cases progress. She also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and facilities are at capacity.

BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) — The United States has temporarily withdrawn some of its forces from Libya due to “security conditions on the ground,” a top military official said Sunday as a Libyan commander’s forces advanced toward the capital of Tripoli and clashed with rival militias.
A small contingent of American troops has been in Libya in recent years, helping local forces combat Islamic State and al-Qaida militants, as well as protecting diplomatic facilities.
“The security realities on the ground in Libya are growing increasingly complex and unpredictable,” said Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the head of U.S. Africa Command. “Even with an adjustment of the force, we will continue to remain agile in support of existing U.S. strategy.”
He did not provide details on the number of U.S. troops that have been withdrawn or how many remain in the country.
Footage circulating online showed two apparent U.S. Navy transport craft maneuvering off a beach in Janzour, east of Tripoli, sending up plumes of spray as American forces were ferried from the shore.
India also evacuated a small contingent of peacekeepers. The Indian foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, said the country’s 15 Central Reserve Police Force peacekeepers were evacuated Saturday from Tripoli because the “situation in Libya has suddenly worsened” and fighting has moved into the capital city.
The self-styled Libyan National Army, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, launched a surprise offensive against the capital last week, a move that could potentially drag the country back into civil war. Libya has been gripped by unrest since the 2011 uprising that overthrew and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. In recent years, the country has been governed by rival authorities in the east and in Tripoli, in the west, each backed by various armed groups.
Fayez Sarraj, head of government in Tripoli, accused Hifter of “betraying” him.
“We have extended our hands towards peace, but after the aggression that has taken place on the part of forces belonging to Hifter and his declaration of war against our cities and our capital ... he will find nothing but strength and firmness,” al-Sarraj said Saturday in televised comments.
Sarraj and Hifter held talks in Abu Dhabi in late February, their first confirmed meeting since November 2018, when they agreed that national elections were necessary, according to the U.N.
Hifter is seeking to capture the capital and seize military control of the whole country before U.N.-sponsored talks due to start next week that were designed to set a time frame for possible elections in the oil-rich country.
The U.N. envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salame, said the U.N. is determined to hold the planned conference.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Libyan factions to return to negotiations, saying that “there is no military solution to the Libya conflict.”
“We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar’s forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,” Pompeo said in a statement.
Fighting was underway Sunday at the international airport, some 24 kilometers (15 miles) from central Tripoli, after Hifter claimed to have seized the area. The airport was destroyed in a previous bout of militia fighting in 2014. Hifter said his forces had launched airstrikes targeting rival militias on the outskirts of Tripoli.
The rival militias, which are affiliated with a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, said they had also carried out airstrikes, slowing Hifter’s advance.
Armed groups behind the U.N.-backed government of national accord, or GNA, have announced an effort to defend Tripoli, vowing to recapture all areas seized by Hifter’s forces.
Col. Mohamed Gnounou, a spokesman for GNA forces, said in televised comments Sunday that the counteroffensive, dubbed “Volcano of Anger,” was aimed at “purging all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces.”
The two sides reported that at least 35 people, including civilians, had been killed since Thursday.
The Health Ministry of the Tripoli-based government said in a statement that at least 21 people, including a physician, were killed and at least 27 wounded. Ahmed al-Mesmari, a spokesman for Hifter’s forces, said Saturday that 14 troops had been killed since the offensive began.
The fighting has displaced hundreds of people, the U.N. migration agency said. The U.N. mission to Libya called for a two-hour cease-fire on Sunday in parts of Tripoli to evacuate civilians and the wounded.
The LNA is supported by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, France and Russia. It answers to the authorities based in eastern Libya, who are at odds with the U.N.-backed government.

Hamas Leader: Israel Will be Forced to Evacuate Tel Aviv if There is a War,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/hamas-leader-israel-will-be-forced-to-evacuate-tel-aviv-if-there-is-a-war,"Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar warned Saturday that if there is a war between Israel and Gaza, Israel will be forced to evacuate Tel Aviv and Jewish communities on its southern border.
“If the Gaza Strip is dragged into war, Israel will suffer. It will not only have to evacuate the communities around the Strip, but also [the cities of] Ashdod and Ashkelon and even Tel Aviv,” Sinwar said, according to a report from Al-Aqsa TV.
“Our fingers are on the trigger and they will remain pressed against it in order to protect our people. We will be the sword and shield,” he continued.
Sinwar also thanked Egypt for brokering a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel on March 22 at 19:00 GMT. The cease-fire follows weeks of violent clashes sparked by Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli communities. One rocket struck a home in central Israel and injured several people.
Israel responded by destroying several Hamas targets in Gaza.
“We have strengthened our relations with Egypt,” Sinwar said of the ceasefire. “The Egyptians have thankfully played a big role in the easing of the restrictions.”
According to Hamas, the Egyptian-sponsored ceasefire included the expansion of Gaza’s fishing zone, the delivery of Qatari funds, and the reopening of the border crossings between the Gaza Strip and Israel.
The ceasefire came as Gazans commemorated the one-year anniversary of the “Great March of Return” which are weekly protests encouraged by Hamas officials on Israel’s southern border.
On Friday, more than 10,000 Gazans protested and rioted along the Gaza border.
Sinwar said the ceasefire agreement doesn’t include any plans to stop the weekly marches.
“The understandings are not an alternative to Palestinian unity and partnership,” the Hamas leader explained. “There is no talk about the Palestinian right to resistance in all its forms, especially in the West Bank. Also, there is no talk about halting the March of Return.”
Meanwhile, warned Hamas against any more violent attacks.
“We will do what is necessary to defend our people and to defend our state,"" Netyanhu said while addressing the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference in Washington D.C. last month."
Netanyahu Vows to Annex Jewish West Bank Settlements in Last-Minute Election Post,www.cbn.com,Chris Mitchell,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/netanyahu-vows-to-annex-jewish-west-bank-settlements-in-last-minute-election-post,"MA’ALE ADUMIM, Israel – Palestinian leaders condemned while others applauded Israeli ’s announcement that he would declare sovereignty over Israeli communities in the West Bank if he’s elected Israel’s next prime minister.
Netanyahu made the historic announcement just days before Israelis go to the polls to choose their next government.
""I will give sovereignty, but I don't differentiate between the settlement blocs and the isolated settlements, because from my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians … if we learnt anything, it is that when we abandon territories, Islamic extremism emerges immediately and slaughters us, and I won't give them the heart of the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said.
Netanyahu’s announcement means that large Jewish communities like Ma’ale Adumim and smaller ones in what is called the West Bank would be part of Israel in any future negotiations with the Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian leaders warned it would destroy the peace process.
""This is, at the end of the day, this is the scenario, and this is where they think they can dictate a solution by destroying the concept of two states,” said Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat.
While Erekat said the international criminal court should address the matter, some Israelis rejoiced.
“Great, to annex it. It belongs to the State of Israel. 42,000 people live here. We will not give up on this place. This will not be like Gaza, what was given back and now rockets fired at them, on Sderot, no. I am in favor of annexing it for the State of Israel,” said Ma’ale Adumin resident Israel Yehezkel.
Others doubted the move.
""There's nothing to be happy about, I don't believe Netanyahu or our mayor,” explained resident Pnina Levy.
The last-minute campaign push will likely win Netanyahu support among the right but whether he wins on Tuesday’s will be up to the rest of Israeli voters."
Turning 2020 Into a Battle About God and Gays?

Why Buttigieg Is Slamming VP Pence and Evangelicals 04-08-2019 Emily Jones Credit: Associated Press
Indiana mayor and possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg (pronounced Boot-uh- jij ) took a swipe at Vice President Mike Pence Sunday for his outspoken support of Biblical marriage.
Buttigieg, who is openly gay, told NBC News that his marriage to schoolteacher Chasten Buttigieg made him a better person. ""And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God,"" he said.
The vice president and his wife, Karen Pence, hold biblical views of marriage – a conviction that has been publicly scorned by the Left. Earlier this year, the second lady was criticized for teaching art at a Christian school that requires both students and faculty to affirm their adherence to biblical guidelines about sex.
Buttigieg said those who have a problem with him being married to another man should take their complaints to God.
""That's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: That if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me,"" Buttigieg said. ""Your quarrel, sir, is with my Creator.""
Buttigieg wasn't always so bold about his sexual identity. In fact, he described his struggle with same-sex attraction as ""a kind of war,"" especially in high school.
""If you could have offered me a pill that could make me straight, I would have swallowed it before you could give me a swig of water,"" Buttigieg said at the LGBTQ Victory Fund's annual brunch.
Today, Buttigieg says ""thank God"" there was no pill.
The mayor also took aim at evangelical Christians during NBC 's ""Meet the Press"" and accused them of being hypocritical for supporting President Donald Trump.
""It's something that really frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable,"" he said.
""Here, you have somebody who not only acts in a way that is not consistent with anything that I hear in scripture or in church, where it's about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers – which is another word for immigrants – and making sure that you're focusing your effort on the poor,"" Buttigieg continued.

He also pointed a finger of blame at Trump's past sexual scandals.
""I can't believe that somebody who was caught writing hush money checks to adult film actresses is somebody they should be lifting up as the kind of person you want to be leading this nation,"" Buttigieg said.
Buttigieg has yet to officially come out as a 2020 candidate but teased a ""special announcement"" coming April 14th. Join me in South Bend on April 14th for a special announcement: https://t.co/GfdYimuYN1 pic.twitter.com/aPFe08yGmW

"With Nielsen Out, Will Trump Turn Tougher to Fix Border Crisis?",www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/with-nielsen-out-will-trump-turn-tougher-to-fix-border-crisis,"With Nielsen Out, Will Trump Turn Tougher to Fix Border Crisis?
WASHINGTON - In a move that has been expected for months, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is stepping down.
Nielsen has struggled to control the flow of illegal immigration across the border. The president announced her departure via tweet Sunday. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019
Three days ago, with Nielsen by his side, the president visited the US-Mexico border and voiced his frustration.
""The system is full, and when it's full, there is nothing you can do about it. You have to say, 'I'm sorry, we can't take you,'"" Trump said.
Her temporary replacement is US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. His background is a sign the president sees immigration as the key component for the $40 billion Homeland Security Department.
In her resignation letter, Nielsen writes, ""I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation's discourse."" Its been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women of @DHSgov . I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service, dedication, and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazards. pic.twitter.com/lIQ5iqGDmF
— Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) April 7, 2019
Democrats on Capitol Hill seem happy she's gone, but expressed concern about harsher immigration policies to come.
""Secretary Nielsen oversaw a department that separated families at the border....I'm concerned by the reports that she is resigning because she was not extreme enough,"" tweeted Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD).
This all comes as record-setting numbers of migrants are coming over the southern border, redlining the border patrol's capability to handle them all.
Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM) told Fox News Sunday he believes the increase is from people legally seeking asylum.
""When the Department of Homeland security is reporting these numbers, I don't believe they are accurately describing these with the number of people that are turning themselves in versus those who are being apprehended,"" he explained.
Republicans say the policy allowing asylum seekers to stay in the country while their cases are heard is part of the problem.
""We're seeing unaccompanied young people as well as families with lots of kids, pouring into our border and they say the magic word 'I'm seeking asylum',"" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) told Meet the Press.
""We don't begin to have the space in our facilities to maintain the kind of care these people deserve….It's going to take some legislation to get it fixed,"" he continued.
McAleenan joins a growing list of ""acting"" department heads stepping in to fill Trump administration vacancies at ICE, the Pentagon, and the White House Chief of Staff.
The ""flexibility"" is something the president has said he likes."
'The Only Thing that Is Eternal Is Jesus': These Players Win and Lose with Grace in NCAA Tourney,www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/the-only-thing-that-is-eternal-is-jesus-these-players-win-and-lose-with-grace-in-ncaa-tourney,"NewsBlock_9AM_040819_HD1080_1590.995_1926.346 6023992325001 'The Only Thing that Is Eternal Is Jesus': These Players Win and Lose with Grace in NCAA Tourney
MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota - One year ago, the Virginia Cavaliers were on the wrong end of the biggest upset in college basketball history. Now they're one win away from redemption.
Tonight, it's UVA against Texas Tech with a national NCAA title on the line. But players from all the Final Four teams say they aren't just here to play basketball. In the 2019 Final Four over the weekend, it was Virginia vs. Auburn and Michigan State vs. Texas Tech after all four teams had battled round after round to get here for a shot at the national title.
But after an exhilarating Saturday night of basketball filled with big shots and controversial calls, Virginia and Texas Tech emerged as winners to play face off Monday night for the National Championship.
Auburn and Michigan State may be headed home, but players from all four teams agree that win or lose, God still has a plan for their lives. The Auburn Tigers had a historic run during this year's NCAA tournament, becoming the only team to beat Kansas, North Carolina, and Kentucky back-to-back to make it to the Final Four - their first in school history. Though they fell just shy of advancing to the championship game, they still give God the glory for the opportunity.
Auburn Forward Thomas Collier said, ""My sole purpose on the earth is to glorify God. And having faith in Christ, like you want to work as hard as you possibly can for the Lord. You know, that doesn't mean God will bless you with a win. Do our part play 100 percent and God will have a perfect plan for you.""
Auburn Guard J'Von McCormick said, ""In the lows and the highs... just know that He's going to be there for you, and you just got to give glory to God.""
FAITHWIRE: ‘It Was God’s Plan’: Auburn Coach Praises God Following Final Four 63-62 Loss
Michigan State did what many thought would be near impossible for any team - defeat Zion Williamson and the Duke Blue Devils to get here. A lot of their motivation came from sophomore Guard Joshua Langford who was injured earlier this season. He's relied heavily on his faith to keep things in perspective and to help inspire his teammates from the bench.
""Because of my belief in God, it's allowed me to have a good foundation,"" Langford said. ""Throughout the whole process, I've just been trying to figure out what else God has placed inside of me, and I feel like that's you know, my voice. That's a gift from Him and I've been using it and trying to help for the team.""
Michigan State Forward Gabe Brown said, ""I believe God works in mysterious ways and in each way possible, so for me to go out there, He's given me the ability to play out there. So I thank him every time I step on the court because I know one day it could be taken away.""
During the 2018 NCAA tournament, UVA made history, but for the wrong reason, when they lost to UMBC, becoming the first #1 seed to get knocked out in the first round. But redemption came this season because now they're playing for a national championship. It's a story that began with Head Coach Tony Bennett and five biblical pillars.
""There's a verse that says always be prepared to give a reason for the hope that you have but do it with gentleness and respect,"" Bennett said. ""I think that's what you have to do. I know what my hope is for me. I know what my life is grounded on. There's nothing that touches it. It's a joy that's unspeakable.""
""And when you have players, our program is built on pillars, five - they're actually biblical pillars,"" he said. ""I'm always respectful, whether they believe that or not, they're wisdom for our program: Humility - do you know who you are as a team and as a player? Passion - do you play with passion? Unity - being part of something bigger than yourself. Servanthood - the way to greatness is through being a servant. And thankfulness. We use those for our team specifically. And again, you always hope that through sports they become better players and young men, and they'll always return what you just model to them.""
Virginia Guard Kyle Guy has been a shooting rock star throughout the tournament. During the gritty match against Auburn, his skill was on center stage when he had to make three free throws with the game on the line after he was fouled trying to make a 3-point jumper for the win. Every kid dreams of moments like that. After preparation meets opportunity, Kyle says he leaves everything else in God's hands.
""I would not be here without Him. I always shower before games and that's kind of how I get my mind right, say a little prayer or whatever. I always obviously with everything I've been through and this team's been through, I'm always praying…I want to win more than anything. But I know Your plan is greater so that's something I can hang my hat on,"" he says.
Who would've thought that Texas Tech would be playing UVA in the championship game? Most probably didn't. But the Red Raiders have shown resilience the entire tournament. For some of them, that tenacity and focus stem from a shared faith in Jesus Christ.
FAITHWIRE: Texas Tech Star Was Playing the Absolute Perfect Worship Song When He Found Out He Was Player of the Year
Texas Tech Forward Norense Odiose said, ""My father's a pastor and so is Jacoby's dad. I just grew up in a household where God is the center of everything that we do. Back home…we get up at 5 a.m. to pray and have our quiet time before we start our day. Just having a good relationship with Christ, it just fuels me and it keeps me going.""
Matt Mooney had a big game against Michigan State. The sharp-shooter dropped 22 points against the Spartans including four 3-pointers. He says that's his way to glorify the name of Lord.
Mooney said, ""Number one is my faith. At the end of the day, basketball is not eternal. The only thing that is eternal is Jesus. You can't take money or basketball when you die, so you know I'm blessed, and I try to play for an audience of one when I get out there."""
"'I Can Clearly Feel that I Am Black': White Couple Identifies as Black, Claims Children Will Be Black Too",www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/i-can-clearly-feel-that-i-am-black-white-couple-identifies-as-black-claims-children-will-be-black-too,"Homepage CWN News CBNNews.com 'I Can Clearly Feel that I Am Black': White Couple Identifies as Black, Claims Children Will Be Black Too 04-08-2019 Benjamin Gill and Steve Warren Martina Big and Michael Eurwen. (Screenshot courtesy: This Morning/YouTube)
The escalating global debate over genetic identity has taken on a new twist. In recent years, the DNA debate has centered around sexuality with individuals making headlines claiming to be non-binary and transgender.
Athletes who were born male but now claim to be female have been winning in sports competitions against young women who were actually born with female genes.
College students and even younger students have been caught up in the ""transmania"" and have decided to change sexes, including having body parts removed in order to change to a new identity.
Now there's a couple who were born white, but they say they're changing to become black.
The Daily Mail reports the couple were married last October in Hawaii and said they identified as black.
Martina Big, 30, from Germany, and Michael Eurwen, 31, appeared on the UK's television program ""This Morning"" to talk about their so-called change in race. They both underwent injections using Melanotan, a synthetic hormone, to darken the skin.
Big claims the darkening of her skin came only after three injections of the hormone. She even told the baffled interviewers their DNA will be changed too, saying their doctors told them their kids would be born black.
One of the hosts of the show pressed her further on her DNA claim.
""If that baby is not black, because I'm trying to understand how genetically this would be possible, will you still be close to them if you give birth to a white baby?"" the interviewer asked.
""Of course - it will be a mix of me and Micheal,"" Big replied, ""but I'm pretty sure it will be black, but if it is milk chocolate or a little bit lighter it doesn't matter.""
""I can clearly feel that I am black – but it's hard to find the right words to describe it,"" Big said.
Big even traveled to Kenya last year to be baptized as ""a real African woman.""
In a post to her Facebook page at that time she wrote: ""One of my Kenyan friends told her pastor about my transformation to a black woman and told him how much I wanted to become a true African woman.""
Twitter users who are fans of the show questioned the alleged genetic change the couple claims will happen.
""I'm so sorry, but no amount of cosmetic changes will affect your genetics. If you were born white, your children will be white. I think Martina needs to find a new doctor,"" one user wrote.
Another user challenged the couple's claim of changing races.
""I've had tanning injections, now I'm a black person, is the equivalent of saying I've drank a glass of water and am now fireproof before running into a burning building while naked,"" a user named Kim wrote .
This is not the first time someone has claimed to be black, but was actually genetically white and had the parents to prove it.
Probably the most headline-grabbing story in recent years was that of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who for years passed as black even while serving as president of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the NAACP.
Her parents came forward in June 2015 to expose her as white to a local television station. She lost her job and last year was charged with welfare fraud.
On April 5, Dolezal, who now calls herself Nkechi Diallo, agreed to a plea deal on those charges, according to The Spokesman-Review .
Medical researchers have tried to come up with various explanations for why people want to change racial identifications. So far, the jury is still out on the psychological consequences of such an action.
Meanwhile, in the US there appears to be less questioning of the explanations for why people say their sexual identity has been changed. But numerous people who had changed their gender have now come forward to say it was a mistake. Read more about that below:

The pro-life movie ""Unplanned"" finished in the top 10 at the box office for the second weekend in a row, overcoming an ""R"" rating and what the film's supporters have called a media blackout.
Now, media outlets are calling the movie's success a surprise. ""Unplanned"" – which is centered on the life of former Planned Parenthood Director Abby Johnson –brought in $3.2 million on its second weekend after 471 more theaters added the film to their showings. The movie made $6,110,000 when it debuted last weekend.
So far, it's earned more than $12 million, doubling the $6 million production budget.
Johnson is rejoicing at the increased attention the movie is bringing to the pro-life movement. ""Unplanned is a train that can't be stopped!!!"" she tweeted.

As CBN News has reported, the film depicts Johnson's emotional decision to quit her Planned Parenthood job after watching an ultrasound-guided abortion.
""It's a little surreal, if I'm honest, to watch someone play out the worst version of yourself in a film,"" Johnson told CBN News during an interview on the set of the film.
""But it's also just a good reminder that God can literally use anything from our past and use it for His glory and use it for His kingdom,"" she added.
Ashley Bratcher, who played Johnson in the movie, has shared her own ""unplanned"" story on Instagram. In a picture with her nine-year-old son, she writes that she used to be ""a very young, struggling, unwed, jobless mother.""
""My unplanned baby turned nine just a few weeks ago,"" she wrote. ""My high school sweetheart and I could barely make ends meet when he was born. I was on Medicaid and WIC and it wasn't uncommon to see our bank account in the red. Was it hard? Absolutely.""
""But the best things in life are worth fighting for and this little man has taught my husband and I more than any other human,"" she added. ""Having our son empowered us, it made us better people. We learned to love unconditionally.""
""Today, this little dude is my Star Wars binge watching partner, my Mario Kart compadre, and most importantly my little prayer warrior,"" she continued. ""He wants to be an architectural engineer, loves science and drawing comics. He continues to teach us so much about life every day. ""
""I'm so so so proud of this little human and the incredible boy he is becoming,"" she concluded. ""As long as my God holds the world in His hands, I know that there's no such thing as Unplanned.""
Bratcher shared on Twitter that she hopes her own story will encourage other women.
""I was pretty vulnerable this past week in sharing about my own Unplanned pregnancy,"" Bratcher tweeted. ""I hope that my story will encourage other women and serve as a reminder of how empowering it is to be a mother."" I was pretty vulnerable this past week in sharing about my own Unplanned pregnancy.

Mystery Disease ID'd as 'Urgent Threat' by CDC,www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/mystery-disease-idd-as-urgent-threat-by-cdc,"Mystery Disease ID'd as 'Urgent Threat' by CDC 04-08-2019 Christian Ellis
A mystery disease that's often hard to detect is now being labeled an ""urgent threat"" by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fungus ""candida auris"" hit several countries around the world over the last five years and was recently found in New York, New Jersey and Illinois.
According to the CDC, it is ""multidrug-resistant"" and called a ""mystery"" because it is difficult to identify with standard lab tests. The results have been damaging as it has spread throughout several healthcare facilities without medical officials being aware.
The New York Times reports an elderly man admitted into a Brooklyn hospital last year for an abdominal surgery was found to have the new deadly germ after a blood test was taken. Doctors immediately isolated him in the intensive care unit, but the germ had already spread across the room. The hospital required special cleaning equipment and had to remove some of the ceiling and floor tiles.
""Everything was positive — the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,"" said Dr. Scott Lorin, president of the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital. ""The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.""
There weren't any anti-fungal medicines able to stop it. As a result, just like many others who contract the illness it causes, the man died within 90 days.
The CDC reports 587 cases of people having C. auris, with 309 in New York, 104 in New Jersey and 144 in Illinois. In Chicago, some nursing homes have indicated at least 50 percent of their residents have tested positive for the virus.
Researchers have identified certain fungi and bacteria that are morphing to defend themselves against modern medicines.
""It's an enormous problem,"" said Matthew Fisher, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London. ""We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals.""
The symptoms include fever, aches, and fatigue. However, if the person's immune system is weak, these types of infection often lead to death. Resistant germs called ""superbugs"" have been known to be most deadly to people with weak immune systems such as newborns, elderly, smokers, diabetics and people with autoimmune disorders who utilize steroids that limit their body's defenses.
Unless new, more effective medicines are found, the risk of more infections will drastically increase. The Times reports one study which predicts 10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050 if scientists are not able to combat the increase of drug resistance.
Some scientists have identified evidence that the massive use of fungicides on crops has been a huge contributor to the increase in drug-resistant fungi infecting humans."
'The Violent Type of People': Drug Cartels Taking Advantage of Migrant Tidal Wave Distraction,www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/the-violent-type-of-people-drug-cartels-taking-advantage-of-migrant-tidal-wave-distraction,"Drugs seized at the US-Mexico border (Photo: screen capture) 6023927888001 'The Violent Type of People': Drug Cartels Taking Advantage of Migrant Tidal Wave Distraction
NEW MEXICO'S SOUTHERN BORDER - US Customs and Border Protection shut down a border crossing Saturday between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas, saying the crisis of migrants crossing illegally requires the agency to deploy its agents along the unguarded border fence.
But in nearby New Mexico, the risks to America go even beyond the flood of illegal immigration.
As the tidal wave of migrants at the southern border dominates the attention of authorities, cartels are using the distraction to ship record amounts of drugs into the US. So far this fiscal year, seizures of cocaine along the border are on pace to triple last year's totals.
The Johnson family has been ranching 160,000 acres of the New Mexico desert for four generations.
Joe Johnson tells CBN News, ""Well my grandfather came here in 1918, and we've been here 101 years this year.""
He's seen the makeup of illegal border crossers change over the years. ""I think what we have coming through us is the violent type of people... More drug traffic.""
""This right here is what the border patrol calls nineteen canyon. And we've been told many times we ought to stay out of here because of the danger. But we can't. We have to keep an eye on our border.""
And here that's nothing more than a barbed wire fence, built by these ranchers more than 40 years ago. But drug runners cut the fence and drive in with thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, and other dangerous drugs.
That's not the only problem facing the Johnsons. From theft to disease, their cattle and livelihood are being put at risk.
Joe says, ""This is all that's keeping us apart right now. And we've had people coming out of Mexico and stealing our cattle.""
Joe's son Russell says not having a border barrier costs them plenty. ""We experience a lot of sickness from all these groups coming through running cattle off the water, sending the cow one way and the calf the other way....and they were breaking out into pasturella pneumonia which is a stress-induced disease that, if not caught within 24-48 hours, they are dead,"" Russell says.
And these risks extend to the entire US food chain. The United States hasn't had an outbreak of Hoof and Mouth disease since the 1920s. But it's still common here in Central and South America.
""These people coming from way south could be carrying hoof and mouth on their feet. And we're told that can last a couple of weeks I believe on someone's feet,"" Joe says.
A government report last month exposed the significant threat. It shows the US would be unable to quickly handle an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease, as there's not enough vaccine to treat all the American cattle and swine at risk. That could cost more than $19 billion in lost exports alone.

Judge Warns: No Right to 'Visual Bodily Privacy' for High School Girls,www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/judge-warns-no-right-to-visual-bodily-privacy-for-high-school-girls,"Judge Warns: No Right to 'Visual Bodily Privacy' for High School Girls 04-08-2019 Steve Warren (Image: Adobe Stock)
After a three-year legal battle, a federal judge for the Northern District of Illinois has ruled a lawsuit can proceed against an Illinois school district that said it was OK for high school transgender students to use girls' locker rooms, restrooms, and showers.
But the court's decision wasn't all good news for the families who are fighting to protect their children's safety and privacy. The College Fix reports the judge also took a swipe at individual privacy rights, ruling the girls have no right to ""visual bodily privacy"" if the government says so.
As CBN News reported , dozens of families joined in the lawsuit against Chicago-area Township High School District 211 back in 2016 because of the district's policy of letting children as young as 14 choose to use the locker rooms of the opposite sex without informing parents.
The district opened the girls' locker room to a boy after the Obama administration's Department of Education threatened the district's federal funding.
Under the Trump administration, the agency rescinded the Obama administration's attempt to rewrite federal law and restored the understanding that, under Title IX, ""sex"" means male or female and not one's beliefs about their gender.
The 1972 federal law prohibits schools from discriminating ""on the basis of sex,"" which for more than 40 years has meant being male or female. Title IX's existing regulations specifically state that a school receiving federal funds can ""provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex"" without putting that funding at risk.
US District Judge Jorge Alonso ruled the Title IX and religious freedom claims can go forward in the lawsuit.
Tom Petersen, director of community relations for the district, emphasized that ""only three"" of the five claims in the lawsuit are going forward.
""The District will continue to defend our practices that affirm and support the identity of all our students,"" he wrote in an email to The College Fix .
The families are represented by attorneys for the Alliance Defending Freedom .
""We need a compassionate approach to protecting students' privacy, and we welcome the court's decision to allow key claims to move forward,"" ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb said in a press release. ""The district officially authorizes opposite-sex use of school privacy facilities, and that violates Title IX. Letting boys into girls' showers, restrooms, and locker rooms is sexual harassment. Students should be confident that their school will protect their privacy and dignity. So far, this school district has failed to do so."""
"With Nielsen Out, Will Trump Turn Tougher to Fix Border Crisis?",www.cbn.com,Amber C. Strong,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/with-nielsen-out-will-trump-turn-tougher-to-fix-border-crisis,"WASHINGTON - In a move that has been expected for months, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is stepping down.
Nielsen has struggled to control the flow of illegal immigration across the border. The president announced her departure via tweet Sunday.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019
Three days ago, with Nielsen by his side, the president visited the US-Mexico border and voiced his frustration.
""The system is full, and when it's full, there is nothing you can do about it. You have to say, 'I'm sorry, we can't take you,'"" Trump said.
Her temporary replacement is US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. His background is a sign the president sees immigration as the key component for the $40 billion Homeland Security Department.
In her resignation letter, Nielsen writes, ""I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation's discourse.""
Its been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women of @DHSgov . I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service, dedication, and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazards. pic.twitter.com/lIQ5iqGDmF
— Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) April 7, 2019
Democrats on Capitol Hill seem happy she's gone, but expressed concern about harsher immigration policies to come.
""Secretary Nielsen oversaw a department that separated families at the border....I'm concerned by the reports that she is resigning because she was not extreme enough,"" tweeted Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD).
This all comes as record-setting numbers of migrants are coming over the southern border, redlining the border patrol's capability to handle them all.
Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM) told Fox News Sunday he believes the increase is from people legally seeking asylum.
""When the Department of Homeland security is reporting these numbers, I don't believe they are accurately describing these with the number of people that are turning themselves in versus those who are being apprehended,"" he explained.
Republicans say the policy allowing asylum seekers to stay in the country while their cases are heard is part of the problem.
""We're seeing unaccompanied young people as well as families with lots of kids, pouring into our border and they say the magic word 'I'm seeking asylum',"" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) told Meet the Press.
""We don't begin to have the space in our facilities to maintain the kind of care these people deserve….It's going to take some legislation to get it fixed,"" he continued.
McAleenan joins a growing list of ""acting"" department heads stepping in to fill Trump administration vacancies at ICE, the Pentagon, and the White House Chief of Staff.
The ""flexibility"" is something the president has said he likes."
Turning 2020 Into a Battle About God and Gays? Why Buttigieg Is Slamming VP Pence and Evangelicals,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/turning-2020-into-a-battle-about-god-and-gays-why-buttigieg-is-slamming-vp-pence-and-evangelicals,"Indiana mayor and possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg (pronounced Boot-uh- jij ) took a swipe at Vice President Mike Pence Sunday for his outspoken support of Biblical marriage.
Buttigieg, who is openly gay, told NBC News that his marriage to schoolteacher Chasten Buttigieg made him a better person. ""And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God,"" he said.
The vice president and his wife, Karen Pence, hold biblical views of marriage – a conviction that has been publicly scorned by the Left. Earlier this year, the second lady was criticized for teaching art at a Christian school that requires both students and faculty to affirm their adherence to biblical guidelines about sex.
Buttigieg said those who have a problem with him being married to another man should take their complaints to God.
""That's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: That if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me,"" Buttigieg said. ""Your quarrel, sir, is with my Creator.""
Buttigieg wasn't always so bold about his sexual identity. In fact, he described his struggle with same-sex attraction as ""a kind of war,"" especially in high school.
""If you could have offered me a pill that could make me straight, I would have swallowed it before you could give me a swig of water,"" Buttigieg said at the LGBTQ Victory Fund's annual brunch.
Today, Buttigieg says ""thank God"" there was no pill.
The mayor also took aim at evangelical Christians during NBC 's ""Meet the Press"" and accused them of being hypocritical for supporting President Donald Trump.
""It's something that really frustrates me because the hypocrisy is unbelievable,"" he said.
""Here, you have somebody who not only acts in a way that is not consistent with anything that I hear in scripture or in church, where it's about lifting up the least among us and taking care of strangers – which is another word for immigrants – and making sure that you're focusing your effort on the poor,"" Buttigieg continued.

He also pointed a finger of blame at Trump's past sexual scandals.
""I can't believe that somebody who was caught writing hush money checks to adult film actresses is somebody they should be lifting up as the kind of person you want to be leading this nation,"" Buttigieg said.
Buttigieg has yet to officially come out as a 2020 candidate but teased a ""special announcement"" coming April 14th.

Now, media outlets are calling the movie's success a surprise. ""Unplanned"" – which is centered on the life of former Planned Parenthood Director Abby Johnson –brought in $3.2 million on its second weekend after 471 more theaters added the film to their showings. The movie made $6,110,000 when it debuted last weekend.
So far, it's earned more than $12 million, doubling the $6 million production budget.
Johnson is rejoicing at the increased attention the movie is bringing to the pro-life movement. ""Unplanned is a train that can't be stopped!!!"" she tweeted. ""In the @nypost today!! #unplannedmovie.""

As CBN News has reported, the film depicts Johnson's emotional decision to quit her Planned Parenthood job after watching an ultrasound-guided abortion.
""It's a little surreal, if I'm honest, to watch someone play out the worst version of yourself in a film,"" Johnson told CBN News during an interview on the set of the film.
""But it's also just a good reminder that God can literally use anything from our past and use it for His glory and use it for His kingdom,"" she added.
Ashley Bratcher, who played Johnson in the movie, has shared her own ""unplanned"" story on Instagram. In a picture with her nine-year-old son, she writes that she used to be ""a very young, struggling, unwed, jobless mother.""
""My unplanned baby turned nine just a few weeks ago,"" she wrote. ""My high school sweetheart and I could barely make ends meet when he was born. I was on Medicaid and WIC and it wasn't uncommon to see our bank account in the red. Was it hard? Absolutely.""
""But the best things in life are worth fighting for and this little man has taught my husband and I more than any other human,"" she added. ""Having our son empowered us, it made us better people. We learned to love unconditionally.""
""Today, this little dude is my Star Wars binge watching partner, my Mario Kart compadre, and most importantly my little prayer warrior,"" she continued. ""He wants to be an architectural engineer, loves science and drawing comics. He continues to teach us so much about life every day. ""
""I'm so so so proud of this little human and the incredible boy he is becoming,"" she concluded. ""As long as my God holds the world in His hands, I know that there's no such thing as Unplanned.""
Bratcher shared on Twitter that she hopes her own story will encourage other women.
""I was pretty vulnerable this past week in sharing about my own Unplanned pregnancy,"" Bratcher tweeted. ""I hope that my story will encourage other women and serve as a reminder of how empowering it is to be a mother.""

"Euthanasia Becoming ""Default Way to Die"" in Belgium",www.cbn.com,Dale Hurd,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/euthanasia-becoming-default-way-to-die-in-belgium,"BRUSSELS – Belgium has long been famous for food, like waffles and chocolate. But it's becoming famous for death.
Belgium has the most liberal euthanasia laws in the world. You can end your life here by simply telling a doctor that you have unbearable physical or mental suffering.
Terminally ill children of any age can receive a lethal injection if their parents agree with the child's wishes.
Woman Euthanized for Being 'Incurably Depressed'
The mother of Belgian university professor Tom Mortier was euthanized in 2012 because, even though she was physically healthy, she was said to be ""incurably depressed.""
""My mother, who was physically healthy, because of her mental problems, received a lethal injection from an oncologist,"" Mortier said.
It was done without his or the family's knowledge. He was contacted by the hospital the day after his mother was killed.
""My mother had a severe mental problem,"" Mortier explained, ""She had to cope with depression throughout her life. She was treated for years by psychiatrists, and the contact between us was broken. A year later, she received a lethal injection.""
Mortier filed a complaint with the medical board and then with a Belgian prosecutor but was turned away. With the help of Alliance Defending Freedom , Mortier appealed his case to the European Court of Human Rights, which has agreed to hear it.
""How can someone like that be euthanized in a democratic western country without the family members even being aware that it was happening?"" asks Mortier's legal counsel Robert Clarke, Director of European Advocacy at ADF International.
Clarke says something that makes the Mortier case even more disturbing is that the doctor who euthanized the woman sits on the very government body that is supposed to oversee the euthanasia law.
The doctor, Wims Distelmans, who some have compared to the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian, once led a euthanasia tour of Auschwitz under the theme ""death with dignity.""
Distelmans co-chairs Belgium's euthanasia commission.
""So, we have a significant conflict of interest where someone is essentially acting as judge and executioner in his own cases,"" Clarke said.
Belgian Euthanasia Commission Accused of Violating the Law
A member of Distelmans' euthanasia commission resigned after the commission failed to act against a doctor who euthanized a dementia patient without consent. Dr. Ludo Van Opdenbosch wrote, ""I do not want to be part of a committee that deliberately violates the law.""
Clarke says, ""There are now more than 13,000 euthanasia cases that this commission has reviewed. And in those 13,000 I'm aware of now one which has been referred to the prosecutor.""
When Belgium passed its law legalizing euthanasia, critics warned that it was headed down an ethical slippery slope. Some wonder if the European nation may have hit bottom, as medical ethics are being replaced by a culture of death.
Euthanasia Now a ""Medical Solution"" in Belgium
Oncologist Benoit Beuselinck at University Hospitals-Leuven says, ""We have begun to offer death as a medical solution, even for non-terminal cases. It's a problem. I have heard about people who were offered euthanasia even though they were not even considering it.""
""The types of conditions, the things that would qualify someone for euthanasia, are being pushed further and further out, Clarke says, ""There were euthanasias carried out on children as young as 17, 11 and nine.""
Professor of Health care Ethics, Dr. Theo Boer says, ""The supply of euthanasia stirs the demand. What you see is that for an increasing number of people, euthanasia becomes the default way to die.""
Belgium Now ""Pushing"" Patients Off Proverbial Bridge
""When we find someone who is requesting to die, who's standing on the proverbial edge of a bridge, and instead of trying to talk them down the state is pushing them off,"" Clarke says.
And Clarke believes Belgium is now the ultimate cautionary tale for any nation that wants to legalize euthanasia, ""I think we have to ask ourselves – is that the kind of society that we want to live in? Or do we want to live in a society with laws that say that vulnerable life should be protected and that all life, no matter what stage, no matter the health of the person, has dignity and value?"""
"'I Can Clearly Feel that I Am Black': White Couple Identifies as Black, Claims Children Will Be Black Too",www.cbn.com,Benjamin Gill and Steve Warren,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/i-can-clearly-feel-that-i-am-black-white-couple-identifies-as-black-claims-children-will-be-black-too,"The escalating global debate over genetic identity has taken on a new twist. In recent years, the DNA debate has centered around sexuality with individuals making headlines claiming to be non-binary and transgender.
Athletes who were born male but now claim to be female have been winning in sports competitions against young women who were actually born with female genes.
College students and even younger students have been caught up in the ""transmania"" and have decided to change sexes, including having body parts removed in order to change to a new identity.
Now there's a couple who were born white, but they say they're changing to become black.
The Daily Mail reports the couple were married last October in Hawaii and said they identified as black.
Martina Big, 30, from Germany, and Michael Eurwen, 31, appeared on the UK's television program ""This Morning"" to talk about their so-called change in race. They both underwent injections using Melanotan, a synthetic hormone, to darken the skin.
Big claims the darkening of her skin came only after three injections of the hormone. She even told the baffled interviewers their DNA will be changed too, saying their doctors told them their kids would be born black.
One of the hosts of the show pressed her further on her DNA claim.
""If that baby is not black, because I'm trying to understand how genetically this would be possible, will you still be close to them if you give birth to a white baby?"" the interviewer asked.
""Of course - it will be a mix of me and Micheal,"" Big replied, ""but I'm pretty sure it will be black, but if it is milk chocolate or a little bit lighter it doesn't matter.""
""I can clearly feel that I am black – but it's hard to find the right words to describe it,"" Big said.
Big even traveled to Kenya last year to be baptized as ""a real African woman.""
In a post to her Facebook page at that time Quote: : ""One of my Kenyan friends told her pastor about my transformation to a black woman and told him how much I wanted to become a true African woman.""
Twitter users who are fans of the show questioned the alleged genetic change the couple claims will happen.
""I'm so sorry, but no amount of cosmetic changes will affect your genetics. If you were born white, your children will be white. I think Martina needs to find a new doctor,"" one user wrote.
Another user challenged the couple's claim of changing races.
""I've had tanning injections, now I'm a black person, is the equivalent of saying I've drank a glass of water and am now fireproof before running into a burning building while naked,"" a user named Kim wrote .
This is not the first time someone has claimed to be black, but was actually genetically white and had the parents to prove it.
Probably the most headline-grabbing story in recent years was that of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who for years passed as black even while serving as president of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the NAACP.
Her parents came forward in June 2015 to expose her as white to a local television station. She lost her job and last year was charged with welfare fraud.
On April 5, Dolezal, who now calls herself Nkechi Diallo, agreed to a plea deal on those charges, according to The Spokesman-Review .
Medical researchers have tried to come up with various explanations for why people want to change racial identifications. So far, the jury is still out on the psychological consequences of such an action.
Meanwhile, in the US there appears to be less questioning of the explanations for why people say their sexual identity has been changed. But numerous people who had changed their gender have now come forward to say it was a mistake. Read more about that below:

Mystery Disease ID'd as 'Urgent Threat' by CDC,www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/mystery-disease-idd-as-urgent-threat-by-cdc,"A mystery disease that's often hard to detect is now being labeled an ""urgent threat"" by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fungus ""candida auris"" hit several countries around the world over the last five years and was recently found in New York, New Jersey and Illinois.
According to the CDC, it is ""multidrug-resistant"" and called a ""mystery"" because it is difficult to identify with standard lab tests. The results have been damaging as it has spread throughout several healthcare facilities without medical officials being aware.
The New York Times reports an elderly man admitted into a Brooklyn hospital last year for an abdominal surgery was found to have the new deadly germ after a blood test was taken. Doctors immediately isolated him in the intensive care unit, but the germ had already spread across the room. The hospital required special cleaning equipment and had to remove some of the ceiling and floor tiles.
""Everything was positive — the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,"" said Dr. Scott Lorin, president of the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital. ""The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.""
There weren't any anti-fungal medicines able to stop it. As a result, just like many others who contract the illness it causes, the man died within 90 days.
The CDC reports 587 cases of people having C. auris, with 309 in New York, 104 in New Jersey and 144 in Illinois. In Chicago, some nursing homes have indicated at least 50 percent of their residents have tested positive for the virus.
Researchers have identified certain fungi and bacteria that are morphing to defend themselves against modern medicines.
""It's an enormous problem,"" said Matthew Fisher, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London. ""We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals.""
The symptoms include fever, aches, and fatigue. However, if the person's immune system is weak, these types of infection often lead to death. Resistant germs called ""superbugs"" have been known to be most deadly to people with weak immune systems such as newborns, elderly, smokers, diabetics and people with autoimmune disorders who utilize steroids that limit their body's defenses.
Unless new, more effective medicines are found, the risk of more infections will drastically increase. The Times reports one study which predicts 10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050 if scientists are not able to combat the increase of drug resistance.
Some scientists have identified evidence that the massive use of fungicides on crops has been a huge contributor to the increase in drug-resistant fungi infecting humans."
Depressed? Try These Proven Natural Remedies to Lift Negative Emotions,www.cbn.com,Lorie Johnson,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/depressed-try-these-proven-natural-remedies-to-lift-negative-emotions,"Negativity, anxiety, anger, stress, trauma, and depression: chances are very high that you or someone you love struggles with these negative emotions. There are many ways to deal with emotional pain. Self-medication with harmful substances or behaviors briefly offers relief, only to make the problem worse in the long run. These include food, drugs, alcohol, risky sexual behavior, shopping, mindless TV, video games or internet surfing.
Christian psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen offers new hope. He says many of us can turn around our negative emotions by changing some of our daily habits. Furthermore, he suggests several coping mechanisms that can make us feel better now and later.
Brain Scans Tell a Tale
Nationwide, his Amen clinics see 4,000 patient visits a month. They have the world's largest database of functional brain scans relating to behavior. He says the SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) scan allows doctors to analyze the blood flow and activity inside the brain. Brain scans are so useful, he says, that nearly eight out of ten diagnoses and treatment recommendations were different after the clinicians used the information from the SPECT scans, compared to current diagnostic methods.
""Here at Amen Clinics, we look at people's brains,"" he told CBN News , ""We have a database of 150-thousand scans on people from 120 countries. And when I started looking at the brain, I'm like, 'Oh, we can make it better or we can make it worse.'""
He developed a program that resulted in one of the highest published success rates in treating mental health, which he shared in his book, Feel Better Fast and Make it Last .
The Line Between Diet and Mood
Many people are amazed to learn that our diet contributes enormously to our mental well-being. Unfortunately, the Standard American Diet is indeed ""SAD,"" because it sabotages our brain.
""We're in a war in our society,"" he said, ""ISIS has nothing on our food industry. The real weapons of mass destruction are highly processed, pesticide sprayed, high glycemic, that means it raises your blood sugar, low-fiber food-like substances stored in plastic containers.""
He recommends a whole-food diet complete with lots of plant-based foods and healthy fats.
""If you change your diet add more colorful fruits and vegetables and get rid of sugar and foods that quickly turn to sugar and processed foods, it's been found to be an effective treatment for depression,"" he said, ""Yes, you can go to the antidepressants for depression, they have all these side effects, or you can go with food.""
Dr. Amen points out the importance of having enough good bacteria in our gut. He says scientific evidence proves our gut microbiome directly influences the way we think and feel.
He says brain scans even reveal the damage extra body fat can have on our brains.
""As your weight goes up, the actual physical size and function of your brain goes down,"" he says, ""Which should scare the fat off anyone.""
Vitamins, Micronutrients and Other Good Stuff
Dr. Amen says too many Americans aren't getting the proper vitamins, minerals and other nutrients necessary for optimal mental health.
For example, he says eighty-percent of Americans are deficient in Vitamin D, often called the ""happy vitamin."" Vitamin D comes from sun exposure, but since so many of us are indoors most of the time and wear sunscreen when we're outside, he recommends a Vitamin D supplement.
Dr. Amen praises fish oil or similar supplements to feel your best.
""I think everybody should be taking Omega-3 fatty acids every day,"" he said, ""We have a crisis in this country of low levels of Omega 3. Why should you care? Twenty-five percent of your brain is actually made up of Omega-3 fatty acids, so if you're low, you're not thinking right.""
There are 16 different brain types according to Dr. Amen. He offers a free, five-minute quiz to learn your brain type and which supplements might be beneficial.
Too Much Screen Time Can Cause Problems
Isolation contributes to mental health problems like depression and stress. Television, social media, and video games can do more harm psychological harm than good.
""Digital addictions-so common,"" he said, ""Things like pornography, looking at things you shouldn't be looking at, even the negative news because the brain pays attention to scary things way before it pays attention to happy things.""
Exercise and Sleep
Staring at screens also tends to promote a sedentary lifestyle, which also raises the risk of emotional issues. Dr. Amen recommends regular exercise because it releases endorphins, our brain's feel-good chemicals. Working out also improves the hippocampus, the region of the brain that helps regulate mood.
Exercise also helps us get a good night's sleep, another critical component to mental wellness.
""Sleep is so important,"" he said, ""You should be targeting at least seven hours of sleep a night. When you have a bad day, it's often because you didn't sleep right.""
Hits to the Head Really Matter
Dr. Amen was a consultant on the movie Concussion, starring Will Smith, that focused on the work of Dr. Bennet Omalu, who identified the danger of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) among football players.
Dr. Amen said mood issues can often be the result of hits to the head.
""Mild traumatic brain injury is a major cause of psychiatric illness and nobody knows about it,"" he said, ""Do not let your children hit soccer balls with their heads. Do not let them play football because it damages your brain.""
Safely Soothe the Senses
Dr. Amen says we all feel emotionally low at times and want something to turn things around right away. The trick, he says, is choosing things that safely appeal to as many senses as possible.
For example, he recommends looking at a picture of loved ones, nature or fractals, which are never-ending patterns. ""Vision is so important. because thirty percent of your brain is dedicated to vision,"" he said.
Listening to the sound of the ocean or your favorite music can instantly improve your mood.
""What are the scents that can help you feel better fast? And lavender has been shown to decrease anxiety and depression,"" Amen told CBN News .
Anti-oxidant-rich dark chocolate is a healthy taste, as is cinnamon, but watch the sugar content.
When it comes to touch, massage proves beneficial, as does simply holding the hand of a happy person.
""There's actually an interesting study that if you hold the hand of someone you care about, your brain waves begin to sync. So you want to be very careful whose hand you hold,"" he said.
So while far too many Americans deal with negativity, anxiety, anger, stress, and trauma, some cases, not all, appear to be linked to our food supply and culture. The good news: for certain people, lifestyle changes can help restore joy and peace."
Rapper Lecrae and Phil Wickham Say Faith-Based Films Like 'Breakthrough' Give Families Something to Hold On To,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/rapper-lecrae-and-phil-wickham-say-faith-based-films-like-breakthrough-give-families-something-to-hold-on-to,"CBNNews.com Rapper Lecrae and Phil Wickham Say Faith-Based Films Like 'Breakthrough' Give Families Something to Hold On To 04-08-2019 Steve Warren Grammy-winning rapper Lecrae.

Musical artists-turned-actors Lecrae and Phil Wickham, who star in the soon-to-be-released faith-based motion picture ""Breakthrough,"" say the film's re-telling of a remarkable true story of faith is what is needed in what the pair call a ""post-Christian North America and Europe.""
As CBN News reported , ""Breakthrough"" tells Joyce Smith's true inspirational story of faith. Smith is told her son is dead after he falls through a frozen lake. Her faith won't accept it and she prays him back to life.
The film, released by 20th Century Fox, is based on the 2017 book The Impossible, which tells the events that happened in St. Charles, Missouri when Smith's son, John, fell through the ice on Lake St. Louis.
After being pulled from the water by first responders an hour later, the boy had no signs of life. Instead of giving up, his mother prayed for a miracle. And a miracle happened. The boy's heart began to beat. His remarkable recovery astonished all of his doctors and he was released from the hospital just a few days after the incident, fully healed.
Grammy winner and hip-hop artist Lecrae told The Christian Post he believes the Smith family's testimony is something people can use and hang on to today.
""I think, specifically like in the Western world, we're in a post-Christian era. So I think a lot of times, we forget our faith has survived for thousands of years. It's just that here in the West, North America and Europe, it's post-Christian,"" Lecrae said.
""It's like, 'oh, we're over that now. We're more progressive with science and so on and so forth.' But take a trip to Africa, you take a trip to China, it's thriving, it's on fire right now. That's the reminder that God is not irrelevant. It's just we forget, but He doesn't,"" he continued. ""We become unfaithful, He's still faithful, and He's going to use whoever wants to acknowledge Him to do whatever it is that He wants done.
""It's almost like, we are going to become the new mission field for the world, and it's films like this to remind us,"" the rapper noted.
Wickham, a contemporary Christian music artist, and worship leader, explained it's a good thing that a generation of people are not willing to subscribe to Christianity just because it has been passed down in their family.
""Once there's truth out there, and people own up to where they stand. I think instead of saying, 'Yeah, I'm Christian, and you don't have to tell me about Jesus,' since they're almost closed off to hearing the real truth that they never heard before,"" Wickham said. ""In some ways, it's paving the way for something beautiful to happen in our country once again.""
After recovering from his accident on the ice, John Smith also admitted that his faith grew from being just a family belief to becoming his own. He now says he feels he's being called by God to become a pastor, according to the CP .
""Breakthrough"" is one of the first faith-based projects executive produced by NBA All-Star Steph Curry.
The movie stars Chrissy Metz (This Is Us), Topper Grace (That 70's Show, BlacKkKlansman), Josh Lucas (You Can Count on Me, A Beautiful Mind, Sweet Home Alabama, Hulk, Secondhand Lions, Glory Road), and hip-hop artist Lecrae.
The film is produced by Devon Franklin, the producer of the box office hit ""Miracles from Heaven."" Franklin, a preacher, and a former studio executive helped the Smith family find a literary agent and develop the book into a film, according to Deadline Hollywood .
Directed by veteran television director Roxann Dawson, the movie will premiere in theaters nationwide April 17, 2019.

"Euthanasia Becoming ""Default Way to Die"" in Belgium",www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/euthanasia-becoming-default-way-to-die-in-belgium,"BRUSSELS – Belgium has long been famous for food, like waffles and chocolate. But it's becoming famous for death.
Belgium has the most liberal euthanasia laws in the world. You can end your life here by simply telling a doctor that you have unbearable physical or mental suffering.
Terminally ill children of any age can receive a lethal injection if their parents agree with the child's wishes.
Woman Euthanized for Being 'Incurably Depressed'
The mother of Belgian university professor Tom Mortier was euthanized in 2012 because, even though she was physically healthy, she was said to be ""incurably depressed.""
""My mother, who was physically healthy, because of her mental problems, received a lethal injection from an oncologist,"" Mortier said.
It was done without his or the family's knowledge. He was contacted by the hospital the day after his mother was killed.
""My mother had a severe mental problem,"" Mortier explained, ""She had to cope with depression throughout her life. She was treated for years by psychiatrists, and the contact between us was broken. A year later, she received a lethal injection.""
Mortier filed a complaint with the medical board and then with a Belgian prosecutor but was turned away. With the help of Alliance Defending Freedom , Mortier appealed his case to the European Court of Human Rights, which has agreed to hear it.
""How can someone like that be euthanized in a democratic western country without the family members even being aware that it was happening?"" asks Mortier's legal counsel Robert Clarke, Director of European Advocacy at ADF International.
Clarke says something that makes the Mortier case even more disturbing is that the doctor who euthanized the woman sits on the very government body that is supposed to oversee the euthanasia law.
The doctor, Wims Distelmans, who some have compared to the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian, once led a euthanasia tour of Auschwitz under the theme ""death with dignity.""
Distelmans co-chairs Belgium's euthanasia commission.
""So, we have a significant conflict of interest where someone is essentially acting as judge and executioner in his own cases,"" Clarke said.
Belgian Euthanasia Commission Accused of Violating the Law
A member of Distelmans' euthanasia commission resigned after the commission failed to act against a doctor who euthanized a dementia patient without consent. Dr. Ludo Van Opdenbosch wrote, ""I do not want to be part of a committee that deliberately violates the law.""
Clarke says, ""There are now more than 13,000 euthanasia cases that this commission has reviewed. And in those 13,000 I'm aware of now one which has been referred to the prosecutor.""
When Belgium passed its law legalizing euthanasia, critics warned that it was headed down an ethical slippery slope. Some wonder if the European nation may have hit bottom, as medical ethics are being replaced by a culture of death.
Euthanasia Now a ""Medical Solution"" in Belgium
Oncologist Benoit Beuselinck at University Hospitals-Leuven says, ""We have begun to offer death as a medical solution, even for non-terminal cases. It's a problem. I have heard about people who were offered euthanasia even though they were not even considering it.""
""The types of conditions, the things that would qualify someone for euthanasia, are being pushed further and further out, Clarke says, ""There were euthanasias carried out on children as young as 17, 11 and nine.""
Professor of Health care Ethics, Dr. Theo Boer says, ""The supply of euthanasia stirs the demand. What you see is that for an increasing number of people, euthanasia becomes the default way to die.""
Belgium Now ""Pushing"" Patients Off Proverbial Bridge
""When we find someone who is requesting to die, who's standing on the proverbial edge of a bridge, and instead of trying to talk them down the state is pushing them off,"" Clarke says.
And Clarke believes Belgium is now the ultimate cautionary tale for any nation that wants to legalize euthanasia, ""I think we have to ask ourselves – is that the kind of society that we want to live in? Or do we want to live in a society with laws that say that vulnerable life should be protected and that all life, no matter what stage, no matter the health of the person, has dignity and value?""

Big Tech Feels the Heat as US Moves to Protect Consumer Data,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/big-tech-feels-the-heat-as-us-moves-to-protect-consumer-data,"Big Tech Feels the Heat as US Moves to Protect Consumer Data 04-08-2019 Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — Momentum is gaining in Washington for a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of the largest technology companies to collect and make money off people’s personal data.
A national law, the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies would need permission to release such information. If it takes effect, a law would also likely shrink Big Tech’s profits from its lucrative business of making personal data available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.
Behind the drive for a law is rising concern over the compromise of private data held by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have earned riches by aggregating consumer information. The industry traditionally has been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.
Support for a privacy law is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to lessen the domination of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have called for the tech giants to be split up.
The Trump White House has said in the past that it could endorse a broad data privacy law.
The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California. That measure will allow Californians to see the personal data being collected on them and where it’s being distributed and to forbid the sale of it. With some exceptions, consumers could also request that their personal information be deleted entirely.
Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions.
“This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. “The industry is terrified.”
On Tuesday, a House committee will press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: Whether they’re doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication.
Facebook, used by 2-billion-plus people including over 200 million in the U.S., has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law.
Facebook’s founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content and ensure election integrity and data portability.
“The internet,” Zuckerberg wrote, “needs new rules.”
Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people’s information, “and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.”
“There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,” Google’s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, has said in a policy paper. “Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.”
A sweeping “privacy shield” law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business — their third penalty against the search giant in two years. The EU watchdogs have also ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of WhatsApp.
On Monday, Britain unveiled plans to vastly increase government oversight of social media companies, with a watchdog that could fine executives or even ban companies that fail to block such content as terrorist propaganda and images of child abuse.
The entire debate cuts to the heart of Big Tech’s hugely profitable commerce in online users’ personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to the individuals they want to reach. Facebook drew 99% of its revenue from advertising last year. For Google’s parent Alphabet, it was 85%, according to Scott Kessler of the research firm CFRA.
Amazon, too, doesn’t just sell products online; it provides ad space, too. The company doesn’t say how much but has said that the “other” revenue in its financial reports is mainly from ads. Its “other” revenue topped $10 billion last year, more than double what it was in 2017.
The tech giants’ problematic relationship with advertisers was spotlighted by action regulators took last month. The Department of Housing and Urban Development filed civil charges against Facebook, accusing it of allowing landlords and real estate brokers to exclude certain racial or ethnic groups from seeing ads for houses and apartments. Facebook could face penalties.
The company has separately agreed to overhaul its ad targeting system and end some of the practices noted by HUD to prevent discrimination in housing listings as well as credit and employment ads. That move was part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists.
Besides crafting a bipartisan data-privacy measure in Congress, lawmakers are considering restoring Obama-era rules that formerly barred internet providers — like AT&T, Verizon and Comcast — from discriminating against certain technologies and services.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has proposed fines and jail time for executives of companies guilty of data breaches.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, representing CEOs of major companies, have presented their own proposals to curb privacy abuses. At the same time, President Donald Trump has echoed complaints from some conservative lawmakers and commentators that the big tech platforms are politically tilted against them.
“Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!” he has tweeted. And he told a rally crowd, “We’re not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read and learn from.”
Tech executives and many Democrats have rejected those assertions as themselves politically biased. Still, Trump has threatened to push regulators to investigate whether Google has abused its role as an internet gateway to stifle competition. And referring to Amazon, Facebook and Google, Trump told Bloomberg News, “Many people think it is a very antitrust situation, the three of them.”
Among the tech giants that are trying to shape any final restrictions is the chipmaker Intel, which has developed its own legislative proposal.
“I think it’s likely we are going to pass a national privacy law by the end of 2020,” David Hoffman, Intel’s associate general counsel and global privacy officer, said in an interview.
By then, the privacy measure emerging in California will have taken effect.
“The California bill is responsible for 90% of the lobbying and political pressure to pass a national law,” said Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, whose board includes tech executives.
Four senators — Republicans Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Jerry Moran of Kansas and Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii — are working on a national measure. They say it would protect consumers from the abuse of their data and provide legal certainty to ensure that tech companies continue to hire and innovate.
“It would be nice,” said Wicker, who leads the key Senate Commerce Committee, “to have it on the president’s desk this year.”

British Government Says Its Making Progress With Pakistan Over Asia Bibi Release,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/british-government-says-it-rsquo-s-lsquo-making-progress-rsquo-with-pakistan-over-asia-bibi-release,"British Government Says It’s ‘Making Progress’ With Pakistan Over Asia Bibi Release 04-03-2019 Will Maule, Faithwire
As persecuted Christian mother Asia Bibi continues to languish in Pakistan, the British government has said that is is in active talks with the Pakistani government to secure her release. Bibi was acquitted of her conviction for blasphemy last October, having spent the best part of a decade on death row.
Providing an update to the British Parliament on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said “making sure that she is safe and has somewhere safe to go is a top priority for this government.”
Daughter of Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi Makes Desperate Plea for Release of Her Ill-Stricken Mother
Despite the British coming under heavy criticism last year after Prime Minister Theresa May reportedly blocked Bibi’s asylum request, Hunt said that the government was progressing in its talks with Pakistani counterparts.
“We have had numerous discussions in private with a Pakistani government about how to progress this,” he said, according to Premier News UK . “We are making progress and I’m very hopeful that this will have a positive outcome.”

However, this is simply not good enough for many of those campaigning for Bibi’s swift release. Member of Parliament, Helen Jones, has told the Warrington Guardian that Hunt could “go one step further in contesting the persecution of Christians around the world” by granting Bibi asylum immediately.
Why Did The British Government Block Bibi's Asylum Request?
Despite British Home Secretary Sajid Javid arguing in favor of the UK helping Bibi reach the safety of British shores, embattled Prime Minister May and her cabinet allegedly decided against the action. According to several reports, the prime minister was concerned about potential reprisal attacks from the Muslim community, should Bibi be admitted into the country.
More Than 500 Pakistani Islamic Imams Sign Declaration Supporting Asia Bibi, Rebuking Terrorism
“Britain was concerned about potential unrest in the country, attacks on embassies and civilians,” Wilson Chowdhry, the head of the British Pakistani Christian Association, told the Telegraph . “It does seem to me that Britain is now a country that is unsafe for those who may be tarred with an allegation of blasphemy. We are very aware that there are extremist elements in this country.”
In response to this, the Muslim Council of Britain tweeted that it sees “no reason why Asia Bibi should be denied asylum into the UK.”
British Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has continued to campaign for Bibi’s release.
What Is Delaying Bibi's Release?
Despite the fact that Bibi’s children are now safely in Canada, the Pakistani government has sought assurances from the mother that she will not speak ill of her home country in the media upon leaving. As such, there is still no indication of when exactly Bibi will finally evade the clutches of the country that has caused her so much strife.
“Even though the government says she can leave, the army has all the power in this case,” noted a source close to the family last month, according to the Daily Mail . “They are in control of her. They are fearful about getting a negative press if she speaks out about her experiences – but they will get an even worse press if she dies in protective custody.”
Bibi, who is being held in a safe house in the port city of Karachi, is reported to be “very unwell” with “low blood pressure.” In addition, it is thought that the 55-year-old mother has been denied medical care while being held captive.
Do continue to pray for Bibi and her family as battle forward in their fight for freedom."
Depressed? Try These Proven Natural Remedies to Lift Negative Emotions,www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/depressed-try-these-proven-natural-remedies-to-lift-negative-emotions,"Depressed? Try These Proven Natural Remedies to Lift Negative Emotions
Negativity, anxiety, anger, stress, trauma, and depression: chances are very high that you or someone you love struggles with these negative emotions. There are many ways to deal with emotional pain. Self-medication with harmful substances or behaviors briefly offers relief, only to make the problem worse in the long run. These include food, drugs, alcohol, risky sexual behavior, shopping, mindless TV, video games or internet surfing.
Christian psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen offers new hope. He says many of us can turn around our negative emotions by changing some of our daily habits. Furthermore, he suggests several coping mechanisms that can make us feel better now and later.
Brain Scans Tell a Tale
Nationwide, his Amen clinics see 4,000 patient visits a month. They have the world's largest database of functional brain scans relating to behavior. He says the SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) scan allows doctors to analyze the blood flow and activity inside the brain. Brain scans are so useful, he says, that nearly eight out of ten diagnoses and treatment recommendations were different after the clinicians used the information from the SPECT scans, compared to current diagnostic methods.
""Here at Amen Clinics, we look at people's brains,"" he told CBN News, ""We have a database of 150-thousand scans on people from 120 countries. And when I started looking at the brain, I'm like, 'Oh, we can make it better or we can make it worse.'""
He developed a program that resulted in one of the highest published success rates in treating mental health, which he shared in his book, Feel Better Fast and Make it Last .
The Line Between Diet and Mood
Many people are amazed to learn that our diet contributes enormously to our mental well-being. Unfortunately, the Standard American Diet is indeed ""SAD,"" because it sabotages our brain.
""We're in a war in our society,"" he said, ""ISIS has nothing on our food industry. The real weapons of mass destruction are highly processed, pesticide sprayed, high glycemic, that means it raises your blood sugar, low-fiber food-like substances stored in plastic containers.""
He recommends a whole-food diet complete with lots of plant-based foods and healthy fats.
""If you change your diet add more colorful fruits and vegetables and get rid of sugar and foods that quickly turn to sugar and processed foods, it's been found to be an effective treatment for depression,"" he said, ""Yes, you can go to the antidepressants for depression, they have all these side effects, or you can go with food.""
Dr. Amen points out the importance of having enough good bacteria in our gut. He says scientific evidence proves our gut microbiome directly influences the way we think and feel.
He says brain scans even reveal the damage extra body fat can have on our brains. ""As your weight goes up, the actual physical size and function of your brain goes down,"" he says, ""Which should scare the fat off anyone.""
Vitamins, Micronutrients and Other Good Stuff
Dr. Amen says too many Americans aren't getting the proper vitamins, minerals and other nutrients necessary for optimal mental health.
For example, he says eighty-percent of Americans are deficient in Vitamin D, often called the ""happy vitamin."" Vitamin D comes from sun exposure, but since so many of us are indoors most of the time and wear sunscreen when we're outside, he recommends a Vitamin D supplement.
Dr. Amen praises fish oil or similar supplements to feel your best.
""I think everybody should be taking Omega-3 fatty acids every day,"" he said, ""We have a crisis in this country of low levels of Omega 3. Why should you care? Twenty-five percent of your brain is actually made up of Omega-3 fatty acids, so if you're low, you're not thinking right.""
There are 16 different brain types according to Dr. Amen. He offers a free, five-minute quiz to learn your brain type and which supplements might be beneficial.
Too Much Screen Time Can Cause Problems
Isolation contributes to mental health problems like depression and stress. Television, social media and video games can do more harm psychological harm than good.
""Digital addictions-so common,"" he said, ""Things like pornography, looking at things you shouldn't be looking at, even the negative news, because the brain pays attention to scary things way before it pays attention to happy things.""
Exercise and Sleep
Staring at screens also tends to promote a sedentary lifestyle, which also raises the risk of emotional issues. Dr. Amen recommends regular exercise because it releases endorphins, our brain's feel-good chemicals. Working out also improves the hippocampus, the region of the brain that helps regulate mood.
Exercise also helps us get a good night's sleep, another critical component to mental wellness. ""Sleep is so important,"" he said, ""You should be targeting at least seven hours of sleep a night. When you have a bad day, it's often because you didn't sleep right.""
Hits to the Head Really Matter
Dr. Amen was a consultant on the movie Concussion, starring Will Smith, that focused on the work of Dr. Bennet Omalu, who identified the danger of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) among football players.
Dr. Amen said mood issues can often be the result of hits to the head. ""Mild traumatic brain injury is a major cause of psychiatric illness and nobody knows about it,"" he said, ""Do not let your children hit soccer balls with their heads. Do not let them play football because it damages your brain.""
Safely Soothe the Senses
Dr. Amen says we all feel emotionally low at times and want something to turn things around right away. The trick, he says, is choosing things that safely appeal to as many senses as possible.
For example, he recommends looking at a picture of loved ones, nature or fractals, which are never-ending patterns. ""Vision is so important. because thirty percent of your brain is dedicated to vision,"" he said.
Listening to the sound of the ocean or your favorite music can instantly improve your mood.
""What are the scents that can help you feel better fast? And lavender has been shown to decrease anxiety and depression,"" Amen told us.
Anti-oxidant-rich dark chocolate is a healthy taste, as is cinnamon, but watch the sugar content.
When it comes to touch, massage proves beneficial, as does simply holding the hand of a happy person.
""There's actually an interesting study that if you hold the hand of someone you care about, your brain waves begin to sync. So you want to be very careful whose hand you hold,"" he said.
So while far too many Americans deal with negativity, anxiety, anger, stress, and trauma, some cases, not all, appear to be linked to our food supply and culture. The good news: for certain people, lifestyle changes can help restore joy and peace."

Still, Trump has threatened to push regulators to investigate whether Google has abused its role as an internet gateway to stifle competition. And referring to Amazon, Facebook and Google, Trump told Bloomberg News, “Many people think it is a very antitrust situation, the three of them.”
Among the tech giants that are trying to shape any final restrictions is the chipmaker Intel, which has developed its own legislative proposal.
“I think it’s likely we are going to pass a national privacy law by the end of 2020,” David Hoffman, Intel’s associate general counsel and global privacy officer, said in an interview.
By then, the privacy measure emerging in California will have taken effect.
“The California bill is responsible for 90% of the lobbying and political pressure to pass a national law,” said Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, whose board includes tech executives.
Four senators — Republicans Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Jerry Moran of Kansas and Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii — are working on a national measure. They say it would protect consumers from the abuse of their data and provide legal certainty to ensure that tech companies continue to hire and innovate.
“It would be nice,” said Wicker, who leads the key Senate Commerce Committee, “to have it on the president’s desk this year.”

'The Violent Type of People': Drug Cartels Taking Advantage of Migrant Tidal Wave Distraction,www.cbn.com,Chuck Holton,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/the-violent-type-of-people-drug-cartels-taking-advantage-of-migrant-tidal-wave-distraction,"NEW MEXICO'S SOUTHERN BORDER - US Customs and Border Protection shut down a border crossing Saturday between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas, saying the crisis of migrants crossing illegally requires the agency to deploy its agents along the unguarded border fence.
But in nearby New Mexico, the risks to America go even beyond the flood of illegal immigration.
As the tidal wave of migrants at the southern border dominates the attention of authorities, cartels are using the distraction to ship record amounts of drugs into the US. So far this fiscal year, seizures of cocaine along the border are on pace to triple last year's totals.
The Johnson family has been ranching 160,000 acres of the New Mexico desert for four generations.
Joe Johnson tells CBN News, ""Well my grandfather came here in 1918, and we've been here 101 years this year.""
He's seen the makeup of illegal border crossers change over the years. ""I think what we have coming through us is the violent type of people... More drug traffic.""
""This right here is what the border patrol calls nineteen canyon. And we've been told many times we ought to stay out of here because of the danger. But we can't. We have to keep an eye on our border.""
And here that's nothing more than a barbed wire fence, built by these ranchers more than 40 years ago. But drug runners cut the fence and drive in with thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, and other dangerous drugs.
That's not the only problem facing the Johnsons. From theft to disease, their cattle and livelihood are being put at risk.
Joe says, ""This is all that's keeping us apart right now. And we've had people coming out of Mexico and stealing our cattle.""
Joe's son Russell says not having a border barrier costs them plenty. ""We experience a lot of sickness from all these groups coming through running cattle off the water, sending the cow one way and the calf the other way....and they were breaking out into pasturella pneumonia which is a stress-induced disease that, if not caught within 24-48 hours, they are dead,"" Russell says.
And these risks extend to the entire US food chain. The United States hasn't had an outbreak of Hoof and Mouth disease since the 1920s. But it's still common here in Central and South America.
""These people coming from way south could be carrying hoof and mouth on their feet. And we're told that can last a couple of weeks I believe on someone's feet,"" Joe says.
A government report last month exposed the significant threat. It shows the US would be unable to quickly handle an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease, as there's not enough vaccine to treat all the American cattle and swine at risk. That could cost more than $19 billion in lost exports alone.
""I think the only way things are going to get better is to build a wall on this border,"" Joe says."

MINNEAPOLIS - The Virginia Cavaliers are the national champions of college basketball after a thrilling overtime victory over the Texas Tech Red Raiders last night in a game that went back and forth throughout the night.
It's the first NCAA Championship for the Cavaliers, and they had to work for all of it. Texas Tech kept coming and coming, closing gap after gap until they forced an overtime before the Cavaliers settled it with their impeccable free throw shooting.
Virginia pulled away early in the first half but Texas fought back. UVA later managed to regain the lead with a 3-pointer by Ty Jerome right before halftime, taking the score to 32-29.
In the second half, Virginia came out swinging with a 3 by sharp shooter Kyle Guy. After a scoring run, the Cavaliers were up 40-31 before Tech's Brandone Francis made a 3 to begin closing the gap again.
Later, Kyle Guy came back with another 3-pointer, giving Virginia an impressive 53-43 lead.
Then with 4:15 left in the game, Tech's comeback kicked into high gear. Matt Mooney drained one from the arc for 3, followed by another 3 by Davide Moretti. Then Jarrett Culver made a nice move to the basket for 2 to take the lead back. With the score at 66-65, victory looked possible for Texas Tech.
Then with 14 seconds left, UVA's Deandre Hunter drained a clutch 3-pointer, tying the score and sending the game to overtime. Then it was settled at the free throw line where the Cavaliers clinched their spot as national champs.
UVA Guard Kihei Clark said, ""We knew they were going to make their run. They're a great team, just like any other team in the country. Um, they really made it hard for us on offense. And Um, we knew they were going to make shots. Basketball's a game that runs. So we knew they were going to make plays. So when they made their runs we just didn't panic and uh trust in the guys and trust in the system.""
UVA's 6′ 8″ Guard Braxton Key said, ""It's a blessing. I mean, I told my uncle Ralph (Sampson) after the game that we did it for him. Because obviously he didn't get one. He's so great full for this program. And he kind of made everything happen for this program and just put it on the map. It's not even about us. I mean, it's the fans, and Charlottesville.""
Kyle Guy said, ""Yeah, we came in together and said that we were going to win a National Championship, and to be able to hug each other with confetti going everywhere and say we did it, it's the greatest feeling I've ever felt in basketball.""
It was a big moment of redemption for UVA after losing in the first round of 2018, despite being the top-ranked team that year. Some had called that stunning defeat the greatest NCAA upset of all time.
For Virginia's Head Coach Tony Bennett, UVA's comeback this year sends a big message about perseverance and humility.
""I think there was a bigger plan going on here, and I wasn't needed, but I was used in it. I hope that it's a message for some people out there that there can be hope and joy and resiliency,"" Bennett said.
""I'm thankful for what happened. That's why I did what I did at the end,"" he said. ""When that horn went off, I just put my head down and said, 'Thank You. I'm humbled, Lord, because I don't deserve to be in this spot, but You chose me to be here, and I'll give thanks.' And I told our guys in the locker room, I said, 'Put your arms around each other, take a look at every guy in here, look at each other. Promise me you will remain humble and thankful for this. Don't let this change you.'"""
Iranian Leaders Chant 'Death to America' as US Terror Designation Highlights 'Terror Campaigns all Around the World',www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/iranian-leaders-chant-death-to-america-as-us-terror-designation-highlights-terror-campaigns-all-around-the-world,"Feb, 11, 2019, IRGC members celebrating 40th anniversary of Islamic Revolution 6024309410001 Iranian Leaders Chant 'Death to America' as US Terror Designation Highlights 'Terror Campaigns all Around the World'
Iran's lawmakers showed up to work today wearing full military uniforms in defiance of the United States after the White House decided to designate the country's elite fighting force as a foreign terrorist organization.
Chanting ""Death to America"" the speaker of Iran's Parliament called the designation the ""climax of stupidity and ignorance,"" while the nation's ruling cleric said the plot against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps would backfire.
""You think if you speak against the Revolutionary Guard you can trigger a difference in Iran?"" asked Iran's President Hassan Rouhani. ""You think the guards' popularity will decrease? Be aware that, from today, the popularity of the guards in the hearts of the Iranian nation and in the region will be more than ever.""
Following the White House designation, Iran state TV called America a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" and moved to label the United States Central Command, CENTCOM, as a terrorist organization.
With US troops in nearby Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, also known as IRGC, warned US troops could now be potential targets.
""Be aware that, and of course you already know that, since last year we have achieved missiles and weapons that you couldn't even imagine,"" warned Rouhani. ""So you can't stop our military might.""
The US Treasury Department already had more than 970 Iranian individuals and entities on its sanctions list. But this is the first time America has labeled another nation's military a terrorist group. ""We're doing it because the Iranian regime's use of terrorism as a tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other government,"" said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the State Department Monday.
The administration says it's singling out the IRGC because of the para-military's primary role in the regime's decades-long global terrorist campaign.
""The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization, but none of us should be fooled,"" warned Pompeo. ""It regularly violates the laws of armed conflict. It plans, organizes and executes terror campaigns all around the world.""
Randy Singer's Virginia law firm handles several cases on behalf of Iran terror victims.
""Our clients have been taken hostage in Yemen by the Houthi rebels who are funded by the IRGC,"" Singer told CBN News . ""Our clients have been taken hostage in Iraq by Shia militias funded by IRGC. Our clients have been subject of suicide bombing attacks funded by IRGC, so this means a lot to clients, both in the court cases, but also more importantly, to people that might be subject to terrorist attacks in the future. Senior International Correspondent George Thomas is on today's CBN News Daily Rundown with more on the IRGC and the ramifications of this new designation. Check it out HERE
With hundreds of thousands of members, the Revolutionary Guard oversees the country's ballistic missiles and nuclear programs as well as having its hand in lucrative businesses, including Iran's banking, shipping and oil industries.
""The leaders of Iran are racketeers, not revolutionaries,"" Pompeo said during his brief remarks. ""The Iranian people deserve better than to be governed by this cadre of hypocritical and corrupt officials.""
Singer says targeting the group will hopefully deprive the world's leading state sponsor of terror of the financial means to spread its reign of evil.
""This is trying to dry up the money source for the IRGC, they spend about a billion to two billion dollars a year funding terrorism, and the idea here is that we are putting on notice companies that deal with them, that if you deal with them, you are bankrolling terrorism as well,"" Singer added.
The designation means any IRGC assets in the United States can be frozen. It bans any American from doing business with the group.
""Businesses and banks around the world now have a clearer duty to ensure that companies with which they conduct financial transactions are not connected to the IRGC in any material way,"" Pompeo said.
The designation takes effect next week.
""With this designation the Trump administration is simply recognizing a basic reality,"" said Pompeo. ""The IRGC will take its rightful place on the same list as terror groups it supports: Lebanese Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas, Khatib Hezbollah, among others, all of which are already designated as foreign terrorist organizations."""
"President Cleans House at DHS, Hoping to Solve Border Crisis",www.cbn.com,Heather Sells,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/president-cleans-house-at-dhs-hoping-to-solve-border-crisis,"With the 2020 election looming and growing frustration at the border, President Donald Trump is moving this week to change the leadership line-up at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and considering an array of tougher policies that include family separation.
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is out. Her official last day on the job is Wednesday.
The president has replaced Nielsen with Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. He will take over on an acting basis. McAleenan has pushed for asylum changes to make screenings faster and decide cases quicker.
The Associated Press reports that more changes are on the way. It says the White House will push out Francis Cissna, the head of US Citizenship and Immigration Servies, and John Mitnick, the Homeland Security general counsel.
Over the weekend, the administration withdrew the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
These changes plus other vacancies add up to a significant lack of leadership at DHS. It includes no deputy secretary, no head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and no head of Customs and Border Protection since McAleenan is moving over.
Trump advisor and immigration hawk Stephen Miller is the catalyst behind the changes according to AP.
But there's no doubt that the president is exasperated with the flood of immigrants at the border, tweeting on Monday: ""Country is full!""
He's apparently considering separating immigrant families at the border again, despite the outrage that he received last year when the policy was implemented in the spring. Prominent evangelicals, including evangelist Franklin Graham, Samuel Rodriguez, and the Southern Baptist Convention, denounced the short-lived effort that separated children and parents once they crossed into the US.
Meanwhile, Border Patrol agents are struggling to keep up with a historic flow of migrants. In March, agents apprehended 100,000 immigrants at the southern border - the highest number in 12 years.
CBN News visited with San Diego Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott last week. He said the San Diego sector, which includes 60 miles of US/Mexico border, expects to double its number of apprehensions this year.
Scott blamed court rulings which have forced Border Patrol to release families within 20 days.
""When people know that they can come in, that they're just going to be processed and released into the US for a court date sometime in the future - that creates a nonstop flow,"" said Scott.
Scott, like many others, is looking to Congress to solve the problem by fixing the legal loopholes that force Border Patrol to quickly release families. ""Something has to change,"" he said, ""this is not a sustainable situation that we're currently in."""

Pro-Life Movement Wins Big in Kentucky as Court Upholds State's Ultrasound Law,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/pro-life-movement-wins-big-in-kentucky-as-court-upholds-states-ultrasound-law,"Pro-Life Movement Wins Big in Kentucky as Court Upholds State's Ultrasound Law 04-09-2019 Christian Ellis Ultrasound (Photo:Adobe Stock)
Pro-lifers in Kentucky are rejoicing after a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the state's Ultrasound Informed Consent Act. The act requires abortionists to grant women the opportunity to see their ultrasound images of their unborn child and play the audio of the child's heartbeat before performing the abortion.
Originally blocked by US District Court Judge David Hale in 2017 when passed, the law is now able to be enforced.
""Today is a historic day, as Kentucky continues to lead the charge in implementing strong pro-life protections for its citizens,"" stated Gov. Matt Bevin (R-KY) according to LifeSite . ""We applaud the decision by the Sixth Circuit, which affirms the commonsense notion that patients should be well equipped with relevant information before making important medical decisions.""
""I am grateful to be governor of a state that values every human life,"" he continued. ""And we are committed to continue our fight on behalf of the most vulnerable among us.""
In the court hearing Thursday, Judge John Bush, one of the three appellate judges and an appointee of President Donald Trump, stated, ""Are the mandated disclosures truthful and not misleading? Yes—no one argues that the heartbeat, sonogram, or its description is false or misleading.""
""That leaves the final question: Are the mandated disclosures relevant to the patient's decision whether to abort unborn life?"" he added. ""The Supreme Court's abortion precedent answers this question for us.""
The abortion precedent he is discussing is the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey and 2018's National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, where the US Supreme Court held ""that the First Amendment has a limited role to play in allowing doctors to avoid making truthful mandated disclosures related to informed consent,"" and the ultrasound law ""provides relevant information"" that ""gives a patient greater knowledge of the unborn life inside her.""
""This also inherently provides the patient with more knowledge about the effect of an abortion procedure: it shows her what, or whom, she is consenting to terminate,"" Bush continued. ""That this information might persuade a woman to change her mind does not render it suspect under the First Amendment. It just means that it is pertinent to her decision-making.""
Judge Alan Norris, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, joined Judge Bush in his ruling. Judge Bernice Donald, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, differed by stating the law ""eviscerates physician discretion"" to decide what ""truthful, non-misleading, and relevant information"" to share with patients according to LifeSite. She went on to say the requirement had ""no basis in the practice of medicine.""
The act went to court after the progressive American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the state on behalf of a Louisville abortion facility, EMW Women's Surgical Center. It was the first of two lawsuits by the ACLU against pro-life measures in Kentucky.
The ACLU recently announced a second lawsuit after the GOP-led Senate voted 32-4 to send a new pro-life bill to Gov. Matt Bevin last month. That legislation bans abortion for women seeking to terminate their pregnancies on the basis of the baby's gender, race or disability such as Down syndrome.
Gov. Bevin had responded to the organization after they made the announcement last month. ""Bring it! Kentucky will always fight for life..."" tweeted Gov. Bevin. ""Always #WeAreProLife #WeAreKY."""
"Suspect Captured, Accused of Plotting Islamic Terror Attack to Plow Down US Crowds of People",www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/suspect-captured-accused-of-plotting-islamic-terror-attack-to-plow-down-us-crowds-of-people,"Suspect Accused of Plotting Islamic Terror Attack to Plow Down US Crowds of People 04-09-2019 Christian Ellis Rondell Henry (Photo: Screen Capture)
Federal officials say they have a suspect in custody, accused of plotting to drive a stolen truck into crowds of people. The Justice Department says 28-year-old Rondell Henry was inspired online by the radical Islamic group ISIS to commit mass murder.
On March 26, Henry allegedly stole a U-Haul truck and drove around Washington, DC, looking for crowds to target. He finally decided on the National Harbor Waterfront in Maryland, an area popular with tourists and families. The crowds were thin, so he parked the truck to return the next day to perform the attack.
The following day officers found the stolen truck, and on the 28th they arrested Henry after they saw him jumping over a security fence. Prosecutors in Maryland have asked the judge to keep Henry detained on a charge of driving a stolen vehicle across state lines.
""The defendant, inspired by the ISIS terrorist organization and prepared to die for his cause, stole a vehicle with the intent of 'plowing it through a crowd full of people' at the National Harbor,"" prosecutors said. ""He must be detained pending trial.""
Leaving his job in the middle of the day, he stole the U-Haul truck from a Virginia mall parking garage after realizing his four-door sedan ""would not cause the catastrophic damage that he desired.""
""I was just going to keep driving and driving and driving. I wasn't going to stop,"" the Associated Press reports a document with Henry's statements.
Henry went on to say he wanted to cause ""panic and chaos"" like the deadly truck attack that killed people in Nice, France in 2016.
Henry was taken for a psychiatric evaluation then into FBI custody. Prosecutors are expected to share new evidence that could add on multiple charges to his charge of interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, which carries up to 10 years in prison.
The government's detention motion states Henry as harboring hatred for ""disbelievers"" of the Islamic faith. Also, Henry is reported to have continually watched ISIS beheading and fighting videos. Prosecutors found images of the ISIS flag, armed ISIS fighters, and the man who committed the Orlando nightclub massacre in 2016 on his phone.
Initially, he desired to perform the attack at Dulles International Airport. However, he was not successful in breaching the security perimeter after two hours. He then headed to the National Harbor where there are multiple restaurants, retail and hotels.
""But so early in the morning on a weekday,"" prosecutors wrote , ""the defendant did not find the sizable crowd upon which he desired to inflict his radical conduct."""

TEL AVIV - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party is slated for a clear victory against Benny Gantz's rival Blue and White party.
By Wednesday morning, 97 percent of the votes were counted and showed the Likud party tied with Blue and White. As of 9 a.m., Likud has won 26.27 percent of the votes, earning them 35 seats in the Knesset. Blue and White won 25.94 percent, also giving them 35 seats.
However, Israel's bloc of right-wing parties has won a majority of the 120 Knesset seats, giving Netanyahu the support he needs to form a government and remain prime minister.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked supporters at a victory party in Tel Aviv Tuesday night.
""Remember, 25 years ago, it was the first time that Sara and I stood here. And here we have returned here, because of you and for you,"" Netanyahu said, adding that his win against Gantz was ""almost unprecedented.""
Netanyahu's victory was history in the making. He will be Israel's longest-serving prime minister.
Meanwhile, Gantz isn't admitting defeat yet.
""Good morning friends, yes, good morning,"" Gantz wrote is a letter to party activists Wednesday. ""The reports tell an unfinished story. There is nothing final about (the results).""
""We may be able to make a political maneuver of one kind or another,"" he said.
Some have speculated that a unity government between Netanyahu and Gantz would help the country heal from a bitter election, and respond to threats from Iran and Hamas.
""The coalition, it's not clear yet, because we need to see who are the parties that are in the game. So two days from now we'll be smarter about the coalition. But one thing we know about, and for sure, Netanyahu is the next prime minister,"" said Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Although Netanyahu's coalition will be right-wing, he says he wants to make sure all Israelis are represented.
""I intend to work quickly to establish a stable government. I want to make it clear, it will be a right-wing government, but I intend to be the prime minister of all Israeli citizens, right or left, Jews or non-Jews alike, all Israeli citizens,"" said Netanyahu.
Netanyahu has already phoned many probable partners in his latest coalition, almost certainly a government of the right. That would include two religious parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism. They finished third and fourth in the voting.
The Times of Israel reports that voter turnout was 67.8 percent, which is down from 2015's 71.8 percent. A spokesperson for the Likud party confirmed to CBN News that voter turnout is low this election.

These changes plus other vacancies add up to a significant lack of leadership at DHS. It includes no deputy secretary, no head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and no head of Customs and Border Protection since McAleenan is moving over.
Trump advisor and immigration hawk Stephen Miller is the catalyst behind the changes according to AP.
But there's no doubt that the president is exasperated with the flood of immigrants at the border, tweeting on Monday: ""Country is full!""
He's apparently considering separating immigrant families at the border again, despite the outrage that he received last year when the policy was implemented in the spring. Prominent evangelicals, including evangelist Franklin Graham, Samuel Rodriguez, and the Southern Baptist Convention, denounced the short-lived effort that separated children and parents once they crossed into the US.
Meanwhile, Border Patrol agents are struggling to keep up with a historic flow of migrants. In March, agents apprehended 100,000 immigrants at the southern border - the highest number in 12 years.
CBN News visited with San Diego Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott last week. He said the San Diego sector, which includes 60 miles of US/Mexico border, expects to double its number of apprehensions this year.
Scott blamed court rulings which have forced Border Patrol to release families within 20 days.
""When people know that they can come in, that they're just going to be processed and released into the US for a court date sometime in the future - that creates a nonstop flow,"" said Scott.
Scott, like many others, is looking to Congress to solve the problem by fixing the legal loopholes that force Border Patrol to quickly release families. ""Something has to change,"" he said, ""this is not a sustainable situation that we're currently in."""

When my husband, Carey, was 12 years old, his dad had a massive stroke and died four days later. His mother was left destitute with five children. This included Carey, three girls, and a three-month-old baby boy. Since the children’s father had been a golf professional, they lived at the country club. When he died, the family was forced to find somewhere else to live.
Carey’s mom, later called “Mammaw” by my children and me, took the $3,000 her husband left in a life insurance policy and searched for another home. She ultimately purchased a tiny, rundown two-bedroom house for $1,500. She used most of the remainder of the insurance money to enclose the back porch for a much-needed third bedroom.
Outside this dilapidated house was a gnarled pear tree, its limbs twisted and broken. Mammaw hated the way that old tree looked, but she couldn’t afford to pay someone to cut it down and haul it away.
The first year they lived there, the ugly old tree yielded a few pears. The next year, she watered it and put a few iron nails around it, hoping they would act as fertilizer. She was pleasantly surprised when the tree produced a good crop of pears that summer.
That old tree, once thought of as worthless and unsightly, became a wellspring for Mamaw’s generosity. Over the next 45 years of her life, she canned over a thousand jars of its fruit. She put up pears, pear preserves, and her own original pear relish. These were received as welcomed gifts by friends and family.
Much like that old pear tree, our bodies age and become wrinkled and misshapen. We may think of ourselves as ugly and unproductive, but thankfully, The Lord does not look at the things people look at.
""People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."" 1 Samuel 16:7 (NIV)
We need Living Water, the nourishment of God’s Word, and the fruit of the Holy Spirit to be productive and share our blessings with others. Until the day we die, we are to continue to bear the fruit of the Spirit of love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. (See Galatians 5:22)
The fruit of the Spirit is a wonderful gift of encouragement we’re to offer to others.
""Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing."" 1 Thessalonians 5:11 (NIV)
We can be generous and bless others when we share this tasty fruit.

'Assault on the Rights of Parents': MA Bans Same-Sex Attraction Therapy Among Healthcare Providers,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/assault-on-the-rights-of-parents-ma-bans-same-sex-attraction-therapy-among-healthcare-providers,"'Assault on the Rights of Parents': MA Bans Same-Sex Attraction Therapy Among Healthcare Providers 04-09-2019 Emily Jones
Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has signed a new law banning licensed health care professionals from trying to help patients under age 18 who struggle with same-sex attraction.
The move blocks health care providers from trying to ""change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.""
Health care professionals are also not allowed to advertise sexual orientation change efforts.
Anyone who violates the law will be subject to punishment, including suspension or revocation of their medical license.
Massachusetts is the 13th state to pass such a law.
Democratic state Rep. Kay Khan authored the legislation and said it will protect that well-being of LGBTQ minors.
""This bill will ensure that children receive therapy in a healthy, evidence-based and medically sound manner, not one which fosters an atmosphere of self-hate, prejudice and intolerance,"" Khan said. ""Massachusetts has always been a trailblazer in advancing civil rights and eliminating discrimination in health care settings for the LGBTQ community. This bill is a necessary extension of these historic commitments.""
Meanwhile, Republican state Rep. Shawn Dooley argued the bill violates the free speech rights of medical professionals.
""The reality is we are legislating what can be said between a doctor and his patient in the sanctity of that relationship,"" Dooley said. ""Let's say an 8-year-old boy comes in and says, 'I'm an 8-year-old girl.' Maybe that therapist — and many therapists I've spoken to have brought this up — wants to push back a little bit. Maybe that child isn't transgender, maybe that child's gay, maybe that child's bi. Why not give every opportunity for that therapist to explore that? Why can't the therapist say, 'No, you're not?'""
The conservative Massachusetts Family Institute's President and General Counsel Andrew Beckwith said, ""MFI will pursue legal action against the Counseling Ban to defend the constitutional rights of parents and counselors in our Commonwealth.""
""This law is an extraordinarily invasive assault on the rights of parents to raise their children and a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech for the counselors whose help they seek,"" the group said in a previous statement. Last night, Governor Baker signed the #CounselingBan into law. Sadly, it is already having exactly the tragic consequences we predicted."

Polling stations close at 10p.m. (1900 GMT, 3 p.m. EDT).
“I have received a dramatic update that there is low turnout in Likud strongholds but that there is a high turnout in left-wing strongholds,” Netanyahu said. “We have to save the Right. There are only a few more hours.”
Meanwhile, the Likud election headquarter is buzzing with activity. So far, there are no Likud leaders present. The event was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m., but was postponed to 11 p.m. because of the low voter turnout, The Times of Israel reports.
Netanyahu’s rival, Benny Gantz from the Blue and White party, urged voters to ignore Netanyahu’s concerns.
“These are the last hours of the campaign. Do not believe any word that Netanyahu is now saying. The battle is close. If you do not get everyone out of the house now and send them to the ballot box, we will not win the elections.”
Experts say Netanyahu and Gantz are feigning alarm in a last-ditch effort to get voters to the polls.
Netanyahu is seeking a record-breaking fourth consecutive term, which would make him the longest serving prime minister in Israel’s history.
While Gantz and Netanyahu have very different views on policy, tonight, with just a few hours left, they are sending the same message to Israelis – go vote."

Click the player above to watch Franklin Graham's Facebook Live interview with actress Ashley Bratcher.
The pro-life film ""Unplanned,"" which premiered in theaters March 29, has continued to surpass box office expectations.
The success comes despite the movie's R-rating for what the Motion Picture Association of America called ""some disturbing/bloody images.""
The film, about the life of former Planned Parenthood Director Abby Johnson, finished in the top 10 at the box office for the second weekend in a row.
Many are praising the film which seeks to expose the truth about abortion. And supporters say the R-rating is proof that abortion is a truly violent act committed against a defenseless person.
In a tweet on April 1, Vice President Mike Pence tweeted, ""So good to see movie theaters across the country showing @UnplannedMovie - a deeply inspiring new pro-life film based on the best-selling book by @AbbyJohnson. More and more Americans are embracing the sanctity of life because of powerful stories like this one. #Unplanned.""

Franklin Graham hosted a Facebook Live interview with actress Ashley Bratcher Tuesday night. Bratcher portrays Johnson in the film.
""It was great to welcome Ashley Bratcher to Boone, NC, today to sit down and talk about the new movie Unplanned that has shattered box office expectations,"" Graham wrote on Facebook. ""Ashley plays the part of former Planned Parenthood Clinic Director Abby Johnson in this powerful true story.""
Bratcher revealed to CBN News while she was filming the movie, that her mother had almost aborted her.
""She said 'I'm going to tell you something that I haven't told you before,"" shared Bratcher. ""And she said to me 'I was in the clinic. I had my name called. I went back. I was being examined by a woman who was very pregnant, and I was on the table and that was when I changed my mind.'""
""To hear I was seconds away from not existing, and then also to know that here I am telling Abby's Johnson's story, it's so clear to me and evident that God's hand at work is present on this project,"" said Bratcher.
Graham went on to encourage his followers to see the film.
""Please make it a point to go to the theater and watch Unplanned—take your family and church, and encourage your church groups to go,"" he said. ""This movie pulls back the curtain on many of the lies about abortion."
PA School Board Decrees 'In God We Trust' Can Be Displayed in Local Schools | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/pa-school-board-decrees-in-god-we-trust-can-be-displayed-in-local-schools,"PA School Board Decrees 'In God We Trust' Can Be Displayed in Local Schools 04-09-2019 Steve Warren
The Greencastle-Antrim School Board in Greencastle, PA has voted unanimously to allow the national motto ""In God We Trust"" and other documents from US history to be displayed in foyers and other public areas of the district's primary, elementary, middle and high schools.
Teachers can also place the motto in their classrooms, as well, along with copies of the US Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.
Herald-Mail Media reportslast month, the school board approved the request of Tom McCloud of Waynesboro, PA, to display the national motto and other documents in the district's schools.
McCloud also volunteered to coordinate funding from groups in the local community to have the motto and documents printed and framed at no cost for the district's schools and classrooms.
The board also passed a resolution saying it desires to display the motto and documents because they serve patriotic, historical, educational and solemnizing purposes.
""We have these documents already displayed in some of the schools,"" said school board President Mike Still, who said he received one email against the board taking the action. ""It's historical. I don't know if we should ever run away from history.""
McCloud successfully spearheaded another similar campaign in the Waynesboro Area School District in 2016 to have the National Motto posted in schools and local municipal offices, according to Herald-Mail Media .
""I made it my mission to get it in as many schools as possible,"" McCloud said last month.
""In God We Trust"" is the official motto of the United States of America. It was adopted as the US motto in 1956 as a replacement or alternative to the unofficial Latin motto of ""E Pluribus Unum"" (""Out of many, one"") which was adopted when the Great Seal of the United States was created and adopted in 1782, according to Wikipedia .
""In God We Trust"" first appeared on the two-cent piece in 1864 during the American Civil War and has appeared on US paper currency since 1957.
""If you don't teach it, people won't know it,"" McCloud said. ""I feel strongly the message has to be spread."""
Redacted Mueller Report to be Released Within a Week,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/redacted-mueller-report-to-be-released-within-a-week,"Redacted Mueller Report to be Released Within a Week 04-09-2019 Associated Press Attorney General William Barr (Photo credit: Patrick Robertson/CBN News)
WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday that he expects to release a redacted version of the special counsel’s Trump-Russia investigation report “within a week” as he defended his handling of the document.
Barr told members of Congress at his first public appearance since receiving special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that his earlier projection of releasing a version by mid-April still stood. The nearly 400-page report is being scoured now to remove grand jury information and details relating to pending investigations.
The redactions will be color-coded and accompanied by notes explaining the decision to withhold information, he said.
Democrats scolded Barr over his handling of the report, telling him they were concerned that a summary of its main conclusions he released last month portrayed the investigation’s findings in an overly favorable way for President Donald Trump.
Rep. Nita Lowey, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said she was taken aback that Barr had reduced Mueller’s report to a four-page letter in just two days. That letter said that Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump associates and that Barr did not believe the evidence in the report was sufficient to prove the president had obstructed justice.
“Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it’s more suspicious than impressive,” Lowey said.
Explaining the rapid turnaround for his letter, Barr said, “The thinking of the special counsel was not a mystery to the Department of Justice prior to the submission of the report.”
Barr was summoned to Congress to talk about his department’s budget request, but lawmakers still asked about the Mueller report as they waited to see it. Barr’s opening remarks focused on funding requests for immigration enforcement and the fights against violent crime and opioid addiction, not mentioning the special counsel’s report at all.
Barr would not discuss the substance of Mueller’s findings but did explain his process for receiving and reviewing the report. He said he had offered Mueller the chance to review his four-page letter, but that Mueller declined. Asked about reports that members of Mueller’s team were unhappy with his handling of the report, Barr said he suspected any discontent may have reflected their desire to put out more information.
“I felt I should state bottom-line conclusions, and I tried to use special counsel Mueller’s own language in doing that,” he said.
Barr also said that he could be open to releasing some redacted details after consulting with congressional leaders, though he said he did not have plans to ask a court for permission to disclose secret grand jury testimony.
Mueller sent his final report to Barr on March 22, ending his almost two-year investigation into possible ties between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Barr released a four-page letter summarizing the report two days later and said he would release a redacted version of the full report by mid-April, “if not sooner.”
The new attorney general’s budget testimony — traditionally a dry affair, and often addressing the parochial concerns of lawmakers — came as Democrats were enraged that he was redacting material from the report and frustrated that his summary framed a narrative about Trump before they were able to see the full version.
The Democrats are demanding that they see the full report and all its underlying evidence, though Trump and his Republican allies are pushing back.
The chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee, Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano of New York, told Barr there were “serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report.”
Barr said in the summary released last month that Mueller didn’t find a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin. He also said that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice, instead presenting evidence on both sides of the question. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided that the evidence was insufficient to establish obstruction.
Facing the intensifying concerns from Democrats that he may have whitewashed Mueller’s findings, Barr has twice moved to defend or at least explain, his handling of the process since receiving the special counsel’s report. He has said that he did not intend for his four-page summary of Mueller’s main conclusions to be an “exhaustive recounting” of his work and that he could not immediately release the entire report because it included grand jury material and other sensitive information that needed to be redacted.
He is likely to be asked to further explain himself at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday that is also on the budget.
Barr is to testify on the report itself at separate hearings before the Senate and House Judiciary committees on May 1 and May 2. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and chairman of the House Judiciary panel, confirmed the May 2 date on Twitter and said he would like Mueller to testify.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said he would be satisfied hearing only from Barr and not Mueller.

Missing for Two Years: Investigators Confirm Pastor Kidnapped by Special Police,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/missing-for-two-years-investigators-confirm-pastor-kidnapped-by-special-police,"Missing for Two Years: Investigators Confirm Pastor Kidnapped by Special Police 04-09-2019 Steve Warren (Screenshot image courtesy: Kimi TV/YouTube)
After a two-year investigation, Malaysia's Human Rights Commission has determined a missing Malaysian pastor was abducted by members of a special police unit for allegedly trying to persuade Muslims to embrace Christianity.
The Baptist Press reports the family of 63-year-old Raymond Koh – who was abducted in February 2017 in Kuala Lumpur by a group of masked men – hopes he is still alive and that the Malaysian government will continue its investigation.
CCTV footage captured the moment of Koh's kidnapping in which 15 masked men in five unmarked vehicles are seen. Koh's abduction took a total of 42 seconds. He has not been seen or heard from since.
Koh pastored an Evangelical Free Church of Malaysia for 20 years before founding Harapan Komuniti in Malaysia in 2004, a community-based charity outreach to single mothers, drug addicts, and HIV/AIDS victims.
Koh's wife Susanna and their three adult children ""are just glad that this investigation has really proved what they already knew: that there was police involvement in this forced disappearance of Pastor Raymond,"" Greg Wilton, missions pastor at Long Hollow Baptist Church in Hendersonville, TN, told the Baptist Press . ""...Now they are very hopeful there will be some legitimate investigation and hopefully even taking to trial of some key figures that have been a part of this.""
Malaysia's National Human Rights Commission announced April 3 that circumstantial and direct evidence suggest Koh and Shiite Muslim activist Amri Che Mat both fell prey to ""enforced disappearance by state agents"" from the national police special branch over matters against Islam, according to media reports. Special Branch is the intelligence arm of the police force, according to Reuters .
The rights panel has little legal authority, and its burden of proof is less than required in Malaysian courts, the media outlet noted.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the government will reinvestigate both disappearances if the human rights commission can produce evidence to support its claims, The Associated Press reported. The prime minister, who was elected in 2018, noted both disappearances occurred under a previous government.
The former home minister, who oversaw police, has denied ordering the police to abduct Koh or Amri. The former national police chief denied the special branch was involved, according to the AP . Still, the retired judge who headed the three-member investigating commission said the evidence of police involvement is ""heinous and despicable.""
Koh was ""a mighty servant of the Lord who did everything for the Lord Jesus,"" Wilton said. The family covets believers' prayers and knows ""nothing will separate them from the love of Christ.""
The majority of Malaysia's population is Muslim. But the country also has Christian, Buddhist and Hindu communities. Leaving the Muslim faith is considered both a sin and a crime by Islamic authorities, and evangelizing Muslims is outlawed.
The human rights commission also hopes to investigate the 2016 disappearances of Christian preachers and former Muslims Joshua and Ruth Hilmi, according to media reports.

Can You Really Trust the Bible? A Thought-Provoking Response to Atheists,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/can-you-really-trust-the-bible-a-thought-provoking-response-to-atheists,"Can You Really Trust the Bible? A Thought-Provoking Response to Atheists 04-09-2019 (Image courtesy PureFlix Insider)
Can human beings truly trust the Bible? Is it reliable? One of the most frequent criticisms made by atheists and skeptics against the Old and New Testaments is that the texts are dated, antiquated and contradictory — and that they are a collection of books written by mere men.
But Mark Spence, vice president of outreach at California-based Christian ministry Living Waters , believes it’s entirely possible to put these critiques to rest, and that Christians shouldn’t be afraid to engage with those who question the merits of their faith.

“Christianity’s intelligent. We have all the answers on our side,” he recently told PureFlix.com’s “Pure Talk.” “We don’t need to run away.”
Spence believes “we can trust the Bible,” and he pointed to its interconnected history and reliable contents to bolster his point.
“This is not one book. This is 66 books written over a period of 1,500 years, by 40 different authors, three different continents with one central main theme: How does man avoid hell and come into relationship with his maker?” he said.
Watch Spence break down the Bible’s reliability below:
Spence is slated to equip Christians to learn more about the Bible when he speaks at the PureFlix.com sponsored Answering Atheist conference (April 17-21) this Easter at the Ark Encounter attraction in Williamstown, Kentucky. It’s a conference that promises “four days of solid biblical teaching to equip you to stand confidently on God’s word.”
“We are going to come together and give people … some very practical ammunition to really think through their worldview — defend their worldview and be on the offense,” Spence said.
He noted that a young man once approached him and questioned why someone would trust in the Bible, especially since it’s a book written by men.
READ ALSO: Inside the Incredible Story Behind Lifesize Replica of Noah’s Ark
“I said, ‘Well, you’re a man. Are you saying I can’t trust anything you say?’” Spence recounted, noting that the young man then said it’s more about being skeptical of things that have been put into writing.
From there, Spence asked how the man proves his age to others, and the teen said he has a license and birth certificate. That’s when the apologist noted that these items — much like the biblical text — were encoded in writing. His point? These arguments don’t pass muster.
He also addressed another barrier some find to God: The existence of pain. Spence said it’s important to try and understand the motivation behind a question like, “Why does God allow pain?”
“When someone asks me a question I usually respond with, ‘Why do you ask?,’” he said, noting that this helps him understand what’s really sparking the question. He gave the example of a woman who once came up to him and asked why there is so much suffering in the world.
When Spence asked why she was asking the question, he learned that she had been diagnosed with cancer and both of her parents had died. In that moment, he realized the importance of being there for her rather than “philosophizing.” Without asking, he wouldn’t have known.

“Sometimes people don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care,” he said. “I want to give people answers, but I always want to give people hope — and that hope is found in Jesus Christ alone.”

"Proposed CA Law Would Force Public Universities to Provide ""Free"" Chemical Abortions to Students",www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/proposed-ca-law-would-force-public-universities-to-provide-free-chemical-abortions-to-students-nbsp,"Proposed CA Law Would Force Public Universities to Provide 'Free' Chemical Abortions to Students 04-09-2019 CBN News AbortionPills
The California Senate Health Committee recently voted 7-2 to force all taxpayer-funded universities in the Golden State to appropriate the funding needed to provide ""free"" chemical abortions to students on campus by 2023.
The legislation, SB 24 , was introduced in December by state Senator Connie Leyva. It would require student health centers on all University of California and California State University campuses to offer chemical abortions to students up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, beginning in January 2023.
To fund the mandate, the measure allocates $200,000 in grant money to each of California's 33 public university student health centers, covering the costs of ""medication abortion readiness"" which includes the purchase of equipment, facility and security upgrades, and training staff members.
The bill is a revised version of a similar bill that former Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed last September stating ""it was not necessary.""
SB 24 now goes to the full state Senate for a vote and Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would support the SB 24 bill if it reaches his desk.
""California schools should be focused on educating students to make a positive difference in this nation, not handing out abortion drugs so it's easy for them to end the lives of future generations,"" Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel said in a press release. ""California laws already are some of the most hostile to unborn babies and young women in America. This horrendous bill would only ensure that more precious lives are ended,"" said Staver.
According to research from the pro-abortion Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, and the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at the University of California, San Francisco, chemical abortions are already widespread among students. The groups estimate that California public college students undergo approximately 300-500 chemical abortions each month, and with serious risks.
The drug Mifepristone/RU-486, which ends the life of the unborn child, and Misoprostol which causes severe cramping, contractions, and bleeding to expel the baby from the womb, are used together in chemical abortions.
Approximately 3.4 million women have used Mifepristone in the US for the medical termination of pregnancy through the end of December 2017, an increase of approximately 163,000 since June 2017. The FDA has documented at least 4,000 cases of serious adverse events, including more than 1,000 women who required hospitalization; in addition, at least 22 women died after using the drug."

A new study by the Cleveland Clinic reveals a diet loaded with excessive unhealthy foods is associated with one in five deaths worldwide.
The study's findings were published in the journal The Lancet .
""We know that sugar is bad and people eat 10 times as much sugar as is recommended; we know that nuts are good, and prevent disease, and people eat only 12 percent of the recommended amount of nuts; so, we're eating way too much of the bad stuff, and hardly enough of the good stuff,"" said Mark Hyman, M.D., director of the Center for Functional Medicine of Cleveland Clinic, said in a press release.
Researchers looked at dietary trends for people across 195 countries in the years between 1990 and 2017. They were looking to see if there was a connection between diet and chronic disease.
In 2017 alone, analysts found diets low in whole grains, fruits, nuts and seeds, and high in trans fats, sugary drinks, red and processed meats, were responsible for roughly 11 million deaths worldwide. Ten million of those deaths were caused by heart disease followed by cancer and Type 2 diabetes.
Out of the 195 countries studied, the US ranked 43 in the number of diet-related deaths.
The study's authors said good nutrition habits were severely lacking in all of the countries.
Dr. Hyman said instead of focusing on getting rid of bad foods, we should focus on adding nutritional ones that promote good health like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds.
""Food is the biggest contributor, globally, to chronic disease and death,"" he noted. ""I think it's important to focus on, not only what to remove – too much sugar; processed foods; junk; fast foods – but focus on what to add.

Barr told members of Congress at his first public appearance since receiving special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that his earlier projection of releasing a version by mid-April still stood. The nearly 400-page report is being scoured now to remove grand jury information and details relating to pending investigations.
The redactions will be color-coded and accompanied by notes explaining the decision to withhold information, he said.
Democrats scolded Barr over his handling of the report, telling him they were concerned that a summary of its main conclusions he released last month portrayed the investigation’s findings in an overly favorable way for President Donald Trump.
Rep. Nita Lowey, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said she was taken aback that Barr had reduced Mueller’s report to a four-page letter in just two days. That letter said that Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump associates and that Barr did not believe the evidence in the report was sufficient to prove the president had obstructed justice.
“Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it’s more suspicious than impressive,” Lowey said.
Explaining the rapid turnaround for his letter, Barr said, “The thinking of the special counsel was not a mystery to the Department of Justice prior to the submission of the report.”
Barr was summoned to Congress to talk about his department’s budget request, but lawmakers still asked about the Mueller report as they waited to see it. Barr’s opening remarks focused on funding requests for immigration enforcement and the fights against violent crime and opioid addiction, not mentioning the special counsel’s report at all.
Barr would not discuss the substance of Mueller’s findings but did explain his process for receiving and reviewing the report. He said he had offered Mueller the chance to review his four-page letter, but that Mueller declined. Asked about reports that members of Mueller’s team were unhappy with his handling of the report, Barr said he suspected any discontent may have reflected their desire to put out more information.
“I felt I should state bottom-line conclusions, and I tried to use special counsel Mueller’s own language in doing that,” he said.
Barr also said that he could be open to releasing some redacted details after consulting with congressional leaders, though he said he did not have plans to ask a court for permission to disclose secret grand jury testimony.
Mueller sent his final report to Barr on March 22, ending his almost two-year investigation into possible ties between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Barr released a four-page letter summarizing the report two days later and said he would release a redacted version of the full report by mid-April, “if not sooner.”
The new attorney general’s budget testimony — traditionally a dry affair, and often addressing the parochial concerns of lawmakers — came as Democrats were enraged that he was redacting material from the report and frustrated that his summary framed a narrative about Trump before they were able to see the full version.
The Democrats are demanding that they see the full report and all its underlying evidence, though Trump and his Republican allies are pushing back.
The chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee, Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano of New York, told Barr there were “serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report.”
Barr said in the summary released last month that Mueller didn’t find a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin. He also said that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice, instead presenting evidence on both sides of the question. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided that the evidence was insufficient to establish obstruction.
Facing the intensifying concerns from Democrats that he may have whitewashed Mueller’s findings, Barr has twice moved to defend or at least explain, his handling of the process since receiving the special counsel’s report. He has said that he did not intend for his four-page summary of Mueller’s main conclusions to be an “exhaustive recounting” of his work and that he could not immediately release the entire report because it included grand jury material and other sensitive information that needed to be redacted.
He is likely to be asked to further explain himself at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday that is also on the budget.
Barr is to testify on the report itself at separate hearings before the Senate and House Judiciary committees on May 1 and May 2. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and chairman of the House Judiciary panel, confirmed the May 2 date on Twitter and said he would like Mueller to testify.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said he would be satisfied hearing only from Barr and not Mueller.

New polling has revealed half of American pastors are too concerned they might offend someone to speak out on hot-button social and moral issues, but could that problem have a simple fix?
According to research from the Barna Group , the same issues pastors feel most pressured to preach about are also the ones they feel most uncomfortable addressing.
It should come as no surprise the issues at the top of the heap are homosexuality and abortion. New from @BarnaGroup : Half of U.S. pastors are concerned they might offend someone when preaching on hot-button issues, but they also feel pressure to preach on those topics. https://t.co/dgs6R7AxUh pic.twitter.com/OFy2gnh6NL

“The pressure for leaders, and especially faith leaders, to satisfy everyone on all sides and to avoid offense is very real today, especially in the digital era,” said Roxanne Stone, editor-in-chief of Barna. “The public nature of social media only increases the stakes.”
The majority of the push and pull pastors feel is coming from inside the congregations they lead.
Survey: Americans Concerned About Country’s Moral Crisis, But Still Turning Away from God
Most of the pastors polled — 64 percent — said they feel limited by their own church members in their capacity to speak out on social and moral topics. By contrast, 69 percent feel pressured to address those same issues from the pulpit.
Michael Howard, senior pastor of Seaford Baptist Church in Virginia, explained in an interview with Faithwire that pastors — like everyone else — wrestle with the desire for acceptance.
“I think a lot of guys probably have thought, ‘I don’t wanna hurt my approval rating,’” he said. “It’s the same reason presidents don’t do everything they said they were gonna do.”
Is There a Fix?
One of the best ways to ensure ministers don’t skirt difficult topics, such as sexual ethics and the dignity of human life, is for pastors to preach expositorily instead of topically, according to Howard, because Bible-driven preaching “forces preachers to deal with hard things.”
From that perspective, he said, it’s easier to stay true to Scripture and preach the entire Gospel, even if it offends congregants’ sensibilities.
“God has designed us to desire perimeters, whether we know it or not,” Howard said. “I think if you stand up in the pulpit and you are honest and transparent and you say, ‘This is as far as the Bible says we can go in belief and behavior,’ people are actually hungry for that and drawn to it.”
That truth, though, doesn’t always quench the desire to be accepted.
Christians Should Embrace Offensive Situations In Our Hypersensitive Culture
Half of Christian ministry leaders said they “frequently” (11 percent) or “occasionally” (39 percent) feel limited in their ability to speak out on hot-button topics. The other half said they “only rarely” (30 percent) or “never” (20 percent) feel limited.
The majority of pastors said they “rarely” (43 percent) or “never” (17 percent) feel pressure to address leading social and moral issues from the pulpit. One-third of ministers, or 34 percent, said they “occasionally” feel pressured and only 6 percent said they “frequently” feel the same way.
Howard, who studied at a very progressive college for his undergraduate degree before attending seminary at a very conservative university, said the fact he’s been exposed to “both sides of the conversation” has better equipped him for ministry.
In 2016, megachurch pastor and televangelist Joel Osteen told CBS News he doesn’t often address sin and hell because people “already feel guilty enough.” But that approach — even if it extinguishes the fear of addressing hot-button topics — entirely misses the mark.

Howard said a minister’s job “is to preach the full counsel of the Word, in season and out of season. This is the job that a pastor has.”
“When I come to the pulpit,” he said, “I always try to think about my unbelieving friends, and if they were sitting front row and center, how would I talk about [different social issues].”
If pastors approach difficult topics with humility, Howard believes most people will respect them, because they’re being “honest.”"

(Image courtesy: PureFlix Insider)
After nearly two decades as a pastor, speaker, and Christian leader, Shane Pruitt has discovered some of the pervasive “lies” that too many people of faith have come to believe. And he’s on a mission to right these theological wrongs in an effort to stop misplaced beliefs from holding people back in their faith.
Pruitt, who recently released a new book titled, 9 Common Lies Christians Believe: And Why God's Truth Is Infinitely Better , recently told “The Pure Flix Podcast” about how these common cliches and proclamations have had a negative impact on the faithful.

“There’s these one-liners, these cliches that we … have adopted into the Christian community, baptized them and have made them a part of our vernacular,” Pruitt said.”But they’re not necessarily biblically true, and they’re actually lies that will hold us back in our faith .”
Among the lies some Christians believe, though, is one that perhaps has the most pervasive impact. It can be found in the popular adage: “Follow your heart.”
“There’s one lie that is at the bedrock or foundation of all these other lies,” Pruitt said, noting that it is the lie that tells people they’re in control or that they are at the center of their own universe. It’s a lie that culture values — but one that is totally and utterly false.
“Who is the center of your universe?” he asked. “Is it you or is it Christ?”
Pruitt shared his own personal story to illustrate why he started becoming more interested in exploring the lies too many Christians have come to believe. His journey started with his son, Titus, whom he and his wife adopted from Uganda.
Titus’ birth was traumatic, and the boy was faced with a great deal of medical issues.
“[His mom] died during childbirth and so by the time Titus was brought into a clinic from way out of town he was almost in a comatose state,” Pruitt said, noting that there were many complications and health woes. “But we didn’t know the severity of those needs until we got back to the states.”
It wasn’t until Titus was brought to a hospital in the U.S. that the Pruitts learned he had a severe seizure disorder and cerebral palsy. These diagnoses left much uncertainty, as Pruitt and his wife didn’t know what Titus’ future would be like.
“That just hit us with a ton of bricks,” he said. “For an entire year of him being at home, multiple surgeries, multiple doctors visits … I was pastoring a fast-growing church at that time. I had to pretend on the outside like everything was great.”
Meanwhile, his wife suffered from anxiety over all that was unfolding, with the couple feeling pressure to “keep it all together.” But rather than continue on that path, the Pruitts had to make a decision to take a healthy approach to deal with the situation.
READ ALSO: Feeling Hopeless? Pastor Tony Evans Has a Solution
“We just turned back to the basics of God’s word and we admitted that we were not okay,” he said, noting that their decision to be so open inspired others to also be transparent.
Pruitt said the experience left him and his wife re-considering a theological belief that has been embraced by far too many: that “God won’t give you more than you can handle.” The couple realized that this simply isn’t an accurate view to take from scripture.
“Yeah, sometimes it is more than we can handle, but that drives us to faith ,” he said. “By faith you take that pressure off your shoulders, you put it on the shoulders of the Lord.”
From there, Pruitt started drafting a broader list of lies, which formed the basis for 9 Common Lies Christians Believe . In the end, he’s hoping to inspire people to go deeper in their faith.
“Faith is not saying, ‘Alright God, once I understand it then I’ll trust you,’ That’s not faith,” Pruitt said. “Faith is saying, ‘I don’t get it. I don’t understand it… I might not like it, but God, I trust you, because you’re doing all things for your glory and my good .”

What if prayer was more than a word spoken and worship more than lyrics woven together by a melody?
That’s the question artist Scott Erickson, known on Instagram simply as “Scott the Painter,” has ventured to answer over the years, particularly with his recent book, “ Prayer: Forty Days of Practice ,” which he co-authored with writer Justin McRoberts.
Through his book and via Instagram, Erickson invites struggling and strong believers — those looking for fresh ways to connect with the same God — to explore how we can communicate with and hear from the Lord through art. A post shared by Scott Erickson (@scottthepainter) on Mar 1, 2019 at 11:28am PST
The traditional mechanics of prayer and worship just weren’t working anymore for Erickson, a full-time artist who gained notoriety about three years ago, when he decided to start posting his work on Instagram.
No longer confident in what had become comfortable, he recycled the mundane in favor of something new: Erickson began connecting with the same Ancient of Days in perhaps the most timeless way, through art.
So often, we confuse the mechanics, Erickson said, with the “essence” of prayer. Looking for different methods to communicate his faith and to express his innermost joys and sorrows, he began to use social media for what he calls “spiritual formation through image contemplation.”
“We say, ‘I’ve gotta pray this way and that way,’” he said. “But the mechanics are there to get you to the essence. When the mechanics stop working, move on. Find mechanics that work — that’s not the point.”
Scripture Predicted the ‘Burnout’ Millennials Are Experiencing
Erickson’s comments are juxtaposed with a culture painted by declining faith. Over the years, church attendance has consistently slipped and almost half of millennials describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated, wandering about, unmoored by any deep faith.
That problem is only made worse by the fact that, for many, the traditional mechanisms of prayer and worship — hands folded, eyes closed, hands raised, music playing — just aren’t getting the job done. It’s like a car running and ready to go — God is actively and intimately moving in our lives — but, for whatever reason, the keys just aren’t unlocking the doors for us to get inside.
“What people are trying to hold onto is their love of the mechanics,” Erickson said, adding he doesn’t want to do away with those practices but instead wants to incorporate others alongside them.
As an artist, one of Erickson’s mechanics for prayer is imagery — a tool he said more people in the Christian community should be open to embracing.
The West Coast native said his art coupled in his new book with McRoberts’ poetic, one-sentence prayers are just “excavation tools” to help the lost finally tap into what God is already doing in their lives.
“Imagery is just really another language to get to that because you can have words land in you but you can also see something that also really lands in you and helps you get to that,” he said, noting so few in evangelical circles see how art and imagery can be spiritually formative.
Christians Should Embrace Offensive Situations In Our Hypersensitive Culture
Catholic and Orthodox traditions, Erickson explained, have continued to use art as a teacher in their spaces, but following the Reformation, Protestants began to make “space for a teacher but we stopped making spaces as a teacher.”
“We just don’t really understand how imagery can be a teacher for us informing us,” he said. “Justin and I wanted to partner those two things together because then it causes a different conversation.”
McRoberts and Erickson are stepping into what is for some people a very real spiritual vacancy. Erickson said he’s received emails from people who told him, “I had all but given up on my faith, but your stuff has helped me find something new.”

Pro-Life Movement Wins Big in Kentucky as Court Upholds State's Ultrasound Law,www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/pro-life-movement-wins-big-in-kentucky-as-court-upholds-states-ultrasound-law,"Pro-lifers in Kentucky are rejoicing after a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the state's Ultrasound Informed Consent Act. The act requires abortionists to grant women the opportunity to see their ultrasound images of their unborn child and play the audio of the child's heartbeat before performing the abortion.
Originally blocked by US District Court Judge David Hale in 2017 when passed, the law is now able to be enforced.
""Today is a historic day, as Kentucky continues to lead the charge in implementing strong pro-life protections for its citizens,"" stated Gov. Matt Bevin (R-KY) according to LifeSite . ""We applaud the decision by the Sixth Circuit, which affirms the commonsense notion that patients should be well equipped with relevant information before making important medical decisions.""
""I am grateful to be governor of a state that values every human life,"" he continued. ""And we are committed to continue our fight on behalf of the most vulnerable among us.""
In the court hearing Thursday, Judge John Bush, one of the three appellate judges and an appointee of President Donald Trump, stated, ""Are the mandated disclosures truthful and not misleading? Yes—no one argues that the heartbeat, sonogram, or its description is false or misleading.""
""That leaves the final question: Are the mandated disclosures relevant to the patient's decision whether to abort unborn life?"" he added. ""The Supreme Court's abortion precedent answers this question for us.""
The abortion precedent he is discussing is the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey and 2018's National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, where the US Supreme Court held ""that the First Amendment has a limited role to play in allowing doctors to avoid making truthful mandated disclosures related to informed consent,"" and the ultrasound law ""provides relevant information"" that ""gives a patient greater knowledge of the unborn life inside her.""
""This also inherently provides the patient with more knowledge about the effect of an abortion procedure: it shows her what, or whom, she is consenting to terminate,"" Bush continued. ""That this information might persuade a woman to change her mind does not render it suspect under the First Amendment. It just means that it is pertinent to her decision-making.""
Judge Alan Norris, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, joined Judge Bush in his ruling. Judge Bernice Donald, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, differed by stating the law ""eviscerates physician discretion"" to decide what ""truthful, non-misleading, and relevant information"" to share with patients according to LifeSite. She went on to say the requirement had ""no basis in the practice of medicine.""
The act went to court after the progressive American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the state on behalf of a Louisville abortion facility, EMW Women's Surgical Center. It was the first of two lawsuits by the ACLU against pro-life measures in Kentucky.
The ACLU recently announced a second lawsuit after the GOP-led Senate voted 32-4 to send a new pro-life bill to Gov. Matt Bevin last month. That legislation bans abortion for women seeking to terminate their pregnancies on the basis of the baby's gender, race or disability such as Down syndrome.
Gov. Bevin had responded to the organization after they made the announcement last month.
""Bring it! Kentucky will always fight for life..."" tweeted Gov. Bevin. ""Always #WeAreProLife #WeAreKY.""
Bring it!
Kentucky will always fight for life...
Always! #WeAreProLife #WeAreKY https://t.co/Qioq9iEQb8

"Proposed CA Law Would Force Public Universities to Provide ""Free"" Chemical Abortions to Students",www.cbn.com,CBN News,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/proposed-ca-law-would-force-public-universities-to-provide-free-chemical-abortions-to-students-nbsp,"The California Senate Health Committee recently voted 7-2 to force all taxpayer-funded universities in the Golden State to appropriate the funding needed to provide ""free"" chemical abortions to students on campus by 2023.
The legislation, SB 24 , was introduced in December by state Senator Connie Leyva. It would require student health centers on all University of California and California State University campuses to offer chemical abortions to students up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, beginning in January 2023.
To fund the mandate, the measure allocates $200,000 in grant money to each of California's 33 public university student health centers, covering the costs of ""medication abortion readiness"" which includes the purchase of equipment, facility and security upgrades, and training staff members.
The bill is a revised version of a similar bill that former Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed last September stating ""it was not necessary.""
SB 24 now goes to the full state Senate for a vote and Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would support the SB 24 bill if it reaches his desk.
""California schools should be focused on educating students to make a positive difference in this nation, not handing out abortion drugs so it's easy for them to end the lives of future generations,"" Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel said in a press release. ""California laws already are some of the most hostile to unborn babies and young women in America. This horrendous bill would only ensure that more precious lives are ended,"" said Staver.
According to research from the pro-abortion Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, and the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at the University of California, San Francisco, chemical abortions are already widespread among students. The groups estimate that California public college students undergo approximately 300-500 chemical abortions each month, and with serious risks.
The drug Mifepristone/RU-486, which ends the life of the unborn child, and Misoprostol which causes severe cramping, contractions, and bleeding to expel the baby from the womb, are used together in chemical abortions.
Approximately 3.4 million women have used Mifepristone in the US for the medical termination of pregnancy through the end of December 2017, an increase of approximately 163,000 since June 2017. The FDA has documented at least 4,000 cases of serious adverse events, including more than 1,000 women who required hospitalization; in addition, at least 22 women died after using the drug."
'Assault on the Rights of Parents': MA Bans Same-Sex Attraction Therapy Among Healthcare Providers,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/assault-on-the-rights-of-parents-ma-bans-same-sex-attraction-therapy-among-healthcare-providers,"Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has signed a new law banning licensed health care professionals from trying to help patients under age 18 who struggle with same-sex attraction.
The move blocks health care providers from trying to ""change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.""
Health care professionals are also not allowed to advertise sexual orientation change efforts.
Anyone who violates the law will be subject to punishment, including suspension or revocation of their medical license.
Massachusetts is the 13th state to pass such a law.
Democratic state Rep. Kay Khan authored the legislation and said it will protect that well-being of LGBTQ minors.
""This bill will ensure that children receive therapy in a healthy, evidence-based and medically sound manner, not one which fosters an atmosphere of self-hate, prejudice and intolerance,"" Khan said. ""Massachusetts has always been a trailblazer in advancing civil rights and eliminating discrimination in health care settings for the LGBTQ community. This bill is a necessary extension of these historic commitments.""
Meanwhile, Republican state Rep. Shawn Dooley argued the bill violates the free speech rights of medical professionals.
""The reality is we are legislating what can be said between a doctor and his patient in the sanctity of that relationship,"" Dooley said. ""Let's say an 8-year-old boy comes in and says, 'I'm an 8-year-old girl.' Maybe that therapist — and many therapists I've spoken to have brought this up — wants to push back a little bit. Maybe that child isn't transgender, maybe that child's gay, maybe that child's bi. Why not give every opportunity for that therapist to explore that? Why can't the therapist say, 'No, you're not?'""
The conservative Massachusetts Family Institute's President and General Counsel Andrew Beckwith said, ""MFI will pursue legal action against the Counseling Ban to defend the constitutional rights of parents and counselors in our Commonwealth.""
""This law is an extraordinarily invasive assault on the rights of parents to raise their children and a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech for the counselors whose help they seek,"" the group said in a previous statement.
Last night, Governor Baker signed the #CounselingBan into law. Sadly, it is already having exactly the tragic consequences we predicted.

Suspect Accused of Plotting Islamic Terror Attack to Plow Down US Crowds of People,www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/suspect-captured-accused-of-plotting-islamic-terror-attack-to-plow-down-us-crowds-of-people,"Federal officials say they have a suspect in custody, accused of plotting to drive a stolen truck into crowds of people. The Justice Department says 28-year-old Rondell Henry was inspired online by the radical Islamic group ISIS to commit mass murder.
On March 26, Henry allegedly stole a U-Haul truck and drove around Washington, DC, looking for crowds to target. He finally decided on the National Harbor Waterfront in Maryland, an area popular with tourists and families. The crowds were thin, so he parked the truck to return the next day to perform the attack.
The following day officers found the stolen truck, and on the 28th they arrested Henry after they saw him jumping over a security fence. Prosecutors in Maryland have asked the judge to keep Henry detained on a charge of driving a stolen vehicle across state lines.
""The defendant, inspired by the ISIS terrorist organization and prepared to die for his cause, stole a vehicle with the intent of 'plowing it through a crowd full of people' at the National Harbor,"" prosecutors said. ""He must be detained pending trial.""
Leaving his job in the middle of the day, he stole the U-Haul truck from a Virginia mall parking garage after realizing his four-door sedan ""would not cause the catastrophic damage that he desired.""
""I was just going to keep driving and driving and driving. I wasn't going to stop,"" the Associated Press reports a document with Henry's statements.
Henry went on to say he wanted to cause ""panic and chaos"" like the deadly truck attack that killed people in Nice, France in 2016.
Henry was taken for a psychiatric evaluation then into FBI custody. Prosecutors are expected to share new evidence that could add on multiple charges to his charge of interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, which carries up to 10 years in prison.
The government's detention motion states Henry as harboring hatred for ""disbelievers"" of the Islamic faith. Also, Henry is reported to have continually watched ISIS beheading and fighting videos. Prosecutors found images of the ISIS flag, armed ISIS fighters, and the man who committed the Orlando nightclub massacre in 2016 on his phone.
Initially, he desired to perform the attack at Dulles International Airport. However, he was not successful in breaching the security perimeter after two hours. He then headed to the National Harbor where there are multiple restaurants, retail and hotels.
""But so early in the morning on a weekday,"" prosecutors wrote , ""the defendant did not find the sizable crowd upon which he desired to inflict his radical conduct."""
PA School Board Decrees 'In God We Trust' Can Be Displayed in Local Schools,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/pa-school-board-decrees-in-god-we-trust-can-be-displayed-in-local-schools,"The Greencastle-Antrim School Board in Greencastle, PA has voted unanimously to allow the national motto ""In God We Trust"" and other documents from US history to be displayed in foyers and other public areas of the district's primary, elementary, middle and high schools.
Teachers can also place the motto in their classrooms, as well, along with copies of the US Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.
Herald-Mail Media reports last month, the school board approved the request of Tom McCloud of Waynesboro, PA, to display the national motto and other documents in the district's schools.
McCloud also volunteered to coordinate funding from groups in the local community to have the motto and documents printed and framed at no cost for the district's schools and classrooms.
The board also passed a resolution saying it desires to display the motto and documents because they serve patriotic, historical, educational and solemnizing purposes.
""We have these documents already displayed in some of the schools,"" said school board President Mike Still, who said he received one email against the board taking the action. ""It's historical. I don't know if we should ever run away from history.""
McCloud successfully spearheaded another similar campaign in the Waynesboro Area School District in 2016 to have the National Motto posted in schools and local municipal offices, according to Herald-Mail Media .
""I made it my mission to get it in as many schools as possible,"" McCloud said last month.
""In God We Trust"" is the official motto of the United States of America. It was adopted as the US motto in 1956 as a replacement or alternative to the unofficial Latin motto of ""E Pluribus Unum"" (""Out of many, one"") which was adopted when the Great Seal of the United States was created and adopted in 1782, according to Wikipedia .
""In God We Trust"" first appeared on the two-cent piece in 1864 during the American Civil War and has appeared on US paper currency since 1957.
""If you don't teach it, people won't know it,"" McCloud said. ""I feel strongly the message has to be spread."""
'God's Hand at Work': Franklin Graham Hosting Facebook Live with 'Unplanned' Actress Ashley Bratcher,www.cbn.com,Charlene Aaron,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/gods-hand-at-work-franklin-graham-hosting-facebook-live-with-unplanned-actress-ashley-bratcher,"Click the player above to watch Franklin Graham's Facebook Live interview with actress Ashley Bratcher.
The pro-life film ""Unplanned,"" which premiered in theaters March 29, has continued to surpass box office expectations.
The success comes despite the movie's R-rating for what the Motion Picture Association of America called ""some disturbing/bloody images.""
The film, about the life of former Planned Parenthood Director Abby Johnson, finished in the top 10 at the box office for the second weekend in a row.
Many are praising the film which seeks to expose the truth about abortion. And supporters say the R-rating is proof that abortion is a truly violent act committed against a defenseless person.
In a tweet on April 1, Vice President Mike Pence tweeted, ""So good to see movie theaters across the country showing @UnplannedMovie - a deeply inspiring new pro-life film based on the best-selling book by @AbbyJohnson. More and more Americans are embracing the sanctity of life because of powerful stories like this one. #Unplanned.""

Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz also shared his support for Unplanned. ""I thought I was prepared for this movie, but I was not,"" Cruz tweeted. ""It is breathtakingly powerful. Deeply disturbing, but also inspiring.""

Franklin Graham hosted a Facebook Live interview with actress Ashley Bratcher Tuesday night. Bratcher portrays Johnson in the film.
""It was great to welcome Ashley Bratcher to Boone, NC, today to sit down and talk about the new movie Unplanned that has shattered box office expectations,"" Graham wrote on Facebook. ""Ashley plays the part of former Planned Parenthood Clinic Director Abby Johnson in this powerful true story.""
Bratcher revealed to CBN News while she was filming the movie, that her mother had almost aborted her.
""She said 'I'm going to tell you something that I haven't told you before,"" shared Bratcher. ""And she said to me 'I was in the clinic. I had my name called. I went back. I was being examined by a woman who was very pregnant, and I was on the table and that was when I changed my mind.'""
""To hear I was seconds away from not existing, and then also to know that here I am telling Abby's Johnson's story, it's so clear to me and evident that God's hand at work is present on this project,"" said Bratcher.
Graham went on to encourage his followers to see the film.
""Please make it a point to go to the theater and watch Unplanned—take your family and church, and encourage your church groups to go,"" he said. ""This movie pulls back the curtain on many of the lies about abortion."
Instagram Artist Shows How Changing the ‘Mechanics’ of Prayer Can Change Your Life,www.cbn.com,"Tré Goins-Phillips, Faithwire",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/instagram-artist-shows-how-changing-the-lsquo-mechanics-rsquo-of-prayer-can-change-your-life,"What if prayer was more than a word spoken and worship more than lyrics woven together by a melody?
That’s the question artist Scott Erickson, known on Instagram simply as “Scott the Painter,” has ventured to answer over the years, particularly with his recent book, “ Prayer: Forty Days of Practice ,” which he co-authored with writer Justin McRoberts.
Through his book and via Instagram, Erickson invites struggling and strong believers — those looking for fresh ways to connect with the same God — to explore how we can communicate with and hear from the Lord through art.
View this post on Instagram Listening to the Voice of God is listening to the Voice of Love... and I don’t know anyone that is all filled up on that. . . The Lenten season starts next week... and it’s 40 days to listen deeply to the voice of Love. My friend @justinmcroberts and I created an excavation tool in @40daysprayerbook that helps get to that conversation. . . Click the profile link in @40daysprayerbook and get this book for this season. It won’t help you lose weight, have more sex, or make you rich. But it does help you hear the Voice of Love in your life.
A post shared by Scott Erickson (@scottthepainter) on Mar 1, 2019 at 11:28am PST
The traditional mechanics of prayer and worship just weren’t working anymore for Erickson, a full-time artist who gained notoriety about three years ago, when he decided to start posting his work on Instagram.
No longer confident in what had become comfortable, he recycled the mundane in favor of something new: Erickson began connecting with the same Ancient of Days in perhaps the most timeless way, through art.
So often, we confuse the mechanics, Erickson said, with the “essence” of prayer. Looking for different methods to communicate his faith and to express his innermost joys and sorrows, he began to use social media for what he calls “spiritual formation through image contemplation.”
“We say, ‘I’ve gotta pray this way and that way,’” he said. “But the mechanics are there to get you to the essence. When the mechanics stop working, move on. Find mechanics that work — that’s not the point.”
Scripture Predicted the ‘Burnout’ Millennials Are Experiencing
Erickson’s comments are juxtaposed with a culture painted by declining faith. Over the years, church attendance has consistently slipped and almost half of millennials describe themselves as religiously unaffiliated, wandering about, unmoored by any deep faith.
That problem is only made worse by the fact that, for many, the traditional mechanisms of prayer and worship — hands folded, eyes closed, hands raised, music playing — just aren’t getting the job done. It’s like a car running and ready to go — God is actively and intimately moving in our lives — but, for whatever reason, the keys just aren’t unlocking the doors for us to get inside.
“What people are trying to hold onto is their love of the mechanics,” Erickson said, adding he doesn’t want to do away with those practices but instead wants to incorporate others alongside them.
As an artist, one of Erickson’s mechanics for prayer is imagery — a tool he said more people in the Christian community should be open to embracing.
The West Coast native said his art coupled in his new book with McRoberts’ poetic, one-sentence prayers are just “excavation tools” to help the lost finally tap into what God is already doing in their lives.
“Imagery is just really another language to get to that because you can have words land in you but you can also see something that also really lands in you and helps you get to that,” he said, noting so few in evangelical circles see how art and imagery can be spiritually formative.
Christians Should Embrace Offensive Situations In Our Hypersensitive Culture
Catholic and Orthodox traditions, Erickson explained, have continued to use art as a teacher in their spaces, but following the Reformation, Protestants began to make “space for a teacher but we stopped making spaces as a teacher.”
“We just don’t really understand how imagery can be a teacher for us informing us,” he said. “Justin and I wanted to partner those two things together because then it causes a different conversation.”
McRoberts and Erickson are stepping into what is for some people a very real spiritual vacancy. Erickson said he’s received emails from people who told him, “I had all but given up on my faith, but your stuff has helped me find something new.”

Missing for Two Years: Investigators Confirm Pastor Kidnapped by Special Police,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/missing-for-two-years-investigators-confirm-pastor-kidnapped-by-special-police,"After a two-year investigation, Malaysia's Human Rights Commission has determined a missing Malaysian pastor was abducted by members of a special police unit for allegedly trying to persuade Muslims to embrace Christianity.
The Baptist Press reports the family of 63-year-old Raymond Koh – who was abducted in February 2017 in Kuala Lumpur by a group of masked men – hopes he is still alive and that the Malaysian government will continue its investigation.
CCTV footage captured the moment of Koh's kidnapping in which 15 masked men in five unmarked vehicles are seen. Koh's abduction took a total of 42 seconds. He has not been seen or heard from since.
Koh pastored an Evangelical Free Church of Malaysia for 20 years before founding Harapan Komuniti in Malaysia in 2004, a community-based charity outreach to single mothers, drug addicts, and HIV/AIDS victims.
Koh's wife Susanna and their three adult children ""are just glad that this investigation has really proved what they already knew: that there was police involvement in this forced disappearance of Pastor Raymond,"" Greg Wilton, missions pastor at Long Hollow Baptist Church in Hendersonville, TN, told the Baptist Press . ""...Now they are very hopeful there will be some legitimate investigation and hopefully even taking to trial of some key figures that have been a part of this.""
Malaysia's National Human Rights Commission announced April 3 that circumstantial and direct evidence suggest Koh and Shiite Muslim activist Amri Che Mat both fell prey to ""enforced disappearance by state agents"" from the national police special branch over matters against Islam, according to media reports. Special Branch is the intelligence arm of the police force, according to Reuters .
The rights panel has little legal authority, and its burden of proof is less than required in Malaysian courts, the media outlet noted.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the government will reinvestigate both disappearances if the human rights commission can produce evidence to support its claims, The Associated Press reported. The prime minister, who was elected in 2018, noted both disappearances occurred under a previous government.
The former home minister, who oversaw police, has denied ordering the police to abduct Koh or Amri. The former national police chief denied the special branch was involved, according to the AP . Still, the retired judge who headed the three-member investigating commission said the evidence of police involvement is ""heinous and despicable.""
Koh was ""a mighty servant of the Lord who did everything for the Lord Jesus,"" Wilton said. The family covets believers' prayers and knows ""nothing will separate them from the love of Christ.""
The majority of Malaysia's population is Muslim. But the country also has Christian, Buddhist and Hindu communities. Leaving the Muslim faith is considered both a sin and a crime by Islamic authorities, and evangelizing Muslims is outlawed.
The human rights commission also hopes to investigate the 2016 disappearances of Christian preachers and former Muslims Joshua and Ruth Hilmi, according to media reports.

Can You Really Trust the Bible? A Thought-Provoking Response to Atheists,www.cbn.com,"Billy Hallowell, Pureflix.com",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/can-you-really-trust-the-bible-a-thought-provoking-response-to-atheists,"Can human beings truly trust the Bible? Is it reliable? One of the most frequent criticisms made by atheists and skeptics against the Old and New Testaments is that the texts are dated, antiquated and contradictory — and that they are a collection of books written by mere men.
But Mark Spence, vice president of outreach at California-based Christian ministry Living Waters , believes it’s entirely possible to put these critiques to rest, and that Christians shouldn’t be afraid to engage with those who question the merits of their faith.
READ ALSO: Want to Know How to Answer Atheists? Check This Out
“Christianity’s intelligent. We have all the answers on our side,” he recently told PureFlix.com’s “Pure Talk.” “We don’t need to run away.”
Spence believes “we can trust the Bible,” and he pointed to its interconnected history and reliable contents to bolster his point.
“This is not one book. This is 66 books written over a period of 1,500 years, by 40 different authors, three different continents with one central main theme: How does man avoid hell and come into relationship with his maker?” he said.
Watch Spence break down the Bible’s reliability below:
Spence is slated to equip Christians to learn more about the Bible when he speaks at the PureFlix.com sponsored Answering Atheist conference (April 17-21) this Easter at the Ark Encounter attraction in Williamstown, Kentucky. It’s a conference that promises “four days of solid biblical teaching to equip you to stand confidently on God’s word.”
“We are going to come together and give people … some very practical ammunition to really think through their worldview — defend their worldview and be on the offense,” Spence said.
He noted that a young man once approached him and questioned why someone would trust in the Bible, especially since it’s a book written by men.

“I said, ‘Well, you’re a man. Are you saying I can’t trust anything you say?’” Spence recounted, noting that the young man then said it’s more about being skeptical of things that have been put into writing.
From there, Spence asked how the man proves his age to others, and the teen said he has a license and birth certificate. That’s when the apologist noted that these items — much like the biblical text — were encoded in writing. His point? These arguments don’t pass muster.
He also addressed another barrier some find to God: The existence of pain. Spence said it’s important to try and understand the motivation behind a question like, “Why does God allow pain?”
“When someone asks me a question I usually respond with, ‘Why do you ask?,’” he said, noting that this helps him understand what’s really sparking the question. He gave the example of a woman who once came up to him and asked why there is so much suffering in the world.
When Spence asked why she was asking the question, he learned that she had been diagnosed with cancer and both of her parents had died. In that moment, he realized the importance of being there for her rather than “philosophizing.” Without asking, he wouldn’t have known.

“Sometimes people don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care,” he said. “I want to give people answers, but I always want to give people hope — and that hope is found in Jesus Christ alone.”

Credit Monitoring Vs. Identity Theft Protection: How Credit Alerts and Identity Alerts Differ,www.cbn.com,MoneyTips,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/credit-monitoring-vs-identity-theft-protection-how-credit-alerts-and-identity-alerts-differ,"You know you need to protect your accounts and personal information – but what is the best method? Should you use a credit monitoring service or subscribe to identity theft protection instead? What's the difference between the two methods?
Credit monitoring services do exactly what they say they do – monitor activity on your accounts with the major credit reporting agencies (TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax). Creditors report all activities related to borrowing money, including your payment history, to credit reporting agencies. Monitoring services may monitor your history with all three agencies or be exclusive to a certain agency.
With credit monitoring, you're alerted to various changes in your credit report – for example, when a potential creditor asks for your credit history or when new credit card accounts or loans are opened in your name. Any activity that is reported to the credit reporting agency is monitored.
However, identity theft can involve more than fraudulent loans or credit accounts in your name. Thieves can use your Social Security number and other personal information to open bank accounts, get jobs, receive government benefits – even commit crimes in your name. None of these activities will show up on your credit report because borrowing is not involved.
Identity theft protection services incorporate credit monitoring and go beyond to check for non-credit related abuses of your information – or let you know that your compromised information is out there, available to thieves for future abuse. Monitoring may include dark web scans, arrest records, court filings, changes of address, and social media accounts.
Identity theft protection services may also include help to restore your identity and resolve fraudulent uses and claims, as well as identity theft insurance. Services and fees vary by vendor. Check the details of any program before signing up. Let MoneyTips protect your credit and identity theft with a 7-day free trial .
Victims of security breaches often receive free credit monitoring or identity protection services for a limited period of time – but the protections from these programs may not be sufficient. You need long-term protection, especially once your personal data has been compromised. You can always cancel accounts and change passwords, but once your Social Security number is compromised, you are in for a lifelong battle with identity thieves.
If identity theft protection generally includes credit monitoring, why would you opt for credit monitoring alone? Cost could be a factor, along with any extra services that the credit monitoring service provides that an identity theft service does not. Evaluate your options as a full package to get the best comparison. If you would like to monitor your credit and see your credit reports and scores, join MoneyTips .
Note that most credit monitoring and identity theft protection services are reactive, not proactive. They let you know when suspicious activity has occurred, but they can't prevent it from happening. You can supplement either service by using common-sense proactive tactics .
Use strong passwords on all your accounts and change them often. Shred any sensitive information before discarding it. Protect all electronic devices with up-to-date anti-virus software. Avoid e-mail scams and suspicious requests for information. Store your personal information in as few places as possible. Check your credit frequently, and consider a credit freeze on your accounts to prevent thieves from opening fraudulent accounts in your name.
Help either service by making it more difficult for identity thieves to get your information, or to use your information if they do get it.
Review the details of each type of service and find the best fit for your comprehensive protection strategy. Just make sure that you follow through with whatever protection you choose. Identity thieves look for the easiest unprotected targets. Don't be one of them.

It's STILL Not Too Late To Lower Your Tax Bill: April 15 is More Than Just the Tax Deadline,www.cbn.com,MoneyTips,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/its-still-not-too-late-to-lower-your-tax-bill-april-15-is-more-than-just-the-tax-deadline,"Are you a procrastinator who waits until the very last moment to file your taxes? The filing deadline is April 15, 2019, to file your taxes for the 2018 tax year, unless you live in Maine or Massachusetts. Due to the Patriots' Day holiday celebrated on April 15 in those states, and the Emancipation Day holiday on April 16 in the District of Columbia, that gives you a few extra days to consider last-minute ways to lower your taxes.
Start by reviewing your possible deductions. Did you just assume that it doesn't pay to itemize? Check out these 19 top tax deductions , and while you're at it, look over these 9 popular tax credits . Tax credits subtract directly from your tax bill instead of reducing your taxable income, and some are refundable (meaning that you may receive a refund even if it's more than the taxes that you owe).
The Deadline for Annual Retirement Contributions
You can also use retirement fund contributions to lower your taxes significantly. Annual contribution limits to IRAs are $5,500 with an extra $1,000 in ""catch-up"" contributions if you are over age 50. You can make contributions until the tax-filing deadline for that year, so contributions for the 2018 tax year may be made until April 15, 2019. (Make sure that your contribution is designated for the 2018 tax year, not 2019.)
You can even open a traditional IRA before the tax-filing deadline of April 15, 2019, and apply the contributions to your 2018 taxes. (You could also open a Roth IRA, but since they are created with after-tax funds, you won't save anything on your taxes.)
Rules for 401(k)s are less straightforward. Generally, as an employee, your contributions to 401(k) plans must be completed by the end of the calendar year for that same tax year. Employers may delay their contributions until the filing deadline depending on the 401(k) structure.
If you are going to contribute to your retirement fund, it's always better to do it earlier in the contribution year to maximize the amount of tax-free interest growth — but if you have the available money and the space below the contribution limit, why not make the best of the situation and max out your 2017 contribution while you can?
Let the free MoneyTips Retirement Planner help you calculate when you can retire without jeopardizing your lifestyle.
The Deadline for Annual Health Plan Contributions
Do you have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and a corresponding Health Savings Account (HSA)? Similar rules apply. You can generally contribute to your HSA until April 15, 2019, and have it count toward your 2018 contribution limit ($3,450 for singles and $6,900 for family coverage). Verify the rules on your individual HSA before making any changes.
The Deadline for Filing for an Extension on your Taxes
Can't deal with your taxes at all right now? You can file for an extension using IRS Form 4868 to delay filing up to October 15, 2019 — but you will have to file the 4868 form before the April 15 deadline to avoid late filing penalties. You must also include payment of the taxes you expect to owe with your extension. By filing an extension, you can take the time to explore your options properly (or perhaps seek help from a tax professional).
Failing to file the extension form on time or to pay your estimated taxes will rack up late filing and late payment bills, which can be substantial. Failing to file accrues a penalty of 5% of the bill for every month or part of a month late, up to 25%. Failing to pay accrues 0.5% each month.
Filing for an extension doesn't extend the contribution deadline for IRAs, HSAs, or 401(k)s, but it does extend the contribution deadline for some retirement programs, primarily Keoghs or SEP plans. If you have a less traditional retirement plan and are not sure what qualifies, contact your plan administrator for advice.
What if you are not a procrastinator and you've already filed your taxes? If you find tax savings after the fact, you can amend a tax return after you have filed by using an IRS 1040X form. The 1040X form basically asks you to list the changes from your previously submitted form.
Important note: Do not attempt to file a second 1040 form to make your changes. Only the 1040X form should be used to make changes or correct errors.
If you were due a refund on your original filing, the IRS suggests that you wait for your original refund to be processed before filing your 1040X. If you were correcting a mistake and owed more money, you would need to file and pay the difference as soon as possible to minimize penalties.
Whether you filed on the first available day or the last — or filed an extension to get more time — there's still a way to save on your tax bill for 2018. Take a few moments to review your tax situation. You may find a nice return (pun intended) on your invested time.
Failing to pay your taxes or a penalty you owe could negatively impact your credit score.

Exit Polls Reveal Netanyahu Slated for Victory Over Gantz,www.cbn.com,Chris Mitchell *,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/israelis-head-to-the-polls-with-netanyahu-and-israels-future-on-the-line,"TEL AVIV - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party is slated for a clear victory against Benny Gantz's rival Blue and White party.
By Wednesday morning, 97 percent of the votes were counted and showed the Likud party tied with Blue and White. As of 9 a.m., Likud has won 26.27 percent of the votes, earning them 35 seats in the Knesset. Blue and White won 25.94 percent, also giving them 35 seats.
However, Israel's bloc of right-wing parties has won a majority of the 120 Knesset seats, giving Netanyahu the support he needs to form a government and remain prime minister.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked supporters at a victory party in Tel Aviv Tuesday night.
""Remember, 25 years ago, it was the first time that Sara and I stood here. And here we have returned here, because of you and for you,"" Netanyahu said, adding that his win against Gantz was ""almost unprecedented.""
Netanyahu's victory was history in the making. He will be Israel's longest-serving prime minister.
Meanwhile, Gantz isn't admitting defeat yet.
""Good morning friends, yes, good morning,"" Gantz wrote is a letter to party activists Wednesday. ""The reports tell an unfinished story. There is nothing final about (the results).""
""We may be able to make a political maneuver of one kind or another,"" he said.
Some have speculated that a unity government between Netanyahu and Gantz would help the country heal from a bitter election, and respond to threats from Iran and Hamas.
""The coalition, it's not clear yet, because we need to see who are the parties that are in the game. So two days from now we'll be smarter about the coalition. But one thing we know about, and for sure, Netanyahu is the next prime minister,"" said Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Although Netanyahu's coalition will be right-wing, he says he wants to make sure all Israelis are represented.
""I intend to work quickly to establish a stable government. I want to make it clear, it will be a right-wing government, but I intend to be the prime minister of all Israeli citizens, right or left, Jews or non-Jews alike, all Israeli citizens,"" said Netanyahu.
Netanyahu has already phoned many probable partners in his latest coalition, almost certainly a government of the right. That would include two religious parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism. They finished third and fourth in the voting.
The Times of Israel reports that voter turnout was 67.8 percent, which is down from 2015's 71.8 percent. A spokesperson for the Likud party confirmed to CBN News that voter turnout is low this election.

‘We Have to Save the Right’: Low Voter Turnout Casts Doubt on Netanyahu’s Election Victory,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/lsquo-we-have-to-save-the-right-rsquo-low-voter-turnout-casts-doubt-on-netanyahu-rsquo-s-election-victory,"TEL AVIV, Israel – Israel is just hours away from closing the polls for an election that will determine the country’s direction and Benjamin Netanyahu’s future as prime minister.
Pollsters are reporting a low voter turnout, flaring concerns among Netanyahu’s Likud party.
The Times of Israel reports that voter turnout is at 61.3%, which is 1 point lower than 2015. A spokesperson for the Likud party confirmed to CBN News that voter turnout is low this election.
Polling stations close at 10p.m. (1900 GMT, 3 p.m. EDT).
“I have received a dramatic update that there is low turnout in Likud strongholds but that there is a high turnout in left-wing strongholds,” Netanyahu said. “We have to save the Right. There are only a few more hours.”
Meanwhile, the Likud election headquarter is buzzing with activity. So far, there are no Likud leaders present. The event was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m., but was postponed to 11 p.m. because of the low voter turnout, The Times of Israel reports.
Netanyahu’s rival, Benny Gantz from the Blue and White party, urged voters to ignore Netanyahu’s concerns.
“These are the last hours of the campaign. Do not believe any word that Netanyahu is now saying. The battle is close. If you do not get everyone out of the house now and send them to the ballot box, we will not win the elections.”
Experts say Netanyahu and Gantz are feigning alarm in a last-ditch effort to get voters to the polls.
Netanyahu is seeking a record-breaking fourth consecutive term, which would make him the longest serving prime minister in Israel’s history.
While Gantz and Netanyahu have very different views on policy, tonight, with just a few hours left, they are sending the same message to Israelis – go vote."
Is Your Diet Deadly? New Study Offers Shocking Global Wake-up Call,www.cbn.com,CBN News,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/is-your-diet-deadly-new-study-offers-shocking-global-wake-up-call,"A new study by the Cleveland Clinic reveals a diet loaded with excessive unhealthy foods is associated with one in five deaths worldwide.
The study's findings were published in the journal The Lancet .
""We know that sugar is bad and people eat 10 times as much sugar as is recommended; we know that nuts are good, and prevent disease, and people eat only 12 percent of the recommended amount of nuts; so, we're eating way too much of the bad stuff, and hardly enough of the good stuff,"" said Mark Hyman, M.D., director of the Center for Functional Medicine of Cleveland Clinic, said in a press release.
Researchers looked at dietary trends for people across 195 countries in the years between 1990 and 2017. They were looking to see if there was a connection between diet and chronic disease.
In 2017 alone, analysts found diets low in whole grains, fruits, nuts and seeds, and high in trans fats, sugary drinks, red and processed meats, were responsible for roughly 11 million deaths worldwide. Ten million of those deaths were caused by heart disease followed by cancer and Type 2 diabetes.
Out of the 195 countries studied, the US ranked 43 in the number of diet-related deaths.
The study's authors said good nutrition habits were severely lacking in all of the countries.
Dr. Hyman said instead of focusing on getting rid of bad foods, we should focus on adding nutritional ones that promote good health like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds.
""Food is the biggest contributor, globally, to chronic disease and death,"" he noted. ""I think it's important to focus on, not only what to remove – too much sugar; processed foods; junk; fast foods – but focus on what to add. For instance, fruits and vegetables should make up 80 percent of your diet."
It's STILL Not Too Late To Lower Your Tax Bill: April 15 is More Than Just the Tax Deadline,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/its-still-not-too-late-to-lower-your-tax-bill-april-15-is-more-than-just-the-tax-deadline,"Finance News MoneyTips It's STILL Not Too Late To Lower Your Tax Bill: April 15 is More Than Just the Tax Deadline ©iStockphoto.com/pabradyphoto
Are you a procrastinator who waits until the very last moment to file your taxes? The filing deadline is April 15, 2019, to file your taxes for the 2018 tax year, unless you live in Maine or Massachusetts. Due to the Patriots' Day holiday celebrated on April 15 in those states, and the Emancipation Day holiday on April 16 in the District of Columbia, that gives you a few extra days to consider last-minute ways to lower your taxes.
Start by reviewing your possible deductions. Did you just assume that it doesn't pay to itemize? Check out these 19 top tax deductions , and while you're at it, look over these 9 popular tax credits . Tax credits subtract directly from your tax bill instead of reducing your taxable income, and some are refundable (meaning that you may receive a refund even if it's more than the taxes that you owe).
The Deadline for Annual Retirement Contributions
You can also use retirement fund contributions to lower your taxes significantly. Annual contribution limits to IRAs are $5,500 with an extra $1,000 in ""catch-up"" contributions if you are over age 50. You can make contributions until the tax-filing deadline for that year, so contributions for the 2018 tax year may be made until April 15, 2019. (Make sure that your contribution is designated for the 2018 tax year, not 2019.)
You can even open a traditional IRA before the tax-filing deadline of April 15, 2019, and apply the contributions to your 2018 taxes. (You could also open a Roth IRA, but since they are created with after-tax funds, you won't save anything on your taxes.)
Rules for 401(k)s are less straightforward. Generally, as an employee, your contributions to 401(k) plans must be completed by the end of the calendar year for that same tax year. Employers may delay their contributions until the filing deadline depending on the 401(k) structure.
If you are going to contribute to your retirement fund, it's always better to do it earlier in the contribution year to maximize the amount of tax-free interest growth — but if you have the available money and the space below the contribution limit, why not make the best of the situation and max out your 2017 contribution while you can?
Let the free MoneyTips Retirement Planner help you calculate when you can retire without jeopardizing your lifestyle.
The Deadline for Annual Health Plan Contributions
Do you have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and a corresponding Health Savings Account (HSA)? Similar rules apply. You can generally contribute to your HSA until April 15, 2019, and have it count toward your 2018 contribution limit ($3,450 for singles and $6,900 for family coverage). Verify the rules on your individual HSA before making any changes.
The Deadline for Filing for an Extension on your Taxes
Can't deal with your taxes at all right now? You can file for an extension using IRS Form 4868 to delay filing up to October 15, 2019 — but you will have to file the 4868 form before the April 15 deadline to avoid late filing penalties. You must also include payment of the taxes you expect to owe with your extension. By filing an extension, you can take the time to explore your options properly (or perhaps seek help from a tax professional).
Failing to file the extension form on time or to pay your estimated taxes will rack up late filing and late payment bills, which can be substantial. Failing to file accrues a penalty of 5% of the bill for every month or part of a month late, up to 25%. Failing to pay accrues 0.5% each month.
Filing for an extension doesn't extend the contribution deadline for IRAs, HSAs, or 401(k)s, but it does extend the contribution deadline for some retirement programs, primarily Keoghs or SEP plans. If you have a less traditional retirement plan and are not sure what qualifies, contact your plan administrator for advice.
What if you are not a procrastinator and you've already filed your taxes? If you find tax savings after the fact, you can amend a tax return after you have filed by using an IRS 1040X form. The 1040X form basically asks you to list the changes from your previously submitted form.
Important note: Do not attempt to file a second 1040 form to make your changes. Only the 1040X form should be used to make changes or correct errors.
If you were due a refund on your original filing, the IRS suggests that you wait for your original refund to be processed before filing your 1040X. If you were correcting a mistake and owed more money, you would need to file and pay the difference as soon as possible to minimize penalties.
Whether you filed on the first available day or the last — or filed an extension to get more time — there's still a way to save on your tax bill for 2018. Take a few moments to review your tax situation. You may find a nice return (pun intended) on your invested time.

Credit Monitoring Vs. Identity Theft Protection: How Credit Alerts and Identity Alerts Differ,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/credit-monitoring-vs-identity-theft-protection-how-credit-alerts-and-identity-alerts-differ,"Credit Monitoring Vs. Identity Theft Protection: How Credit Alerts and Identity Alerts Differ ©iStockphoto.com/weerapatkiatdumrong
You know you need to protect your accounts and personal information – but what is the best method? Should you use a credit monitoring service or subscribe to identity theft protection instead? What's the difference between the two methods?
Credit monitoring services do exactly what they say they do – monitor activity on your accounts with the major credit reporting agencies (TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax). Creditors report all activities related to borrowing money, including your payment history, to credit reporting agencies. Monitoring services may monitor your history with all three agencies or be exclusive to a certain agency.
With credit monitoring, you're alerted to various changes in your credit report – for example, when a potential creditor asks for your credit history or when new credit card accounts or loans are opened in your name. Any activity that is reported to the credit reporting agency is monitored.
However, identity theft can involve more than fraudulent loans or credit accounts in your name. Thieves can use your Social Security number and other personal information to open bank accounts, get jobs, receive government benefits – even commit crimes in your name. None of these activities will show up on your credit report because borrowing is not involved.
Identity theft protection services incorporate credit monitoring and go beyond to check for non-credit related abuses of your information – or let you know that your compromised information is out there, available to thieves for future abuse. Monitoring may include dark web scans, arrest records, court filings, changes of address, and social media accounts.
Identity theft protection services may also include help to restore your identity and resolve fraudulent uses and claims, as well as identity theft insurance. Services and fees vary by vendor. Check the details of any program before signing up. Let MoneyTips protect your credit and identity theft with a 7-day free trial .
Victims of security breaches often receive free credit monitoring or identity protection services for a limited period of time – but the protections from these programs may not be sufficient. You need long-term protection, especially once your personal data has been compromised. You can always cancel accounts and change passwords, but once your Social Security number is compromised, you are in for a lifelong battle with identity thieves.
If identity theft protection generally includes credit monitoring, why would you opt for credit monitoring alone? Cost could be a factor, along with any extra services that the credit monitoring service provides that an identity theft service does not. Evaluate your options as a full package to get the best comparison. If you would like to monitor your credit and see your credit reports and scores, join MoneyTips .
Note that most credit monitoring and identity theft protection services are reactive, not proactive. They let you know when suspicious activity has occurred, but they can't prevent it from happening. You can supplement either service by using common-sense proactive tactics .
Use strong passwords on all your accounts and change them often. Shred any sensitive information before discarding it. Protect all electronic devices with up-to-date anti-virus software. Avoid e-mail scams and suspicious requests for information. Store your personal information in as few places as possible. Check your credit frequently, and consider a credit freeze on your accounts to prevent thieves from opening fraudulent accounts in your name.
Help either service by making it more difficult for identity thieves to get your information, or to use your information if they do get it.
Review the details of each type of service and find the best fit for your comprehensive protection strategy. Just make sure that you follow through with whatever protection you choose. Identity thieves look for the easiest unprotected targets. Don't be one of them.
Protect your credit – protect your identity – protect yourself with a free MoneyTips trial .

Suspect Accused of Plotting Islamic Terror Attack to Plow Down US Crowds of People - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/suspect-captured-accused-of-plotting-islamic-terror-attack-to-plow-down-us-crowds-of-people,"Suspect Accused of Plotting Islamic Terror Attack to Plow Down US Crowds of People 04-09-2019 Christian Ellis Rondell Henry (Photo: Screen Capture)
Federal officials say they have a suspect in custody, accused of plotting to drive a stolen truck into crowds of people. The Justice Department says 28-year-old Rondell Henry was inspired online by the radical Islamic group ISIS to commit mass murder.
On March 26, Henry allegedly stole a U-Haul truck and drove around Washington, DC, looking for crowds to target. He finally decided on the National Harbor Waterfront in Maryland, an area popular with tourists and families. The crowds were thin, so he parked the truck to return the next day to perform the attack.
The following day officers found the stolen truck, and on the 28th they arrested Henry after they saw him jumping over a security fence. Prosecutors in Maryland have asked the judge to keep Henry detained on a charge of driving a stolen vehicle across state lines.
""The defendant, inspired by the ISIS terrorist organization and prepared to die for his cause, stole a vehicle with the intent of 'plowing it through a crowd full of people' at the National Harbor,"" prosecutors said. ""He must be detained pending trial.""
Leaving his job in the middle of the day, he stole the U-Haul truck from a Virginia mall parking garage after realizing his four-door sedan ""would not cause the catastrophic damage that he desired.""
""I was just going to keep driving and driving and driving. I wasn't going to stop,"" the Associated Press reports a document with Henry's statements.
Henry went on to say he wanted to cause ""panic and chaos"" like the deadly truck attack that killed people in Nice, France in 2016.
Henry was taken for a psychiatric evaluation then into FBI custody. Prosecutors are expected to share new evidence that could add on multiple charges to his charge of interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, which carries up to 10 years in prison.
The government's detention motion states Henry as harboring hatred for ""disbelievers"" of the Islamic faith. Also, Henry is reported to have continually watched ISIS beheading and fighting videos. Prosecutors found images of the ISIS flag, armed ISIS fighters, and the man who committed the Orlando nightclub massacre in 2016 on his phone.
Initially, he desired to perform the attack at Dulles International Airport. However, he was not successful in breaching the security perimeter after two hours. He then headed to the National Harbor where there are multiple restaurants, retail and hotels.
""But so early in the morning on a weekday,"" prosecutors wrote , ""the defendant did not find the sizable crowd upon which he desired to inflict his radical conduct."""
Pro-Life Movement Wins Big in Kentucky as Court Upholds State's Ultrasound Law - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/pro-life-movement-wins-big-in-kentucky-as-court-upholds-states-ultrasound-law,"Pro-Life Movement Wins Big in Kentucky as Court Upholds State's Ultrasound Law 04-09-2019 Christian Ellis Ultrasound (Photo:Adobe Stock)
Pro-lifers in Kentucky are rejoicing after a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the state's Ultrasound Informed Consent Act. The act requires abortionists to grant women the opportunity to see their ultrasound images of their unborn child and play the audio of the child's heartbeat before performing the abortion.
Originally blocked by US District Court Judge David Hale in 2017 when passed, the law is now able to be enforced.
""Today is a historic day, as Kentucky continues to lead the charge in implementing strong pro-life protections for its citizens,"" stated Gov. Matt Bevin (R-KY) according to LifeSite . ""We applaud the decision by the Sixth Circuit, which affirms the commonsense notion that patients should be well equipped with relevant information before making important medical decisions.""
""I am grateful to be governor of a state that values every human life,"" he continued. ""And we are committed to continue our fight on behalf of the most vulnerable among us.""
In the court hearing Thursday, Judge John Bush, one of the three appellate judges and an appointee of President Donald Trump, stated, ""Are the mandated disclosures truthful and not misleading? Yes—no one argues that the heartbeat, sonogram, or its description is false or misleading.""
""That leaves the final question: Are the mandated disclosures relevant to the patient's decision whether to abort unborn life?"" he added. ""The Supreme Court's abortion precedent answers this question for us.""
The abortion precedent he is discussing is the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey and 2018's National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, where the US Supreme Court held ""that the First Amendment has a limited role to play in allowing doctors to avoid making truthful mandated disclosures related to informed consent,"" and the ultrasound law ""provides relevant information"" that ""gives a patient greater knowledge of the unborn life inside her.""
""This also inherently provides the patient with more knowledge about the effect of an abortion procedure: it shows her what, or whom, she is consenting to terminate,"" Bush continued. ""That this information might persuade a woman to change her mind does not render it suspect under the First Amendment. It just means that it is pertinent to her decision-making.""
Judge Alan Norris, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, joined Judge Bush in his ruling. Judge Bernice Donald, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, differed by stating the law ""eviscerates physician discretion"" to decide what ""truthful, non-misleading, and relevant information"" to share with patients according to LifeSite. She went on to say the requirement had ""no basis in the practice of medicine.""
The act went to court after the progressive American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the state on behalf of a Louisville abortion facility, EMW Women's Surgical Center. It was the first of two lawsuits by the ACLU against pro-life measures in Kentucky.
The ACLU recently announced a second lawsuit after the GOP-led Senate voted 32-4 to send a new pro-life bill to Gov. Matt Bevin last month. That legislation bans abortion for women seeking to terminate their pregnancies on the basis of the baby's gender, race or disability such as Down syndrome.
Gov. Bevin had responded to the organization after they made the announcement last month. ""Bring it! Kentucky will always fight for life..."" tweeted Gov. Bevin. ""Always #WeAreProLife #WeAreKY."""
"Airbnb Reverses Ban on Israeli Homes in West Bank, Says it Never Supported BDS",www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/airbnb-reverses-ban-on-israeli-homes-in-west-bank-says-it-never-supported-bds,"Airbnb Reverses Ban on Israeli Homes in West Bank, Says it Never Supported BDS 04-10-2019 Emily Jones
JERUSALEM, Israel - Airbnb has reversed its decision to ban home listings in Israeli settlement communities in historic Judea and Samaria, also known as the West Bank.
Airbnb announced the policy change after a court settlement Monday between the hospitality service and several American Jewish plaintiffs who sued the company.
Last November, the company vowed to ""remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.""
A copy of the settlement obtained by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency says that Airbnb will now allow rentals in both Palestinian Arab communities and Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria. However, the company said it will not profit off of the listings and will instead donate the money to humanitarian organizations.
The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination against minorities in the US. The plaintiffs, who are American but own property in Judea and Samaria, argued that Airbnb discriminated against them for being Jewish, while Christians and Muslims were still allowed to post rental properties in the West Bank.
Airbnb objected to accusations that it intended to alienate its Jewish customers and shot down claims that it supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.
""Airbnb recognizes that its decision to apply its Policy to Subject Listings in the Affected Region has been met with strong objections by some members of the Airbnb community as well as other individuals and groups supportive of Israel,"" the settlement document reads. ""Some have even sought to associate Airbnb with the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (""BDS"") movement. Airbnb is clear that it does not intend, and has never intended, to align itself with the BDS movement or to otherwise position the company as adverse to any segment of its community.""
Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of Shurat Hadin, the law firm that represented the Jewish plaintiffs said other companies need to take Airbnb's lead.
""Other international companies need to learn the lessons from Airbnb's mistake and understand that boycotting Israel and discriminating against Jews are unlawful acts, which will ultimately result in dire legal consequences, public condemnations and embarrassment,"" Darshan-Leitner said.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state would boycott Airbnb over its policy. Now, Desantis applauds the company for its reversal.
""I am encouraged to hear that @Airbnb will not move forward with its policy that would eliminate the listings of Israeli properties. Florida will never support companies that discriminate against Israel,"" he said. I am encouraged to hear that @Airbnb will not move forward with its policy that would eliminate the listings of Israeli properties. Florida will never support companies that discriminate against Israel."

TEL AVIV - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party won a hard-fought victory against Benny Gantz's rival Blue and White party after a bruising election. The Blue and White party conceded defeat late Wednesday even after winning a substantial number of seats in the Israeli parliament known as the Knesset.
By Wednesday morning, 97 percent of the votes were counted and showed the Likud party tied with Blue and White. As of 9 a.m., Likud had won 26.27 percent of the votes, earning them 35 seats in the Knesset. Blue and White won 25.94 percent, also giving them 35 seats.
However, Israel's broader bloc of right-wing parties won a majority of the 120 Knesset seats, giving Netanyahu the support he needs to form a coalition government and remain prime minister.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked supporters at a victory party in Tel Aviv Tuesday night.
""Remember, 25 years ago, it was the first time that Sara and I stood here. And here we have returned here, because of you and for you,"" Netanyahu said, adding that his win against Gantz was ""almost unprecedented.""

Before the election, the prime minister pledged to annex Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), and said he wouldn’t uproot any of them. Israeli political analyst Elie Pieprz told CBN News it is time.
“The voters, the people, want to apply Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. There’s no doubt Judea and Samaria are part of Israel and that’s the way Israelis see it,” Pieprz said.
Netanyahu has already spoken with many probable partners in his latest coalition, almost certainly a government of the right. That would include two religious parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism. They finished third and fourth in the voting.
The Times of Israel reports that voter turnout was 67.8 percent, which is down from 2015's 71.8 percent. A spokesperson for the Likud party confirmed to CBN News that voter turnout is low this election.

Pro-Lifers Argue 'the Tide Is Turning in America' as Pain-Capable Abortion Ban Revived in Congress,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/pro-lifers-argue-the-tide-is-turning-in-america-as-pain-capable-abortion-ban-revived-in-congress,"Pro-Lifers Argue 'the Tide Is Turning in America' as Pain-Capable Abortion Ban Revived in Congress
WASHINGTON – Pro-life lawmakers are bringing back the fight to ban abortions after five months of pregnancy, saying that's the point at which scientific evidence shows babies being aborted feel pain.
Only seven countries currently allow elective abortions after five months of pregnancy, including the communist regimes in North Korea, Vietnam, and China. The United States is also part of this small group, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) hopes to change that through the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
""I want to get out of the club of seven,"" said Graham. ""I think most people, once they know what we're talking about, this will gain momentum and become law.""
Graham says there is mounting evidence proving babies in the womb feel pain at that stage.
""I would ask the opponents of this bill to dispute the fact that anesthesia is provided routinely to a child who is in the 5th month of the pregnancy, to protect the child from the pain that would occur to save its life through surgery,"" continued Graham.
Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) disputes the research and tells CBN News he believes the bill is a hoax.
""The bill as a whole is unsupported by science, it has no foundation in fact and it violates the Constitution,"" said Blumenthal. ""This proposal is doomed and divisive. It has no chances of success and simply further divides us in efforts to achieve progress.""
According to a 2019 Marist poll, 66% of all voters want this law passed.
""The tide is turning in America, and Americans are becoming more and more pro-life,"" claims Catherine Glenn Foster of Americans United for Life.
She testified at Tuesday's hearing alongside abortion survivor Melissa Ohden.
""The extreme abortion legislation is worrisome, it's painful,"" Ohden told CBN News.
Foster expressed shock that Democrat Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee and are running for president in 2020, skipped the hearing.
""It was really telling that they don't want to go on the record and maybe be seen as being so extreme that they would oppose this common sense law, common sense bill that the majority of Americans agree on, even pro-choice Americans,"" said Foster.
She says according to abortion industry studies, health reasons are not the main reason why the majority of women seek these later abortions.
""Their own studies say in fact it's not because of fetal anomaly, it's not because of life of the mother – it's because in large part the same reasons why women seek those first trimester abortions. It's issues of finances, it's relationship issues, it's not really feeling ready to handle a pregnancy yet,"" continued Foster.
Senator Graham says he knows getting the votes in the House and Senate will be tough right now, but he's committed to fight for this over the long haul."

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) summarized the September 11 terror attacks as an event in which ""some people did something,"" sparking outrage among critics who accuse her of trivializing the bloodiest terror attacks on American soil.
Omar was speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) fundraising event last month when she made the comments.
""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,"" Omar said.

Omar is a controversial congresswoman and has been accused of being anti-Semitic for her repeated comments about Israel and the Jewish people.
Republican chairwoman Ronna McDaniel urged Democrats to openly condemn Omar's alleged anti-Semitism and trivialization of the September 11 attacks.
""llhan Omar isn't just anti-Semitic – she's anti-American. Nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives to Islamic terrorists on 9/11, yet Omar diminishes it as: 'Some people did something.'

Others raised brows over Omar's attendance at the CAIR event. CAIR was infamously named as an unindicted co-conspirator in sending millions of charity funds to the Hamas terror group in the case against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development.
Omar also asked a judge to show leniency toward a group of Minnesota men accused of trying to join ISIS in 2015. The congresswoman was a Minnesota state representative at the time, joining in a letter to Judge Michael Davis that urged him to give the men shorter sentences, arguing that severe punishment for their crimes would motivate others to join the terror group.
""Incarcerating 20-year-old men for 30 or 40 years is essentially a life sentence. Society will have no expectations of the to-be 50- or 60-year-old released prisoners; it will view them with distrust and revulsion,"" read Omar's letter to the judge, as obtained by FOX 9 of Minneapolis-St. Paul.
Last week, Omar asked the Trump administration to work for the release of Hoda Abdelmonem, a senior member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood who is imprisoned in Egypt.
""I recently met with @jkbadawy and @thefreedomi to talk about Hoda Abdelmonem, a political prisoner in Egypt.

"Richard Cole, Last WWII Doolittle Raider, Dies in Texas",www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/national-security/2019/april/richard-cole-last-wwii-doolittle-raider-dies-in-texas,"Richard Cole, Last WWII Doolittle Raider, Dies in Texas (AP Photo) 6024897403001 Richard Cole, Last WWII Doolittle Raider, Dies in Texas Ret. Lt. General Jerry Boykin appeared on CBN's Newswatch program Wednesday to talk about Col. Cole and his remarkable bravery.
DALLAS (AP) - Retired Lt. Col. Richard ""Dick"" Cole, the last of the 80 Doolittle Tokyo Raiders who carried out the daring U.S. attack on Japan during World War II, died Tuesday at a military hospital in Texas. He was 103.
Robert Whetstone, a spokesman for Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, confirmed Cole's death. Cole's daughter, Cindy Chal, said he was having some heart issues but had walked into the emergency room.
Cole, who lived in Comfort, Texas, had stayed active even in recent years, attending air shows and participating in commemorative events including April 18, 2017, ceremonies for the raid's 75th anniversary at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.
Chal said her father ""enjoyed every minute"" of his long, distinguished life.
Cole was mission commander Jimmy Doolittle's co-pilot in the attack less than five months after the December 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.
Doolittle died in 1993. The Gen. James ""Jimmy"" H. Doolittle Archives are at the University of Texas at Dallas. Cole's papers are also part of the school's History of Aviation Collection.
Cole was a Dayton-area native who recounted riding his bicycle as a child to watch planes at McCook Field, a military testing air base there. He dreamed of being a pilot and after attending Ohio University, enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1940. Stationed in South Carolina, he signed up as a volunteer for a secret mission he knew would be dangerous, but not much else about. They trained at Eglin Air Force to fly B-25 bombers on short takeoffs, in preparation for flying off an aircraft carrier.
The Raiders launched their assault April 18, 1942, in B-25 bombers from the USS Hornet. Suspecting they had been detected by Japanese patrols, they left farther away from Japan than planned.
The crews of the 16 planes were ""very quiet"" as they neared Japan, Cole recalled, saying his role next to Doolittle was to ""be seen, not heard. ... You didn't speak until spoken to."" But the country song ""Wabash Cannonball"" started running through his head and he unconsciously began tapping his toe, which caught Doolittle's attention. He shot Cole a look, he recalled with a laugh.
Doolittle soon ordered bomb bay doors opened, and the attack was on against what turned out to be limited anti-aircraft fire in the surprise attack.
They then headed to China, running out of fuel. Cole said Doolittle gave the command to prepare to bail out as they neared the coast, adding: ""I wish you all good luck.""
Cole said it was scary to parachute into a dark ""unknown"" in rough weather. His parachute caught in a tree, leaving him dangling but safe. Chinese partisans helped lead him and other Raiders to safety.
Three Raiders died trying to reach China, and eight were captured by Japanese soldiers. Three were executed, and a fourth died in captivity.
Cole recalled that Doolittle was distraught at first, upset that he had lost all of his planes and some of his men. Doolittle would later receive the Medal of Honor.
The raid inflicted scattered damage while providing a psychological lift back home. The stunned Japanese military diverted resources after a string of Pacific successes.
""Seven decades later, we are still awed by the sheer audacity of the Doolittle raid and the incredible men whose grit and bravery made it possible,"" Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi of California said when the Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to the Raiders in a 2015 ceremony. ""Though time has thinned their ranks, it will never dim the daring of their deeds.""
Cole continued to fly missions in the China-Burma-India theater until 1944, and had peacetime service assignments in several states.
In an AP interview in April, 2017, Cole described as ""a somber affair"" the toast he planned to carry out to end a long Raider tradition. Using goblets engraved with their names, they each year lifted them and sipped cognac in tribute to those who had gone before. Retired Staff Sgt. David Thatcher died in 2016 at age 94 in Missoula, Montana.
Doolittle organized reunions that became annual affairs, and Cole was a regular. He also took part in other special events, including leading a special public ""final toast"" ceremony at the museum in 2013, when four Raiders were still alive. He said then: ""May they rest in peace.""
He said in April 2017 he hadn't expected to be the last survivor, since he was older than most on the mission
Cole attributed his longevity to being an optimist and living a life of ""moderation."" He said he believed he spoke for all Raiders when he said they didn't want any more recognition than all the others who put their lives on the line in the war effort.
""We don't want to be remembered any more than the rest of the people who took part in beating the Japanese,"" Cole said. ""They started it, and we finished it.""
Chal said a memorial service is planned for April 18 at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio. She said her father will be buried later at Arlington National Cemetery.

"Scientists Reveal First Image Ever Made of a Black Hole, Confirming Einstein's Theory",www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/scientists-reveal-first-image-ever-made-of-a-black-hole-confirming-einsteins-theory,"Scientists Reveal First Image Ever Made of a Black Hole, Confirming Einstein's Theory 04-10-2019 Seth Borenstein Scientists revealed the first image ever made of a black hole on April 10, 2019 after assembling data gathered by a network of radio telescopes around the world. (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration/Maunakea Observatories via AP)
WASHINGTON (AP) - Scientists on Wednesday revealed the first image ever made of a black hole, depicting its hot, shadowy edges where light bends around itself in a cosmic funhouse effect.
Assembling data gathered by eight radio telescopes around the world, astronomers created the picture showing the violent neighborhood around a supermassive black hole, the light-sucking monsters of the universe theorized by Einstein more than a century ago and confirmed by observations for decades.
It looked like a flaming orange, yellow and black ring.
""We have seen what we thought was unseeable. We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole. Here it is,"" said Sheperd Doeleman of Harvard.
Jessica Dempsey, a co-discoverer and deputy director of the East Asian Observatory in Hawaii, said it reminded her of the powerful flaming Eye of Sauron from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.
Unlike smaller black holes that come from collapsed stars, supermassive black holes are mysterious in origin. Situated at the center of most galaxies, including ours, they are so dense that nothing, not even light, can escape their gravitational pull. This one's ""event horizon"" - the point of no return around it, where light and matter begin to fall inexorably into the abyss - is as big as our entire solar system.
Three years ago, scientists using an extraordinarily sensitive observing system heard the sound of two much smaller black holes merging to create a gravitational wave, as Albert Einstein predicted. The new image, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters and announced around the world in several news conferences, adds light to that sound.
Outside scientists suggested the achievement could be worthy of a Nobel Prize, just like the gravitational wave discovery.
While much around a black hole falls into a death spiral and is never to be seen again, the new image captures ""lucky gas and dust"" circling at just far enough to be safe and seen millions of years later on Earth, Dempsey said.
Taken over four days when astronomers had ""to have the perfect weather all across the world and literally all the stars had to align,"" the image helps confirm Einstein's general relativity theory, Dempsey said. Einstein a century ago even predicted the symmetrical shape that scientists just found, she said.
""It's circular, but on one side the light is brighter,"" Dempsey said. That's because that light is approaching Earth.
The measurements are taken at a wavelength the human eye cannot see, so the astronomers added color to the image. They chose ""exquisite gold because this light is so hot,"" Dempsey said. ""Making it these warm gold and oranges makes sense.""
What the image shows is gas heated to millions of degrees by the friction of ever-stronger gravity, scientists said. And that gravity creates a funhouse effect where you see light from both behind the black hole and behind you as the light curves and circles around the black hole itself, said astronomer Avi Loeb, director of the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard. (The lead scientists in the discovery are from Harvard, but Loeb was not involved.)
The project cost $50 million to $60 million, with $26 million of that coming from the National Science Foundation.
Johns Hopkins astrophysicist Ethan Vishniac, who was not part of the discovery team but edits the journal where the research was published, pronounced the image ""an amazing technical achievement"" that ""gives us a glimpse of gravity in its most extreme manifestation.""
He added: ""Pictures from computer simulations can be very pretty, but there's literally nothing like a picture of the real universe, however fuzzy and monochromatic.""
""It's just seriously cool,"" said John Kormendy, a University of Texas astronomer who wasn't part of the discovery team. ""To see the stuff going down the tubes, so to speak, to see it firsthand. The mystique of black holes in the community is very substantial. That mystique is going to be made more real.""
There is a myth that says a black hole would rip you apart, but Loeb and Kormendy said the one pictured is so big, someone could fall into it and not be torn to pieces. But the person would never be seen from again.
Black holes are ""like the walls of a prison. Once you cross it, you will never be able to get out and you will never be able to communicate,"" Loeb said.
The first image is of a black hole in a galaxy called M87 that is about 53 million light years from Earth. One light year is 5.9 trillion miles, or 9.5 trillion kilometers. This black hole is about 6 billion times the mass of our sun.
The telescope data was gathered by the Event Horizon Telescope two years ago, but it took so long to complete the image because it was a massive undertaking, involving about 200 scientists, supercomputers and hundreds of terabytes of data delivered worldwide by plane.
The team looked at two supermassive black holes, the M87 and the one at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. The one in our galaxy is closer but much smaller, so they both look the same size in the sky. But the more distant one was easier to take pictures of because it rotates more slowly.
""We've been hunting this for a long time,"" Dempsey said. ""We've been getting closer and closer with better technology.""

'God's Hand at Work': Franklin Graham Hosts Facebook Live with 'Unplanned' Actress Ashley Bratcher | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,Charlene Aaron,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/gods-hand-at-work-franklin-graham-hosting-facebook-live-with-unplanned-actress-ashley-bratcher,"
Click the player above to watch Franklin Graham's Facebook Live interview with actress Ashley Bratcher.
The pro-life film ""Unplanned,"" which premiered in theaters March 29, has continued to surpass box office expectations.
The success comes despite the movie's R-rating for what the Motion Picture Association of America called ""some disturbing/bloody images.""
The film, about the life of former Planned Parenthood Director Abby Johnson, finished in the top 10 at the box office for the second weekend in a row.
Many are praising the film which seeks to expose the truth about abortion. And supporters say the R-rating is proof that abortion is a truly violent act committed against a defenseless person.
In a tweet on April 1, Vice President Mike Pence tweeted, ""So good to see movie theaters across the country showing @UnplannedMovie - a deeply inspiring new pro-life film based on the best-selling book by @AbbyJohnson. More and more Americans are embracing the sanctity of life because of powerful stories like this one. #Unplanned.""

Franklin Graham hosted a Facebook Live interview with actress Ashley Bratcher Tuesday night. Bratcher portrays Johnson in the film.
""It was great to welcome Ashley Bratcher to Boone, NC, today to sit down and talk about the new movie Unplanned that has shattered box office expectations,"" Graham wrote on Facebook. ""Ashley plays the part of former Planned Parenthood Clinic Director Abby Johnson in this powerful true story.""
Bratcher revealed to CBN News while she was filming the movie, that her mother had almost aborted her.
""She said 'I'm going to tell you something that I haven't told you before,"" shared Bratcher. ""And she said to me 'I was in the clinic. I had my name called. I went back. I was being examined by a woman who was very pregnant, and I was on the table and that was when I changed my mind.'""
""To hear I was seconds away from not existing, and then also to know that here I am telling Abby's Johnson's story, it's so clear to me and evident that God's hand at work is present on this project,"" said Bratcher.
Graham went on to encourage his followers to see the film.
""Please make it a point to go to the theater and watch Unplanned—take your family and church, and encourage your church groups to go,"" he said. ""This movie pulls back the curtain on many of the lies about abortion.

US Attorney General William Barr faced off for the first time Tuesday with House lawmakers about his handling of the Mueller report. Now he's back on the hot seat testifying before a Senate subcommittee Wednesday.
Barr is responding to Democratic criticism over his summary of Mueller. He says the redacted report will be released next week, but that may not be good enough for Democrats.
""I do think it's important that the public have an opportunity to learn the results of the special counsel's work,"" Barr said.
Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday, Barr stuck to his promise to deliver a redacted version of the report in coming days. ""And so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public, and then I will engage with the chairmen of both Judiciary Committees about that report, and about any further requests that they have,"" Barr said.
Although Barr was officially on Capitol Hill to testify about the Justice Department's budget, many lawmakers circled back to the Russia investigation.
Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY) said, ""I must say it is extraordinary to evaluate hundreds of pages of evidence legal documents, and finding based on a 22-month-long inquiry, and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours. Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it's more suspicious than impressive.""
Democrats have been critical of Barr's approach and want to see the complete conclusions of the Mueller investigation, threatening to issue a subpoena if they don't get what they want.
Barr addressed scrutiny of his four-page letter summarizing his main conclusions from Mueller's nearly 400-page report, stating the Mueller team's finding that neither President Trump or his campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia's interference with the 2016 election.
Lowey said, ""All we have is your four-page report which seems to cherry pick to draw most favorable for president.""
He defended his decision to release that letter instead of summaries written by the special counsel. ""I think any summary regardless of who prepares it not only runs the risk of, you know, being under-inclusive or over-inclusive but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once,"" Barr said. ""I tried to use as much of the special counsel's own language as I could. They were just stating the bottom line conclusions.""
House Republicans are ready to move on. Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA) said, ""No collusion, no obstruction. It's over, it's done.""
""Well, the letter - the letter speaks for itself,"" Barr said.
Meanwhile, Barr is also investigating whether the FBI abused its authority in getting wiretaps on Trump aides that fueled the investigation leading to the Mueller probe.
The attorney general testifies before the Senate Wednesday, and he says he will answer more questions from Congress next month after the full Mueller report has been released."

Measles Outbreak Causes NYC Health Emergency: 'One of the Most Contagious Viruses Known to Man',www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/measles-outbreak-causes-nyc-health-emergency-one-of-the-most-contagious-viruses-known-to-man,"Measles Outbreak Causes NYC Health Emergency: 'One of the Most Contagious Viruses Known to Man' 04-10-2019 Christian Ellis
A spike in cases of measles has New York City declaring a public health emergency – 285 of the 465 cases found across the country are located in the area.
Most of the outbreak has happened within a large Orthodox Jewish community. Now, public officials are requiring children in the community to be vaccinated and will fine parents up to $1,000 if they aren't.
""This is an unusual action,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio stated. ""And it's because of the sheer extent of the crisis.""
Measles, a disease declared eliminated in the US in 2000, has seen a resurgence over the past few years. The disease leads to multiple health problems like pneumonia, brain swelling, seizures, deafness or intellectual disability. While measles deaths rarely take place in the US, over 110,000 people died globally in 2017 from the disease.
The reason measles has seen a return is a result of parents turning away from vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says roughly 80% of the US cases are in ages 19 or younger. In the Jewish community in New York, anti-vaccine sentiment has been popular which contributes to children catching the disease.
Besides New York, outbreaks have happened in Washington state, California, Michigan and New Jersey this year. The outbreak in Washington is correlated to a community where only 80% of children received the vaccination.
Though the vaccination is required to attend US schools, the National Conference of State Legislatures says 17 states allow some type of non-medical exemption for ""personal, moral or other beliefs.""
""We try to control our school, and we really strive to comply 100% with the Department of Health,"" Rabbi David Oberlander, Yeshiva Kehilath Yakov School in NY, said. ""But we don't control the parents, and we don't intend to control the parents.""
The virus easily spreads from coughing or sneezing. It can live for up to two hours in the air or on nearby surfaces. Nine out of 10 unvaccinated people will catch the disease if they come in contact with it.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, calls it ""one of the most contagious viruses known to man."""
Depressed? Try These Proven Natural Remedies to Lift Negative Emotions | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/depressed-try-these-proven-natural-remedies-to-lift-negative-emotions,"Depressed? Try These Proven Natural Remedies to Lift Negative Emotions
Negativity, anxiety, anger, stress, trauma, and depression: chances are very high that you or someone you love struggles with these negative emotions. There are many ways to deal with emotional pain. Self-medication with harmful substances or behaviors briefly offers relief, only to make the problem worse in the long run. These include food, drugs, alcohol, risky sexual behavior, shopping, mindless TV, video games or internet surfing.
Christian psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen offers new hope. He says many of us can turn around our negative emotions by changing some of our daily habits. Furthermore, he suggests several coping mechanisms that can make us feel better now and later.
Brain Scans Tell a Tale
Nationwide, his Amen clinics see 4,000 patient visits a month. They have the world's largest database of functional brain scans relating to behavior. He says the SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) scan allows doctors to analyze the blood flow and activity inside the brain. Brain scans are so useful, he says, that nearly eight out of ten diagnoses and treatment recommendations were different after the clinicians used the information from the SPECT scans, compared to current diagnostic methods.
""Here at Amen Clinics, we look at people's brains,"" he told CBN News, ""We have a database of 150-thousand scans on people from 120 countries. And when I started looking at the brain, I'm like, 'Oh, we can make it better or we can make it worse.'""
He developed a program that resulted in one of the highest published success rates in treating mental health, which he shared in his book, Feel Better Fast and Make it Last .
The Line Between Diet and Mood
Many people are amazed to learn that our diet contributes enormously to our mental well-being. Unfortunately, the Standard American Diet is indeed ""SAD,"" because it sabotages our brain.
""We're in a war in our society,"" he said, ""ISIS has nothing on our food industry. The real weapons of mass destruction are highly processed, pesticide sprayed, high glycemic, that means it raises your blood sugar, low-fiber food-like substances stored in plastic containers.""
He recommends a whole-food diet complete with lots of plant-based foods and healthy fats.
""If you change your diet add more colorful fruits and vegetables and get rid of sugar and foods that quickly turn to sugar and processed foods, it's been found to be an effective treatment for depression,"" he said, ""Yes, you can go to the antidepressants for depression, they have all these side effects, or you can go with food.""
Dr. Amen points out the importance of having enough good bacteria in our gut. He says scientific evidence proves our gut microbiome directly influences the way we think and feel.
He says brain scans even reveal the damage extra body fat can have on our brains. ""As your weight goes up, the actual physical size and function of your brain goes down,"" he says, ""Which should scare the fat off anyone.""
Vitamins, Micronutrients and Other Good Stuff
Dr. Amen says too many Americans aren't getting the proper vitamins, minerals and other nutrients necessary for optimal mental health.
For example, he says eighty-percent of Americans are deficient in Vitamin D, often called the ""happy vitamin."" Vitamin D comes from sun exposure, but since so many of us are indoors most of the time and wear sunscreen when we're outside, he recommends a Vitamin D supplement.
Dr. Amen praises fish oil or similar supplements to feel your best.
""I think everybody should be taking Omega-3 fatty acids every day,"" he said, ""We have a crisis in this country of low levels of Omega 3. Why should you care? Twenty-five percent of your brain is actually made up of Omega-3 fatty acids, so if you're low, you're not thinking right.""
There are 16 different brain types according to Dr. Amen. He offers a free, five-minute quiz to learn your brain type and which supplements might be beneficial.
Too Much Screen Time Can Cause Problems
Isolation contributes to mental health problems like depression and stress. Television, social media and video games can do more harm psychological harm than good.
""Digital addictions-so common,"" he said, ""Things like pornography, looking at things you shouldn't be looking at, even the negative news, because the brain pays attention to scary things way before it pays attention to happy things.""
Exercise and Sleep
Staring at screens also tends to promote a sedentary lifestyle, which also raises the risk of emotional issues. Dr. Amen recommends regular exercise because it releases endorphins, our brain's feel-good chemicals. Working out also improves the hippocampus, the region of the brain that helps regulate mood.
Exercise also helps us get a good night's sleep, another critical component to mental wellness. ""Sleep is so important,"" he said, ""You should be targeting at least seven hours of sleep a night. When you have a bad day, it's often because you didn't sleep right.""
Hits to the Head Really Matter
Dr. Amen was a consultant on the movie Concussion, starring Will Smith, that focused on the work of Dr. Bennet Omalu, who identified the danger of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) among football players.
Dr. Amen said mood issues can often be the result of hits to the head. ""Mild traumatic brain injury is a major cause of psychiatric illness and nobody knows about it,"" he said, ""Do not let your children hit soccer balls with their heads. Do not let them play football because it damages your brain.""
Safely Soothe the Senses
Dr. Amen says we all feel emotionally low at times and want something to turn things around right away. The trick, he says, is choosing things that safely appeal to as many senses as possible.
For example, he recommends looking at a picture of loved ones, nature or fractals, which are never-ending patterns. ""Vision is so important. because thirty percent of your brain is dedicated to vision,"" he said.
Listening to the sound of the ocean or your favorite music can instantly improve your mood.
""What are the scents that can help you feel better fast? And lavender has been shown to decrease anxiety and depression,"" Amen told us.
Anti-oxidant-rich dark chocolate is a healthy taste, as is cinnamon, but watch the sugar content.
When it comes to touch, massage proves beneficial, as does simply holding the hand of a happy person.
""There's actually an interesting study that if you hold the hand of someone you care about, your brain waves begin to sync. So you want to be very careful whose hand you hold,"" he said.
So while far too many Americans deal with negativity, anxiety, anger, stress, and trauma, some cases, not all, appear to be linked to our food supply and culture. The good news: for certain people, lifestyle changes can help restore joy and peace. "
Attorney General Barr: 'I Think Spying Did Occur' Against Trump Campaign | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/attorney-general-barr-i-think-spying-did-occur-against-trump-campaign,"Attorney General Barr: 'I Think Spying Did Occur' Against Trump Campaign 04-10-2019 Associated Press President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr (Official White House Photo by Tia Dufour)
WASHINGTON (AP) - Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday he is reviewing the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, declaring he believed the president's campaign had been spied on and wanted to make sure proper procedures were followed.
""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr told senators at a budget hearing that, like a similar House hearing Tuesday, was dominated by questions about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
It was not immediately clear what ""spying"" Barr was referring to, but President Donald Trump's supporters have repeatedly made accusations of political bias within the FBI and seized on anti-Trump text messages sent and received by one of the lead agents involved in investigating whether the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia.
Barr, who was nominated to his post by Trump four months ago, told a Senate appropriations subcommittee that though he did not have specific evidence of wrongdoing, ""I do have questions about it."" His review is separate from a Justice Department inspector general investigation into the early days of the FBI's Russia probe, which Barr said he expects to conclude sometime around May or June.
""I feel that I have an obligation to ensure government power was not abused,"" Barr said.
Barr also said he expected to release a redacted version of Mueller's nearly 400-page report next week - a slight change from the estimate he gave Tuesday, when he said the release would be within a week.
Though he said the document will be redacted to withhold negative information about peripheral figures in the investigation, Barr said that would not apply to Trump, who is an officeholder and central to the probe.
Democrats said they were concerned that a four-page summary letter of the report's main conclusions Barr released last month portrayed the investigation's findings in an overly favorable way for Trump. The letter said that Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and Trump associates around the time of the 2016 election and that Barr did not believe the evidence in the report was sufficient to prove the president had obstructed justice.

The comments came from Barr during Senate testimony Wednesday. He was testifying for a second day at a congressional budget hearing that was dominated by questions about special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation.
Calling this a ""big deal"", Barr plans to get to the bottom of what originally sparked the Mueller investigation in July 2016.
""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr told the panel.
As a result, he's putting together a team to uncover the origin of the Mueller probe.
Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen asked Barr directly if he believed spying on the campaign occurred, and he said: ""Yes I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.""
Barr wants to review if the threshold for initiating a counterintelligence probe should be adjusted.
""I am not saying that in-proper surveillance occurred,"" the attorney general said. ""I am saying that I am concerned about it and am looking into it. I feel that I have an obligation to ensure government power was not abused.""
The 22-month investigation revealed the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia. Despite the findings, Democrats have demanded to see the full report unredacted. Barr said he can't do that, but did promise senators more access to the investigation when it comes to the grand jury material.
Barr stopped short in releasing new details about the Mueller investigation saying that he ""will not discuss the report until it's released."" The redacted report should be released sometime next week.
Barr said he'll answer more questions from lawmakers next month."

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) summarized the September 11 terror attacks as an event in which ""some people did something,"" sparking outrage among critics who accuse her of trivializing the bloodiest terror attacks on American soil.
Omar was speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) fundraising event last month when she made the comments.
""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,"" Omar said.

Omar is a controversial congresswoman and has been accused of being anti-Semitic for her repeated comments about Israel and the Jewish people.
Republican chairwoman Ronna McDaniel urged Democrats to openly condemn Omar's alleged anti-Semitism and trivialization of the September 11 attacks.
""llhan Omar isn't just anti-Semitic – she's anti-American. Nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives to Islamic terrorists on 9/11, yet Omar diminishes it as: 'Some people did something.' Democrat leaders need to condemn her brazen display of disrespect,"" she said.

Others raised brows over Omar's attendance at the CAIR event. CAIR was infamously named as an unindicted co-conspirator in sending millions of charity funds to the Hamas terror group in the case against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development.
Omar also asked a judge to show leniency toward a group of Minnesota men accused of trying to join ISIS in 2015. The congresswoman was a Minnesota state representative at the time, joining in a letter to Judge Michael Davis that urged him to give the men shorter sentences, arguing that severe punishment for their crimes would motivate others to join the terror group.
""Incarcerating 20-year-old men for 30 or 40 years is essentially a life sentence. Society will have no expectations of the to-be 50- or 60-year-old released prisoners; it will view them with distrust and revulsion,"" read Omar's letter to the judge, as obtained by FOX 9 of Minneapolis-St. Paul.
Last week, Omar asked the Trump administration to work for the release of Hoda Abdelmonem, a senior member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood who is imprisoned in Egypt.
""I recently met with @jkbadawy and @thefreedomi to talk about Hoda Abdelmonem, a political prisoner in Egypt. I hope that Trump brings up her case in his meeting with the regime that has imprisoned her. We must work to #FreeHoda,"" Omar said.

"Barr Deflects Accusations on Mueller Summary, Now Investigating Obama's FBI for Trump Campaign Wiretaps",www.cbn.com,Charlene Aaron,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/barr-deflects-accusations-on-mueller-summary-now-investigating-obamas-fbi-for-trump-campaign-wiretaps,"US Attorney General William Barr faced off for the first time Tuesday with House lawmakers about his handling of the Mueller report. Now he's back on the hot seat testifying before a Senate subcommittee Wednesday.
Barr is responding to Democratic criticism over his summary of Mueller. He says the redacted report will be released next week, but that may not be good enough for Democrats.
""I do think it's important that the public have an opportunity to learn the results of the special counsel's work,"" Barr said.
Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday, Barr stuck to his promise to deliver a redacted version of the report in coming days.
""And so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public, and then I will engage with the chairmen of both Judiciary Committees about that report, and about any further requests that they have,"" Barr said.
Although Barr was officially on Capitol Hill to testify about the Justice Department's budget, many lawmakers circled back to the Russia investigation.
Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY) said, ""I must say it is extraordinary to evaluate hundreds of pages of evidence legal documents, and finding based on a 22-month-long inquiry, and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours. Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it's more suspicious than impressive.""
Democrats have been critical of Barr's approach and want to see the complete conclusions of the Mueller investigation, threatening to issue a subpoena if they don't get what they want.
Barr addressed scrutiny of his four-page letter summarizing his main conclusions from Mueller's nearly 400-page report, stating the Mueller team's finding that neither President Trump or his campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia's interference with the 2016 election.
Lowey said, ""All we have is your four-page report which seems to cherry pick to draw most favorable for president.""
He defended his decision to release that letter instead of summaries written by the special counsel.
""I think any summary regardless of who prepares it not only runs the risk of, you know, being under-inclusive or over-inclusive but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once,"" Barr said. ""I tried to use as much of the special counsel's own language as I could. They were just stating the bottom line conclusions.""
House Republicans are ready to move on. Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA) said, ""No collusion, no obstruction. It's over, it's done.""
""Well, the letter - the letter speaks for itself,"" Barr said.
Meanwhile, Barr is also investigating whether the FBI abused its authority in getting wiretaps on Trump aides that fueled the investigation leading to the Mueller probe.
The attorney general testifies before the Senate Wednesday, and he says he will answer more questions from Congress next month after the full Mueller report has been released."
Pro-Lifers Argue 'the Tide Is Turning in America' as Pain-Capable Abortion Ban Revived in Congress,www.cbn.com,Abigail Robertson,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/pro-lifers-argue-the-tide-is-turning-in-america-as-pain-capable-abortion-ban-revived-in-congress,"WASHINGTON – Pro-life lawmakers are bringing back the fight to ban abortions after five months of pregnancy, saying that's the point at which scientific evidence shows babies being aborted feel pain.
Only seven countries currently allow elective abortions after five months of pregnancy, including the communist regimes in North Korea, Vietnam, and China. The United States is also part of this small group, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) hopes to change that through the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
""I want to get out of the club of seven,"" said Graham. ""I think most people, once they know what we're talking about, this will gain momentum and become law.""
Graham says there is mounting evidence proving babies in the womb feel pain at that stage.
""I would ask the opponents of this bill to dispute the fact that anesthesia is provided routinely to a child who is in the 5th month of the pregnancy, to protect the child from the pain that would occur to save its life through surgery,"" continued Graham.
Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) disputes the research and tells CBN News he believes the bill is a hoax.
""The bill as a whole is unsupported by science, it has no foundation in fact and it violates the Constitution,"" said Blumenthal. ""This proposal is doomed and divisive. It has no chances of success and simply further divides us in efforts to achieve progress.""
According to a 2019 Marist poll, 66% of all voters want this law passed.
""The tide is turning in America, and Americans are becoming more and more pro-life,"" claims Catherine Glenn Foster of Americans United for Life.
She testified at Tuesday's hearing alongside abortion survivor Melissa Ohden.
""The extreme abortion legislation is worrisome, it's painful,"" Ohden told CBN News.
Foster expressed shock that Democrat Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee and are running for president in 2020, skipped the hearing.
""It was really telling that they don't want to go on the record and maybe be seen as being so extreme that they would oppose this common sense law, common sense bill that the majority of Americans agree on, even pro-choice Americans,"" said Foster.
She says according to abortion industry studies, health reasons are not the main reason why the majority of women seek these later abortions.
""Their own studies say in fact it's not because of fetal anomaly, it's not because of life of the mother – it's because in large part the same reasons why women seek those first trimester abortions. It's issues of finances, it's relationship issues, it's not really feeling ready to handle a pregnancy yet,"" continued Foster.
Senator Graham says he knows getting the votes in the House and Senate will be tough right now, but he's committed to fight for this over the long haul."
"Scientists Reveal First Image Ever Made of a Black Hole, Confirming Einstein's Theory",www.cbn.com,Seth Borenstein,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/scientists-reveal-first-image-ever-made-of-a-black-hole-confirming-einsteins-theory,"WASHINGTON (AP) - Scientists on Wednesday revealed the first image ever made of a black hole, depicting its hot, shadowy edges where light bends around itself in a cosmic funhouse effect.
Assembling data gathered by eight radio telescopes around the world, astronomers created the picture showing the violent neighborhood around a supermassive black hole, the light-sucking monsters of the universe theorized by Einstein more than a century ago and confirmed by observations for decades.
It looked like a flaming orange, yellow and black ring.
""We have seen what we thought was unseeable. We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole. Here it is,"" said Sheperd Doeleman of Harvard.
Jessica Dempsey, a co-discoverer and deputy director of the East Asian Observatory in Hawaii, said it reminded her of the powerful flaming Eye of Sauron from the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.
Unlike smaller black holes that come from collapsed stars, supermassive black holes are mysterious in origin. Situated at the center of most galaxies, including ours, they are so dense that nothing, not even light, can escape their gravitational pull. This one's ""event horizon"" - the point of no return around it, where light and matter begin to fall inexorably into the abyss - is as big as our entire solar system.
Three years ago, scientists using an extraordinarily sensitive observing system heard the sound of two much smaller black holes merging to create a gravitational wave, as Albert Einstein predicted. The new image, published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters and announced around the world in several news conferences, adds light to that sound.
Outside scientists suggested the achievement could be worthy of a Nobel Prize, just like the gravitational wave discovery.
While much around a black hole falls into a death spiral and is never to be seen again, the new image captures ""lucky gas and dust"" circling at just far enough to be safe and seen millions of years later on Earth, Dempsey said.
Taken over four days when astronomers had ""to have the perfect weather all across the world and literally all the stars had to align,"" the image helps confirm Einstein's general relativity theory, Dempsey said. Einstein a century ago even predicted the symmetrical shape that scientists just found, she said.
""It's circular, but on one side the light is brighter,"" Dempsey said. That's because that light is approaching Earth.
The measurements are taken at a wavelength the human eye cannot see, so the astronomers added color to the image. They chose ""exquisite gold because this light is so hot,"" Dempsey said. ""Making it these warm gold and oranges makes sense.""
What the image shows is gas heated to millions of degrees by the friction of ever-stronger gravity, scientists said. And that gravity creates a funhouse effect where you see light from both behind the black hole and behind you as the light curves and circles around the black hole itself, said astronomer Avi Loeb, director of the Black Hole Initiative at Harvard. (The lead scientists in the discovery are from Harvard, but Loeb was not involved.)
The project cost $50 million to $60 million, with $26 million of that coming from the National Science Foundation.
Johns Hopkins astrophysicist Ethan Vishniac, who was not part of the discovery team but edits the journal where the research was published, pronounced the image ""an amazing technical achievement"" that ""gives us a glimpse of gravity in its most extreme manifestation.""
He added: ""Pictures from computer simulations can be very pretty, but there's literally nothing like a picture of the real universe, however fuzzy and monochromatic.""
""It's just seriously cool,"" said John Kormendy, a University of Texas astronomer who wasn't part of the discovery team. ""To see the stuff going down the tubes, so to speak, to see it firsthand. The mystique of black holes in the community is very substantial. That mystique is going to be made more real.""
There is a myth that says a black hole would rip you apart, but Loeb and Kormendy said the one pictured is so big, someone could fall into it and not be torn to pieces. But the person would never be seen from again.
Black holes are ""like the walls of a prison. Once you cross it, you will never be able to get out and you will never be able to communicate,"" Loeb said.
The first image is of a black hole in a galaxy called M87 that is about 53 million light years from Earth. One light year is 5.9 trillion miles, or 9.5 trillion kilometers. This black hole is about 6 billion times the mass of our sun.
The telescope data was gathered by the Event Horizon Telescope two years ago, but it took so long to complete the image because it was a massive undertaking, involving about 200 scientists, supercomputers and hundreds of terabytes of data delivered worldwide by plane.
The team looked at two supermassive black holes, the M87 and the one at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. The one in our galaxy is closer but much smaller, so they both look the same size in the sky. But the more distant one was easier to take pictures of because it rotates more slowly.
""We've been hunting this for a long time,"" Dempsey said. ""We've been getting closer and closer with better technology.""

"Airbnb Reverses Ban on Israeli Homes in West Bank, Says it Never Supported BDS",www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/airbnb-reverses-ban-on-israeli-homes-in-west-bank-says-it-never-supported-bds,"JERUSALEM, Israel - Airbnb has reversed its decision to ban home listings in Israeli settlement communities in historic Judea and Samaria, also known as the West Bank.
Airbnb announced the policy change after a court settlement Monday between the hospitality service and several American Jewish plaintiffs who sued the company.
Last November, the company vowed to ""remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.""
A copy of the settlement obtained by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency says that Airbnb will now allow rentals in both Palestinian Arab communities and Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria. However, the company said it will not profit off of the listings and will instead donate the money to humanitarian organizations.
The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination against minorities in the US. The plaintiffs, who are American but own property in Judea and Samaria, argued that Airbnb discriminated against them for being Jewish, while Christians and Muslims were still allowed to post rental properties in the West Bank.
Airbnb objected to accusations that it intended to alienate its Jewish customers and shot down claims that it supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.
""Airbnb recognizes that its decision to apply its Policy to Subject Listings in the Affected Region has been met with strong objections by some members of the Airbnb community as well as other individuals and groups supportive of Israel,"" the settlement document reads. ""Some have even sought to associate Airbnb with the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (""BDS"") movement. Airbnb is clear that it does not intend, and has never intended, to align itself with the BDS movement or to otherwise position the company as adverse to any segment of its community.""
Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, president of Shurat Hadin, the law firm that represented the Jewish plaintiffs said other companies need to take Airbnb's lead.
""Other international companies need to learn the lessons from Airbnb's mistake and understand that boycotting Israel and discriminating against Jews are unlawful acts, which will ultimately result in dire legal consequences, public condemnations and embarrassment,"" Darshan-Leitner said.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state would boycott Airbnb over its policy. Now, Desantis applauds the company for its reversal.
""I am encouraged to hear that @Airbnb will not move forward with its policy that would eliminate the listings of Israeli properties. Florida will never support companies that discriminate against Israel,"" he said.

"Netanyahu Wins Re-election in Israel, Rival Party Concedes Defeat After Close Race",www.cbn.com,Chris Mitchell,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/netanyahu-wakes-up-to-victory-after-most-of-israels-votes-counted,"TEL AVIV - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party won a hard-fought victory against Benny Gantz's rival Blue and White party after a bruising election. The Blue and White party conceded defeat late Wednesday even after winning a substantial number of seats in the Israeli parliament known as the Knesset.
By Wednesday morning, 97 percent of the votes were counted and showed the Likud party tied with Blue and White. As of 9 a.m., Likud had won 26.27 percent of the votes, earning them 35 seats in the Knesset. Blue and White won 25.94 percent, also giving them 35 seats.
However, Israel's broader bloc of right-wing parties won a majority of the 120 Knesset seats, giving Netanyahu the support he needs to form a coalition government and remain prime minister.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked supporters at a victory party in Tel Aviv Tuesday night.
""Remember, 25 years ago, it was the first time that Sara and I stood here. And here we have returned here, because of you and for you,"" Netanyahu said, adding that his win against Gantz was ""almost unprecedented.""
Netanyahu's victory was history in the making. He will be Israel's longest-serving prime minister.
Meanwhile, Gantz had held on to the hope of forming his own coalition, but it didn't work out.
Some had speculated that a unity government between Netanyahu and Gantz would help the country heal from a bitter election, and respond to threats from Iran and Hamas.
""We need to see who are the parties that are in the game. So two days from now we'll be smarter about the coalition. But one thing we know about, and for sure, Netanyahu is the next prime minister,"" said Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Although Netanyahu's coalition will be right-wing, he says he wants to make sure all Israelis are represented.
""I intend to work quickly to establish a stable government. I want to make it clear, it will be a right-wing government, but I intend to be the prime minister of all Israeli citizens, right or left, Jews or non-Jews alike, all Israeli citizens,"" said Netanyahu.
Before the election, the prime minister pledged to annex Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), and said he wouldn’t uproot any of them. Israeli political analyst Elie Pieprz told CBN News it is time.
“The voters, the people, want to apply Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. There’s no doubt Judea and Samaria are part of Israel and that’s the way Israelis see it,” Pieprz said.
Netanyahu has already spoken with many probable partners in his latest coalition, almost certainly a government of the right. That would include two religious parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism. They finished third and fourth in the voting.
The Times of Israel reports that voter turnout was 67.8 percent, which is down from 2015's 71.8 percent. A spokesperson for the Likud party confirmed to CBN News that voter turnout is low this election.

Measles Outbreak Causes NYC Health Emergency: 'One of the Most Contagious Viruses Known to Man',www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/measles-outbreak-causes-nyc-health-emergency-one-of-the-most-contagious-viruses-known-to-man,"A spike in cases of measles has New York City declaring a public health emergency – 285 of the 465 cases found across the country are located in the area.
Most of the outbreak has happened within a large Orthodox Jewish community. Now, public officials are requiring children in the community to be vaccinated and will fine parents up to $1,000 if they aren't.
""This is an unusual action,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio stated. ""And it's because of the sheer extent of the crisis.""
Measles, a disease declared eliminated in the US in 2000, has seen a resurgence over the past few years. The disease leads to multiple health problems like pneumonia, brain swelling, seizures, deafness or intellectual disability. While measles deaths rarely take place in the US, over 110,000 people died globally in 2017 from the disease.
The reason measles has seen a return is a result of parents turning away from vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says roughly 80% of the US cases are in ages 19 or younger. In the Jewish community in New York, anti-vaccine sentiment has been popular which contributes to children catching the disease.
Besides New York, outbreaks have happened in Washington state, California, Michigan and New Jersey this year. The outbreak in Washington is correlated to a community where only 80% of children received the vaccination.
Though the vaccination is required to attend US schools, the National Conference of State Legislatures says 17 states allow some type of non-medical exemption for ""personal, moral or other beliefs.""
""We try to control our school, and we really strive to comply 100% with the Department of Health,"" Rabbi David Oberlander, Yeshiva Kehilath Yakov School in NY, said. ""But we don't control the parents, and we don't intend to control the parents.""
The virus easily spreads from coughing or sneezing. It can live for up to two hours in the air or on nearby surfaces. Nine out of 10 unvaccinated people will catch the disease if they come in contact with it.

The most expensive painting ever sold at an art auction is missing. And it seems no one can account for it.
A painting of Jesus Christ which art historians believe was done by Leonardo da Vinci was purchased by an anonymous buyer for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in 2017 for $450 million. The painting called ""Salvator Mundi"" was to be exhibited at the Louvre Abu Dhabi.
One month after the auction, The New York Times reports the museum's culture department announced the painting would be displayed as a part of its collection. Last September, the painting was scheduled to be unveiled, but the event was canceled with no explanation.
The Louvre Abu Dhabi's culture department and staff have refused to answer any questions about the painting. Also, an official at the Louvre in Paris, which licenses its name to the Abu Dhabi museum, told the Times their staff has been unable to locate the ""Salvator Mundi.""
In addition, both museums refused to provide a comment to the Times .
Believed to have been painted around 1500, the painting's provenance even includes it being listed in the inventory of King Charles I of England's collection after he was executed in 1649, the newspaper reported. The painting then disappears from the historical record sometime in the late 1700s.
However, the heavily painted-over artwork later turned up in the collection of a 19th-century British industrialist. Art historians at the time surmised it was the work of one of da Vinci's students.
Then in 2005, two dealers saw it at an auction in New Orleans and brought it to Dianne Modestini, a professor at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and a conservator, the Times reported.
Modestini restored the details, stripping away the overpainting, and repaired damage to the wood panel.
In 2013, the painting was bought by Russian billionaire, Dmitry E. Rybolovlev for $127.5 million who auctioned it off at Christy's in New York four years later. At the time of the Saudi prince's purchase, some art historians were skeptical the painting was one of da Vinci's works.
Rumors abound in the art world as to the exact whereabouts of the painting. One story currently circulating is it was taken to Europe after payment was made.
Modestini said that she had heard from a restoration expert that he had been asked by an insurance company to examine the painting in Zurich last fall before further shipping.
But the examination was canceled the Times reported and the expert declined to comment.
""After that, the trail goes completely cold,"" Modestini said"
Attorney General Barr: 'I Think Spying Did Occur' Against Trump Campaign,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/attorney-general-barr-i-think-spying-did-occur-against-trump-campaign,"President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr (Official White House Photo by Tia Dufour) 6025120234001 Attorney General Barr: 'I Think Spying Did Occur' Against Trump Campaign
CAPITOL HILL -- Attorney General William Barr says he does think campaign spying happened leading up to the 2016 election, adding that it's his ""obligation"" to look into it.
The comments came from Barr during Senate testimony Wednesday. He was testifying for a second day at a congressional budget hearing that was dominated by questions about special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation.
Calling this a ""big deal"", Barr plans to get to the bottom of what originally sparked the Mueller investigation in July 2016.
""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr told the panel. As a result, he's putting together a team to uncover the origin of the Mueller probe. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen asked Barr directly if he believed spying on the campaign occurred, and he said: ""Yes I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.""
Barr wants to review if the threshold for initiating a counterintelligence probe should be adjusted. ""I am not saying that in-proper surveillance occurred,"" the attorney general said. ""I am saying that I am concerned about it and am looking into it. I feel that I have an obligation to ensure government power was not abused."" The 22-month investigation revealed the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia. Despite the findings, Democrats have demanded to see the full report unredacted. Barr said he can't do that, but did promise senators more access to the investigation when it comes to the grand jury material. Barr stopped short in releasing new details about the Mueller investigation saying that he ""will not discuss the report until it's released."" The redacted report should be released sometime next week.
Barr said he'll answer more questions from lawmakers next month."
National Review Nails Leftist Activists: 'The War on Chick-fil-A Is Chicken McCarthyism' - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/national-review-nails-leftist-activists-the-war-on-chick-fil-a-is-chicken-mccarthyism,"National Review Nails Leftist Activists: 'The War on Chick-fil-A Is Chicken McCarthyism' 04-10-2019 Steve Warren
Rich Lowry, the editor of the National Review , has called out Chick-fil-A's opponents writing the recent bans from San Antonio and Buffalo's airports are not about social justice, but ""about punishing the Georgia-based company for the faith of its leadership.""
""The official bans are anti-Christian, unconstitutional and a harbinger of a larger effort to hunt down and punish any organization that has uncongenial views on sexual morality,"" Lowry writes in the April 9 op-ed .
He points to San Antonio City Councilman Roberto Treviño's explanation of why Chick-fil-A was banned. ""Everyone has a place here, and everyone should feel welcome when they walk through our airport,"" Treviño said. Lowry highlights how ironic this statement really is.
""The irony of discriminating against Chick-fil-A in order to demonstrate the city's famous open-ness was, of course, lost on him,"" he wrote.
Chick-fil-A's growth as the largest, fastest-growing restaurant chain in America is well-documented due to its good food and fast, friendly service.
The hostility toward the company began in 2012 after CEO Dan Cathy's statements about his personal opposition to gay marriage and revelations that his foundation contributed to conservative groups. Responding to the backlash at the time, Cathy said the company would back off the gay marriage debate and instead, focus on chicken.
Despite the company's neutrality, according to Lowry, critics still detect the ""lingering stench of Christianity"" with their chicken.
The left-wing Think Progress issued a report widely circulated in the media accusing the company of ""anti-equality"" giving. As Lowry explains this means the company donated to the Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (and a small Christian home for troubled young men in Vidalia, Georgia).
The editor also points out that since the Salvation Army raises about $2 billion a year, a lot of other people are guilty of the same offense.
He goes even further, writing, ""To consider all that the Salvation Army does — its thrift shops, aid for the homeless, disaster relief, anti-trafficking programs, Christmas gifts to needy children and much, much more — and reduce the organization to an allegedly anti-LGBTQ group is simply perverse."" Lowry says public officials participating in the current campaign against Chick-fil-A need to go back and read the Constitution.
""Any public official joining the punitive campaign against Chick-fil-A needs a remedial lesson in the Constitution, which forbids discrimination against private companies on the basis of political or religious viewpoint. It is the enemies of Chick-fil-A who are intolerant and out of the mainstream. They desperately need to abandon their tawdry McCarthyite crusade — and Eat Mor Chikin,"" he wrote."
