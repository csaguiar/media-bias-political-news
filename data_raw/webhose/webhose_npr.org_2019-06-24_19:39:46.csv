"As Opioids Fuel Growing Female Prison Population, Ohio Tries Alternative Treatment",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727025795/as-opioids-fuel-growing-female-prison-population-ohio-tries-alternative-treatmen?station=KXJZ_FM,"Ohio's growing female prison population can be tied to drugs and addiction. Officials want to stop the cycle. One program helps women get at the root of their problems to help them change.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Ohio has one of the largest female prison populations in the country. There are about nine times more women behind bars in the state today as there were just a few decades ago. And experts agree addiction has been fueling this rapid growth. Paige Pfleger from member station WOSU reports on one program inside a state prison that's trying to help women overcome addiction and change their lives.
JAMIE MONGHAN: These are our rooms. We don't really spend a lot of time in there. Only time we really is in there is during count time. Other than that, we're out here program...
PAIGE PFLEGER, BYLINE: Wearing a blue uniform and matching blue eyeshadow, Jamie Monghan gives a tour of her prison unit. It looks like a brightly decorated elementary school. The walls are covered in multicolored handprints and encouraging sayings, like family is a verb and one day at a time.
MONGHAN: We able to come out our rooms and, if we having a bad day, look around and be able to see some of the things that might encourage us.
PFLEGER: Monghan is serving a seven-year sentence for robbery at the Ohio Reformatory for Women. She lives inside the Tapestry Treatment Community. It's the only addiction recovery unit for incarcerated women in the state. It uses a tiered approach and group therapy to help women identify the root causes that lead to addiction. For Monghan, that was being molested and pressured into an abortion at a young age.
MONGHAN: It's been a really huge eye-opener for me. A lot of things that I've been through in my life that I try to shut out and I didn't even think affected me, I'm starting to realize that it really did.
PFLEGER: Tapestry opened in 1990 as the opioid epidemic raged through Ohio, incarcerating women at the highest rates in the state's history.
MONGHAN: This is a safe haven.
PFLEGER: The unit has more than 100 beds reserved for women brought in on drug charges or struggling with addiction. In Ohio, that's a lot of the female prison population. In fact, 35% of all charges against women in the last decade were drug related. And that doesn't include theft and burglary, which are often tied to addiction, too, says retired Franklin County drug court judge, Scott VanDerKarr.
SCOTT VANDERKARR: They're either stealing to feed their habit or, you know, getting involved in other criminal activity due to their opiate addiction or to their substance use disorder. We need to get people with substance use disorder into treatment and not in our prisons, and that's what's been happening.
PFLEGER: That's where programs like Tapestry come in. As the population of women exploded, it became readily apparent that addiction and recovery services needed to grow, too. Ronette Burkes heads all of Ohio's women's prisons.
RONETTE BURKES: Our responsibility is not to punish people. The punishment is their sentence to prison. Our responsibility is to help enhance and change their lives.
PFLEGER: From 7:30 until 5:00 every day, inmates in the Tapestry Program have nonstop group therapy. They talk about relapse prevention, health, domestic violence. Inmate Jamie Monghan says the work doesn't stop there.
MONGHAN: This is like a community, so we are held at a higher standard. This is our house.
PFLEGER: She says her fellow inmates, her sisters, hold each other accountable around the clock. It's helped her learn to set boundaries and to advocate for herself.
MONGHAN: I've been working my butt off. And every opportunity that I have in here is to actually be able to be a better person, I'm taking it because I'm worth it. You know, I know that now. And I know that something has to change in my life in order for me to be able to move forward.
PFLEGER: The recidivism rate for women in Ohio is about 17% according to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. For women released from Tapestry, the rate is about a third of that. For NPR News, I'm Paige Pfleger in Marysville, Ohio.

Barbershop: How Political Reporters Cover 2020 Female Candidates,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727025778/barbershop-how-political-reporters-cover-2020-female-candidates?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Democratic strategist Jess McIntosh, Christian Science Monitor reporter Christa Case Bryant, and journalist Christine Rosen.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to focus on U.S. politics now as the unofficial start of summer, Memorial Day weekend, is when the candidate visits to the fish fries and the bull roast and state fairs really get going. So we thought this would be a good time to take a look at a few presidential candidates who've made news for what they are choosing not to do.
Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have said they will not participate in town halls presented by Fox News, with Warren saying she wouldn't contribute to the ratings of what she called a hate-for-profit racket. Now, some political reporters and commentators have contrasted them unfavorably with, say, the South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, who did appear on Fox and got a warm reception.
But there has been very little discussion about the merits of their decisions, and that got us thinking more broadly about how the women candidates decisions, not to mention their biographies, are represented by a press corps and, for want of a better term, a pundit class that's still largely white and male, but who are transmitting these decisions to an electorate that's far more diverse. A number of journalists have been writing about this, so we thought we'd take the conversation into the Barbershop, which is, irony noted, a bit of a gendered term. But that's what we call these weekly roundtables where we talk with interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds.
So joining us this week are Christa Case Bryant. She's a national political reporter for the Christian Science Monitor. She just wrote a big piece about this very subject. She's with us from Boston. Christa, thanks for joining us.
CHRISTA CASE BRYANT: My pleasure.
MARTIN: And Christine Rosen is a senior writer at Commentary Magazine, and she's with us from her home in Washington, D.C. Christine, welcome to you. Thank you for joining us.
CHRISTINE ROSEN: Thanks for having me.
MARTIN: And Jess McIntosh is the former director of communications outreach for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. She is with us from New York. Jess, welcome to you as well. Thanks for joining us.
JESS MCINTOSH: Thanks so much for having me.
MARTIN: So let's start with the candidates' decision. As we mentioned, they have faced criticism. Political commentator Bill Maher told the Democrats to grow a pair and appear on Fox News as a way to appeal to the Fox News audience. The clear implication is that they are weak. But Warren has been campaigning in areas that Trump won and among constituencies where he's popular. She's just saying she's not going to appear on Fox. So, Jess, I'll start with you on this as - because you are the strategist here. What do you make of her decision and that of Kamala Harris to turn this offer down?
MCINTOSH: I mean, I think it's a smart one. Everybody has to make their own decision about whether or not to go on Fox. It commands a huge market share of the audience, so I see wanting to do it. But I think what Elizabeth and Kamala are doing is really important. That doesn't mean you write off red states. That doesn't mean you write off Republican crowds. But Fox News under Trump has become something other than just a conservative media outlet. And I think it's fair to recognize that and question whether they should have a role in who we choose as our nominee.
MARTIN: OK. Christine, what about you? You're a person who writes for conservative media as well as for other outlets. What do you make of her decision - or their decision?
ROSEN: I think it's a mistake, actually. I think it suggests a kind of contempt for a viewer that is wrongheaded and isn't going to help an electorate that's already highly polarized. And look. Let's be honest. Fox News is not Russian state television. It's obviously got a partisan bias. You could make the same argument about certain shows and programs that air on MSNBC, for example. But I think a candidate should go on and should talk to different kinds of voters. And yes, obviously they're they're going to be campaigning in red states.
But there's a real danger about this sort of contempt that I think a lot of politicians - on both sides of the aisle, it should be noted - have been demonstrating recently. And if we want to move towards a more healthy civic and political culture, that's the wrong direction to be going and is to be saying, I absolutely won't appear on this entire network. Look. I don't agree with everything on Fox News either. But I think it's a missed opportunity for them, to be honest.
MARTIN: Christa?
BRYANT: Yeah?
MARTIN: Do you want to answer this? I can give you a pass if you want to because you're a beat reporter. But if you feel comfortable answering it, I am interested...
BRYANT: No, I'd be happy to.
MARTIN: ...In your take on it.
BRYANT: I actually - before the presidential campaign really got going, I spent the last year and a half as our heartland correspondent traveling through a lot of areas where Trump had done very well in 2016. And every time I went on one of those trips, I just was so struck by how different things look through the eyes of folks in West Virginia or Kentucky or Nebraska or wherever I was than it does sitting in Boston or New York or whatever. And while I respect Warren and Harris wanting to take what they see as a principled decision on this, I do think it's a missed opportunity. And I think it will at least be perceived by people who watch Fox as a slight. And that could have negative impacts on their campaign.
MARTIN: Christine, to that end, you wrote a piece in which you wrote that there's no evidence - now, you didn't specifically look at coverage. You were talking about the behavior of the voters, OK? So you wrote that there isn't any evidence of systemic sexism or bias against female candidates running for office. You know, you were focusing on research mainly at the legislative level. But I'm going to ask you, as a person who's in the field yourself - having looked at this, do you think the women candidates are getting a less favorable coverage or more negative coverage relative to what they would be getting if they were men?
ROSEN: I don't. And I actually think the most important overarching point we should all recognize is that party identification remains a much more powerful force in deciding whether or not to support a candidate than sex. I mean, I - honestly, the concern I have is the pipeline. I would like to see more women running and winning at the legislative level, both state and for the House of Representatives. And we don't see enough women doing that.
MARTIN: So, Jess, is there anything else you wanted to add? Like, is there something else that you'd like to see political writers, observers, think about when they cover this race? The first thing is, how would you frame that? Like, if you were making a sort of a checklist for reporters to say, look, this is the way - this is best practices, how would you proceed?
MCINTOSH: I want to see a balance in the quantity of coverage for sure. I mean, the amount that went into Beto as he was considering whether or not to get in, the amount that went into Biden for the three weeks before he got in - that kind of sustained, constant, relatively positive coverage has simply never been afforded to any of the women. And we can see what happens in polling data. Pete Buttigieg went from 1% to 11% after a week and a half of positive coverage about his candidacy.
If we cover the women who are doing the right things - I mean, Kamala is regularly speaking to 20,000 people. Elizabeth Warren is low-key reordering the economy to benefit workers and women. There are things to cover about their candidacies that could be covered at the same level as the guys are, and we're not quite there yet.
MARTIN: OK. Christine, what about you? If you were in charge of political coverage, if you had a checklist of best practices, what would be on it?
ROSEN: What I would like to see is more of a range on the part of the media not to rush to an argument about sexism, which in some odd ways can be detrimental to the female candidates themselves. But I think the media class in general - we all like narratives, right? It's easier to have a story to tell. I think we're heading in the right direction, but we need to be careful especially as, you know, pundits, commentators and reporters not to assume that the answer to every question when it comes to a female candidate is sexism.
MARTIN: OK. So let me go back to this question of why a number of people have written about the fact that Pete Buttigieg seems to have gotten some very favorable coverage just out of the gate. So the question is why. I mean, is it because he's a guy and because most of the political reporters, frankly, the present company notwithstanding, are guys? Or is there some other reason? Because the fact is, he's a glass ceiling breaker in his own right, so - as an openly gay man, as an Army veteran. You know, so what's your take on that, Christa?
BRYANT: Well, Politico had this really fascinating piece about Lis Smith, who's sort of the woman behind getting him on all of these media appearances. And it was really interesting to me to think about all of the women on senior staffs of campaigns who are working behind the scenes to help get their candidates coverage. And she is just a powerhouse. And it was amazing going back months getting him a lot of exposure and a lot of time with a lot of different outlets. And I think that made a huge difference in enabling him to start off his campaign with a great deal of momentum. So that's a really interesting point.
And there's actually - a number of the campaigns have a majority of women among their senior staff. And Castro and Sanders have more women than any of the other (laughter) - any of the women who are actually running. And even Trump has more women on his senior staff than Klobuchar, for example. So I think that's another interesting aspect to the conversation about how well are women's perspectives shaping our understanding of the primary.
MARTIN: So, Jess, what do you say about that? I know a number of people have written about the fact that Mayor Pete Buttigieg got some fairly favorable coverage coming out of the gate. Why do you think that is? Is it because he's a guy, or is there some other reason?
MCINTOSH: Oh, I think he's an incredibly impressive candidate. And I think it is - it cannot be overstated what it means to have an openly LGBT person running for office. I - that's just - that's incredibly inspiring, and it speaks to the diversity of the Democratic Party on this field, and I'm over the moon about it.
But having women in senior staffs across the field really means that a lot of candidates are engaging with issues that matter to women in a much more thoughtful way than they ever have before. The idea that we're talking about immigration as a women and families issue, the idea that we're talking about minimum wage as a women's issue - all of this - it matters greatly to getting the right kinds of policies that are going to benefit women, which is why it matters to have diverse candidates running in the first place. It's not about a pretty picture. It's about a better country and better policies.
MARTIN: OK. Christine, you wanted to say something about that?
ROSEN: Yes. I think - look. The reason that Buttigieg is getting a ton of press where maybe some of the other female candidates are not is that he has a unique and uniquely American story. He's telling a really fascinating story. And I - one disagreement I would have on this is, yes, he's an openly gay man. But he's been actually really savvy in the sense that he hasn't made identity politics his platform.
He has a wide range of issues he's concerned about. He's a military vet. You know, he's a small town mayor, so he brings a whole lot of issues at the local level to a national platform in an interesting way. And I think at a time where our politics is so incredibly polarized, where identity politics in particular is used to shut down conversations on both sides of the aisle in a way that isn't helpful to advancing debate and crafting, you know, compromise policies on important issues.
The other thing is, you know, he's the - he was the shiny, new object for a couple of weeks. Whenever a candidate announces, there's a little boom of coverage. We'll see, I think, as the debates start to happen how the candidates shake out in terms of the - their ability to sustain the American people's attention in such a kind of never-ending primary race.
MARTIN: Christa Case Bryant is national political reporter for the Christian Science Monitor. Christine Rosen is a senior writer at Commentary Magazine. And Jess McIntosh is a Democratic strategist and former director of communications outreach for Hillary for America.
Thank you all so much for joining us.
BRYANT: Thank you.
MCINTOSH: Thank you

The Release And Supervision Of Radicalized Convicts,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727025771/the-release-and-supervision-of-radicalized-convicts?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Kevin Lowry, former Chief U.S. Probation Officer, about a program he's involved with to deradicalize convicted terrorists.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
On Thursday, John Walker Lindh, a man known as the American Taliban, was released from prison after serving 17 years of a 20-year sentence. Lindh was captured during the first months of the war in Afghanistan. He later pleaded guilty to aiding the Taliban and said he'd made a mistake joining them.
Now the question of what should happen to former jihadists and others committed to terrorist organizations is one that governments all over the world are confronting, especially the question of whether these prisoners can be safely released back to society. We wanted to talk about this with one of the few American officials who's faced this question in a comprehensive way in recent years, Kevin Lowry. He's not involved with Lindh's probation. But, as the former chief probation officer for the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, he oversaw a program that worked with people convicted of crimes related to terrorist activity. And I started by asking him how can anyone really know if someone involved with a terrorist group has changed.
KEVIN LOWRY: Well, I think it's very important to realize that we never go by somebody's words. We watch their actions and their behaviors. And we're constantly monitoring those through surveillance. They monitor very closely while they're in custody of the Bureau of Prisons. We monitor very closely while they're on supervision. So that's what we're doing in our monitoring to protect the community is to make sure that people aren't involved, or their activities do not put up red flags that they're engaging in extremist behaviors or activities.
MARTIN: Now, one of the reasons we've called you is that you've dealt with extremists from a lot of backgrounds in recent years - both former jihadists and white supremacists, or people who belong to these far-right extremist groups. Why Minnesota?
LOWRY: Well, one of the things that brought this to forefront for us is we have a immigrant population of about a hundred thousand people that has been very heavily targeted by al-Shabaab and ISIS. There is a number of young men and some women that have got involved in - with foreign terrorist organizations. We've had a lot of these cases come through our justice system, and we've had to work with them both on a pretrial basis through sentencing or a conviction process.
In addition to that, we're dealing with them as they're coming out on supervised release into the community after being incarcerated in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.
MARTIN: So the program in Minnesota, was the goal of the program to de-radicalize people? Was the goal to assess whether they had educated themselves about the consequences of the ideologies that they had been loyal to? What was the goal? How did it work?
LOWRY: It's forensic in nature, and it very carefully breaks down all of the person's history, all of their involvement in the terrorist organization. It involves looking at things like, did they have a loss or a broken identity or lack of identity? Do they have meaning purpose or belonging in addition to that status and ideology? We start with dissecting these things in a psychological fashion and working with them to re-establish somebody's identity, to give them a meaning and purpose, to give them some sort of belonging in addition to developing a status as - in community, which we hope is a successful law-abiding citizen.
But it's a very complex process that requires identifying underlying factors of, why did people get involved in terrorism in the first place, and then what underlying factors were triggers for them, and then how can we counter those throughout the process?
MARTIN: Well, what do you make of the narrative around Lindh? I mean, at the time he was sentenced, he said it was a mistake. He said it was a mistake to join the Taliban. It was a mistake to go and fight with them. But subsequently, there have been these reports by - allegedly by U.S. government assessors - saying that he supports ISIS or that he supports their goals. How do you assess something like that? How do you - what do you make of that?
LOWRY: In any case where somebody hasn't denounced a group cause or ideology that advocates for terrorism or criminal extremism, then - A, that is a red flag, and it's something that you need to watch. But also what we see with a lot of these cases is leakage. And leakage is when some sort of information that is passed between extremists or in other correspondence from extremists, or that they advocate for some sort of extremist organization or ideology other than their own, gives us a clear indication that they have not made some sort of cognitive shift away from violent or criminal extremism.
MARTIN: You know, thousands of people around the world are facing these situations now. I mean, these people who left lots of countries to go overseas and connect with ISIS or fight for ISIS or marry people involved with these extremist organizations, they're coming back. Do you have advice for your officials in other parts of the country, or perhaps even the world, about how we should start thinking about this as a society?
LOWRY: Well, I think first and foremost that it has to be a focus area, and, A and B, that it has to be very well-funded. We can't think of this as an issue of the day, and then a 24-hour news cycle passes, and it's not the topic that's hot in the media attention at the moment. Every time that we stop or we don't continue to move forward when a catastrophic event occurs, then we're going to be in a situation where asking the same questions - what are we doing? Why aren't we doing more? What should be done?
MARTIN: That's Kevin Lowry. He is the former chief probation officer for the U.S. District Court in Minnesota. Mr. Lowry, thank you so very much for talking to us.
LOWRY: You're welcome. And thank you.

toggle caption Myriam Santos/Courtesy of the artist Mavis Staples' latest album, We Get B y, is out now.
Myriam Santos/Courtesy of the artist Mavis Staples could've retired in good conscience years ago.
But slowing down isn't her style.
With her father, sisters and brother as The Staple Singers, her gospel songs scored the civil rights movement.
More than a half century later, as Staples nears 80, the decorated R&B star continues to train her soulful pipes on hope and resilience in her call for change.
As her lifelong mission endures, she's been pushing out new material with contemporary artists. Ben Harper produced and wrote most of the songs on her new album, We Get By , after Mavis and the singer-songwriter clicked during a collaboration on her 2016 album, Livin' on a High Note.
In a recent interview, NPR's Michel Martin caught up with Staples from her hometown of Chicago, following up on their conversation in 2016 , around the time that then President Obama celebrated Staples at the Kennedy Center Honors.
As she told Martin at the time, Staples felt that the world looked a lot like it did in the 1960s, and said she respected artists who were singing to inspire change.
Her tune remains the same.
""We're going at the world backwards,"" Staples said. ""We need a change. And every chance I get I'm going to sing songs of change.""
Hear their conversation at the audio link, and read an edited version below.
Mavis Staples, ""Change"" ANTI- Records YouTube Interview Highlights On what keeps her going
It's what I love to do. I'm happiest when I'm singing. I'm just grateful that I have so many fans that still want to hear me, you know, and grateful to the record company for making room for me to continue. It's my gift — it's what God put me here for, I do believe.
On her collaboration with Ben Harper
Ben had written me a song for one of my other albums, Livin' on a High Note . And that song was ""Love and Trust."" I fell so in love with that song and every time we'd sing it, the audience they would just roar. We'd been singing it for a couple of years.
Then I ran into Ben on the road — we would always meet up somewhere on the road. I said ""Ben, you have got to write me another song."" He said, ""Well, Mavis, why don't I write you 11 songs,"" he said, ""Let's make an album."" Sounds good to me, you know, I said ""I don't know if I could handle 11 good songs from Ben Harper."" He said, ""Well yeah, you can handle it Mave.""
He was not playing with me. I wasn't playing with him either. I love him so much. He is such a beautiful spirit. Actually, he's writing what I've been singing all my life. But all songwriters have a different twist and I like Ben's, I like it a lot.
On the opener track, ""Change""
I felt like I was singing with my family again. It was just in the groove of where we would sing, not to mention the message that's in that song: It is time for a change. It's been time a long time ago but, you know, now more than ever. It's just too many things going wrong.
I mentioned back in the '60s [ in a 2016 NPR interview ], and still the news reminds me of the '60s. We're going at the world backwards. You know we've got to change. We need a change. And every chance I get I'm going to sing songs of change .
On why she chose the 1956 Gordon Parks photo ("" Outside Looking In, Mobile, Alabama"" captures six African-American children peering into a whites-only park through a chain-link fence )
That photograph hit me like a ton of bricks. They had sent me about nine pictures, you know, trying to find something for the album. That was the only one I saw — and it grabbed me. You know, these little babies, standing on the outside — they want to swing, they want to go on the slide.
And it kind of reminded me of my sisters and I, we had that problem when we were growing up. We couldn't go to the beach, we couldn't go to the park. We wanted some grass where we lived, we didn't really have any grass, you know, we'd have to play in a vacant lot with dirt and glass so that photograph grabbed me in the heart and almost brought me to tears. I said, ""This is the one.""
On what she hopes her songs will give others
I hope my songs give them a reason to wake up, and think about what is going on in the world. And hopefully, they resonate with the audience. I've always hoped from the time we started singing the freedom songs that our songs, we're singing them to make a difference, you know, make a better place — help somebody instead of hurting somebody — so much we could do to make it better.
On whether she has a favorite song
I love every one, but I do love ""Heavy on My Mind.""

Great? No. But good.""
Alina Selyukh/NPR At 6:30 am, four of five Gordon family members are roaming around their suburban Sacramento house — if you only count the humans. There's also four dogs, a bunny, a tortoise, chickens, ducks, goats, and a not-so-miniature miniature pig named Squiggy.
Hilary Gordon is discussing the day's schedule with her husband in the middle of wrapping a breakfast sandwich for their 14-year-old, checking on cereal for their 17-year-old, and staring down their 11-year-old who just realized he forgot to finish today's math homework.
Having time like this with her family is a major reason why Gordon, 47, works as a shopper for the grocery-delivery app Instacart, in a suburb of Sacramento. ""I find it fun. It gives me something to do, I'm not out spending money. And I love the flexibility,"" she says.
Instacart is one of a slew of similar apps — DoorDash, Postmates, Shipt — paying tens of thousands of workers like Gordon to deliver packages, food or groceries to strangers. Similar to those who drive for rideshare apps Uber and Lyft, delivery workers can choose when to work. But they don't have to invite strangers into their cars.
Profiles Of America In Full Employment This draws women — often in their 40s and 50s — who now make up more than half of the contractors working for major food delivery apps.
Instacart told NPR more than 50% of people who shop for the app are women. DoorDash said women make up more than 50% of its ""dashers"" in rural and suburban areas, and more than 60% in urban areas. Target's Shipt declined to share this statistic. Postmates said an April survey of its workers showed 48% were female, and 38% had a child at home.
Gordon and a half-dozen other women shared details of working for delivery apps to NPR, which paint a picture of the epitome of gig work: Accessible but high-intensity, with pay that's quick but unpredictable and hours that are flexible but unreliable.
""I tell people, it's a great thing to have, if you're looking for extra money but you don't really need it,"" said Christina Lewkowitz, 50, who works for Instacart, DoorDash, Shipt, Deliv and a vineyard in Sacramento.
'I will not work for free'
After splitting up school drop-offs with her husband, Hilary Gordon parks her Subaru SUV in a grocery store parking lot. Her Instacart shift today is 8 am to 6 pm. She's got her shopping sneakers on and a fully charged phone — watching the screen for incoming grocery orders, which she will both shop and deliver.
The first ""batch,"" as they call it, is a bust: $8 with no tip, for seven items, to be taken 4 miles. But the store is 8 miles away. Instacart says it pays 60 cents per mile for delivery to the customer, but doesn't pay for the drive to the store in the first place. The company explains that it can't be sure that the worker, for example, isn't doing a non-Instacart gig until they begin shopping.

Alina Selyukh/NPR Logging miles is a big cost of the job. Some days Gordon might drive a hundred miles, filling up the tank at least once a day. For every order, she does quick math to calculate the gas expense. This $8 order doesn't cut it. Gordon picks one of her canned responses to Instacart: ""Pay too low. I will not work for free!""
""It's really hard to say yes to that, because you feel like, then they're thinking, 'Oh, well, see, they'll work for that' — and I don't want to work for that,"" Gordon says.
But you can't skip too many orders — the app will think you stopped working. Gordon gets a good one: eight items, for $9.87 plus a promise of a $6 tip. But most importantly, it's only 1.5 miles of driving. She can knock it out in about 20 minutes.
Shopping for other people is a bit like a scavenger hunt, except the app is timing you. You rush through the whole store, scanning every item that goes in the basket and messaging the customer with updates.
READ MORE: The Rise Of The Contract Workers Gordon checks each bell pepper for blemishes, throws a hail-mary on the ripeness of avocados, tells Instacart that ""organic celery"" is out of stock. The app suggests she grab ""spring water"" instead. Gordon laughs out loud.
After almost a year and a half with Instacart, Gordon says she still loves grocery shopping. And she especially loves meeting new people — chatting up store workers for help and playing with friendly pets she meets at customers' homes.
'Hopefully tomorrow is better'
Like a lot of gig workers, this is not a career Gordon pictured for herself. She has two master's degrees — in counseling and family therapy.
She worked as a therapist in other states, but a move to California required more classes and exams, right as her oldest was born. Gordon became a social worker, until she made the calculation familiar to many working women: Her job took up mornings and evenings, with a not-so-great salary.
""When you're going to pay the majority of it to let someone else raise your kids? Just didn't make any sense,"" Gordon says.

Alina Selyukh/NPR A few years later, the recession hit. Her husband lost his job in finance. Their house value dropped. They're still paying down the debt that stacked up. But now, there's also soccer, swim team, lacrosse, broken cleats, a junior prom dress, trips to look at colleges, AP exams, SAT tests and summer camp.
This rhythm is all-too familiar for women doing app work. Gigs help cover some expenses of child and health care — an opportunity for side-income on top of a steadier job, either the deliverer's or their partner's. Workers who do app-based jobs to supplement income is a growing cohort within the gig economy, says Shelly Steward of the Future of Work Initiative at the Aspen Institute.
Profiles Of America In Full Employment Hot Job Market Is Wooing Women Into Workforce Faster Than Men Gig workers are often ""independent contractors"" who don't get benefits like health insurance or sick leave. And when families piece together multiple jobs and gigs to make a living, ""the system of workplace benefits that's been in place does not adequately cover nearly as many workers,"" Steward says.
Stacie Ballard, 43, pieces together work for at least seven apps while building her own business in Atlanta. She keeps a stack of t-shirts in her trunk — green for Instacart, green and white to walk dogs for Wag, green and grey to deliver packages for Shipt — changing between gigs as she earns extra cash for her teenager's graduation and other expenses.
""If you're a mom or a caregiver or something, it's really flexible,"" Ballard said. ""It can be frustrating when you know you have certain bills that are coming up, and you're like, 'Ok, I need to make this much money. Hopefully tomorrow is better,' But so far it's always worked out.""
All the things to consider
Ballard, like many women in the gig economy, works for apps part time. For one, hustling full-time is exhausting. But also, hours can be hard to get.
On Instacart, available hour-long shifts get claimed within seconds, workers said. Part-time workers like Ballard and Lewkowitz often stalk the app all day, hoping to grab some.
Gordon is one of the Instacart regulars who gets ""early access"" to a full week's worth of shifts so she can get hours predictable and long enough to make the work worth it for her. But to qualify, she commits to doing this ""gig"" full-time, because ""early access"" requires working at least 90 hours in three weeks or 25 hours in three weekends.
Instacart says it's announced a pilot of a new way to qualify, which would encourage good customer ratings instead of long hours.
Even for full-timers like Gordon, signing up for shifts is ""anxiety-inducing."" She describes frantic clicking on Sunday mornings, when the schedule opens, selecting all the hour-slots before they get claimed, within minutes.
And after all that, as any gig worker knows, having more hours doesn't assure a huge paycheck bump. It might be a slow day, or long distances might make orders not worth the cost of gas. Workers also consider less obvious cost of these jobs. Is the order too complicated and time consuming? Too heavy?
All Tech Considered The Faceless Boss: A Look Into The Uber Driver Workplace Once, Gordon accidentally accepted a Costco batch with 81 cases of water. She says Instacart told her she could do multiple trips, but she refused and had to return — and ultimately give up — the whole order. So today, Gordon is eagle-eyed, spotting 13 cases of water in an otherwise appealing $32 batch.
One final thing she always checks is whether she knows the delivery address. Many delivery workers keep a mental track of locations that require climbing stairs, like apartments without elevators. On Gordon's mental list are also a house with the guy who greeted her in a robe, and an older man who pressured her into bringing his groceries inside and said he'd been tracking her.
And then there's the matter of tipping . Orders from businesses are notorious for being large and lacking tips. Workers say they wish the apps more aggressively encouraged their users to tip. Instacart recently changed its tipping system and retroactively compensated workers after workers and labor advocates fought a policy that counted tips toward base payments that Instacart promised for deliveries — sometimes offsetting what Instacart paid out of its own pocket.
Today, Gordon delivered eight orders in 10 hours, and made $133, before extra bumps for heavy orders and good reviews. Today was okay. There was one day when she made $50 in six hours. That wasn't worth it. Gordon's best day's haul was $255 — when she worked almost 12 hours.

toggle caption Lorne Matalon for NPR U.S. citizens use ropes to cross the Rio Grande from San Antonio del Bravo, Mexico, into Candelaria, Texas. U.S. citizens depend on the free health clinic in San Antonio del Bravo.
Lorne Matalon for NPR Along one rugged stretch of the Rio Grande, U.S. citizens routinely cross the border into the United States illegally. A shortage of basic services in rural Texas, such as health care, means U.S. citizens rely on Mexican services and rarely pass through an official port of entry on return.
Informal, unregulated crossings have been a fixture of life for generations in rural communities along the U.S.-Mexico border. Today, however, with the unrelenting focus on border security, this kind of unfettered back-and-forth by U.S. citizens is rare.
""We're citizens. We're U.S. citizens that have to go to get help in Mexico,"" said Loraine Tellez, a resident of the unincorporated town of Candelaria in West Texas. She said that the help principally involves health care.
There are two towns here, hamlets really, both remote within their own countries yet a stone's throw from each other across the Rio Grande — San Antonio del Bravo in Mexico and Candelaria in Texas. Their combined population is estimated by residents to be approximately 150 people.
National In Big Bend, Texas, There's Bipartisan Consensus: No Border Wall National Cellist Yo-Yo Ma Plays Bach In Shadow Of Border Crossing If you are in Texas and get sick or have an accident, you can walk across the river — using ropes to cross above the water — to a clinic in San Antonio del Bravo where treatment and medicine are free, paid for by the Mexican government even if you're a U.S. citizen. In the U.S., the nearest hospital is a long drive away in Alpine, Texas.
""A 10-minute walk versus three hours to the hospital,"" Tellez said, detailing her options.
It's not a violation of U.S. law to walk into Mexico. However, returning back to Candelaria is. The official port of entry is a 90-minute drive away.
All this back-and-forth has created an unspoken but clearly understood relationship between residents and the U.S. Border Patrol. Mike Shelton is the U.S. Border Patrol agent in charge for the region that includes Candelaria and a group of tiny river towns.

Lorne Matalon for NPR ""The Border Patrol doesn't want to admit that things like this are going on, but the reality of the situation is it does,"" Shelton explained. He said agents are trained to use their judgement on a case-by-case basis. ""We want these agents to reason for themselves: 'Is what I'm about to do going to further the interests of the government and society?' ""
""Just because we can take enforcement action doesn't necessarily mean we should,"" Shelton continued. ""We don't want agents to put people's lives at risk simply because [the agents] are blindly following the letter of the law. It's about being human.""
This area is also a well-trodden corridor for both human and drug smugglers. Residents said they'll tell agents if they have any misgivings about strangers they don't recognize.
""That's our way of helping them in order for them to help us,"" said Evelyn Lozano, 18, who said she has seen human smugglers passing through the region on multiple occasions.
Lozano is a U.S. citizen but effectively lives in both countries, with school in Texas during the week and weekends with family in San Antonio del Bravo. Lozano must travel three hours round trip each weekday to attend school in the border city of Presidio, Texas, because Candelaria does not have a school. Nor does it have a grocery store or gas station.
""They know that we are crossing illegally,"" Lozano said of Border Patrol agents working in the area from a small base in Candelaria. ""But they do understand the fact that we do need to cross sometimes in order to get help, in order for us to get food, in order for us to survive. So that's why we go to Mexico, because we don't get that help here in Texas.""
The help is reciprocal. Some Mexican citizens receive their mail in Candelaria because there's no postal service in San Antonio del Bravo. Their American relatives bring the mail across.
Tellez acknowledged that what is happening here flies in the face of border enforcement.
""Down deep in my heart it does make me feel guilty, but I have to do it sometimes,"" she said. However, she and other residents said, they don't flaunt what they're doing.
They understand that the Border Patrol has a job to do.
Meanwhile, the delicate dance between otherwise law-abiding U.S. citizens and border agents will continue on this isolated section of the Rio Grande."

Beer Archaeologists Are Reviving Ancient Ales : The Salt : NPR,www.npr.org,Rae Ellen Bichell,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/05/26/723983713/beer-archaeologists-are-reviving-ancient-ales-with-some-strange-results,"Enlarge this image Beer archaeologist Travis Rupp inspects his latest ""Ale of Antiquity,"" George Washington Porter, surrounded by the oak barrels it fermented in at Avery Brewing Co. in Boulder, Colo. Dustin Hall/The Brewtography Project Dustin Hall/The Brewtography Project Beer archaeologist Travis Rupp inspects his latest ""Ale of Antiquity,"" George Washington Porter, surrounded by the oak barrels it fermented in at Avery Brewing Co. in Boulder, Colo.
Dustin Hall/The Brewtography Project The closest that Travis Rupp came to getting fired from Avery Brewing Co. in Boulder, Colo., he says, was the time he tried to make chicha. The recipe for the Peruvian corn-based beer, cobbled together from bits of pre-Incan archaeological evidence, called for chewed corn partially fermented in spit. So, Rupp's first task had been to persuade his colleagues to gather round a bucket and offer up their chompers for the cause.
Once he got to brewing, the corn-quinoa-spit mixture gelatinized in a stainless steel tank, creating a dense blob equivalent in volume and texture to about seven bathtubs of polenta. Oops.
In another go, Rupp managed to avoid the brew's gelatinous fate, but encountered a new problem when it came time to drain the tank. ""It literally turned into cement in the pipes because the corn was so finely ground,"" says Rupp. ""People were a little cranky.""
These are the kinds of sticky situations that come with trying to bring ancient flavors into modern times.
A self-proclaimed beer archaeologist, Rupp has traveled the world in search of clues as to how ancient civilizations made and consumed beer. With Avery Brewing Co., he has concocted eight of them in a series called ""Ales of Antiquity."" The brews are served in Avery's restaurant and tasting room.
""The one thing that we've been really quite surprised by is not a single one of them is undrinkable,"" he says. ""Every one of them has gotten done and we're like, 'That is so weird. That is just so cool.' ""
There's the Viking-inspired beer based on information gleaned from sagas and the debris of ancient shipwrecks. It's made with juniper branches and baker's yeast, which gives it a slight but surprising whiff of banana. (Rupp regrets that he had to ferment it in regular brewing equipment rather than a more historically accurate trough made from a freshly cut and hollowed out juniper tree.)
Another, called Beersheba, is based on references and artifacts primarily from Israel. It involves three types of grain and pomegranate juice, in the style of King Zimri-Lim, who, Rupp read, was known to send slaves into the mountains to get snow for his icehouse so that his beer could be served cold. It's one of Rupp's personal favorites, despite smelling a little like baby spit-up and tasting like a funky fruit rollup.
A beer called Benedictus came about when Rupp teamed up with a couple of Italian monks to re-create a monastic recipe calling for wormwood and lavender and dating to A.D. 825. It smells like a spicy men's shampoo and tastes like drinking an herb garden. The Peruvian chicha, on the other hand, is sour and summery.
The brewery's latest is a porter meant to show what George Washington would have been swigging at Mount Vernon during his retirement years.
""It's also maybe a little too drinkable, as I would attest on the first night that this got released,"" says Rupp.
The Salt Meet The Indiana Jones Of Ancient Ales And Extreme Beverages Rupp is not alone in the world of beer archaeology. Patrick McGovern is scientific director of the Biomolecular Archaeology Project at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The author of Ancient Brews: Rediscovered and Re-Created, he is known as the ""Indiana Jones of Ancient Ales.""
McGovern took a swing at ancient chicha, too, with the brewery Dogfish Head in Delaware. ""We chewed the red Peruvian corn for eight hours. The insides of our mouths were pretty cut up and our jaws were aching and so on, but it worked,"" he says. The final product involved peppercorns and wild strawberries. Dogfish Head has been making chicha ever since , both serving it to customers at the brewery and shipping it out.
The trouble with re-creating ancient brews is that it's actually an impossible task, even for McGovern, who uses techniques like mass spectrometry and gas chromatography to figure out what an ancient vessel once contained.
""You don't have 100% certainty by any means,"" says McGovern. ""The basic ingredients I think we can be pretty sure of. What we don't know about is likely microorganisms, the bittering agents, or other additives that we might have missed.""
In a way, we will never truly be able to taste what King Midas was drinking, or the brews of Machu Picchu. Or even something much more recent, like George Washington's favorite porter.
""I can't re-create what was on the individual's clothes the day that they were producing that beer that could have fallen into it. I can't re-create the yeast that's in the air, the yeast that's in some guy's beard as he's, you know, working over a brewing vat or something like that. I'll never be able to do that,"" says Rupp. ""But I can get as close as I can. I will do my damnedest to get as close as I can.""
Rupp is now gearing up to tackle a controversial question among brewers: What did the original India pale ale really taste like? He is also planning trips to investigate the brewing traditions of Kazakhstan and Uruguay and exploring whether it might be possible to resurrect a beer that sank aboard a Swedish ship almost 400 years ago.
Someday, just for fun and if technology will allow it, Rupp would love to resurrect ancient yeast from Antarctic ice cores and brew something with it. To McGovern, on the other hand, ""the holy grail for ancient fermented beverages would be to discover and re-create a Paleolithic alcohol beverage. There's 2 million years there — at least — in which humans are probably drinking fermented beverages, and we don't have any containers.""
Rupp's path to beer archaeology started in 2010, when he finished graduate school in classical history and started lecturing part time at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
""Of course, that's not going to cut it paying the bills, so I was looking for other work,"" he says. Eventually, he wound up as a bartender at Avery Brewing Co., where he now oversees research and development and the wood barrel aging program while continuing to teach classes at the university on topics such as Pompeii and ancient sports.
Through his escapades into beer history, Rupp has concluded that we have beer history all wrong. First off, he says, ""There's a perception that ancient or historic beers were undrinkable and crap and thick and just bleh.""
But Rupp maintains that the ancients wouldn't settle for ""mundane gruel"" any more than we would.

Rupp says one historic account mentioned the president ""drank porter and three glasses of wine and became quite boisterous by the end of the dinner."" Courtesy of Travis Rupp Courtesy of Travis Rupp The latest ""Ale of Antiquity"" was inspired by George Washington's preference for porters. Rupp says one historic account mentioned the president ""drank porter and three glasses of wine and became quite boisterous by the end of the dinner.""
Courtesy of Travis Rupp ""We know the Egyptians didn't do that. They actually record putting fruits and things into their beer to sweeten it and to literally varietize the beer,"" he says. And the Romans were quick to trash Egyptian brews.
""They really stomp all over Egyptian beer. It was the cheap stuff that if you couldn't afford anything else, that's what you drank,"" says Rupp. ""This idea of literally valuing beer based on quality? They were doing that!""
McGovern agrees. ""We think that humans have been basically the same from the beginning, in that we have the same sensory organs, we have the same response to alcohol with our brains, and so we would know what we like,"" he says. Cultural and individual preferences aside, he says, there's likely a through line in what humans think makes a good drink.
Then, there's another assumption: If a culture's records and art don't frequently and obviously reference beer, they probably didn't make or drink it.
But, Rupp asks, ""How many books have you read on milk? Do you know the history of the paper clip? No.""
In some seemingly beerless societies, he says, it's possible the drink was so common that it didn't seem worth writing about. Or at least, didn't seem worth writing about to the highfalutin sliver of the population that could actually write.
The ancient Greeks, for example, aren't widely considered to have been beer drinkers because it doesn't come up in their written records — not the way wine and olives do.
Scholars studying ancient Greece concluded, Rupp says, ""that they didn't necessarily know what it was because they talk about it in a very strange way or that it was relegated to 'the barbarians.' ""
But after a two-year scavenger hunt through records and across archaeological sites, Rupp has come to believe that the Greeks were, indeed, brewers — at least during the Bronze Age. For example, decades-old excavation reports written by archaeologists working at the prehistoric settlement of Akrotiri mention vases containing ""imperfectly ground flour,"" including bits of seed husks.
The Salt 5,000-Year-Old Chinese Beer Recipe Revealed ""Yet they were finding it right next to vases that had perfectly ground flour,"" says Rupp. ""Well, I know what that is because I work with it every day, and that's spent grain.""
Combined with recent finds , it stands to reason, then, that the ancient Greeks might have been guzzling beer just like the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Scandinavians, Romans and Babylonians.
""I'm very open to the idea that the Greeks were making beer,"" says McGovern. ""I think they were mixing it ... with other things, too.""
McGovern's chemical analysis of remains from a tomb in central Turkey dating to about 700 B.C. showed that King Midas of Greek mythology was drinking a mixture of grape wine, barley beer and honey mead — something like a drink called Midas Touch that McGovern concocted with Dogfish Head Brewery. In The Iliad, he says, a mixed beverage called kykeon is given to soldiers injured in the battle of Troy. (As if the wine-beer-mead trio weren't enough, McGovern says there's good evidence the Greeks were topping off the mixed beverage with a sprinkling of grated cheese.)
And how about us? A thousand years from now, if beer archaeologists look back on our time, what beer might they assume Americans loved the most?
""The craft beer industry is such a small blip on the historical radar right now,"" says Rupp. ""They're going to look at those most regularly and largely produced and it's going to be lagers, would be my guess."""

It's a curious process, looking back at marketing trends of yore. Take the ubiquity of the stepback covers in the romance section during the 1980s: It seemed that every handsome Scottish warrior squeezing a buxom lass came with one of those peek-a-boo cutouts.
A decade earlier, my mother's novels frequently bore the tagline ""a novel of suspense!"" I'm sure books nowadays still say the same thing sometimes, but back then the phrase seemed to be stamped on covers everywhere.
There's a reason why I'm bringing the 1970s and the novel of suspense into this discussion — and it's because both feature prominently in The Summer of Ellen by Agnete Friis, translated by Sinead Quirke Kongerskov.
The Summer of Ellen is definitely ""a novel of suspense!"" Calling it a thriller would invoke stakes that are too high, and noir doesn't seem to quite belong with the sunny, rural atmosphere. Novel of suspense, then, fits perfectly. Lyrical would also work quite well.
Friis' novel takes place via flashbacks, moving back and forth between the summer of 1978 and the present. She describes Denmark in the 1970s with the keen eye of a miniaturist, taking in every little detail until you feel you are breathing the fresh country air and touching the blades of grass. It's a beautiful, lovely landscape — and yet, there is an element of unease creeping through the pages as Jacob, a teenager working on a farm for the summer, meets the beautiful, older Ellen. She's a hippie 20-something from the nearby commune who fills Jacob's head with impulses which swing from frenzied carnality to sweet romance. Left at that, this could be a coming-of-age tale. But a girl from a nearby farm has gone missing, and in the present, a middle-aged Jacob heads back to the farm to find out whatever happened to Ellen, who also seems to have disappeared after that summer. 'The Wolf And The Watchman' Has Some Serious Bite
Jacob's present-day investigation into Ellen's location is a necessary component to the narration, but the segments set in the past are much more compelling and pop off the page like bright sparks. It's almost disappointing when we must return to Jacob's current woes. I assume that's the point of the tale, to drive through how real, how meaningful, 1978 is compared to the dreary existence of the now. Young Jacob is flawed, but also innocent, and his yearning is the yearning of a boy. Older Jacob is a much harder character to like.
This is a beautifully written book, descriptive, atmospheric and carefully woven.
This is a beautifully written book, descriptive, atmospheric and carefully woven. The conclusion seems a tad rushed, but it's hard to find any fault with it otherwise. Despite the wide vistas of fields and countryside, Friis manages to create a feeling of claustrophobia and an impending sense of doom. Two striking scenes, one during the culling of chickens, are especially vivid and worth the cover price alone.
Alfred Hitchcock once said that a thriller is a whodunit, an intellectual process, but suspense is an emotional one. Friis knows this — and slowly, slowly takes us by the hand and draws us into a seductive, and dangerous, summer.

She describes Denmark in the 1970s with the keen eye of a miniaturist, taking in every little detail until you feel you are breathing the fresh country air and touching the blades of grass. It's a beautiful, lovely landscape — and yet, there is an element of unease creeping through the pages as Jacob, a teenager working on a farm for the summer, meets the beautiful, older Ellen. She's a hippie 20-something from the nearby commune who fills Jacob's head with impulses which swing from frenzied carnality to sweet romance. Left at that, this could be a coming-of-age tale. But a girl from a nearby farm has gone missing, and in the present, a middle-aged Jacob heads back to the farm to find out whatever happened to Ellen, who also seems to have disappeared after that summer.
Book Reviews 'The Wolf And The Watchman' Has Some Serious Bite Jacob's present-day investigation into Ellen's location is a necessary component to the narration, but the segments set in the past are much more compelling and pop off the page like bright sparks. It's almost disappointing when we must return to Jacob's current woes. I assume that's the point of the tale, to drive through how real, how meaningful, 1978 is compared to the dreary existence of the now. Young Jacob is flawed, but also innocent, and his yearning is the yearning of a boy. Older Jacob is a much harder character to like.
This is a beautifully written book, descriptive, atmospheric and carefully woven.
This is a beautifully written book, descriptive, atmospheric and carefully woven. The conclusion seems a tad rushed, but it's hard to find any fault with it otherwise. Despite the wide vistas of fields and countryside, Friis manages to create a feeling of claustrophobia and an impending sense of doom. Two striking scenes, one during the culling of chickens, are especially vivid and worth the cover price alone.
Alfred Hitchcock once said that a thriller is a whodunit, an intellectual process, but suspense is an emotional one. Friis knows this — and slowly, slowly takes us by the hand and draws us into a seductive, and dangerous, summer.

Indian Parents Agonize Over Islamic Radicalization Of Their Children : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/725651159/god-please-help-her-indian-parents-agonize-over-radicalization-of-their-children,"Enlarge this image

Bindu Sampath listens over and over to a voicemail of the giggling granddaughter she's never met. She wonders if she ever will.
Sampath's daughter Nimisha, the child's mother, abruptly left their native India three years ago. She'd gone to dental school a few hundred miles north of their hometown in the southwestern state of Kerala. It was there that she met her future husband. She converted to Islam from Hinduism, and he from Christianity. Authorities say they both joined ISIS.
The 29-year-old dentist is believed to be in Afghanistan now. She and her husband are wanted by Indian authorities, who have charged them with conspiracy and ISIS membership. They're among dozens of people who've joined ISIS from northern Kerala in the past five years — more than anywhere else in India, according to a database of ISIS recruitment numbers in India compiled by the Observer Research Foundation, an Indian think tank. Its tally is based on data from India's National Investigation Agency, the country's main counter-terrorism agency.
Most terrorism in India — the 2008 Mumbai attacks , for example — has been related to the India-Pakistan or Kashmir conflicts , or to a longtime territorial struggle by domestic Marxist guerrillas. India hasn't been a target for global jihad in the way Europe or the United States have. But neither had Sri Lanka, until this year's Easter bombings killed more than 250 people there, and ISIS claimed responsibility .
Sri Lankan authorities probing those Easter attacks have expanded their investigation to southern India, where officials say the alleged mastermind of the bombings had traveled. It's also where one of his followers was arrested in late April, accused of planning another suicide attack. Experts believe Sri Lanka, south India and the Indian Ocean region may be a new front for global jihad.
""This may be a message by the Islamic State, saying, 'Look, we are still alive and kicking. If you are pushing us out from Syria, we are very much alive in Sri Lanka. We are very much alive in South Asia,'"" says S.D. Muni, a distinguished fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses , a think tank in New Delhi.
For a while after she left India, Nimisha Sampath — who changed her name to Fatima Isa when she converted to Islam and got married — sent her mother text and voice messages from Afghanistan. They avoided discussing serious stuff. Bindu Sampath says she didn't want to ask too many questions. She just wanted to hear her daughter's voice.
In Afghanistan, Isa had given birth to a daughter. She sent photos of the little girl, whose third birthday is coming up this summer, and audio messages of her giggling.
Sampath says Indian authorities have informed her that her daughter and her family are involved with ISIS, though their exact role is unclear.
""I don't want to hear about the possibilities. I will be depressed — or commit suicide,"" says Sampath, 52, in a tearful interview at her southern Kerala home, where she also runs a makeup studio. ""Only a mother can know how I am sacrificing. I say, 'God, please help her, please hold her.' ""
Sampath keeps a framed photo of her granddaughter by her bed.
ISIS has radicalized people all over the world. But in India, stories from parents like Bindu Sampath have been very rare. Even with more than 180 million Muslims — one of the world's largest Muslim populations — India has had very few cases of radicalization.
""When Mahatma Gandhi launched his independence movement [in the early 20th century,] Indian Muslims were part and parcel of that movement, and from that time, politically and culturally, Indian Muslims have been well-integrated into the Indian mainstream,"" says Ashraf Kadakkal, a professor of Islamic and West Asian Studies at the University of Kerala.
But Kadakkal says that's changing now.
India has had very few cases of radicalization. Most cases have come from the south, especially the state of Kerala. Lauren Frayer/NPR hide caption toggle caption Lauren Frayer/NPR India has had very few cases of radicalization. Most cases have come from the south, especially the state of Kerala. Lauren Frayer/NPR
One possible contributing factor: Prime Minster Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which won power five years ago, has sought a bigger role for India's majority-Hindu faith in politics and public life. Many Indian Muslims and other minorities feel disenfranchised . In trying to make Hinduism more central to Indian identity, Kadakkal says the BJP has labeled Muslims as the ""other.""
""So this 'otherization' process has actually widened the division between the Muslims and Hindus, which may create an atmosphere in favor of fringe groups or radical groups,"" Kadakkal says.
ISIS recruitment has not been concentrated in northern India, though, where most of the country's Muslims live. It's happening in the south, which has stronger labor ties with the Persian Gulf. Millions of southern Indians work in the Middle East and send money home.
Kasaragod, the area of northern Kerala where Sampath's daughter is believed to have been radicalized, is prosperous, flush with remittances from the Gulf. From centuries-old spice routes to modern-day migrant workers, Kerala has historic and continuous ties to Gulf countries. Remittances, mostly from the Gulf, make up more than a third of the state's economy .
With Gulf money often comes Gulf values — especially for area Muslims, Kadakkal notes.
""They work in the Middle Eastern region and they come back with a new perspective,"" he says. ""They consider the environment [in India] not to be Islamic. Here, you see the faces of women. You've got cinema, dance, drama — everything!"" Enlarge this image

One of them was killed in a U.S. drone strike. He says his sons were ""brainwashed.""

That environment may be gradually changing in parts of Kerala. It's been a full generation since migrant workers began leaving to work in the Gulf and have since returned home with more conservative values. In Kasaragod, a district which 15 residents left three years ago to join ISIS in a single group, many women now wear full Muslim face veils, something that wasn't common previously. Over the decades, more mosques and Islamic schools have been built.
Experts say Gulf influence alone hasn't been enough to radicalize Indian Muslims, because they have been so well-integrated into Indian society. But with the recent rise of Hindu nationalism, Kadakkal says, radicalization is increasingly a fear.
Wealth earned in the Gulf is especially apparent in Kasaragod's huge marble villas, surrounded by swaying palm trees, next to white sand beaches.
On the porch of one such villa, a haggard-looking father in a white undershirt slumps in a plastic chair. He looks broken, describing how his two sons and a nephew were radicalized by a man who'd spent time in the Gulf and Sri Lanka. The man took them to Afghanistan, he says.

The young men were radicalized ""through the Internet and also through their friends,"" says Abdul Rahman Paramban, a Kerala businessman who worked in the Gulf earlier in this own career. ""Especially this one guy, Rashid. He left high-paying jobs in Dubai and Oman to accept a teaching job in our community. He's the one who brainwashed my boys.""
That man he's referring to, Abdul Rashid, has since been charged with terrorism offenses. The record of charges against him says he was previously kicked out of an ""Arabic college"" in Sri Lanka ""for advocating violent jihad.""
Paramban and local officials say that while working at a branch of the International Peace School in Kasaragod, Rashid befriended several local men in their 20s — including Paramban's sons and nephew — and helped radicalize them. Together they're believed to have traveled to Afghanistan in the summer of 2016.
At 68, Paramban wants to retire, but he has no other sons to take over the family hotel business. He's angry. His sons' first responsibility was to their family, he says.
These days, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Paramban prays daily at his local mosque. It's a Salafi one, preaching a strict Saudi strain of Islam. That's one thing that's changed, he says, since he was born here in Kasaragod district.
His village of Padanna used to have only a few mosques, he says, and it's home to a 400-year-old shrine where a Sufi saint from Afghanistan is interred. Now there are more than two dozen mosques for a village of about 3,700 families.
The conservative Islamic atmosphere of Paramban's village is similar to that of the Sri Lankan town, Kattankudy , where the Easter bombings' mastermind grew up. Both areas are flush with Gulf money, and Gulf ideas. That, experts say, may make them fertile ground for the Islamic State's new recruitment drive.
Paramban has refused to exchange messages with his sons since they left India, but sad news reached him last year. His eldest son still exchanges text messages with some neighbors back home. Through those neighbors, the son sent word that his brother, Paramban's younger son , along with the man's wife and child, had all been killed in a U.S. drone strike .
As for Bindu Sampath — the Kerala grandmother who loves to hear the giggling voice of the granddaughter she's never met — she worries about a similar fate for her loved ones in Afghanistan. Six months ago, her daughter's phone went silent. Her last message came in November. There's been no contact since. NPR producer Sushmita Pathak contributed to this report."
"Tired Of Being 'Dope Sick,' A Drug User Gets Help From Police To Get Sober : NPR",www.npr.org,Anna Boiko-Weyrauch,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/726125645/tired-of-being-dope-sick-a-drug-user-gets-help-from-police-to-get-sober,"Tired Of Being 'Dope Sick,' A Drug User Gets Help From Police To Get Sober Tired Of Being 'Dope Sick,' A Drug User Gets Help From Police To Get Sober Embed Embed Enlarge this image

Shannon was a meth and heroin user, but is in recovery with the help of a police program that connects people who use drugs with services. Dana McGlocklin for NPR
Two key ingredients came together for Shannon McCarty to get off drugs in late 2017: connections and timing.
""The police showed up because they said they got a call that we were shooting up in the car,"" Shannon said.
Everett police officer, Inci Yarkut walked up to window of the car where Shannon was living.
""I explained who I was and what my role in the police department was,"" Yarkut said, and she gave Shannon a business card. ""[I] said, 'Hey, if there's something that we can do for you — because I think there are things that we can do for you, that we can help you — give me a call.""
That connection would prove vital for Shannon to get off heroin and meth. And the timing was right for her as well.
You're not going to quit until you're ready and I was so ready and I decided that I didn't want to die anymore. I decided I wanted to live. Shannon McCarty, former drug user
Across the country police agencies are re-evaluating how they handle people with addiction. Everett, Wash., is one place where, instead of just arresting people, officers help those with addiction get the services they need. As Shannon's story shows, sometimes a personal touch can make all the difference.
Shannon was not doing well when Officer Yarkut approached that car, Yarkut remembers.
""[She was] very skinny, very pale,"" Yarkut said.
The difference today is astonishing.
""She looks healthy. She has a big old smile on her face. You can just see in her face what a changed person she is, and it's pretty awesome,"" Yarkut said.
Sitting next to her in the front of a police vehicle for this interview, Shannon agrees, tears in her eyes.
""It is awesome,"" she said. ""I've been through a lot...""
""I decided I wanted to live""
Shannon's troubles started when she was a kid, she said. The three words she uses to describe her childhood are sad, lonely, and scared.
Being an adult wasn't much easier: chronic pain, mental illness, divorce, drugs. Shannon says she started smoking meth to deal with the long hours of working two jobs, then she moved on to heroin and got hooked. After a few years she was homeless and miserable.
[J]ust continually putting people in jail, putting people in jail, putting people in jail and having them come out and repeat that cycle of their drug use, that's not doing anything for them. Inci Yarkut, Everett Police Officer
And finally, she was tired of being dope sick, Shannon said. She was just tired. She didn't want to do it anymore.
""You're not going to quit until you're ready and I was so ready and I decided that I didn't want to die anymore,"" she said. ""I decided I wanted to live.""
That was when she met Officer Yarkut.
The officer belongs to a special team at the Everett Police Department, created in 2016, called the Community Outreach and Enforcement Team. Officers now partner with social workers to reach out to people with addiction living on the street and connect them to services they need. As Meth Use Surges, First Responders Struggle To Help Those In Crisis
""The idea behind our team was to really focus on that outreach piece because just continually putting people in jail, putting people in jail, putting people in jail and having them come out and repeat that cycle of their drug use, that's not doing anything for them,"" Yarkut said.
The outreach doesn't always work the first time. But Shannon kept Officer Yarkut's number and eventually, texted her.
Shannon and Yarkut read their messages out loud, and Shannon's voice cracks with emotion.
Shannon wrote: ""Hello Inci, I tried to send you a message a few weeks ago I'm not sure if you got it ... I was hoping to set up a time to meet with you for your help on the stuff we had talked about. I don't want to go to jail or have a record as I am just the lost, depressed, hurt woman who has made a few poor choices, basically trying to end my life because I can't take pain and hurt anymore ... I have lost a lot over the last three years including my will, it seems. I don't want to be this judged person anymore. I just need some help and I am not usually one to ask for help, but I want to be me again. I am sorry and thank you for listening, and I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for your time. Shannon.""

Officer Yarkut responded: ""Hi Shannon, I never got a message from you. I'm so happy to hear from you. I would love to meet and see if we can help you out ... You can call or text me or come by the police department and ask for me. Please hang on. We'll help you.""
They're taking it step by step
Step one for Shannon was to stop being dope sick and stop using heroin. Shannon got some Suboxone off a friend, which is not legal but is how a few people have told us they started to get off heroin. Suboxone, also known as buprenorphine, is a proven drug to treat opioid addiction.
Step two was to get addiction treatment the legal way. With Officer Yarkut's business card, Shannon set up meetings with the police officers and social workers, and she got an appointment at a Suboxone clinic.
Step three through... oh, I don't know, step 173?... Set up a new life.
Shannon needs a lot of appointments for drug treatment, counseling and housing. She needs some way to get around, so recently, Officer Yarkut drove her in her patrol car to the Everett bus station and helped Shannon get a bus card with a reduced fare.
Shannon stands on a red X on the floor and poses for her picture.
""This is gonna be a horrible picture,"" Shannon says. ""I have no makeup on.""
And then she's done.
Officer Yarkut thanks the woman behind the desk and they walk out of the station. Shannon looks down at her new bus card.
""It's a horrible picture!"" Shannon says and laughs.
""It's a bus card. I don't think anyone's picture would look good on that thing,"" Yarkut says.
Little things
So many little things can build on each other when someone is in recovery. Even really little things are important, like a few words from a loved one marking each day Shannon is off drugs.
""Since day nine, my sister sends me a message every single day and it says, 'Happy Day whatever I'm on.,'"" Shannon explained. ""And I told her, I said, 'You do not know or realize how much those three little words mean to me, every single day.'""
Those little pieces built on each other.
Ten months later, Shannon has her own place, a low-rent studio apartment in a building in downtown Everett for people who used to be homeless. It's a single room with a bed, a couch, and piles of her stuff, including soup cans, a coffee machine, and a fridge.
Shannon has a new dog, too: a chubby little pug-chihuahua-weiner dog mix.
Shannon has now been sober for almost a year and a half. She texted Officer Yarkut to let her know.
Every day, no matter what — rain, snow, or sunshine — Shannon takes her dog outside, combatting the loneliness she says she still grapples with.
Compared to when she was on drugs and living in a car, Shannon says she's come a long way.
Life is still a struggle, but she says she's trying really hard.

An Update From Paradise High School After Camp Fire : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107472/an-update-from-paradise-high-school-after-camp-fire,"NPR's Susan Davis checks in with Loren Lighthall, the Paradise High School principal, about how he and his students have been coping, months after the Camp Fire destroyed most of their town.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
The Paradise High School class of 2019 has had a tragic year. In November, faulty power lines sparked a massive blaze, known as the Camp Fire, that devastated Northern California and burned most of Paradise to the ground. Days after the fire, we spoke with their principal, Loren Lighthall, who was trying to wrap his mind around what the future would be like for him and his students.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LOREN LIGHTHALL: Where will they live? There is literally no place to live in Paradise. There's no homes. There's no temporary shelters. There's no hotels. There's nothing.
DAVIS: Now the senior class is getting ready to graduate, and Principal Lighthall joins us again. Welcome back to the program.
LIGHTHALL: Thank you.
DAVIS: Walk us through the past few months for you. What happened with your students, and how did - how did you make the rest of the school year work?
LIGHTHALL: Well, we did an online school. And we only had three weeks left in the semester, so it was a great way to finish. And then we started at a second location in Chico. We had to move the entire high school to a different location. And we were able to pull that off. But as it's went on and we're into the seventh month of this, it's been very, very difficult for kids because they're living far away. And they're not vested in where they're living. So they're not making friends there.
Most teenagers struggle with the teenage years. And when you add a trauma event like this, where you lose your entire community, your house, your church, your work and you lose all that support system, it's been very difficult mentally. And it's been very difficult for us to find enough counselors to be able to help students get to where they need to be.
DAVIS: Were you surprised at the level of outpouring of support from not only your community but people from all over the country?
LIGHTHALL: So many people have done so much. I mean, just individual people have given $25 to help them have a good grad night or not have to worry about buying a cap and gown, free prom, free winter formal, free senior trip, free yearbook. That's the silver lining I think, in all of this, that so many people do care. And you can really feel that.
DAVIS: We've been talking a lot about your students. But you and your family were also touched by this disaster. You lost your home. How's your family doing?
LIGHTHALL: They're doing pretty good. Yeah, I have seven children and five that still live at home. We did get an apartment. But it's an 1,100-square-foot upstairs apartment. And it's been cramped. We do feel lucky to get that, but it's certainly not what we need long-term.
DAVIS: I understand you've made, also, a decision about your professional life.
LIGHTHALL: Yeah, I did make the decision to leave for two reasons - one, the housing. There's no housing here. You know, 18,000 homes burned. And there's 18,000 families looking for housing. And also leaving the trauma, where you're reminded of it every time you go to church, every time you go to work, every time you go to home. So I'm looking forward to kind of leaving that aspect of it - but really not looking forward to leaving the kids in Paradise High School.
DAVIS: What is your message to your graduating seniors when they walk across the stage?
LIGHTHALL: That we've got to put this behind us. If we keep worrying about all that happened and all the things that have been unfair - the whole thing is unfair. We're going to have to move past it and look forward with hope so that we can move on with our lives.
DAVIS: Loren Lighthall is the principal of Paradise High School.
Thank you very much, and we wish you so much luck in your next chapter.
LIGHTHALL: Thank you.

More Democratic representatives are moving to support an impeachment inquiry. NPR's Susan Davis talks to Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., about why he is now calling for an impeachment inquiry.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
Is the tide turning towards impeachment for President Trump? Speaker Nancy Pelosi still says she's not ready to go there.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NANCY PELOSI: I do think that impeachment is a very divisive place to go in our country.
DAVIS: The cracks in party unity are beginning to show. Virginia Democrat Don Beyer broke with party leaders and is calling for impeachment proceedings to begin now. He joins us live from Virginia.
Congressman, welcome to the program.
DON BEYER: Thank you, Susan.
DAVIS: You are the first member of Congress from Virginia to call for impeachment. What made you change your mind?
BEYER: Yeah. It's - we were content to wait till the Mueller report came out and even content to let the process play. You know, our - the leaders of the four committees that are investigating this are all doing a lot of very constructive things. But in the last two weeks, number one, Mnuchin refused to turn over the president's tax returns, despite the fact that the law is incredibly simple and clear. And then Barr refused to testify before the House and was cited by the committee for contempt. And then Justin Amash, the first Republican, actually came out with a long, really detailed piece of why he did. I've always felt impeachment shouldn't be partisan. We need to have Republicans and Democrats. And so, in a way, Justin really opened the door for this to be bipartisan in the first.
DAVIS: What do you believe opening impeachment proceedings will provide Democrats that you can't get through the regular oversight, investigative subpoena authority channels?
BEYER: Susan - great question. And, really, what I've called for is that Jamie Raskin, who's our only - who's our constitutional scholar in the House.
DAVIS: He's a congressional Democrat from Maryland.
BEYER: Yeah, thank you. He's a - the impeachment inquiry - and the notion is that the inquiry will give us tools - investigative tools, subpoena tools - that we don't have in the regular committees. The committees are largely limited to things that affect our legislative function, whereas an impeachment inquiry actually says, did the president actually obstruct justice? You know, Mueller cited 10 instances where the president probably did - may have obstructed justice. And, of course, he decided not to indict because he felt the Justice Department told him he couldn't. But he left it to us to make that investigation and make that determination.
DAVIS: Don't you think that the speaker, however, has a point when she says, this country is so divided that an impeachment proceeding could be just incredibly corrosive to the country?
BEYER: I totally agree. It's one of the reasons I have waited so long because I really do not want to do anything that's more divisive than we already are. And one of the tragedies of the Trump presidency is, as I can recall, he's the first president in my lifetime, maybe the history, who's taken divisiveness as his driving political strategy. But the comeback to the notion that, why would we make the country ever more divided? - is if we don't impeach this president, when would we ever impeach a president? We should just take impeachment out of the books. And we do have - while we have a responsibility to heal the country and bring it together, which all of us take seriously, we also have a responsibility to defend the Constitution. And this president - well, just over the weekend, the notion of selling arms sales - huge arms sales to Saudi Arabia against the will of the Democrats and the Republicans in both Houses passed.
DAVIS: You represent a reliably Democratic congressional district. You don't have to worry too much about reelection in a general election. But what do you say to your colleagues in swing seats who helped win this Democratic majority who look at impeachment and just see a total political loser that could cost you your majority in the House?
BEYER: Well, I'm incredibly sympathetic to that. But I think rule number one is we shouldn't be making the decision on impeachment based on the political consequences. That's just too cynical and too profane. We should be making this on the basis of, what's the right thing to do? What's the legal thing to do? - the constitutional thing. And I also - I don't know that this is true. But I hope that those - my wonderful colleagues in swing seats, even seats that Trump won in 2016, will be bolstered by the fact that we are trying to do the right thing for the country. They shouldn't have to apologize for a president who's - documented - lied 10,000 times already to the American people.
DAVIS: In the few seconds we have left, do you think more House Democrats are going to take your side in this in the coming weeks?
BEYER: Yeah, and I also hope more House Republicans. I know many of them told me privately they wish they could be there, and maybe they'll be there soon.
DAVIS: Virginia Democratic Congressman Don Beyer, thank you for speaking with us.

Why Mount Everest's Death Toll Keeps Climbing : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107521/why-mount-everests-death-toll-keeps-climbing,"NPR's Susan Davis talks to Outside magazine editor Grayson Schaffer about the recent deaths of climbers on Mount Everest.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
This year is on track to be one of the deadliest ever on the world's tallest peak. Ten people have died in the last week or so on Mount Everest, scrambling to reach the summit during a break in the weather. There are reports of a massive traffic jam as climbers waited their chance to stand atop the mountain at just over 29,000 feet. Joining us now on the line is Grayson Schaffer, an editor at large at Outside magazine. Welcome to the program.
GRAYSON SCHAFFER: Thanks for having me.
DAVIS: For those who haven't seen the images, can you explain what the logjam at the top looks like?
SCHAFFER: Well, you essentially have something that looks like people are waiting in line for concert tickets to a sold-out show, only instead of trying to, you know, get in to see their favorite artist, they're trying to reach the top of the world and are running into, you know, essentially just traffic. The danger there is that, at that altitude, the body just can't survive. They're breathing bottled oxygen. And when that oxygen runs out because you're waiting in line, you are at much higher risk for developing high-altitude edemas and altitude sickness and dying of those illnesses while you're still trying to reach the summit.
DAVIS: You've been to Everest yourself. Could you describe a bit of what it's like for a climber to be in the upper reaches of the mountain - the area known as the death zone?
SCHAFFER: I've never actually been into the death zone myself, but once you get above about 25,000 feet, your body just can't metabolize the oxygen. Your muscles start to break down. You start to have fluid that builds up around your lungs and your brain. Your brain starts to swell. You start to lose cognition. Your decision making starts to become slow. And you start to make bad decisions - and all of this is happening in the face of, you know, each person trying to sort of reach their ultimate dream. I mean, the reason that people try to climb Mount Everest is because it grabs a hold of them and they feel like they just have to make the summit. And so you'll have some people, you know, in distress and not necessarily, you know, getting help from the people who are around them. So it's this kind of bizarre thing to be surrounded by hundreds of people and yet totally alone at the top of the world.
DAVIS: A Sherpa who has climbed the mountain many times told The New York Times that this spring's traffic jam was the worst he's ever seen. Are the Nepalese authorities simply giving out too many permits?
SCHAFFER: Well, one of the issues is that the Chinese side of the mountain - the Tibetan side - now limits their permits. So more and more people are climbing from the Nepalese side. And what we've seen in the past is that every year is the worst traffic jam just because there are more and more people who are climbing the mountain. More of those people are trying to summit during the same good summit windows because everybody has the same weather forecasting. And so you'll have, on any given year, several hundred people trying to pack themselves into the same summit window. And that has created this bizarre phenomenon of blue-sky Everest deaths, where people are trying to reach the top - they have good weather, but the thing that is causing all these fatalities is just the fact that everybody is trying to reach the summit in the same 12-hour weather window.
DAVIS: Tragedies on the mountain are nothing new. One of the most famous we remember is the 1996 tragedy, recounted in Jon Krakauer's book ""Into Thin Air,"" where eight people died in a single day on Everest due, at least in part, to a crowd trying to reach the summit. Has nothing changed in the years since?
SCHAFFER: Well, I mean, the only thing that's changed is that it's gotten exponentially worse since 1996. In that incident, there was actually a storm that came. And that's why you had eight people die in that tragedy. Now what we're seeing and what we will probably see every year forward is eight to 10 people dying just in a routine manner, just because of the sheer number of people trying to fit onto the route.
DAVIS: Grayson Schaffer of Outside magazine, thanks for speaking with us.
SCHAFFER: Thanks for having me.

What To Read This Summer : NPR,www.npr.org,Barrie Hardymon,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107493/what-to-read-this-summer,"Need summer book recommendations? From new novels, to classics, to nonfiction, here are our suggestions.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
Now for a little news I could use - book recommendations. My Memorial Day weekend starts right after the show. And like most people, I'm looking for summer reads, something to put in my bag next to my SPF 100. Normally I would solicit recommendations on social media. But today I don't have to because WEEKEND EDITION books editor Barrie Hardymon joins me in studio now. Hey, Barrie.
BARRIE HARDYMON, BYLINE: Hi. I also have sunscreen recommendations for later if you want them.
DAVIS: (Laughter) First I want to start off with what I would ask you, is that my favorite kind of summer read is just the frothy page-turner, the one book that everyone's reading that HBO or Netflix is going to turn into a movie or TV show sometime next year.
HARDYMON: You want your basic ""Gone Girl.""
DAVIS: Yes.
HARDYMON: You want your ""Big Little Lies.""
DAVIS: Exactly.
HARDYMON: I got you. So I'm going to recommend a book that is by Karin Slaughter. I don't know if you've read any of her other books. They can be quite bloody. But they're great crime mysteries that are - also have really great characterization but not at the expense of plot. And so the book I want to recommend is called ""Pieces Of Her."" It's totally propulsive. It's about a young woman named Andy Oliver.
She's at lunch with her mom, chatting it up when, all of a sudden, next to her a deranged young man comes up with a gun. And her mother does something very, very surprising for a lady who is described as knowing where all the tops to the Tupperware are, which is that she very calmly and coolly kills him.
DAVIS: (Laughter).
HARDYMON: So I'm not going to say any more than that. The rest of the book is this roller coaster ride of finding out who her mother is. And it's also this really great mother-daughter story. And, bonus, it will be turned into a mini-series by Netflix.
DAVIS: What is that called again? Just remind me.
HARDYMON: It's called ""Pieces Of Her,"" by Karin Slaughter. But if you're waiting for the next book like that that's coming out, the hottest off the press, I would recommend ""Bunny"" by Mona Awad, which is also very funny and very sharp and an extremely readable page-turner, which is coming out in June.
DAVIS: I also think about summer reading as escapism fiction. You know, you want to go to another world or back in time or fantasy novels. What about that?
HARDYMON: So for, you know, people who are, like, maybe missing ""Game Of Thrones""...
DAVIS: Yeah.
HARDYMON: ...Or if you're sad about the way it ended but also want to be outside at the same time, not in front of a TV, this is the perfect time to pick up ""Wolf Hall."" Now, I know...
DAVIS: A throwback.
HARDYMON: ...That sounds a little crazy. But - it's a throwback, but remember, the third one is coming out in 2020, in March of 2020. They just announced it.
DAVIS: And it might take you until next summer to finish ""Wolf Hall,"" to be ready.
HARDYMON: So this is - I want to correct the misapprehension that this is a hard book to read. This is a - like, a - certainly a long piece of psychologically realistic fiction. But you - from the minute you meet Thomas Cromwell, you really are going to be sucked in. And if - if you are a ""Game Of Thrones"" watcher who is interested in how power corrupts, how an intensely human, brilliant person can, you know, become the kind of person that maybe dragon fires a whole village or - I don't know - takes down the Catholic Church and murders a queen, then, you know, ""Wolf Hall"" is for you. Plus, you then will have the benefit of being right on time in March, when the third one comes out.
DAVIS: What about for your friend, the - the I-don't-do-fiction reader, the reader that wants to read...
HARDYMON: I don't know any of those people. (Laughter).
DAVIS: I don't know many, but I know they exist - the person that doesn't really want fiction. They want nonfiction. They want something smart to read. I'm thinking more along the lines of, like, Ron Chernow's ""Hamilton"" that everybody became obsessed with, that read like fiction but was actually the book that's going to impress people that you read this summer.
HARDYMON: That's right. There's literally a picture of Lin-Manuel Miranda on the beach reading that, but it's an old...
DAVIS: (Laughter).
HARDYMON: In any case, yes. So there's a wonderful book that I think actually kind of brings together a lot of our - of our genres. And it's called ""Murder By The Book."" It's by Claire Harman. And it's about a murder in Victorian London in which a minor aristocrat is murdered by his valet. Now, it actually does sound like fiction, right? It's nonfiction. But what's so wonderful about it is this guy's defense was that he had read a popular novel, and the book made me do it, which is kind of a wonderful thing if you think about what fiction can do.
However, it's also this wonderful book about class and how we think about the way that books influence us. Every detail is amazing. I just - I - Claire Harman describes the aristocrat as being ripe and aged. It also really answers this essential question of how powerful can books be.
DAVIS: Barrie Hardymon, our books editor. And if you want specific recommendations, you can always tweet her @bhardymon, or tell us what you're recommending to your friends, @NPRWeekend.
Barrie, thanks for this.
HARDYMON: You're welcome.

AFP/Getty Images Come 2020, Memorial Day weekend in Washington, D.C., will be a whole lot quieter.
Rolling Thunder , the veterans advocacy group that organizes a massive annual motorcycle ride through the nation's capital, announced this week that the gathering in 2019 will be its last big rally.
The sound of thousands of motorcycles rumbling through the city has been a staple of the holiday weekend for decades.
TFW you’re going to check out the Jefferson Memorial w/ your out-of-town friends & baby and you accidentally stumble upon a sneak preview of #RollingThunder . Hundreds of thousands of bikers rolling thru DC to remember our nation’s POWs & honor our fallen heroes.🇺🇸 #MemorialDay pic.twitter.com/YrqvS0qyQE
— Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) May 27, 2018 But Artie Muller, a Vietnam veteran and executive director of Rolling Thunder, told NPR that the event had become too costly and that federal agencies were making it overly difficult to organize.
""We're just sick and tired of getting the shaft from them,"" Muller said.
There were problems getting permission to use the giant parking lots at the Pentagon where bikers gathered for the ride, he noted, adding that some people this year hadn't been allowed into the lot and left out of frustration.
The group also took issue with what it described as restrictive Department of Defense security guidelines, a ban on merchandise sales and limits on sponsors, The Washington Post reports.
Rolling Thunder Vice President Pete Zaleski told Military Times that it costs over $200,000 to host the event. ""It really has exploded to beyond what we can support,"" he said.
The Two-Way Bikers From Across America Ride To Remember Soldiers 'Unaccounted For' In a June letter to local chapters of Rolling Thunder, Muller criticized the Defense Department and the U.S. Park Police: ""Despite planning meetings, agreements and exorbitant permit charges fees these DC agencies do everything they can to divert and complicate our event.""
Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough said, in a statement to NPR, ""The department supports the peaceful, lawful exercise of American citizens' First Amendment rights, and remains focused on ensuring the safety and security of the demonstrators and the Pentagon Reservation. The department is prepared to support the 2019 Rolling Thunder ride, as we have for the last 31 years.""
The Park Police didn't immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.
Joe Chenelly, executive director of the veterans' advocacy group AMVETS, expressed concern over the decision on Twitter.
Is there a chance the beloved demonstration could last past 2019? https://t.co/IcHcY3aCNv #RollingThunder pic.twitter.com/xWOSeRxndW
— AMVETS (@AMVETSHQ) December 14, 2018 The ride has grown in popularity since 2,500 motorcyclists first thundered across Washington, D.C.'s Memorial Bridge in 1988. It has become the world's largest single-day motorcycle event, according to Rolling Thunder. Organizers call it a demonstration intended to honor veterans and troops killed in action and put pressure on the U.S. government to find service members who are still missing.
Back At Base Having Changed America, The League Of POW/MIA Families Fades Rolling Thunder has looked into using alternative parking lots in the area, according to Muller, but none could handle the massive number of people and machines. And he said that over the years, it has become increasingly difficult to raise money as younger riders forgo purchasing the vests, patches and pins that help fund the group.
The final ride in D.C. is set to take place on May 26. Starting in 2020, Muller said, Rolling Thunder's 90-some local chapters will hold smaller events across the country. He's hopeful those rides will attract a new generation of veterans and supporters.
""There's a lot of riders out there that don't have the money, don't have the time off of work. ... They want to participate and they can't,"" Muller said. ""Maybe this is the change that's needed.""

What Narendra Modi's Victory Means For Minorities In India,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107528/what-narendra-modis-victory-means-for-minorities-in-india,"India's right-wing Hindu nationalist party declared victory in this year's election. NPR's Susan Davis speaks with journalist Rana Ayyub about what this means for the country's minority communities.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP party declared victory in this year's historic general election in India. BJP is a Hindu nationalist party that wants to establish India as a Hindu nation. This makes for a difficult reality for the country's millions of religious and ethnic minorities, the largest being Indian Muslims. Rana Ayyub is an independent journalist who has covered Prime Minister Modi since the early days of his political career. She is also a Muslim living in Mumbai, India. And she joins us now via Skype.
Welcome to the program.
RANA AYYUB: Thank you for having me, Susan.
DAVIS: There are many minority groups in India from Muslims to Christians to Jains to Dalits. What is life like right now for these people?
AYYUB: Well, as I wrote in a column a couple of months ago - that life for Indian minorities is a nightmare in India right now because Narendra Modi, in his last five-year term, has unleashed a kind of a lynch mob in India that wants to establish a Hindu state. You know, there are lynchings on the streets of Muslims for allegedly eating beef. The president of the ruling party has referred to Muslims as termites and infiltrators and migrants who need to be wiped out. So that's the kind of sentiment, despite the fact that in his acceptance speech yesterday, he has talked about an inclusive India. As somebody who has observed his political career, Mr. Modi does not walk the talk. And Indian minorities are well aware of his track record in hate crimes and hate speech. So there is apprehension and there is fear amongst Indian minorities at this point of time.
DAVIS: Muslims make up about 14% of the population in the country of India yet just 4% of the representation in Parliament. That is the lowest level in decades. Is this anti-Muslim sentiment you're talking about contributing also to the decline in representation in government?
AYYUB: Absolutely, because it's the first time in independent India when the ruling party does not have a single Muslim representative in Parliament despite the population of Muslims in India being 190 million. And that speaks volumes of the kind of discrimination, you know, the government has of - vis a vis Muslims. Various BJP leaders have made scathing remarks of the Muslim community that - a minister of child and welfare said that she does not need the Muslim vote to get elected. Muslims in India have been underrepresented in - whether it's in the civil services, whether it's in the armed forces, in the bureaucratic services because there is a sentiment in the government that they do not encourage Muslim aspirants and Muslim candidates, especially with the anti-Muslim sentiment in the country. So that Muslims are least represented in the Indian Parliament is not the least bit surprising, especially with the present regime.
DAVIS: This rise of populist and nationalist right-wing governments, we see it happening all over the world in places like Hungary...
AYYUB: Right.
DAVIS: ...And Brazil and Australia. What message...
AYYUB: Yeah.
DAVIS: ...Do you think it sends to the world that India, the world's largest democracy, is following this trend?
AYYUB: Well, I know there are populist regimes all over the world. But when the world's largest democracy tries to follow that model, it ruins its secular character that - we've all been saying that if Mr. Modi comes to power, it will be an attack on India's soul. India cannot afford to go the populist, strong-man way.
DAVIS: Rana Ayyub is an independent journalist based in Mumbai, India.
Thank you so much.
AYYUB: Thank you so much, Susan.

NPR's Alt.Latino music podcast shares suggestions for summer listening.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
Memorial Day signals the start of summer - slower days, vacations and a more laid-back attitude toward life. But for our friends at NPR Music's Alt.Latino podcast, summer heats up literally and figuratively. Host Felix Contreras is here to explain.
Hey, Felix.
FELIX CONTRERAS, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.
DAVIS: So how are you going to keep busy this summer?
CONTRERAS: OK. So looking ahead, you know, there are three major Latin music festivals that we cover every year - one in Chicago, one in New York and one in Philadelphia. That all happens, like, between June and July. Their bands from Latin America come in - and all over the U.S. There's tons of new music. And it's a great time for music discovery, so that always keeps me busy. And this year, from the middle of May to mid-June, there are a whole bunch of great new records from familiar names and some names that may be new.
DAVIS: OK. So I love a summer jam. So I'm ready. What's first on your list?
CONTRERAS: OK. New music from Santana.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LOS INVISIBLES"")
CONCHA BUIKA: (Singing in Spanish).
CONTRERAS: That's from an upcoming album called ""Africa Speaks."" And it's sort of an artistic reset. You know, he's got his usual band, but he worked with super producer Rick Rubin. And he featured a vocalist by the name of Concha Buika. She's from Spain, so the album is saturated with all kinds of different African sounds, like Afrobeat, West African drumming. But Buika adds a little bit of flamenco influence. And it's an interesting artistic choice for Carlos Santana. And I think it works brilliantly. It's his best record in a very long time.
(SOUNDBITE OF CARLOS SANTANA AND BUIKA SONG, ""LOS INVISIBLES"")
CONTRERAS: I've been listening to him since, you know, the first album came out in '69. And this is something that just sort of pops and vibrates just all kinds of life and dynamism for the first time in a long time. In that long time - he's being recognized this year. He's got the 50th anniversary of Woodstock. He's got the 50th anniversary of his first album and the 20th anniversary of ""Supernatural"" - just all sort of happened in the same year.
DAVIS: Do you think this is going to be a hit album?
CONTRERAS: I don't know if it's going be a hit album, but it'll certainly be a nice, high watermark for his musical career.
DAVIS: It doesn't seem fair to start with Santana.
CONTRERAS: (Laughter).
DAVIS: That's a tough act to follow.
CONTRERAS: (Laughter) Right? Right?
DAVIS: So how do you follow Santana? What do you have next?
CONTRERAS: OK. Check this out. This is a new album. We do that with something completely different and just as compelling. It's a new album by the Mexican vocalist Lila Downs.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""CLANDESTINO"")
LILA DOWNS: (Singing in Spanish).
DAVIS: This sounds very traditional to me.
CONTRERAS: She has been - that's her whole thing is that she's been doing a lot of traditional Mexican music and usually with just a sprinkling of contemporary sounds. But this time around, she worked with a Mexican producer by the name of Camilo Lara. And he's done a lot of, like, dance club stuff, a lot of reimagining the traditions of Mexican music. He's got a really nice golden touch. And if you listen on headphones, you hear a lot of little things happening with this album that's strictly Camilo Lara's influence. We're listening to Lila Downs cover a song by Manu Chao. It's called ""Clandestino."" It's sort of his signature song. And it's something that he created early 2000s, and it's just become an anthem. And Lila really brings it home with her voice, with this arrangement. It's something not to miss. Check it out.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""CLANDESTINO"")
DAVIS: This is having a beer at sunset in the summertime.
CONTRERAS: (Laughter) Yeah. Right? Yeah.
DAVIS: This is happy hour. I'm drinking a beer. It's beautiful out, and I'm listening to this music.
CONTRERAS: It's perfect for that. And while it sounds like they couldn't be any different, really what they have in common are these two veteran artists who are looking at new ways to express themselves. Imagine; 50 years - how are you going to keep it fresh? How are you going to keep it new? Lila Downs has been doing it for a couple of decades as well. It's always interesting and fascinating to me to listen and watch these musicians like, OK. What are we going to pull out of the hat next?
DAVIS: How do you keep it new and now?
CONTRERAS: There you go.
DAVIS: So those are some veteran singers. What about the up-and-comers? Who's new in the Latin music sound?
CONTRERAS: Check this track out. Listen to this.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""INVENCIBLE"")
DAVIS: It's kind of sultry.
CONTRERAS: Yes, very.
ILE: (Singing in Spanish).
DAVIS: Who is that?
CONTRERAS: OK. This is Puerto Rican vocalist iLe. OK, now, her background briefly. She is the little sister of Rene Joglar and Eduardo Cabra, the brothers who make up Calle 13, a super, super popular and successful Puerto Rican rap duo. Ile was called PG-13.
DAVIS: (Laughter).
CONTRERAS: OK, in their rap show, she's jumping up and down. She's singing, you know? And they're doing all this heavy-duty hip-hop. She has an amazing singing voice. And this year, she's released this record. It's very percussion-heavy. But it explores her voice more, as you heard - lot of influences, beautiful record.
DAVIS: OK. I think we have time for one more.
CONTRERAS: This is a newer artist. This is Flor De Toloache - the all-female mariachi group from New York that has been crushing it with their mash-up of mariachi tradition and things like R&B and other forms of Latin music.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""TE LO DIJE"")
FLOR DE TOLOACHE: (Singing in Spanish).
CONTRERAS: They have been super busy lately, lending their voices to a variety of collaborations. Along the way, lead vocalist Mireya Ramos recently discovered that she's cousins with R&B singer Miguel. They collaborated. And this track is on both Miguel's recent all-Spanish EP and Flor De Toloache's album. This record is a beautiful mash-up of their R&B roots, their Mexican music roots and mariachi underneath. It's just a fantastic track full of lovely, lush sounds. Check it out.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""TE LO DIJE"")
MIGUEL: (Singing in Spanish).
DAVIS: It does seem thematically that there's a lot of women in this mix.
CONTRERAS: I guess so. I hadn't noticed.
DAVIS: (Laughter).
CONTRERAS: But there you go. Yeah. There's a ton of great music out right now, man. And what it does - it just shows the variety, as we saw today - the variety of Latin music expressions; different styles, different genres, different countries, different backgrounds. It's a lot of fun. I have a good job right now.
DAVIS: Yeah.
CONTRERAS: It's a lot of fun.
DAVIS: Felix Contreras is the host of NPR Music's Alt.Latino podcast.
Thank you so much.

Massachusetts 'Drag Prom' Offers Accepting Space,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107549/massachusetts-drag-prom-offers-accepting-space,"It's prom season, an anxious time for young people. It can be especially hard for kids who identify as LGBTQ. Enter Drag Prom, a dance where kids don't worry about their clothes or who they bring.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
It's prom season, a time of excitement and anxiety for teenagers. That's especially true for LGBTQ kids, who may feel like they don't quite fit in. But for students in one Massachusetts town, there's an alternative event. Quincy Walters of member station WBUR takes us to Drag Prom.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""WORK"")
RIHANNA: (Singing) Work, work, work, work, work, work. You see me. I be work, work. work, work, work, work. You see me...
QUINCY WALTERS, BYLINE: Kids gather in awkward dance circles. Others are off to the side on their phones - a familiar scene. But Drag Prom isn't your run-of-the-mill school dance. It's not held at a school at all. The public library in Arlington, Mass., puts it on at the local senior center. Drag Prom is for high-schoolers and middle-schoolers. And it's where sixth-grader Josh Landau says he feels comfortable wearing golden heels, a blue dress and a white, faux fur coat.
JOSH LANDAU: I like makeup. And I like a lot of things surrounding drag, so I just thought, this is a perfect opportunity for me to dress up, show my side that I really like to show. So that's why I'm here.
WALTERS: And how would you describe your style?
LANDAU: How would I describe it? That's a tough question, see. I would describe it as this stylish, like, princess.
WALTERS: Kids don't have to dress in drag. But for those who do want to and don't feel comfortable leaving the house that way, there's a room available to change into different clothes.
KATY KANIA: There's makeup, shoes, accessories. There's masculine and feminine clothing.
LANDAU: That's chaperone Katy Kania, who works at the public library in Arlington.
KANIA: It's mostly for kids that, like, can't leave home dressing the way they would want to. If they feel, you know, unsafe either in their family or walking down the street, they can dress up here.
LANDAU: Drag Prom isn't just a space accepting kids for what they wear. It's also where kids can feel at ease about who they bring. Eighth-grader Emma Phillips hasn't had good experiences at school dances. At the last one, Phillips, who uses they/them pronouns, says there seemed to be a double standard for LGBTQ kids and straight kids. Phillips and friend Ruth Hyry-Weintraub remember when Phillips tried to hold their girlfriend's hand, and teachers intervened.
EMILY PHILLIPS: We got split apart. I, like, pecked her on the forehead. And we - their chaperones had said, all right. Break it up, girls.
RUTH HYRY-WEINTRAUB: And wasn't it, like - other people were doing way more inappropriate things?
PHILLIPS: Oh, yeah.
UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah.
HYRY-WEINTRAUB: And they looked the other way when, like, straight people doing were this, so...
PHILLIPS: People were making out in the corner.
WALTERS: At Drag Prom, Phillips brought a friend as a date and felt comfortable dancing with them.

WALTERS: While the atmosphere of Drag Prom is jovial, there's a small reminder that beyond the doors of this dance, there's a world that's often unkind to these kids. On a folding table against the wall, there's a veil called the veil of shame. On it, kids write all the bad things people have said to them - queer-do (ph), freak, burn in hell. But 12-year-old Landau says the beauty of Drag Prom is he and other kids don't have the task of teaching people to accept them.
LANDAU: It's not about people being OK with us being LGBTQ. It's a chance for us to be wild, just have fun. It's not all about, you know, you must understand us. It's that we just want to have fun too.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SAME LOVE"")
MARY LAMBERT: (Singing) I can't change even if I tried.
WALTERS: In addition to the veil of shame, there's the veil of joy where the Drag Prom attendees write nice things they know to be true about themselves, things like good at math or funny or kind or beautifully perfect.

Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Understanding and interpreting a text message isn't always easy. That's where some artificial intelligence companies want to help, by analyzing conversations and providing feedback.
Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Texting is the go-to way to communicate these days. It keeps us connected, but it also has some gray areas. What does that upside down smiley face mean? Why don't people use periods at the ends of their sentences anymore?
A number of tech companies are using artificial intelligence to help improve texting relationships. Mei, is one of those companies. It aims to ""deliver real-time personalized analysis and advice based on your text conversations.""
Shots - Health News As Artificial Intelligence Moves Into Medicine, The Human Touch Could Be A Casualty Journalist Rainesford Stauffer has written about this issue for The New York Times. In an interview with NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday, she says these apps are meant to analyze our messages and provide feedback on our interactions with others. She says the feedback is often what people are searching for as they try to figure out the confusion that sometimes springs up when they're texting.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Interview Highlights How these apps are designed to help with texting
I think the idea behind an app like Mei, is based on text messages and call logs that come in through your phone, it is capable of detecting and understanding everything from personality and mood to how we interact and when we interact with our contacts. As it builds this personality profile, it gives you feedback on your text.
The examples of that were really interesting. It was everything from ""your mom loves you very much"" to ""you seem like more of an introvert than an extrovert"" or detecting abnormal behavior if you're not texting like your usual self.
What companies are doing to address privacy concerns
That was one of things that I really got to speak with the founder about and he did reassure me that though they collect communication with every contact to build an accurate profile of the user, the only personally identifiable information they have is your phone number. They don't have your name. They couldn't pick you out of a crowd, but the person on the other end, who you're corresponding with, is not aware that a personality profile is being built on them or that their information is being analyzed in this way.
Technology Should This Exist? The Ethics Of New Technology I think the argument to that is you could turnaround and show a friend that you're sitting next to someone's text and say ""Hey, what do you think this means? Do you think this is a little odd?"" But the idea of information being harvested with the intention of analyzing mood and personality adds a little bit to that gray area of who has access to what and what we're reading into.
On whether people truly need help texting
I think that now more than ever our communications are loaded in the sense that it's possible to read into a lot. I think that we have a desire for answers about what the person on the other end of the line is thinking and I think apps like Mei work to fill that void. I think the most interesting element of this is the emphasis on trying to make communication and technology more human through increased technology. I think we're really yearning for human to human understanding and trying to figure out how to relate to each other through all of these different forms of communication.

Baby Anacondas Surprise Aquarium,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107535/baby-anacondas-surprise-aquarium,"The birth of two anacondas at the New England Aquarium took everyone by surprise because the exhibit has no male snakes.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
The birth of some animals at an aquarium wouldn't normally be news. But the arrival of two baby anacondas took the staff of the New England Aquarium in Boston by surprise. Craig LeMoult of member station WGBH explains why.
CRAIG LEMOULT, BYLINE: Biologist Tori Babson takes care of all kinds of animals at the New England Aquarium and says things got especially interesting there late one afternoon in January.
TORI BABSON: I was cleaning up my tanks, getting everybody fed before the end of the day.
LEMOULT: And then she heard something weird.
BABSON: One of the event staff walked by the tank and noticed that there were a bunch of little babies in the exhibit.
LEMOULT: She went to check it out. And sure enough, there they were. Unlike most snake species, anacondas don't lay eggs. They have live births.
BABSON: So it looks pretty much like you would imagine, a tiny baby snake coming out of a bigger one.
LEMOULT: There were actually 18 babies, each about 2 feet long, emerging from a 30-pound, 10-foot-long anaconda named Anna.
BABSON: We were all quite surprised, definitely had no idea that we had a pregnant snake - equally surprised because there were no males in the exhibit. All four of the adults that are in there are all confirmed females.
LEMOULT: The mother anaconda had never encountered a male snake. She did this all on her own. Babson reaches into a terrarium and pulls one of the babies out.
BABSON: They have black spots all along their dorsal side. And their ventral side is more yellow and gray spots with a yellow line going down the middle.
LEMOULT: Reproduction without a male is not unheard of. Senior biologist Sarah Tempesta says it's called parthenogenesis.
SARAH TEMPESTA: Parthenogenesis is more common in plants and in invertebrates. So things like wasps, ants, aphids, you'll see parthenogenesis more frequently than you will in vertebrate species.
LEMOULT: But it does sometimes happen in things like lizards and snakes, especially if they're in captivity and kept apart from males. She says this is the second known case in green anacondas.
TEMPESTA: Some species simply clone themselves. So they duplicate their DNA, duplicate their cells. And all their offspring will be completely identical to themselves.
LEMOULT: Or sometimes unfertilized eggs can be fused with other cells from the mother that aren't normally used for reproduction. It took several months for the New England Aquarium to get DNA testing back on these snakes. And ultimately, they did confirm this was parthenogenesis. In fact, these babies do appear to be clones of their mom. If all that sounds familiar from somewhere, you might remember it was a plotline in the dinosaur movie ""Jurassic Park.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""JURASSIC PARK"")
BD WONG: (As Henry Wu) You're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed?
JEFF GOLDBLUM: (As Dr. Ian Malcolm) No, I'm - I'm simply saying that life finds a way.
TEMPESTA: Yeah, so this is the same sort of concept. Life will find a way. These females, you know, in the absence of a male, have found another way to create offspring.
LEMOULT: The New England Aquarium recently confirmed what they believe is the first observed case of parthenogenesis in a small species of shark. But unfortunately, that offspring didn't survive. And of the 18 baby anacondas, 15 were stillborn and another died within a week. But two survived.
Is there any chance I could hold it?
BABSON: Yeah.
LEMOULT: I could?
Tori Babson hands one over.
BABSON: So she may zoom around and try to - try to explore you a little bit.
LEMOULT: OK.
BABSON: She also - if you can get one finger for her to anchor on - there you go.
LEMOULT: Oh, there you go.
It winds its way around my hands, sniffing at my wrists the way snakes do, by flicking out its little tongue. It's a bit awe-inspiring, actually, this odd and rare genetic marvel. And at this size, it's actually pretty cute. For NPR News, I'm Craig LeMoult in Boston.

Trump Takes In A Sumo Wrestling Competition,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107514/trump-takes-in-a-sumo-wrestling-competition,"Trump Takes In A Sumo Wrestling Competition Trump Takes In A Sumo Wrestling Competition Embed Embed
On his second day in Tokyo, President Trump attended a sumo wrestling event.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
President Trump is on an official state visit to Japan. He's there to meet the country's new emperor and talk trade with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But today he also got a front-row view of Japan's national sport - sumo wrestling. The stop at the tournament was a part of the Japanese government's effort to impress Trump, as NPR's Ayesha Rascoe reports.
AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Wherever President Trump goes, he's usually the center of attention. But at the arena, all eyes were on the wrestlers.
(CHEERING)
RASCOE: From the beginning, this trip to Japan was planned to be full of ceremony, pomp and pageantry. Trump will get more of that on Monday when he meets with Japan's Emperor Naruhito, who ascended to the throne earlier this month. At the sumo tournament, Trump was treated to something a little different - body-pounding combat.
(CHEERING)
RASCOE: The matches only lasted seconds. Two men of massive size and stature would enter the ring, but only one would emerge victorious. It was a fitting spectacle for Trump, who often talks about U.S. foreign policy in terms of winners and losers. He makes a case that if the U.S. is not dominating, it's losing. In the sumo competition, one wrestler did come out on top.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Asanoyama...
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: ...In honor of your outstanding achievement as sumo grand champion, I hereby award you the United States President's Cup.
RASCOE: Trump presented a U.S.-made trophy to the champion. Clocking in at more than 4 feet and around 70 pounds, the trophy was about the size of a child. Trump had to be helped when he lifted it to give it to the winner. Afterward, he said he hoped the cup would have a lasting legacy.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: We brought that beautiful trophy, which they'll have, hopefully, for many hundreds of years. And that will be their trophy for the championship - sumo championships.
RASCOE: If that happens, it would place the U.S. trophy where Trump likes to be; on the winner's side.

Neil Webb/Getty Images/Ikon Images Maybe you know colleagues who keep a sweater or a blanket at their desks to stay warm as the air conditioning tries to ice them out. Alternatively, maybe you have a co-worker who always comments on how warm the space is.
Either way, it's evident that the battle for the thermostat is being waged in offices and homes across the United States.
It's the debate that Tom Chang and his wife have been having for more than a decade.
Women, There's A Reason Why You're Shivering In The Office Chang is an associate professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California . He says that their ""vigorous discussion"" is, in part, what prompted him to study the effect of temperature on people's cognitive performance.
He, along with Agne Kajackaite of the WZB Berlin Social Science Center , took 543 German college students, put them in a room and made them take tests at different temperatures — ranging from as low as 61 degrees to as high as 91 degrees.
The study showed a difference in performance between men and women depending on the temperature.
""As the temp went up, women did better on math and verbal tasks, and men did worse,"" Chang says. ""And the increase for women in math and verbal tasks was much larger and more pronounced than the decrease in performance of men.""
In other words, the warmer the room, the better the women did on the tests overall.
But the point of the study isn't to say whether there is an ideal office temperature, Chang says.
Shots - Health News Heat Making You Lethargic? Research Shows It Can Slow Your Brain, Too ""I think, if anything, what I want people to take away from this study is that we're all a little different here and that one size doesn't fit all,"" he says. ""More broadly, I think we should be more aware that environmental factors, like temperature, have a much bigger impact on your day-to-day lives than we generally give them credit for.""
Chang says if you see half your workers keeping blankets at their desks, or sweating through their shirts, maybe consider changing the temperature.
""Our research says that even if as a business you only care about profit and productivity, you should take the comfort of your workers into account, as it will affect the bottom line,"" Chang says.

Mena Massoud On Being 'Aladdin' : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107500/mena-massoud-on-being-aladdin,"The latest of Disney's live-action remakes is Aladdin . NPR's Susan Davis talks to actor Mena Massoud who plays the title character.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
The latest of Disney's live-action remakes of their classic movies is ""Aladdin."" The empire of Agrabah and the tale of Princess Jasmine and the common thief, Aladdin, has come to life. And, yes, it really is a whole new world, with a little help from the genie, played by Will Smith, Abu the monkey, a magic carpet and director Guy Ritchie. Naomi Scott plays Princess Jasmine, and Mena Massoud plays Aladdin. Mena Massoud joins me now from NPR's studios in Culver City.
Hey, there.
MENA MASSOUD: Thank you very much. Thank you.
DAVIS: So you were born, I believe, one year before the original animated version of the movie came out. Did you grow up as a kid watching ""Aladdin""?
MASSOUD: I did. Yeah, I did. I think the first time I watched it was probably back in Egypt, when I was a little baby. I have two older sisters, and they really looked up to Princess Jasmine. So it was on at the house before I could even walk and talk.
DAVIS: So I want to talk a little bit about that because you grew up in Egypt.
MASSOUD: I was born there. We immigrated when I was 3 1/2 years old, to Toronto. But I'm still very, very close to my culture and - back home in Egypt.
DAVIS: Why did your family move to Canada?
MASSOUD: We're - we're Coptic Christian. And my parents just felt like things were getting a little too dangerous when I was growing up. And they wanted to create a better life for their family. So they decided to immigrate.
DAVIS: It seems like when you take on a role like this, there is so much nostalgia for the role of Aladdin for people that grew up watching this movie. And I wonder, when you get a role like this, how do you approach taking on such an iconic character, even if the original was a cartoon?
MASSOUD: When I got my first callback, actually, I decided I wasn't going to watch the animation anymore. I knew that it was already ingrained in me. So I didn't want to get in my head about it. I didn't want it to influence my mannerisms or my character choices. I wanted to bring a fresh take to it. I just focused on who this guy is. You know, he's a - he's a young man who lost his parents very young. And he's had to fight to survive on the streets. So I just wanted to focus on those themes and his character arc.
DAVIS: There has been this conversation ongoing in Hollywood about representation and diversity. And ""Aladdin"" seems to be very much in that conversation. You know, the original version of the movie wasn't without controversy at the time or even now. You know, it played on some stereotypes about Arab culture. Do you think that the updated version has made efforts - and how - to sort of correct the things that the original may have done wrong?
MASSOUD: Well, I mean, first and foremost I can't remember the last time more than one culture and more than one ethnicity was represented on screen. And this film does a beautiful job of that. I mean, I'm Egyptian Canadian. Naomi's English Indian. Nasim and Navid are Iranian American. So we've just really covered our grounds and tried to represent as many cultures as possible. And that's something that really does not happen as often as it should in Hollywood.
DAVIS: Do you feel like, as an Arab, you felt specifically - you know, you want to protect this view of Arab culture, that it was reflected fairly on screen too?
MASSOUD: Yeah. We certainly wanted to represent the Middle East and the culture in a beautiful way. And as an Egyptian myself, I think we did that. You see a little bit of the beautiful dance that comes from not only India but the Middle East and the vibrancy of it. And we went to Jordan to try to get that authentic feel, which we certainly did.
We spent a lot of time in the Wadi Rum desert. It reminded me a lot of being back in Cairo. So, you know, I think this film takes a lot of steps forward. And hopefully Hollywood continues to build on that. I know I certainly will try to do that in my career.
DAVIS: I see in my notes here that Will Smith mistook you for a dancer.
MASSOUD: (Laughter) It's not so much that he mistook me as much as I just was so nervous, I didn't introduce myself. You know, the first time I met him, he was speaking to Guy Ritchie. And I had dance rehearsal. And I went over, and I thought Guy would, you know, help break the ice. And he didn't. And then I didn't say anything. So I walked away, and I had to come back and introduce myself properly.
DAVIS: (Laughter) Well, one of things - I want to talk about the movie itself. You're the title character in ""Aladdin."" But to me, this story also seemed very much a story about female empowerment. And...
MASSOUD: Yes.
DAVIS: ...No spoilers. We don't want to give anything away. But it does seem like the remake also has some updated versions or updated takes on relationships and on female ambition. And Aladdin really struck me as an ally to Jasmine in her ambitions.
MASSOUD: Yeah, I mean, one of the beautiful things that you can do when you're reimagining a story like this is that you can modernize it a little bit. And one of the ways we wanted to do that was tell a more Jasmine-centric story. So we wanted to show what a modern relationship between a man and a woman looks like. And, you know, I hope people enjoy that aspect of it.
DAVIS: Aladdin, I joke, said - to me seems like a guy that would wear a this-is-what-a-feminist-looks-like T-shirt if he existed in 2020.
MASSOUD: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I try to support all the women in my life. So absolutely, Aladdin tries to do that as well, and rightfully - rightfully so.
DAVIS: Mena Massoud plays the title role in the new Disney live-action remake of ""Aladdin.""
Thank you so much.
MASSOUD: Thank you for having me.

SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
Memorial Day is a time to remember the fallen men and women who died serving our country. But for those that have lost a loved one in service, it's also a time to grieve. There is a program that can help, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, known as TAPS. Every Memorial Day weekend, mentors and mentees in TAPS come together here in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the people they've lost. That includes Erin Yaggy and August Cabrera. They both lost their husbands and join me now from Arlington, Va. Good morning.
AUGUST CABRERA: Good morning.
ERIN YAGGY: Good morning.
DAVIS: I'd like to start with hearing more about your husbands and what branches they served in. Erin, maybe you could go first.
YAGGY: Sure. My husband was Major David ""Worm"" Yaggy. My husband was a pilot and instructor, a flight instructor, with the military. And he died on a training flight with his student, AJ Prezioso on March 14, 2008.
DAVIS: And August?
CABRERA: I'm the surviving spouse of Lieutenant Colonel David Cabrera. He was on a voluntary deployment to Afghanistan and was hit by a suicide bomber on a convoy mission out to a forward operating base. This was October 29 of 2011.
DAVIS: Erin, it's my understanding that you are a mentor in the TAPS program. Why did you want to become a mentor to other survivors?
YAGGY: Well, I felt like so many of the people who understood me and could help me were people like me, who had experienced loss. And I wanted to be able to better help myself and others by learning what I should do to best speak to people and try to relate to them in ways that were helpful.
DAVIS: August, what have you gained through this mentorship with Erin?
CABRERA: Erin became my mentor in March of 2012. And just having her as a support system for me when I was upset or confused or sad or even happy about things, she became somebody that I could call. So she went from being my mentor - and now that's been seven years - and now she and I are just very good friends.
DAVIS: You're both mothers as well. I understand that children make up a quarter of the survivors that TAPS supports. How are your kids doing?
YAGGY: My daughter was 17 months old. Lizzie (ph) didn't understand who her dad was. She had very few memories. And it broke my heart. I originally think that I told myself that I was coming for my child. But as soon as I met these amazing people, they became our TAPS family. And it's - there's no place I'd rather be than here with our TAPS family on Memorial Day.
It is a happy place. It is a place where - Lizzie pointed out the window as we drove here and said, see those kids with the red shirts? Those are kids just like me. They get it. They know what it's like to lose a dad.
CABRERA: As for my kids, they were 5 and 7 when their dad died. He also had two older kids that were 13 and 14. So all four of his kids, actually, now come to TAPS. But this is the one place that they feel normal. This is the place they don't have to explain who they are or why they're sad or why they're laughing at really morbid jokes. It's just - this has normalized their experience for them.
DAVIS: Tomorrow you're going go to Arlington Cemetery. What does it mean to you to be there?
YAGGY: Well, my husband's buried there. August's husband's buried there. It's a beautiful place. And I am grateful and proud of what he did as he served and who he was as a human being.
CABRERA: Tomorrow I'll take all four of Dave's kids to Arlington. And I'll stand there with the four of them and then my step-kids' mom. And we'll just hold them while they have a moment with their dad. And we'll all cry, and we'll all have a moment. And then we'll start telling stories about their dad and how silly he was.
And most of us walk barefoot because he was always barefoot. And so we'll walk through Arlington barefoot and just be in the moment. The hardest part for me, though, is walking past all those other gravestones and just thinking about all the other broken families that are represented. Every single one of those white stones just breaks my heart.
DAVIS: Erin Yaggy and August Cabrera are paired together in the TAPS mentorship program. Thank you for sharing your stories.
YAGGY: Thank you.
CABRERA: Thank you so much for having us.
DAVIS: For military families dealing with the loss of a loved one, the TAPS helpline is 1-800-959-8277.

Sunday Politics: Trump Vs. Pelosi,www.npr.org,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727107462/sunday-politics-trump-vs-pelosi,"NPR's Susan Davis speaks with NBC White House Correspondent Geoff Bennett about the deteriorating relationship between President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
SUSAN DAVIS, HOST:
The relationship between President Donald Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi has never been warm. But this past week it deteriorated into this.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
NANCY PELOSI: We believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So get these phony investigations over with.
PELOSI: I pray for the president of the United States. I wish that his family or his administration or his staff would have an intervention for the good of the country.
TRUMP: Crazy Nancy - I tell you what. I've been watching her. And I have - I have been watching her for a long period of time. She's not the same person. She's lost it.
DAVIS: Geoff Bennett is my former colleague at NPR and now White House correspondent for NBC. And he joins me now in studio.
Good morning, Geoff.
GEOFF BENNETT, BYLINE: It's great to see you, Sue.
DAVIS: Man, that escalated quickly.
BENNETT: Yeah, it did. And what's so bizarre about this whole thing is that if you set aside the political theater and the ad hominem attacks, what I've heard from people close to President Trump for months is that he actually likes Nancy Pelosi. He respects her. He thinks that she's a worthy adversary. He respects the kind of power that she wields over her caucus. But yet, the president cannot seem to let these attacks go. And so the thing that he really homed in on was when she was at the White House, and she told reporters that the president had engaged in a cover-up. That was the thing that set the president off.
And so this White House is set on a footing, a campaign footing - not a legislative footing. They're focused squarely on 2020. And I think this scorched-earth offensive that we saw from the president this past week just shows that he thinks that his path to reelection is paved by way of confrontation and certainly not collaboration - certainly not cooperating with Nancy Pelosi or any other Democrat on Capitol Hill.
DAVIS: Well, to that end, last week's meeting, remember, was supposed to be about infrastructure.
BENNETT: Right.
DAVIS: This, like, last lingering bipartisan hope that has launched a thousand jokes and memes - we know that. But is it now fair to finally say this thing is not going to happen?
BENNETT: The infrastructure thing?
DAVIS: Yeah.
BENNETT: Yeah, I think the infrastructure thing is dead and gone. And even people close to the president and Republicans on the Hill that I've talked to have said that the president's approach to all of this - where he seems to see nothing but upside in suggesting that Democrats are all for investigating him and not about legislating, and he's not going to work with them while they're investigating him - it really poses a few risks. One, he's not going to be able to add any legislative wins to his record heading into 2020. And it also, in a roundabout way, forces him to own the gridlock.
And so Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats have made the point, some of them obliquely but some of them directly, that the president now is playing into their argument, that they have said since 2016 that he's all about himself. He's not about what's - doing what's right for the country. And so, by his own admission, by saying he's not going to work with Democrats, they say that that works for them politically.
DAVIS: It was also a week where there was a lot of talk about impeachment. And the president and his administration have been taking these actions that Democrats see, on Capitol Hill, as goading them towards impeachment by claiming executive privilege to block testimony, fighting subpoenas. What's the White House strategy here on fighting Democrats from getting any of this information?
BENNETT: This is - this is actually fairly remarkable because I've been told that the legal strategy is the same as the political strategy when it comes to dealing with impeachment and dealing with oversight demands from Democrats. And that is to punt to the courts and run out the clock. That's the thing that Donald Trump did in - back in his business life. He relied on the courts for protection a lot of times or - or if he just needed to, again, run out the clock on some issues that didn't work for him for whatever reason.
And here again you see the administration just pivoting to the courts. However, we just saw this past week on two major issues where the courts decided in favor of Democrats. And so Nancy Pelosi, again, in a roundabout way, is buying time for herself. And she has said she's not against impeachment. She's just not for impeachment right now.
DAVIS: Does the White House share the view that impeachment could actually be good politically for the president in the way that many people think it was for former President Bill Clinton?
BENNETT: Oh, certainly. And we've heard from White House officials, even before Democrats won the majority, that if they did win the majority, that that was the thing that they were going to do, that they were going to overplay their hands and that they were going to actually help Donald Trump prove his point that this is entirely a partisan pursuit, that whereas Democrats say that they, you know, need access to the full Mueller report; they need access to documents and financial records pertaining to the president to do their legislative and oversight work, that this is really just a political witch hunt.
DAVIS: You mentioned court battles. The president lost another battle in the courts this past week. A judge temporarily blocked the administration from using a billion dollars in military money to begin building the border wall with Mexico. What's the impact here if the president can't deliver to his base on the central promise of his presidency?
BENNETT: The impact might not be that severe. And here's why. I've talked to Trump supporters all over the country, and they're not so much invested in the details. They're not so much invested in the results. What they're invested in is the fight.
DAVIS: Yeah.
BENNETT: And so long as Donald Trump is seen fighting the establishment, fighting with the courts, fighting with enemies - real and perceived - I think his supporters will be OK with that. So even though there's this temporary injunction, as long as Donald Trump continues to, you know, make the point on Twitter and other places, I think his supporters will get behind him.
DAVIS: NBC's Geoff Bennett, thank you so much for coming in.
BENNETT: Thanks, appreciate it. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

A possible tornado struck the Oklahoma city of El Reno Saturday night and killed at least two people.
In a news conference early Sunday morning , El Reno mayor Matt White said the storm hit at about 10:30 p.m., and warning sirens sounded at 10:27 p.m.
The storm destroyed an American Budget Value Inn, damaged the nearby Skyview Estates mobile home park and also affected nearby businesses, including a car dealership.
""People have absolutely lost everything,"" White said in a second press conference Sunday morning. ""You're not going to believe some of the devastation when you see some of the pictures.""
According to White, 29 people had been transported to local hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to critical. He said several hundred people have been affected or displaced.
The mobile home park, according to White, had 88 homes. Rescue efforts, which are still ongoing, are mainly focused on about 15 of them. White said all of the guests at the American Budget Value Inn had been accounted for as of Sunday morning.
El Reno sits 30 miles west of Oklahoma City. According to the 2010 census, its population is about 17,000. What Makes People Heed A Weather Warning — Or Not?
The region has also experienced severe flooding this week. White got choked up as he spoke about local first responders.
""We've gone through situation after situation after situation, and they have gone nonstop,"" White said. ""During the flooding, they had 40-something boat rescues ... and then this tornado happens.""
This is not be the first destructive tornado to hit the city in recent years: In 2013, eight people in the El Reno area were killed by a tornado that swept across a broad area of Oklahoma .
The El Reno storm is the latest in a spate of deadly weather in the Midwest. Several tornadoes struck Missouri this past week , and both Missouri and Oklahoma have been experiencing severe flooding.
On Saturday, officials told some Tulsa residents they should consider leaving their homes. According to the Associated Press , the levees that help contain the Arkansas River are growing stressed."

President Trump attended a sumo wrestling competition with Japan’s Prime Abe on Sunday, as the Japanese rolled out the red carpet for Trump during his visit to Tokyo.
The wrestler who won the competition received a U.S.-made trophy named the President’s Cup, in honor of Trump’s trip.
“That was something to see these great athletes, because they really are athletes,” Trump said after the tournament. “It’s a very ancient sport and I’ve always wanted to see sumo wrestling, so it was really great.”
On Monday, Trump will be the first foreign world leader to officially meet with Japan’s new emperor, Naruhito, who ascended to the throne at the beginning of May.

Ramaphosa signed a carbon tax into law on Sunday. Jerome Delay/AP
A carbon tax in South Africa will go into effect on June 1. President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the measure into law on Sunday, making South Africa one of about 40 countries worldwide to adopt a carbon-pricing program.
Proponents of the carbon tax say the true cost of carbon emissions, a key contributor to climate change, is not reflected in the price of fossil fuels. Many economists have argued that taxing carbon would result in a shift toward cleaner sources of energy.
The tax will be introduced in phases: The first phase will run until December 2022 and will tax carbon at a rate of about $8.34 per ton of CO2 equivalent. But according to a statement from the National Treasury, tax breaks will significantly reduce the effective rate of the tax.
The treasury will assess the impact of the tax and the country's progress toward emissions goals before the second phase of the policy, which will start in 2023 and end in 2030.
The policy has been in the works for the better part of a decade, Reuters reported.
The state-owned utility Eskom has previously said carbon tax legislation would push up electricity prices, but the National Treasury said on Sunday that it did not expect the measure to raise the price of electricity. Financial struggles at Eskom have led to blackouts throughout the country this year .
Giants of energy-intensive industries, like the steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal and the gold producer Sibanye-Stillwater, have expressed opposition to the carbon tax, saying the policy would raise costs by too much.
But some climate advocates say South Africa's policies are not going far enough.
The Climate Action Tracker , which measures countries' progress toward meeting the goals of the comprehensive Paris Agreement, has said the country is not currently on track toward meeting its targets.
Globally, the Climate Action Tracker finds very few countries are currently set to meet their goals. The Paris Agreement, signed by nearly 200 countries, has a central aim: Keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But it also outlines a second, more ambitious one: Keep that increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Small island nations have said they would be decimated under a 2-degree increase.
The New York Times has called Britain's carbon tax ""perhaps the clearest example in the world of a carbon tax leading to a significant cut in emissions.""
The European Union has already implemented a broader system of cap-and-trade, another popular carbon pricing method. But Britain tacked on its own price floor for carbon, which the Times said ""essentially functions as a carbon tax of around $25 per ton.""
The policy has helped to drive greenhouse gas emissions in Britain to their lowest level since 1890.
Many carbon pricing schemes are not as aggressive as Britain's. And many countries that have instituted carbon taxes or cap-and-trade policies have not seen reductions as deep, in part because political opposition has prevented price increases large enough to significantly alter behavior.
Critics of the carbon tax law in Canada have said that even though the government offers Canadians rebates as part of the policy, the rebates fail to account for the fact that the tax increases the cost of food and other goods.
Last year, Greg Bertelsen of the Climate Leadership Council told NPR's John Ydstie he was seeing growing bipartisan support for a carbon tax in the U.S. But former Minnesota congressman Vin Weber said he thinks gathering Republican support for a carbon tax would be difficult, given President Trump's commitment to the coal industry.
""For a Republican today to embrace any tax is difficult,"" Weber said. ""And since President Trump was elected, particularly a tax that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult."" Facebook"

James Flores/Getty Images Legendary Green Bay Packers quarterback Bart Starr died Sunday in Birmingham, Ala. He was 85 years old.
Starr, who played for the Packers from 1956 to 1971, was the first quarterback in history to win five NFL championships. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.
In a statement on the team website , Green Bay Packers historian Cliff Christl wrote that Starr was ""maybe the most popular player in Packers history.""
Starr is known widely for one particular performance , in the NFL championship game many call the most storied ever Packers victory.
It was New Year's Eve, 1967, and the temperature was minus 15; thus, the game was called the ""Ice Bowl."" The Packers were playing the Dallas Cowboys. With 16 seconds left, the Packers were down by 3 points, and the ball was at the 1-yard line.

Mike Roemer/AP Sports As Dallas Comes To Town, Green Bay Remembers Historic 'Ice Bowl' Starr, who had not run a quarterback sneak all season, suggested to Packers coach Vince Lombardi that it was time for one. So Starr ran across the end zone for a game-winning touchdown — and as Christl wrote, he will forever be remembered ""for that frozen-in-time moment where he was lying face down under a pile of bodies in the south end zone of Lambeau Field, the hero of the Ice Bowl.""
""He always seemed to deliver in the clutch,"" Christl said.
Until Tom Brady won his sixth Super Bowl with the New England Patriots earlier this year, Starr held the record for the most championships won by a quarterback. Starr is one of only six Packers to have a jersey retired by the team.
Starr was not instantly legendary. In fact, the Green Bay Press-Gazette wrote that he struggled during his first few years on the team.
Former Packers assistant coach Bob Schnelker told the Press-Gazette that Starr ""didn't start out like he was going to be the greatest player.""
""But toward the end, he was as good as there was,"" Schnelker said. ""Look at all the championships.""
After he retired from football, Starr returned to the Packers as a coach. He was not particularly successful in the role and was eventually fired after nine years of coaching.
Later, Starr worked in real estate and, along with his wife, Cherry Starr, helped start a ranch that provides mental health services, equine therapy and other supports to teens.
According to the Packers' team statement, Starr had been in poor health since 2014, when he suffered a serious stroke.

An Israel-based pharmaceutical company has agreed to an $85 million settlement with the state of Oklahoma over its alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis.
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter had accused Teva Pharmaceuticals of creating a public nuisance through its production and marketing of opioids. In a statement announcing the settlement, Teva said the agreement ""does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company."" Teva also said it ""has not contributed to the abuse of opioids in Oklahoma in any way.""
The settlement makes Teva the second company to settle with Oklahoma over the opioid epidemic. In March, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, agreed to a $270 million settlement with the state. Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, had been due to appear in court on Tuesday alongside Johnson & Johnson.
""Today's announcement is a testament to the state's legal team's countless hours and resources preparing for this trial and their dedication and resolve to hold the defendants in this case accountable for the ongoing opioid overdose and addiction epidemic that continues to claim thousands of lives each year,"" Hunter said in a statement . BREAKING || We have agreed to an $85 million settlement agreement with Israeli-based Teva Pharmaceuticals for its role in fueling the state’s opioid epidemic. — Mike Hunter (@AGMikeHunter) May 26, 2019
Hunter says the money from the Teva settlement will go towards combating the opioid crisis. State attorneys expect it will take between $12.7 billion and $17.5 billion over a 20 to 30-year period to abate Oklahoma's opioid crisis, according to The Oklahoman .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , overdoses involving opioids were responsible for more than 47,000 deaths in 2017 alone. The CDC says 36% of those deaths involved prescription opioids.
In April, a poll released by NPR and Ipsos found that a third of Americans have been touched directly by the opioid epidemic. The survey found that 57% of Americans felt pharmaceutical companies should be held responsible for making the crisis worse.
""It's something, no matter your age, your gender, no matter where you live, your party affiliation, that people believe in large numbers,"" said Mallory Newall, the lead Ipsos researcher on the survey.
Paul Ten Haken, the Mayor of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, tweeted that the ""Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid cases, including South Dakota and 1,850 other mostly municipal and state governments that have sued the same drug makers.""

Johnson & Johnson will continue to face trial for its alleged role in the opioid crisis, and is scheduled to appear in court this Tuesday.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Alysia Montano is an Olympian and a U.S. champion. You might remember her as the pregnant runner. She competed in 2014 when she was eight months pregnant with her first child. Two weeks ago, Montano made headlines again when, in a video for The New York Times, she called out the sports industry in general and sponsors like Nike and ASICS in particular for cutting off pay and health benefits to female athletes when they take time off to give birth and recover. That encouraged other women athletes to speak out about their experiences with sponsors. We called Montano to ask her to tell us more, starting with the financial realities of competing in track and field.
ALYSIA MONTANO: We're not paid a huge salary by a league at all. Instead, our income comes almost exclusively from sponsorship deals with inked apparel companies, like Nike and ASICS, that keeps them bound for three to five years. And we don't get rich.
MARTIN: No, point taken. Well, when you decided to have a baby, like, what happened? I mean, did you tell your contact at Nike? Did your agent speak to them? Like, what happened?
MONTANO: Back in 2012, I just finished the Olympic year. And I finished fifth at the Olympics. I noted hey, you know, you guys, it's - I'm looking at my contract here, and there aren't any protections in place. And they would not provide me with what would happen to me. That led us to kind of seeking out other options. ASICS came into play and kind of stated the same thing. Hey, I plan on expanding my family. ASICS at the time had said, we appreciate full athletes. Come over here. And so I did. I finished a year with them in which I finished with a bronze medal at world championships.
And so in that off-year, I'd hoped that we would conceive and be able to have our daughter and return to the sport. And I did conceive. I did have my daughter. And my daughter was two months old. And I got a phone call that said, I want to talk about your contracts in regard to your performance this year - which means - you mean the year that I've been with child? And then I was - my payment was reduced.
MARTIN: And what about your health benefits? I mean, that was another thing that emerged in the reporting on this is that there are athletes whose health insurance was terminated. And I can't think a very thing - many things more frightening than either being pregnant or having a child or having a newborn with no health insurance - summarily terminated. So what about you? Did you at least have health insurance to cover the delivery or the postpartum period?
MONTANO: Yes. So the way that it works is a tier system. The luck that I did have with my daughter was I fell within the tier system because I made the Olympic team in 2012, and the protection was there for me. Now, if I didn't make the Olympic team in 2012 and I became pregnant, I would lose my health insurance. My point and my stance is this should not be because I am an Olympian. This needs to be something that is in place for women athletes regardless.
MARTIN: I mean, this whole question of women and their reproductive choices is very much in the news right now. And I just have to ask you very directly, do you feel that you are getting messages from your sport that if you want to be a top-tier athlete, you should not have children?
MONTANO: Yes, absolutely. Before I had my daughter, I had a few examples of women that I looked up to who had returned to sport. I was very excited about - one of them being Kara Goucher. She talked about the difficult part of her motherhood and in resuming training and how she went on all these unpaid appearances with Nike. And her son ends up being extremely ill. And she, you know, she ends up having to leave him while he was dangerously ill to go compete at a race to restart her pay.
And that, to me, is a very strong message, like, your family is not first. Running and the sport is first regardless of - and also, we want you to prove to us, are you as focused, are you as dedicated? And the message is being sent that, if you're a serious athlete, you do not want to be a mother, and motherhood is not for serious athletes.
MARTIN: Before we let you go, I do have to ask. There are those who will say it just isn't their job. In fact, this is an argument that came up during the discussions over reauthorizing the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. There were those who said during testimony well, you know, I'm a man, why should I pay for maternity benefits? It's not my problem. It has nothing to do with me. So for people who feel that way, that, you know what, it's a private decision, there isn't any broader social responsibility to support this. You know, what would you say?
MONTANO: Of course that's what somebody would say that. It's oozing with privilege, right? When we look at women's issues, women's rights, this is a scope in which a man should not have any say on. And I think that it's so asinine for people to - men in particular - to think, like, this is a personal issue. This is something that is true in the world. It's - it can only happen to women. Men will never have to face pregnancy ever. And the people who are going to talk about policies and these protections are going to be men.
MARTIN: Is it true that all the people who negotiate these contracts at Nike are men?
MONTANO: They're all men that are - within house at Nike have been and are all men. It's an old boys club. The culture at Nike is - that's - it remains to be an old boys club. And this is the time for it to be exposed. You know, the time is now.
MARTIN: That was Olympian and former USA champion Alysia Montano. Alysia Montano, thank you so much for talking to us.
MONTANO: Thank you so much for having me.
MARTIN: After we spoke with Montano, two news organizations reported that a Nike vice president, in a memo to staff, said the company was eliminating a performance requirement for 12 months for those athletes who decide to have a baby.
So we called Alysia Montano back to get her reaction. And she told us she wants to acknowledge movement on this issue, but she has not yet seen an actual contract. She says she wants to make sure Nike writes this protection into the contracts of new and current female athletes because, she says, track and field athletes tend to sign contracts before they are the age in which women typically start thinking about having families, and by the time they do, they are locked into contracts without protections for maternity leave.

"For NPR Student Podcast Challenge, Many Students Tackle Climate Change : NPR",www.npr.org,Anya Kamenetz,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190912/for-npr-student-podcast-challenge-many-students-tackle-climate-change,"This year, NPR challenged students across the country to make podcasts about anything. Hundreds of students took on one topic: climate change.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
From the sunrise movement in the U.S. to the school strike for climate in 100 countries, teenagers have become the faces of climate activism. We definitely heard from teens when NPR held its first-ever student podcast challenge this spring. Hundreds of the nearly 6,000 entries in the nationwide podcast contest dealt with climate change and related environmental issues. Anya Kamenetz of the NPR education team has more.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING))
LEAH GLASPEY: Maybe you guys have heard of the climate crisis sweeping the globe today. If not...
ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Leah Glaspey, a seventh grader at Irving A. Robbins Middle School in Farmington, Conn., has a podcast for you.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CARA SZCZEPANSKI: I'm Cara Szczepanski.
LEAH: And I'm Leah Glaspey. And...
KAMENETZ: Their teacher, Alysson Olsen, says the girls started their podcast journey by thinking of climate change as a debate. But as they got deeper into their research, their focus shifted to the gaps in their own education, and they got upset.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LEAH: Climate change shouldn't be censored from the ears of children.
KAMENETZ: As they tell their classmates...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LEAH: We were given an edited piece of the truth.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KAMENETZ: Szczepanski ended their podcast with a passionate plea for change.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CARA: I mean, this is scary, and we understand that. But people have to realize that climate change is real. And it may be scary, but we are the ones that need to fix it.
KAMENETZ: The title of their entry - ""A Missed Opportunity: The Inconvenient Truth About Climate Change In Public Schools."" Across the country at Highline High School in Burien, Wash., junior Kat Quach zoomed in on a different aspect of the climate change problem.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KAT QUATCH: In this podcast, we're going to be talking about being vegan.
KAMENETZ: Quach chalked up the climate benefits of a vegan diet, which can be an uphill battle given American fast food culture.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KAT: Taco Bell even serves a taco with fried chicken as a tortilla. We wrap our meat in other meats. Who decided that we ever needed that much meat?
KAMENETZ: Lily Duong is another junior at Highline whose podcast considered the relationship between food and the environment. She brought her microphone to her family's Vietnamese restaurant, where she says...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LILY DUONG: At the restaurant, we don't compost. And often, many things we buy, like rice noodles, come in plastic packaging or is imported from other countries.
KAMENETZ: She interviewed her mother in the restaurant's kitchen about the practical barriers to becoming more sustainable. And, as we often do at NPR, she interpreted for her mother from Vietnamese.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DUONG: Why don't we switch to biodegradable to-go containers?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking through interpreter) It's not required by law. And it's a little bit more expensive.
KAMENETZ: Speaking of sustainability, the seventh graders at Goshen Middle School in Goshen, Ind., produced several entries exploring the Green New Deal. These boys put the issue in terms of their dream cars.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I want the Tesla Model X because it will help the environment, and it looks pretty cool.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Well, I want a Tesla Roadster because it is an electric car, so that means it does not put out carbon emissions.
KAMENETZ: Students around the country told us they aren't just researching the topic of climate change. They're also taking action themselves.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ZOE: Hey. So my name is Zoe, and this is David.
KAMENETZ: These fifth graders in Maryland Elementary in Bexley, Ohio, started a project called SOS for Save Our Seas. It's aimed at cutting back on plastic and increasing recycling in their lunchroom.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ZOE: Sandro, what do you know about recycling?
SANDRO: Well, recycling helps the community and the whole earth by reusing plastic that we don't need and we can make into something helpful.
KAMENETZ: They announced their plan at a school assembly.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: And (unintelligible).
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Who remembers what's SOS stand for?
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Unintelligible).
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Save Our Seas. Great job. Let's give them a warm round of applause.
(APPLAUSE)
KAMENETZ: And a round of applause to everyone who entered our student podcast challenge.

Troll Watch: City Infrastructures Targeted With Stolen NSA Hacking Tools : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190905/troll-watch-city-infrastructures-targeted-with-stolen-nsa-hacking-tools,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Thomas Rid, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, about how hackers are using software developed by the NSA to attack government computers.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to spend some time now talking about cybersecurity. Recently stolen NSA tools have been used apparently in cyberattacks in Baltimore and North Carolina. Hackers used this software to interrupt digital infrastructure like government computers, and usually demand money to stop. That's today's topic in our regular segment called Troll Watch.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
MARTIN: This is where we've been keeping track of cybersecurity attacks, as well as the themes, memes and conspiracies being pushed by bots and trolls. Joining us now to talk more about this is Thomas Rid. He is a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he teaches about cybersecurity. Professor Rid, welcome. Thanks so much for talking to us.
THOMAS RID: Thank you. Hi.
MARTIN: Let's walk through the facts that are known. So as I understand it, the NSA develops certain hacking tools, and somehow or another, they lost control of them. They were leaked, stolen somehow. And they started showing up in the summer of 2016. Is that right?
RID: Yeah, that is correct. The NSA lost control over its crown jewels of hacking tools at some point, presumably in early 2016. And the leaks started in August 2016 in a drip-drip fashion. So over the next half year, a number of hacking tools appeared in public. And this caused huge havoc worldwide.
MARTIN: Do we have any sense of who is behind the attacks?
RID: It's important to understand that the hacking tools became public, so anybody could use them. The first actors to use them were intelligence agencies - first, the North Koreans, then Russian military intelligence in the summer of 2017. But now criminals and opportunistic hackers are using these tools as well.
MARTIN: One of the ways that this has become public is that Baltimore, Md., has been struggling with a cyberattack that has affected thousands of government computers and a number of important government operations. This is what was reported in The New York Times. The New York Times reported that the attack has interrupted real estate sales, water billing and things of that sort. How is something like this addressed? I mean, obviously these hackers are demanding money. So what happens? Do governments actually pay these people?
RID: We need to take one step back. The specific vulnerability to a computer system that was used in this attack has actually been fixed already in early 2017. But the problem is that a lot of firms, city governments, organizations don't actually patch their systems regularly because their IT budgets are too low. So that means that high-value targets have probably already fixed that hole in their security, but a lot of other targets haven't, which is why we now see criminals use these vulnerabilities against cities and other targets.
MARTIN: Should the NSA be held responsible for this? I'm just wondering. The fact that this crown jewel, as you put it, was leaked or stolen and became public, is that their fault?
RID: This is a great question. Actually, there's controversy. So initially, losing control of this hacking tool - and really, thousands of others - was clearly the NSA's fault. But at some point, I guess, their responsibility for criminals reusing what has become public is diminishing. But the problem here is that the U.S. government - first Obama, then the Trump administration, and of course, also Congress - have never addressed the underlying extraordinary leak that took place that is known as Shadow Brokers, which is arguably the worst security breach the NSA has ever suffered - even worse than the Snowden leak.
MARTIN: It just seems remarkable that something that has such significance and such a power to disrupt people's lives hasn't gotten more attention. Does it seem strange to you?
RID: Well, you know, the story is quite complicated. But I think we have to do better and really understand the Shadow Broker's leak, it's reuse. This is ultimately an attack, if we take the whole thing, that has caused tens of billions of damage to the world economy - billions.
MARTIN: As you would imagine with the upcoming presidential elections in this country, many people are concerned about cybersecurity. And the question becomes if routine government operations and those of private industry can be disrupted, then what does this say about our ability to guard our elections? What do you think it says?
RID: Again, we have to be very specific here. And it is possible to defend yourself if you're just a private citizen or if you have a small company. It's possible to patch your systems, to update the system to the most recent software, to use a number of security products that protect you, even against high-profile targets. But of course, we have to be on guard and get to the bottom of these most difficult and most complex cases. And this is certainly at the top of that list here.
MARTIN: That's Thomas Rid, professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he teaches about cybersecurity. Professor Rid, thank you so much for talking to us.
RID: Thank you.

Book: 'The Queen' Follows Original Welfare Fraudster Linda Taylor,www.npr.org,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190933/book-the-queen-follows-original-welfare-fraudster-linda-taylor,"Josh Levin, author of The Queen: The Forgotten Life Behind an American Myth , talks with NPR's Michel Martin about Linda Taylor's complicated history.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Linda Taylor or Linda Bennett (ph) or Linda Gordon (ph) or whoever she really was might have remained a busier than average con artist, maybe the subject of an expose or two in one of the Chicago papers. Instead, she became Exhibit A of a kind of cultural corrosion and governmental ineptitude that Ronald Reagan promised to fix. Here he is in a radio commentary from October, 1976.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RONALD REAGAN: The trail extends through 14 states. She has used 127 names so far, posed as a mother of 14 children at one time, seven at another, signed up twice with the same caseworker in four days and once, while on welfare, posed as an open heart surgeon complete with office.
MARTIN: In speeches, Reagan usually called her the woman from Chicago. The Chicago newspapers gave her a name that stuck - the welfare queen. But as it turns out, neither Reagan nor most of the reporters - not even most of the cops on her trail ever really got her story straight. It was actually far more complicated and perhaps even more terrible than any of them ever figured out. Josh Levin thinks he has, though, and he tells the fascinating and bizarre tale in a new book called ""The Queen."" And he is with us now in our studios in Washington, D.C.
Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
JOSH LEVIN: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: Let me just say up front, this story is so strange. It has so many twists and turns. It's a wonder anybody could follow it all. And, first of all, what is her real name?
LEVIN: She was born Martha Louise White.
MARTIN: Martha Louise White - but you call her Linda Taylor in the book, right?
LEVIN: Yes. When she became a public figure kind of briefly in the mid-1970s, that was what she was known as.
MARTIN: So she really did commit welfare fraud. Can we just establish that - the fact that she did use aliases, she did use any number of means in order to get benefits to which she was not entitled? That's accurate.
LEVIN: That is accurate. The thing that's inaccurate is to characterize her fraud as typical. When Reagan talked about her in his speeches when he ran for president for the first time in 1976, he was highlighting her because she was an extraordinary case because she had stolen a lot of money. But at the same time, he wanted to use her as an example of what was wrong with the system. And that was really what was inaccurate - the implication that people that are on welfare - that we should be suspicious of them.
MARTIN: To the best of your knowledge, how much did she steal?
LEVIN: Reagan would say $150,000 in a single year. Sometimes, it was reported that she'd stolen 300,000 or even a million. What I was able to find when I went to the Illinois State Archives is some correspondence back and forth between public officials where it seems like what they settled on was on the order of $40,000 over a period of several years - which is a lot of money, but it's not the scope that Reagan described.
MARTIN: But she had other crimes. I mean, like, she would say she was going to buy a house and never pay for it. And she was a grifter, right?
LEVIN: She was a grifter. And her grifts included, you know, posing as a heart surgeon. We heard that from Reagan at the - in the clip at the top. That was true. She did do that. She would also pose as a voodoo priestess, and she would scam people on a very close-up personal level. She would tell people that she, like, could communicate with their dead relatives or could see into the future and would - she would prey on people an incredible number of ways and seemed to have an instinct for how to really get inside and devastate individuals.
MARTIN: One of the points that you make in the book is that, you know, the welfare fraud was the least of it. Actually, what she may have done was worse. I mean, you think she actually may have kidnapped kids and wanted to use them to get benefits.
LEVIN: Not sure why she did the kidnappings. Her behavior often seemed irrational and inexplicable. But yeah, she was arrested on kidnapping charges in Chicago in 1967. She was not charged. And then in 1975, when she has been indicted for welfare fraud - and at that point, she is a known figure, she's known as the welfare queen - the Chicago Tribune reports that she's been accused of a homicide. And yet, even with an accusation that severe and that kind of horrifying, it just doesn't affix itself to her story.
MARTIN: How did she get involved in this life to begin with?
LEVIN: When I started to really dig into where she had come from and who she was before she became Linda Taylor and the welfare queen, I found a very 20th-century American story of this woman who had grown up in the Deep South. She was mixed race in a family that didn't accept her. She was denied an education. She was denied the love of the people who were supposed to care for and protect her. And as so many Americans did, she left the Deep South and moved out West.
But out there, she had trouble finding steady work. I found some arrests for prostitution-related offenses in the 1940s. And then out there, she married a white man. And she listed her race at that time as Hawaiian because if she had been marked as black on an official form, California had not yet struck down its miscegenation ban, so she wouldn't - it wouldn't have been legal for her to enter into this marriage.
And so I think these events all helped chart the course of her life and mark her life to some degree. And yet, they don't explain or excuse her criminal behavior. And, you know, as far as why she did the things that she did, she was not someone who was honest about her motivations and about what she'd done. And so as far as looking for answers, a lot of this stuff is unknowable.
MARTIN: Well, she did a lot of things. I mean, one of the ways that this scam unraveled is that she reported a burglary that could not possibly have happened. I mean, she's reported that, like, a big refrigerator was stolen from her apartment or something like that, right? And...
LEVIN: Yeah. Her story was that the refrigerator had been taken out of her window, which geometrically, it was not a plausible scenario.
MARTIN: So how did it all finally come to an end?
LEVIN: So in 1977, she goes on trial for welfare fraud, and she's convicted and given a pretty harsh sentence. She was only actually charged with stealing a little under $9,000. So for $9,000, she gets three to seven years in prison. She goes away to a state prison in Illinois. And after that, she's never written about again. She's almost, like, erased from history and the public record. And what I was able to find is that when she got out of prison, she predictably changed identities, moved to Florida and committed a bunch more crimes.
MARTIN: And then she died in 2002. You paint a portrait of a - I don't know how else to describe it - a deeply damaged person. But you also make the case in the book that her story is about more than her. What do you want people to draw from it?
LEVIN: I think what this book is about to a large degree is just the damage that can be done by telling a distorted story. In Illinois, after her successful prosecution, there was a special unit created exclusively to prosecute welfare fraud. A lot of people got caught up in that who were not Linda Taylor-like. These are people who were struggling. But after her case and all the publicity it got, welfare fraud is increasingly treated as a matter that needs to be dealt with harshly, severely in courts and then with prison time.
And then, on national policy level, Reagan does not win in 1976. But he continues to talk about Taylor when he runs successfully in 1980. And then, once he's in office, he tells her story not only publicly. He tells his newspaper editors. He also tells it to the Congressional Black Caucus. He tells it to people in Congress behind the scenes as he's selling his cuts to food stamps and aid to families with dependent children.
And what he's arguing is if we cut out the Linda Taylors, if we cut out the fraudsters, then there can be more for everyone else, and it's a win-win situation. And he passes - succeeds in passing these very large cuts. The effect of them is a lot more devastating on vulnerable people than I think he was selling when he was selling these cuts.
MARTIN: Josh Levin is the editorial director of Slate, and his new book is called ""The Queen."" Josh Levin, thanks so much for talking to us.
LEVIN: Thank you.

Sneaker Designer D'Wayne Edwards Gives Others A Foot In The Door,www.npr.org,Mandalit del Barco,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190919/sneaker-designer-dwayne-edwards-gives-others-a-foot-in-the-door,"D'Wayne Edwards is a legend in the world of sneakers. He was one of the first black sneaker designers and he created his own academy to give others a foot into the business.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Now we'd like to tell you about a legend in the world of sneakers. D'Wayne Edwards was one of the first black designers. He also created his own academy to give others a foot into the business. NPR's Mandalit del Barco spent time with Edwards when he visited one of his proteges in LA.
MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: At a storefront space in Venice Beach, cobblers listen to jazz as they handcraft limited edition and custom-made sneakers for the company No.One. Twenty-two-year-old Ari Montanez has designed some of the label's latest kicks, including a black and white leather sneaker.
ARI MONTANEZ: The Delta right over there is the one I first worked on when I first got here.
DEL BARCO: Montanez says he'd been a shy kid, who sometimes got into trouble in Orange, N.J.
D'WAYNE EDWARDS: Actually, Ari's dad reached out to me and was like, hey, my son wants to do some footwear.
DEL BARCO: That's D'Wayne Edwards. He's been mentoring young footwear designers through his program Pensole Design Academy, which is free for students. It partners with sneaker companies and schools like the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena.
EDWARDS: I didn't have the money to go to college.
DEL BARCO: Edwards was the youngest of six children. And times were tough in Inglewood, where he grew up. In the 1980s and '90s, the LA community was known for street gang violence and poverty.
EDWARDS: All of my friends were either gangbangers or athletes. So I tried to stay out of it. I love to draw.
DEL BARCO: Edwards also loved basketball and used to watch the LA Lakers practice at his high school.
EDWARDS: I would see Magic and Kareem every other day. They were just gigantic people.
DEL BARCO: So were you looking at their shoes?
EDWARDS: Oh, of course. Not only that, a friend of mine, he was a ball boy. And he would get me the shoes after the game.
DEL BARCO: He says back then, sneakers mostly came in just white with red or blue, never with green - his high school colors.
EDWARDS: I would get some green shoe dye and duct tape and tape up all the white and paint the swoosh green.
DEL BARCO: His classmates started paying him to customize sneakers. Edwards says wearing the latest style was everything.
EDWARDS: It was your self-expression. It was your car. People look down first, and then they scan the rest of the body after that. And, you know, there's there's two things you didn't want to hear - what size do you wear? Because that means they were about to take your shoes. The second one was, where'd you get them? And you never answered either question. You just kept moving.
DEL BARCO: Edwards wanted to make a career out of designing sneakers, but his high school guidance counselor was no help.
EDWARDS: She's like, you're a better shot at joining the military. No black kid from Inglewood would ever become a footwear designer.
DEL BARCO: But Edwards proved her wrong. At 17, when he worked as a file clerk for LA Gear, he put a new sneaker concept in the company's suggestion box every day until the owner appointed him as a designer. Then for Skechers, he devised shoes for rappers like Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Finally, Nike hired him to design for Michael Jordan's line of sneakers. Edwards started with the Air Jordan 21.
EDWARDS: So Michael loves cars, and he had just bought a Bentley GT Continental - well, two of them. And he was like, hey, I love this car. Can we build a shoe based on this vehicle?
DEL BARCO: Edwards flew to London to see how the car was made. To design the Air Jordan 22, he examined the F-22 fighter plane made of titanium.
EDWARDS: The atomic number for titanium is 22. And so I built this titanium platform within the shoe, paying homage to the actual aircraft.
DEL BARCO: Edwards says he's always gotten strength from his mother, who once gave him a small card with an inspirational message. For 32 years, he's kept that card in his wallet.
EDWARDS: It says, believe in yourself, in the power that you have...
DEL BARCO: Edwards gave his protege Ari Montanez a copy of the card, which was like getting handed a diploma. They read it together.
D'WAYNE EDWARDS AND ARI MONTANEZ: There is no limit to what you can do.
DEL BARCO: Mandalit del Barco, NPR News.

NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Gayle Tzemach Lemmon about her reporting on the status of women in Syria.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Author Gayle Tzemach Lemmon has also just returned from Syria, where she's been working on a book about the roles of women in the fight against ISIS. We last spoke with her in December after President Trump announced that U.S. forces would withdraw from the country. At the time, he said that the U.S. had, quote, ""won the war against ISIS,"" unquote, a claim many immediately disputed. He has since decided to leave hundreds of troops in Syria.
But we wanted to check back in with Gayle after her latest reporting trip there, and she is with us now from Los Angeles. Gayle, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Oh, great to join you.
MARTIN: So could you just tell us where you went on this trip, and who are some of the people that you spoke with? And. Of course, I want to know what's changed since you were last there.
LEMMON: I was in Raqqa, in Kobani, in a number of towns. And what I have seen is that the people I've been following for the past two years - one mom, who came out of Raqqa eight and a half months pregnant, led her entire family facing ISIS snipers, ISIS mines and coalition airstrikes designed to rout ISIS from the city. After having given birth, she's now supporting her whole family. She's working for an NGO. And the thing that's so fascinating is to see these moms talk about how women, even in camps for the displaced, are taking on all kinds of new roles.
MARTIN: I just want to pause for a minute and ask about women who fought with ISIS or who are married to ISIS fighters. How are they being treated in this community? Are they there? Are they being accepted? What is happening with them?
LEMMON: There is a level of acceptance for some. So one young woman I met joined the all-women's force after being brutalized by her husband, who was part of ISIS. On the other hand, the women who were foreigners and even the real hardcore last holdouts in the fight against ISIS who are in this town of Baghuz, which had basically an apocalyptic end. They ran out of food. They ran out of water.
And what you see now from the women who were part of that is that all of the crimes of ISIS - you know, enslaving girls, raping women, beheading people on the streets, the hangings - that was not enough really to make them lose confidence in the head of ISIS. But the fact that children whose families belong to ISIS starved to death while leaders had food, that is what's making people very disappointed, very disillusioned, especially the women I've talked to.
MARTIN: Are there people who still support the caliphate despite all that they went through?
LEMMON: Absolutely there are. And in fact, one woman from Egypt I met has four daughters. She was talking about how all they want is to go home, to go back to Egypt, to go back to the parks, to go see relatives. And she said to me, you know, I don't believe in Baghdadi. But I still believe in the caliphate.
MARTIN: I did want to ask about your take on U.S. policy in northeast Syria because back in January, you wrote on your website that it's working. You said that the U.S. has helped defeat ISIS and prevent its resurgence, and it's done so not solely through direct military engagement, but by assisting a partner force. And I wanted to ask if you think that this assistance is sufficient to keep the threat of an ISIS resurgence in check.
LEMMON: It is sufficient as a foundation because what you see now is local folks holding local towns and working their best to keep them safe. But it is an international problem that requires international investment to help people have water and power and schools that run. And they merit our investment.
MARTIN: That was writer Gayle Tzemach Lemmon, who just returned from a reporting trip in Syria. Gayle, thanks so much for talking to us once again.

Polls close today in the European Union Parliamentary Elections. Early results may signal whether nationalist or pro-EU candidates will take a majority of the parliament.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Results are coming in from elections in 28 nations that voted for seats in the European Union's Parliament. Commentators have called the vote a battle for the soul of Europe because of the rise of nationalist populist parties that want to weaken the EU. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley is following the results from her base in Paris, and she is with us now.
Eleanor, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Great to be with you, Michel.
MARTIN: Do you see any big trends emerging?
BEARDSLEY: Well, the first big trend is that turnout was huge, and no one expected that. In France and mostly everywhere, I was standing out of - outside of polling places, and just many young people - there was just a lot of voters. Secondly, the preliminary vote count shows that the two principal pro-European parties - you know, the mainstream moderate parties that have governed in a coalition for many years - they both lost about 40 seats each, and they no longer have a majority. That means they're going to have to find another party to work with.
And at the same time, far-right, populist, euroskeptic, you know, parties - they gained many seats. And thirdly, the ecologists did really well. They gained at least 20 seats. They may be the fourth biggest force in the Parliament now. And the French Green Party leader talked about a green wave sweeping over Europe.
MARTIN: One thing that I think people may be curious about is that the United Kingdom had to vote in this election even though it voted three years ago to leave the EU. So what happened there? And what about France, where you are?
BEARDSLEY: Yeah, Michel. It is very ironic. Britain voted to leave the EU, but it's still in the EU today, so by law, they had to organize these elections for Britain's 73 seats in the Parliament. The two mainstream - you know, the Conservative and Labour Parties both lost seats. And the Brexit party of Nigel Farage did very well - gained 24 seats. You remember he pushed for the Brexit vote to begin with. But, you know, those elected today will probably never go to the EU Parliament because when Britain leaves, its seats will be redistributed to other countries.
MARTIN: And what about...
BEARDSLEY: And...
MARTIN: What about France? Because Macron is obviously very pro-EU.
BEARDSLEY: Absolutely. Marine Le Pen did very well. That was expected. It wasn't a huge shock. She got about 24% of the vote. Macron avoided disaster. He personally invested in the campaign. He got about 22%, so came in, you know, second. But it was clearly a rebuke - a rebuke to him. And the - you know, the top person in Marine Le Pen's party lists said, the president - he turned this vote into a plebiscite, and he got his answer. The people are against him and his policies.
MARTIN: That is NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris.
Eleanor, thanks so much.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 11:35 a.m. ET
Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are very much on each other's minds.
At his campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday, the former vice president went off script — twice — to deride a protester with a whistle.
""That must be Bernie or somebody,"" Biden apparently said, raising eyebrows and drawing laughs.
(The line is at 8:21 into this video . You can decide for yourself what he said.)
Minutes later, with Biden talking about unity and governing amid more background whistling, he used the whistler as a punchline.
""You know, there's serious work that has to be done,"" Biden said, ""but it's not being done by a president who wakes up in the middle of the night and wages war on Twitter or like the guy on the whistle back there. Wonder whose campaign he's with.""
Analysis Biden Eschews Anger, Hoping 'Unity' Can Lift Him To The Presidency In those two offhand remarks, Biden flashed a raw look at his view of the difference between himself and Sanders when it comes to governing – an adult seeking consensus or a kooky guy with a whistle.
Sanders, a senator from Vermont, swatted back the next day on NBC's Meet the Press , noting that while beating President Trump was ""No. 1,"" that was ""not enough.""
""I understand that our campaign is unique in the sense that we're going to try to win the Democratic primary, that we are going to try to beat Trump, but you know what else we're going to try to do? We're going to try to transform the United States of America. ... So our campaign has a different goal. It's to transform this country, and we're taking on the entire establishment when we do that.""
And what's more establishment than the former vice president from an administration that many progressives lament as too incremental, too naïve and too wide-eyed about working with Republicans?
Analysis Are Democrats Ready To 'Feel The Bern' Or Is Sanders The 'MySpace' Of 2020? ""There is this dynamic tension between wanting to win and wanting to be inspired,"" said Karen Finney, a top Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton's campaign, on Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaign in Georgia in 2018 and is now working for Higher Heights, an organization working to elect black women.
Finney, though, notes that Biden has appeal among Democrats because he represents something of a soothing balm, an antidote to almost three years of a hard departure from normalcy, in the view of Democrats, many independents and some Republicans.
""Part of wanting to win is there is a mood in the country for, I don't like to say going back to normalcy, but to establish a new normal that you feel confident that the person in charge knows what he's doing or she's doing,"" Finney said. ""And there's something about Biden, partially because he has the experience on the big stage with Obama that reminds you what that's like.""
That is likely why Biden — so far in this very early stage of the primary — is comfortably ahead in surveys of Democratic voters.
Analysis How Trump Breaks With Clinton And Nixon On Governing While Under Investigation ""The disadvantage, if you want to call it that, for Biden is voters do want a new face of the party, a younger face of the party,"" said Adam Hodge, a Democratic consultant, who was an Obama administration and Democratic National Committee spokesman. ""But all of that is secondary to who is the best person to beat Donald Trump next November. And who can amass a large governing coalition to actually get things done. A majority of the Democratic Party do want a president to not only win, but also get things done.""
Governing and consensus-building are things Biden has been harping on.
""Well, I'm going to say something outrageous: I know how to make government work,"" Biden said Saturday, adding, ""I helped make this government work before. And I can make it work again. To me, our principles must never be compromised. But compromise itself is not a dirty word. Consensus is not a weakness — it's a necessity. It's how this government was designed to work.""
Politics Senate Reaches $19 Billion Deal For Disaster Aid Without Border Wall Funding That is not popular with progressives who want bold change, and they don't trust Biden to hold the line on those principles.
""I will be damned if the same politicians who refused to act then [in recent decades] are going to try to come back today and say we need to find a middle-of-the-road approach to save our lives,"" progressive star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said after hearing Biden could be crafting a ""middle-of-the-road"" climate change approach.
The split comes down to unity versus anger , restoration versus revolution .
""It's a political revolution"" that's needed, said Larry Cohen, head of Our Revolution, an outside group supporting Sanders that grew out of his 2016 campaign. ""Restoration in this country — what period are we going to go back to? The period of Jim Crow? State militias? We are moving forward, not restoration. To build a democracy here, it has to be inclusive — in a meaningful way.""
There are warning signs for both Biden and Sanders. The Democratic takeover of the House was fueled in 2018 by women. And a Pew poll out Thursday found that women, especially those under 50, were far less enthusiastic about voting for a white male than for a woman.
And there are nearly two dozen candidates for Democrats to choose from, including prominent women like Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who will be fanning out this Memorial Day weekend from Iowa to New Hampshire.
So far, Biden and Sanders have stood out, but the campaign is about to enter an important next phase; debate season begins next month. Those events will be, for many voters, their introduction to some of these candidates – and someone could break out.
""This is why the debates are going to be so important,"" Finney said, ""because, right now, it's hard to get a sense of their strength in terms of how they're doing with voters, because there are 23 of them. ... Seeing how they engage each other will give us a lot more information on the strength of these candidates.""
At the end of the day, though, despite the very real and clear divisions, party strategists believe the party will come together because of Trump.
National Security U.S. Brings New Charges Against Julian Assange In War Logs, State Cables Case ""One of the most galvanizing forces in American politics in recent history is the Trump presidency,"" Hodge said. ""And I think Democrats, regardless of who the nominee is, will absolutely unite behind whoever we nominate.""
Case in point, Cohen said of Biden, ""If he's the nominee,"" his group ""will support him enthusiastically. At the end of the day, elections are binary. It's like a light switch, I want the light on. It's not a close call. There's a huge difference between Vice President Biden and Donald Trump.""
That said, he added, ""Now is the time to talk about what kind of nation we can be, and what can we get done — and let's aim higher.""

Chiang Ying-ying/AP More than a thousand people participated in a mass wedding banquet in Taiwan on Saturday to celebrate the island becoming the first place in Asia to legally recognize same-sex unions.
The event included a wedding ceremony for about 20 couples. Couples walked down a red carpet at the wedding banquet, surrounded by jubilant supporters. Supporters gathered around the venue, camping out on picnic blankets to watch the ceremony and stage performances.
Earlier this month, Taiwan's legislature voted 66 to 27 to recognize same-sex marriages. Taiwan's high court had ruled in 2017 that forbidding the marriage of same sex couples violated Taiwan's constitution, and set a two-year deadline for the legislature to pass a corresponding law or same-sex marriage would become legal automatically.
NPR's Laurel Wamsley reported that marriage equality was part of President Tsai Ing-wen's 2016 campaign platform. Before the vote in Taiwan's state legislature, Tsai tweeted, ""Good morning Taiwan. Today, we have a chance to make history & show the world that progressive values can take root in an East Asian society. Today, we can show the world that #LoveWins.""

Chiang Ying-ying/AP Chi Chia-wei, whom The New York Times calls the ""godfather"" of Taiwan's gay rights movement, told the news outlet, ""Progress is good. More progress is even better."" Chi, who was imprisoned by Taiwan in 1986 for coming out as gay, told the NYT the issues of transnational couples and full adoption rights must still be addressed.
Same-sex marriages remain illegal throughout the rest of Asia, and in some parts of Africa, it is considered a crime. But as the NYT notes, Taiwan has been a leader of gay rights in Asia and its annual gay pride parade in Taipei routinely draws thousands.

Unbeknownst to Mollie, a member of the Osage tribe, the marriage was part of a larger plot to steal her family's oil wealth. Oklahoma Historical Society, Oklahoman Collection/Courtesy of Doubleday
Generations ago, the American Indian Osage tribe was compelled to move. Not for the first time, white settlers pushed them off their land in the 1800s. They made their new home in a rocky, infertile area in northeast Oklahoma in hopes that settlers would finally leave them alone.
As it turned out, the land they had chosen was rich in oil, and in the early 20th century, members of the tribe became spectacularly wealthy. They bought cars and built mansions; they made so much oil money that the government began appointing white guardians to ""help"" them spend it. Killers of the Flower Moon Subtitle The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI Author Independent Booksellers
And then Osage members started turning up dead.
In his new book, Killers of the Flower Moon , David Grann describes how white people in the area conspired to kill Osage members in order steal their oil wealth, which could only be passed on through inheritance.""This was a culture of complicity,"" he says, ""and it was allowed to go on for so long because so many people were part of the plot. You had lawmen, you had prosecutors, you had the reporters who wouldn't cover it. You had oilmen who wouldn't speak out. You had morticians who would cover up the murders when they buried the body. You had doctors who helped give poison to people."" Interview Highlights
On how the conspiracy worked
What makes these crimes so sinister is that it involved marrying into families. It involved a level of calculation and a level of betraying the very people you pretended to love. And the way these murders would take place is that people would marry into the families and then begin to kill each member of the family. ... That's exactly what happened to [Osage woman Mollie Burkhart]. She had married a white man, and his uncle was the most powerful settler in the area. He was known as the King of the Osage Hills ... and he had orchestrated a very sinister plot played out over years where he directed his nephew, who had married Mollie Burkhart, to marry her so that he could then begin to kill the family members one by one and siphon off all the wealth.
On how Mollie Burkhart's family was killed
One day in 1921, her older sister disappeared and Mollie looked everywhere for her and couldn't find her. And about a week later, her body was found essentially in a ravine, decomposed. She'd been shot in the back of the head. Comanche Nation: The Rise And Fall Of An 'Empire'
Then just a few weeks later, Mollie's mother began to grow increasingly sick. She seemed to be almost disappearing, withering in front of her. And within two months she, too, had died. And evidence later suggested that she had been secretly poisoned.
Not long after that, Mollie was sleeping in her bed in her house with her white husband; they had a couple children. And she heard a loud explosion. She got up in panic and terror. ... She had another sister who lived not far away, and in the area where her sister's house was she could see almost this orange fire ball rising into the sky. It almost looked as if the sun had burst into the night. And her sister's house had been blown up killing that sister as well as her sister's husband and a servant who lived in that house.

The Osage National Museum/Courtesy of Doubleday
On how far the conspirators went to cover up their crimes
Almost anyone who tried to investigate the killings — or at least stop them in the area — they, too, were killed. One attorney tried to gather evidence and one day he was thrown off a speeding train and all the evidence that he had gathered had disappeared. Another time, an oilman had traveled to Washington, D.C., to try to get help. ... He checked into a boarding house in Washington, D.C. ... He was then found the next day stripped naked. He had been stabbed more than 20 times; his head had been beaten in. The Washington Post at the time said what everyone at that point knew, which was there was a conspiracy to kill rich Indians.
On how authorities reacted to the deaths
It's really important to understand back then that there was so much lawlessness. That was one of the things that shocked me when I began researching the story, that even in the 1920s much of America remained a country that was not fully rooted in its laws. Its legal institutions were very fragile; there was enormous corruption, particularly in this era and in this area. And the conspirators were able to pay off lawmen, they were able to pay off prosecutors. There was so much prejudice that these crimes were neglected.
Mollie Burkhart beseeched the authorities to try to investigate, to get help, but because of prejudice they often ignored the crimes. And she issued money for a reward, she hired private investigators, but the crimes for years remained unsolved, and the body count continued to increase. By 1924 there were at least 24 murders alone. ...
Finally, the Osage, in desperation, they issued a resolution, a tribal resolution, beseeching the federal authorities to help. And finally a then-very obscure branch of the Justice Department intervened. It was known as the Bureau of Investigation and it was what ... would later be renamed the FBI. The History Of The FBI's Secret 'Enemies' List
On the FBI's investigation
J. Edgar Hoover ... was the new director, and it became one of the FBI's first major homicide cases that it ever dealt with. ... The bureau initially badly bungled the case. ... [Hoover] turned the case over to a frontier lawman at the time who finally put together an undercover team that included ... probably the only American Indian agent in the bureau at the time. They went undercover. ... They were able, through some dogged investigation and at great danger, to eventually capture some of the ringleaders. And those ringleaders included not only Mollie Burkhart's husband, it also included [his] uncle, a man who was seen as this great protector of the community.
On what the FBI missed in their investigation
The bureau was so anxious to wrap up the case that they ignored many, many other unsolved crimes and many, many other killers. ... When you begin to look at the documents and you begin to collect the evidence from the Osage, it becomes abundantly apparent. ...
I pulled some of the guardian papers and there was this little booklet that came out. It had a little fabric cover. All it was was essentially identifying the name of a guardian and which Osage they were in charge of. And when I opened up the book, I could see the name of the guardian and when I began to look at the names of the Osage under them I could see written next to many of them simply the word ""Dead. Dead. Dead."" It was almost like a ledger; it was like this forensic, bureaucratic accounting.
But when you're looking at it, you're beginning to realize you're looking at hints of a systematic murder campaign, because there's no way all these people died in a span of just a couple years. It defied any natural death rate. The Osage were wealthy, they had good doctors. ... And then when you begin to look into each of those individual cases, you start to find trails of evidence suggesting poisonings, a murder. You start to try to trace the money ... and where the wealth went. And what you begin to discover is something even more horrifying than the bureau ever exposed.

Delegates for both Guaidó and Nicolás Maduro are slated to hold direct talks in Norway this week aimed at ending the crisis in Venezuela.
Federico Parra /AFP/Getty Images The push for a negotiated solution to the Veneuzelan crisis appears to be picking up steam with delegates for President Nicolás Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaidó slated for direct talks in Norway this week.
The Norwegian government, which is serving as mediator, made the announcement two weeks after an initial round of meetings involving the two sides in Oslo. The effort is designed to break months of political gridlock at a time when Venezuela is suffering from its worst economic meltdown in history, a disaster that has prompted more than 3 million people to flee the country.
""Norway commends the parties for their efforts and appreciates their disposition"" to negotiate, Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide said on Saturday.
Even so, skeptical. It claims Maduro has used past negotiations, including meetings in the Dominican Republic two years ago, to stall for time while refusing to make concessions.
""They will never fool us again with a false dialogue like in 2017,"" Guaidó told supporters on Saturday. ""That's why today we're in the streets.""
 Pompeo Guaidó, who is recognized by the United States and more than 50 other countries has instead tried to force out Maduro, who was reelected last year in balloting marred by allegations of widespread fraud. But massive street protests and calls for the Venezuelan military to withdraw their support for Maduro have failed.
""If you can't kick him out, at some point you are going to have to realize that you must negotiate,"" said Caracas pollster and political analyst Luis Vicente León.
He added that the two sides have likely been speaking in secret for months in order to set up the talks in Norway, which also helped broker Colombia's historic 2016 peace treaty that ended a long guerrilla war.
Several factors could prompt Maduro to cut a deal. These include U.S. sanctions on the nation's vital oil industry, which provides more than 90% of Venezuela's export income, said Geoff Ramsey of the Washington Office on Latin America, a policy and human rights group.
""The pressure isn't letting up,"" he said. ""Maduro and his entire inner circle have every interest to advance some kind of negotiated transition because that's the only way to get out from under pressure of U.S. sanctions.""
In addition, Maduro may fear a military coup as salaries and living conditions for officers deteriorate. Ramsey thinks they ""would be very happy to throw [Maduro] under the bus and replace him with someone who has much more international legitimacy.""
Opinion Opinion: Venezuela's Guaidó Is On A Long-Haul Mission. Are His U.S. Backers? Latin America Venezuelans Find Temporary Lifeline At Colombia's First Border Tent Camp On Saturday, a smiling Maduro appeared on national television to announce that he would send a delegation to Norway to ""move forward towards good agreements.""
The opposition insists that negotiations must focus on Maduro either stepping down or holding a free and fair presidential election. So does the U.S. On Saturday, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said: ""We believe the only thing to negotiate with Nicolás Maduro is the conditions of his departure.""
The two sides appear far apart. During initial talks earlier this month, representatives for Maduro and the opposition spoke separately with a Norwegian mediator rather than to each other.
Opposition supporters fear that Maduro is simply trying to distract attention from the country's growing havoc, which includes hyperinflation, widespread power outages and gasoline.
In Maracaibo, one of the hardest hit cities located near the Colombian border, vegetable salesman and Guaidó supporter Ángel Gallardo claimed that only a foreign-led invasion would dislodge Maduro from power. ""Negotiations won't solve anything,"" he said.
But with life getting tougher by the day, high school principal Alexander Pérez said he's desperate for a breakthrough in Oslo. Thanks to hyperinflation, Pérez said that until recently, he was spending more per day on bus fare than he earned on the job. He now walks to work.
""Negotiations are the best solution,"" Pérez said. ""That way we will avoid bloodshed and even more pain than we are already suffering."""
Book: 'The Queen' Follows Original Welfare Fraudster Linda Taylor,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190933/book-the-queen-follows-original-welfare-fraudster-linda-taylor?station=KXJZ_FM,"Josh Levin, author of The Queen: The Forgotten Life Behind an American Myth , talks with NPR's Michel Martin about Linda Taylor's complicated history.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Linda Taylor or Linda Bennett (ph) or Linda Gordon (ph) or whoever she really was might have remained a busier than average con artist, maybe the subject of an expose or two in one of the Chicago papers. Instead, she became Exhibit A of a kind of cultural corrosion and governmental ineptitude that Ronald Reagan promised to fix. Here he is in a radio commentary from October, 1976.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RONALD REAGAN: The trail extends through 14 states. She has used 127 names so far, posed as a mother of 14 children at one time, seven at another, signed up twice with the same caseworker in four days and once, while on welfare, posed as an open heart surgeon complete with office.
MARTIN: In speeches, Reagan usually called her the woman from Chicago. The Chicago newspapers gave her a name that stuck - the welfare queen. But as it turns out, neither Reagan nor most of the reporters - not even most of the cops on her trail ever really got her story straight. It was actually far more complicated and perhaps even more terrible than any of them ever figured out. Josh Levin thinks he has, though, and he tells the fascinating and bizarre tale in a new book called ""The Queen."" And he is with us now in our studios in Washington, D.C.
Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
JOSH LEVIN: Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: Let me just say up front, this story is so strange. It has so many twists and turns. It's a wonder anybody could follow it all. And, first of all, what is her real name?
LEVIN: She was born Martha Louise White.
MARTIN: Martha Louise White - but you call her Linda Taylor in the book, right?
LEVIN: Yes. When she became a public figure kind of briefly in the mid-1970s, that was what she was known as.
MARTIN: So she really did commit welfare fraud. Can we just establish that - the fact that she did use aliases, she did use any number of means in order to get benefits to which she was not entitled? That's accurate.
LEVIN: That is accurate. The thing that's inaccurate is to characterize her fraud as typical. When Reagan talked about her in his speeches when he ran for president for the first time in 1976, he was highlighting her because she was an extraordinary case because she had stolen a lot of money. But at the same time, he wanted to use her as an example of what was wrong with the system. And that was really what was inaccurate - the implication that people that are on welfare - that we should be suspicious of them.
MARTIN: To the best of your knowledge, how much did she steal?
LEVIN: Reagan would say $150,000 in a single year. Sometimes, it was reported that she'd stolen 300,000 or even a million. What I was able to find when I went to the Illinois State Archives is some correspondence back and forth between public officials where it seems like what they settled on was on the order of $40,000 over a period of several years - which is a lot of money, but it's not the scope that Reagan described.
MARTIN: But she had other crimes. I mean, like, she would say she was going to buy a house and never pay for it. And she was a grifter, right?
LEVIN: She was a grifter. And her grifts included, you know, posing as a heart surgeon. We heard that from Reagan at the - in the clip at the top. That was true. She did do that. She would also pose as a voodoo priestess, and she would scam people on a very close-up personal level. She would tell people that she, like, could communicate with their dead relatives or could see into the future and would - she would prey on people an incredible number of ways and seemed to have an instinct for how to really get inside and devastate individuals.
MARTIN: One of the points that you make in the book is that, you know, the welfare fraud was the least of it. Actually, what she may have done was worse. I mean, you think she actually may have kidnapped kids and wanted to use them to get benefits.
LEVIN: Not sure why she did the kidnappings. Her behavior often seemed irrational and inexplicable. But yeah, she was arrested on kidnapping charges in Chicago in 1967. She was not charged. And then in 1975, when she has been indicted for welfare fraud - and at that point, she is a known figure, she's known as the welfare queen - the Chicago Tribune reports that she's been accused of a homicide. And yet, even with an accusation that severe and that kind of horrifying, it just doesn't affix itself to her story.
MARTIN: How did she get involved in this life to begin with?
LEVIN: When I started to really dig into where she had come from and who she was before she became Linda Taylor and the welfare queen, I found a very 20th-century American story of this woman who had grown up in the Deep South. She was mixed race in a family that didn't accept her. She was denied an education. She was denied the love of the people who were supposed to care for and protect her. And as so many Americans did, she left the Deep South and moved out West.
But out there, she had trouble finding steady work. I found some arrests for prostitution-related offenses in the 1940s. And then out there, she married a white man. And she listed her race at that time as Hawaiian because if she had been marked as black on an official form, California had not yet struck down its miscegenation ban, so she wouldn't - it wouldn't have been legal for her to enter into this marriage.
And so I think these events all helped chart the course of her life and mark her life to some degree. And yet, they don't explain or excuse her criminal behavior. And, you know, as far as why she did the things that she did, she was not someone who was honest about her motivations and about what she'd done. And so as far as looking for answers, a lot of this stuff is unknowable.
MARTIN: Well, she did a lot of things. I mean, one of the ways that this scam unraveled is that she reported a burglary that could not possibly have happened. I mean, she's reported that, like, a big refrigerator was stolen from her apartment or something like that, right? And...
LEVIN: Yeah. Her story was that the refrigerator had been taken out of her window, which geometrically, it was not a plausible scenario.
MARTIN: So how did it all finally come to an end?
LEVIN: So in 1977, she goes on trial for welfare fraud, and she's convicted and given a pretty harsh sentence. She was only actually charged with stealing a little under $9,000. So for $9,000, she gets three to seven years in prison. She goes away to a state prison in Illinois. And after that, she's never written about again. She's almost, like, erased from history and the public record. And what I was able to find is that when she got out of prison, she predictably changed identities, moved to Florida and committed a bunch more crimes.
MARTIN: And then she died in 2002. You paint a portrait of a - I don't know how else to describe it - a deeply damaged person. But you also make the case in the book that her story is about more than her. What do you want people to draw from it?
LEVIN: I think what this book is about to a large degree is just the damage that can be done by telling a distorted story. In Illinois, after her successful prosecution, there was a special unit created exclusively to prosecute welfare fraud. A lot of people got caught up in that who were not Linda Taylor-like. These are people who were struggling. But after her case and all the publicity it got, welfare fraud is increasingly treated as a matter that needs to be dealt with harshly, severely in courts and then with prison time.
And then, on national policy level, Reagan does not win in 1976. But he continues to talk about Taylor when he runs successfully in 1980. And then, once he's in office, he tells her story not only publicly. He tells his newspaper editors. He also tells it to the Congressional Black Caucus. He tells it to people in Congress behind the scenes as he's selling his cuts to food stamps and aid to families with dependent children.
And what he's arguing is if we cut out the Linda Taylors, if we cut out the fraudsters, then there can be more for everyone else, and it's a win-win situation. And he passes - succeeds in passing these very large cuts. The effect of them is a lot more devastating on vulnerable people than I think he was selling when he was selling these cuts.
MARTIN: Josh Levin is the editorial director of Slate, and his new book is called ""The Queen."" Josh Levin, thanks so much for talking to us.
LEVIN: Thank you.

Olympic Track Star Rebukes Sponsorship Pay Penalties For Pregnant Athletes,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190926/olympic-track-star-rebukes-sponsorship-pay-penalties-for-pregnant-athletes?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Olympic track runner Alysia Montano about how sport endorsement companies treat maternity leave.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Alysia Montano is an Olympian and a U.S. champion. You might remember her as the pregnant runner. She competed in 2014 when she was eight months pregnant with her first child. Two weeks ago, Montano made headlines again when, in a video for The New York Times, she called out the sports industry in general and sponsors like Nike and ASICS in particular for cutting off pay and health benefits to female athletes when they take time off to give birth and recover. That encouraged other women athletes to speak out about their experiences with sponsors. We called Montano to ask her to tell us more, starting with the financial realities of competing in track and field.
ALYSIA MONTANO: We're not paid a huge salary by a league at all. Instead, our income comes almost exclusively from sponsorship deals with inked apparel companies, like Nike and ASICS, that keeps them bound for three to five years. And we don't get rich.
MARTIN: No, point taken. Well, when you decided to have a baby, like, what happened? I mean, did you tell your contact at Nike? Did your agent speak to them? Like, what happened?
MONTANO: Back in 2012, I just finished the Olympic year. And I finished fifth at the Olympics. I noted hey, you know, you guys, it's - I'm looking at my contract here, and there aren't any protections in place. And they would not provide me with what would happen to me. That led us to kind of seeking out other options. ASICS came into play and kind of stated the same thing. Hey, I plan on expanding my family. ASICS at the time had said, we appreciate full athletes. Come over here. And so I did. I finished a year with them in which I finished with a bronze medal at world championships.
And so in that off-year, I'd hoped that we would conceive and be able to have our daughter and return to the sport. And I did conceive. I did have my daughter. And my daughter was two months old. And I got a phone call that said, I want to talk about your contracts in regard to your performance this year - which means - you mean the year that I've been with child? And then I was - my payment was reduced.
MARTIN: And what about your health benefits? I mean, that was another thing that emerged in the reporting on this is that there are athletes whose health insurance was terminated. And I can't think a very thing - many things more frightening than either being pregnant or having a child or having a newborn with no health insurance - summarily terminated. So what about you? Did you at least have health insurance to cover the delivery or the postpartum period?
MONTANO: Yes. So the way that it works is a tier system. The luck that I did have with my daughter was I fell within the tier system because I made the Olympic team in 2012, and the protection was there for me. Now, if I didn't make the Olympic team in 2012 and I became pregnant, I would lose my health insurance. My point and my stance is this should not be because I am an Olympian. This needs to be something that is in place for women athletes regardless.
MARTIN: I mean, this whole question of women and their reproductive choices is very much in the news right now. And I just have to ask you very directly, do you feel that you are getting messages from your sport that if you want to be a top-tier athlete, you should not have children?
MONTANO: Yes, absolutely. Before I had my daughter, I had a few examples of women that I looked up to who had returned to sport. I was very excited about - one of them being Kara Goucher. She talked about the difficult part of her motherhood and in resuming training and how she went on all these unpaid appearances with Nike. And her son ends up being extremely ill. And she, you know, she ends up having to leave him while he was dangerously ill to go compete at a race to restart her pay.
And that, to me, is a very strong message, like, your family is not first. Running and the sport is first regardless of - and also, we want you to prove to us, are you as focused, are you as dedicated? And the message is being sent that, if you're a serious athlete, you do not want to be a mother, and motherhood is not for serious athletes.
MARTIN: Before we let you go, I do have to ask. There are those who will say it just isn't their job. In fact, this is an argument that came up during the discussions over reauthorizing the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. There were those who said during testimony well, you know, I'm a man, why should I pay for maternity benefits? It's not my problem. It has nothing to do with me. So for people who feel that way, that, you know what, it's a private decision, there isn't any broader social responsibility to support this. You know, what would you say?
MONTANO: Of course that's what somebody would say that. It's oozing with privilege, right? When we look at women's issues, women's rights, this is a scope in which a man should not have any say on. And I think that it's so asinine for people to - men in particular - to think, like, this is a personal issue. This is something that is true in the world. It's - it can only happen to women. Men will never have to face pregnancy ever. And the people who are going to talk about policies and these protections are going to be men.
MARTIN: Is it true that all the people who negotiate these contracts at Nike are men?
MONTANO: They're all men that are - within house at Nike have been and are all men. It's an old boys club. The culture at Nike is - that's - it remains to be an old boys club. And this is the time for it to be exposed. You know, the time is now.
MARTIN: That was Olympian and former USA champion Alysia Montano. Alysia Montano, thank you so much for talking to us.
MONTANO: Thank you so much for having me.
MARTIN: After we spoke with Montano, two news organizations reported that a Nike vice president, in a memo to staff, said the company was eliminating a performance requirement for 12 months for those athletes who decide to have a baby.
So we called Alysia Montano back to get her reaction. And she told us she wants to acknowledge movement on this issue, but she has not yet seen an actual contract. She says she wants to make sure Nike writes this protection into the contracts of new and current female athletes because, she says, track and field athletes tend to sign contracts before they are the age in which women typically start thinking about having families, and by the time they do, they are locked into contracts without protections for maternity leave.

Sneaker Designer D'Wayne Edwards Gives Others A Foot In The Door,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190919/sneaker-designer-dwayne-edwards-gives-others-a-foot-in-the-door?station=KXJZ_FM,"D'Wayne Edwards is a legend in the world of sneakers. He was one of the first black sneaker designers and he created his own academy to give others a foot into the business.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Now we'd like to tell you about a legend in the world of sneakers. D'Wayne Edwards was one of the first black designers. He also created his own academy to give others a foot into the business. NPR's Mandalit del Barco spent time with Edwards when he visited one of his proteges in LA.
MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: At a storefront space in Venice Beach, cobblers listen to jazz as they handcraft limited edition and custom-made sneakers for the company No.One. Twenty-two-year-old Ari Montanez has designed some of the label's latest kicks, including a black and white leather sneaker.
ARI MONTANEZ: The Delta right over there is the one I first worked on when I first got here.
DEL BARCO: Montanez says he'd been a shy kid, who sometimes got into trouble in Orange, N.J.
D'WAYNE EDWARDS: Actually, Ari's dad reached out to me and was like, hey, my son wants to do some footwear.
DEL BARCO: That's D'Wayne Edwards. He's been mentoring young footwear designers through his program Pensole Design Academy, which is free for students. It partners with sneaker companies and schools like the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena.
EDWARDS: I didn't have the money to go to college.
DEL BARCO: Edwards was the youngest of six children. And times were tough in Inglewood, where he grew up. In the 1980s and '90s, the LA community was known for street gang violence and poverty.
EDWARDS: All of my friends were either gangbangers or athletes. So I tried to stay out of it. I love to draw.
DEL BARCO: Edwards also loved basketball and used to watch the LA Lakers practice at his high school.
EDWARDS: I would see Magic and Kareem every other day. They were just gigantic people.
DEL BARCO: So were you looking at their shoes?
EDWARDS: Oh, of course. Not only that, a friend of mine, he was a ball boy. And he would get me the shoes after the game.
DEL BARCO: He says back then, sneakers mostly came in just white with red or blue, never with green - his high school colors.
EDWARDS: I would get some green shoe dye and duct tape and tape up all the white and paint the swoosh green.
DEL BARCO: His classmates started paying him to customize sneakers. Edwards says wearing the latest style was everything.
EDWARDS: It was your self-expression. It was your car. People look down first, and then they scan the rest of the body after that. And, you know, there's there's two things you didn't want to hear - what size do you wear? Because that means they were about to take your shoes. The second one was, where'd you get them? And you never answered either question. You just kept moving.
DEL BARCO: Edwards wanted to make a career out of designing sneakers, but his high school guidance counselor was no help.
EDWARDS: She's like, you're a better shot at joining the military. No black kid from Inglewood would ever become a footwear designer.
DEL BARCO: But Edwards proved her wrong. At 17, when he worked as a file clerk for LA Gear, he put a new sneaker concept in the company's suggestion box every day until the owner appointed him as a designer. Then for Skechers, he devised shoes for rappers like Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Finally, Nike hired him to design for Michael Jordan's line of sneakers. Edwards started with the Air Jordan 21.
EDWARDS: So Michael loves cars, and he had just bought a Bentley GT Continental - well, two of them. And he was like, hey, I love this car. Can we build a shoe based on this vehicle?
DEL BARCO: Edwards flew to London to see how the car was made. To design the Air Jordan 22, he examined the F-22 fighter plane made of titanium.
EDWARDS: The atomic number for titanium is 22. And so I built this titanium platform within the shoe, paying homage to the actual aircraft.
DEL BARCO: Edwards says he's always gotten strength from his mother, who once gave him a small card with an inspirational message. For 32 years, he's kept that card in his wallet.
EDWARDS: It says, believe in yourself, in the power that you have...
DEL BARCO: Edwards gave his protege Ari Montanez a copy of the card, which was like getting handed a diploma. They read it together.
D'WAYNE EDWARDS AND ARI MONTANEZ: There is no limit to what you can do.
DEL BARCO: Mandalit del Barco, NPR News.

"For NPR Student Podcast Challenge, Many Students Tackle Climate Change",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190912/for-npr-student-podcast-challenge-many-students-tackle-climate-change?station=KXJZ_FM,"This year, NPR challenged students across the country to make podcasts about anything. Hundreds of students took on one topic: climate change.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
From the sunrise movement in the U.S. to the school strike for climate in 100 countries, teenagers have become the faces of climate activism. We definitely heard from teens when NPR held its first-ever student podcast challenge this spring. Hundreds of the nearly 6,000 entries in the nationwide podcast contest dealt with climate change and related environmental issues. Anya Kamenetz of the NPR education team has more.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING))
LEAH GLASPEY: Maybe you guys have heard of the climate crisis sweeping the globe today. If not...
ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Leah Glaspey, a seventh grader at Irving A. Robbins Middle School in Farmington, Conn., has a podcast for you.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CARA SZCZEPANSKI: I'm Cara Szczepanski.
LEAH: And I'm Leah Glaspey. And...
KAMENETZ: Their teacher, Alysson Olsen, says the girls started their podcast journey by thinking of climate change as a debate. But as they got deeper into their research, their focus shifted to the gaps in their own education, and they got upset.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LEAH: Climate change shouldn't be censored from the ears of children.
KAMENETZ: As they tell their classmates...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LEAH: We were given an edited piece of the truth.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KAMENETZ: Szczepanski ended their podcast with a passionate plea for change.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CARA: I mean, this is scary, and we understand that. But people have to realize that climate change is real. And it may be scary, but we are the ones that need to fix it.
KAMENETZ: The title of their entry - ""A Missed Opportunity: The Inconvenient Truth About Climate Change In Public Schools."" Across the country at Highline High School in Burien, Wash., junior Kat Quach zoomed in on a different aspect of the climate change problem.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KAT QUATCH: In this podcast, we're going to be talking about being vegan.
KAMENETZ: Quach chalked up the climate benefits of a vegan diet, which can be an uphill battle given American fast food culture.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KAT: Taco Bell even serves a taco with fried chicken as a tortilla. We wrap our meat in other meats. Who decided that we ever needed that much meat?
KAMENETZ: Lily Duong is another junior at Highline whose podcast considered the relationship between food and the environment. She brought her microphone to her family's Vietnamese restaurant, where she says...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LILY DUONG: At the restaurant, we don't compost. And often, many things we buy, like rice noodles, come in plastic packaging or is imported from other countries.
KAMENETZ: She interviewed her mother in the restaurant's kitchen about the practical barriers to becoming more sustainable. And, as we often do at NPR, she interpreted for her mother from Vietnamese.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DUONG: Why don't we switch to biodegradable to-go containers?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking through interpreter) It's not required by law. And it's a little bit more expensive.
KAMENETZ: Speaking of sustainability, the seventh graders at Goshen Middle School in Goshen, Ind., produced several entries exploring the Green New Deal. These boys put the issue in terms of their dream cars.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I want the Tesla Model X because it will help the environment, and it looks pretty cool.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Well, I want a Tesla Roadster because it is an electric car, so that means it does not put out carbon emissions.
KAMENETZ: Students around the country told us they aren't just researching the topic of climate change. They're also taking action themselves.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ZOE: Hey. So my name is Zoe, and this is David.
KAMENETZ: These fifth graders in Maryland Elementary in Bexley, Ohio, started a project called SOS for Save Our Seas. It's aimed at cutting back on plastic and increasing recycling in their lunchroom.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ZOE: Sandro, what do you know about recycling?
SANDRO: Well, recycling helps the community and the whole earth by reusing plastic that we don't need and we can make into something helpful.
KAMENETZ: They announced their plan at a school assembly.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: And (unintelligible).
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Who remembers what's SOS stand for?

Troll Watch: City Infrastructures Targeted With Stolen NSA Hacking Tools,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190905/troll-watch-city-infrastructures-targeted-with-stolen-nsa-hacking-tools?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Thomas Rid, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, about how hackers are using software developed by the NSA to attack government computers.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to spend some time now talking about cybersecurity. Recently stolen NSA tools have been used apparently in cyberattacks in Baltimore and North Carolina. Hackers used this software to interrupt digital infrastructure like government computers, and usually demand money to stop. That's today's topic in our regular segment called Troll Watch.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
MARTIN: This is where we've been keeping track of cybersecurity attacks, as well as the themes, memes and conspiracies being pushed by bots and trolls. Joining us now to talk more about this is Thomas Rid. He is a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he teaches about cybersecurity. Professor Rid, welcome. Thanks so much for talking to us.
THOMAS RID: Thank you. Hi.
MARTIN: Let's walk through the facts that are known. So as I understand it, the NSA develops certain hacking tools, and somehow or another, they lost control of them. They were leaked, stolen somehow. And they started showing up in the summer of 2016. Is that right?
RID: Yeah, that is correct. The NSA lost control over its crown jewels of hacking tools at some point, presumably in early 2016. And the leaks started in August 2016 in a drip-drip fashion. So over the next half year, a number of hacking tools appeared in public. And this caused huge havoc worldwide.
MARTIN: Do we have any sense of who is behind the attacks?
RID: It's important to understand that the hacking tools became public, so anybody could use them. The first actors to use them were intelligence agencies - first, the North Koreans, then Russian military intelligence in the summer of 2017. But now criminals and opportunistic hackers are using these tools as well.
MARTIN: One of the ways that this has become public is that Baltimore, Md., has been struggling with a cyberattack that has affected thousands of government computers and a number of important government operations. This is what was reported in The New York Times. The New York Times reported that the attack has interrupted real estate sales, water billing and things of that sort. How is something like this addressed? I mean, obviously these hackers are demanding money. So what happens? Do governments actually pay these people?
RID: We need to take one step back. The specific vulnerability to a computer system that was used in this attack has actually been fixed already in early 2017. But the problem is that a lot of firms, city governments, organizations don't actually patch their systems regularly because their IT budgets are too low. So that means that high-value targets have probably already fixed that hole in their security, but a lot of other targets haven't, which is why we now see criminals use these vulnerabilities against cities and other targets.
MARTIN: Should the NSA be held responsible for this? I'm just wondering. The fact that this crown jewel, as you put it, was leaked or stolen and became public, is that their fault?
RID: This is a great question. Actually, there's controversy. So initially, losing control of this hacking tool - and really, thousands of others - was clearly the NSA's fault. But at some point, I guess, their responsibility for criminals reusing what has become public is diminishing. But the problem here is that the U.S. government - first Obama, then the Trump administration, and of course, also Congress - have never addressed the underlying extraordinary leak that took place that is known as Shadow Brokers, which is arguably the worst security breach the NSA has ever suffered - even worse than the Snowden leak.
MARTIN: It just seems remarkable that something that has such significance and such a power to disrupt people's lives hasn't gotten more attention. Does it seem strange to you?
RID: Well, you know, the story is quite complicated. But I think we have to do better and really understand the Shadow Broker's leak, it's reuse. This is ultimately an attack, if we take the whole thing, that has caused tens of billions of damage to the world economy - billions.
MARTIN: As you would imagine with the upcoming presidential elections in this country, many people are concerned about cybersecurity. And the question becomes if routine government operations and those of private industry can be disrupted, then what does this say about our ability to guard our elections? What do you think it says?
RID: Again, we have to be very specific here. And it is possible to defend yourself if you're just a private citizen or if you have a small company. It's possible to patch your systems, to update the system to the most recent software, to use a number of security products that protect you, even against high-profile targets. But of course, we have to be on guard and get to the bottom of these most difficult and most complex cases. And this is certainly at the top of that list here.

A Divided Europe Elects A New Parliament,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190891/a-divided-europe-elects-a-new-parliament?station=KXJZ_FM,"Polls close today in the European Union Parliamentary Elections. Early results may signal whether nationalist or pro-EU candidates will take a majority of the parliament.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Results are coming in from elections in 28 nations that voted for seats in the European Union's Parliament. Commentators have called the vote a battle for the soul of Europe because of the rise of nationalist populist parties that want to weaken the EU. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley is following the results from her base in Paris, and she is with us now.
Eleanor, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Great to be with you, Michel.
MARTIN: Do you see any big trends emerging?
BEARDSLEY: Well, the first big trend is that turnout was huge, and no one expected that. In France and mostly everywhere, I was standing out of - outside of polling places, and just many young people - there was just a lot of voters. Secondly, the preliminary vote count shows that the two principal pro-European parties - you know, the mainstream moderate parties that have governed in a coalition for many years - they both lost about 40 seats each, and they no longer have a majority. That means they're going to have to find another party to work with.
And at the same time, far-right, populist, euroskeptic, you know, parties - they gained many seats. And thirdly, the ecologists did really well. They gained at least 20 seats. They may be the fourth biggest force in the Parliament now. And the French Green Party leader talked about a green wave sweeping over Europe.
MARTIN: One thing that I think people may be curious about is that the United Kingdom had to vote in this election even though it voted three years ago to leave the EU. So what happened there? And what about France, where you are?
BEARDSLEY: Yeah, Michel. It is very ironic. Britain voted to leave the EU, but it's still in the EU today, so by law, they had to organize these elections for Britain's 73 seats in the Parliament. The two mainstream - you know, the Conservative and Labour Parties both lost seats. And the Brexit party of Nigel Farage did very well - gained 24 seats. You remember he pushed for the Brexit vote to begin with. But, you know, those elected today will probably never go to the EU Parliament because when Britain leaves, its seats will be redistributed to other countries.
MARTIN: And what about...
BEARDSLEY: And...
MARTIN: What about France? Because Macron is obviously very pro-EU.
BEARDSLEY: Absolutely. Marine Le Pen did very well. That was expected. It wasn't a huge shock. She got about 24% of the vote. Macron avoided disaster. He personally invested in the campaign. He got about 22%, so came in, you know, second. But it was clearly a rebuke - a rebuke to him. And the - you know, the top person in Marine Le Pen's party lists said, the president - he turned this vote into a plebiscite, and he got his answer. The people are against him and his policies.
MARTIN: That is NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris.
Eleanor, thanks so much.
BEARDSLEY: Michel, good to be with you.

"In The Face Of Brutal Fates, Many Women Still Cling To ISIS",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/26/727190898/in-the-face-of-brutal-fates-many-women-still-cling-to-isis?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Gayle Tzemach Lemmon about her reporting on the status of women in Syria.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Author Gayle Tzemach Lemmon has also just returned from Syria, where she's been working on a book about the roles of women in the fight against ISIS. We last spoke with her in December after President Trump announced that U.S. forces would withdraw from the country. At the time, he said that the U.S. had, quote, ""won the war against ISIS,"" unquote, a claim many immediately disputed. He has since decided to leave hundreds of troops in Syria.
But we wanted to check back in with Gayle after her latest reporting trip there, and she is with us now from Los Angeles. Gayle, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.
GAYLE TZEMACH LEMMON: Oh, great to join you.
MARTIN: So could you just tell us where you went on this trip, and who are some of the people that you spoke with? And. Of course, I want to know what's changed since you were last there.
LEMMON: I was in Raqqa, in Kobani, in a number of towns. And what I have seen is that the people I've been following for the past two years - one mom, who came out of Raqqa eight and a half months pregnant, led her entire family facing ISIS snipers, ISIS mines and coalition airstrikes designed to rout ISIS from the city. After having given birth, she's now supporting her whole family. She's working for an NGO. And the thing that's so fascinating is to see these moms talk about how women, even in camps for the displaced, are taking on all kinds of new roles.
MARTIN: I just want to pause for a minute and ask about women who fought with ISIS or who are married to ISIS fighters. How are they being treated in this community? Are they there? Are they being accepted? What is happening with them?
LEMMON: There is a level of acceptance for some. So one young woman I met joined the all-women's force after being brutalized by her husband, who was part of ISIS. On the other hand, the women who were foreigners and even the real hardcore last holdouts in the fight against ISIS who are in this town of Baghuz, which had basically an apocalyptic end. They ran out of food. They ran out of water.
And what you see now from the women who were part of that is that all of the crimes of ISIS - you know, enslaving girls, raping women, beheading people on the streets, the hangings - that was not enough really to make them lose confidence in the head of ISIS. But the fact that children whose families belong to ISIS starved to death while leaders had food, that is what's making people very disappointed, very disillusioned, especially the women I've talked to.
MARTIN: Are there people who still support the caliphate despite all that they went through?
LEMMON: Absolutely there are. And in fact, one woman from Egypt I met has four daughters. She was talking about how all they want is to go home, to go back to Egypt, to go back to the parks, to go see relatives. And she said to me, you know, I don't believe in Baghdadi. But I still believe in the caliphate.
MARTIN: I did want to ask about your take on U.S. policy in northeast Syria because back in January, you wrote on your website that it's working. You said that the U.S. has helped defeat ISIS and prevent its resurgence, and it's done so not solely through direct military engagement, but by assisting a partner force. And I wanted to ask if you think that this assistance is sufficient to keep the threat of an ISIS resurgence in check.
LEMMON: It is sufficient as a foundation because what you see now is local folks holding local towns and working their best to keep them safe. But it is an international problem that requires international investment to help people have water and power and schools that run. And they merit our investment.
MARTIN: That was writer Gayle Tzemach Lemmon, who just returned from a reporting trip in Syria. Gayle, thanks so much for talking to us once again.
LEMMON: Pleasure to join you.

Binnington may be a rookie playing in his first Stanley Cup Final, but he has been taking part in a tradition that dates back decades.
Tom Pennington/Getty Images When the St. Louis Blues take the ice Monday, they may look a little green. This series against the Boston Bruins marks the first time the franchise has skated in a Stanley Cup Final since 1970. In other words, nearly two and a half decades before their rookie goaltender, Jordan Binnington , was even born.
At the same time, for all his youth, the team's 25-year-old netminder will be taking part in the same decades-old tradition as his veteran Bruin counterpart, Tuukka Rask . Both goalies will don masks drenched with vibrant color and baroque twists on their team icons. For Binnington, that means a hazy glimpse of St. Louis' Arch-adorned skyline ; for Rask, that means a snarling golden bear .
Both masks also represent something the uninitiated may not have expected to find on an ice surface: art, history — even high fashion, of a sort.
""I will tell you that it's a huge thing for a goalie to look good,"" says former goaltender Ron Tugnutt , who played for eight teams across his 16-year NHL career. ""A lot of children want to grow up to be goalies because they see these masks.""
Enlarge this image Ron Tugnutt, seen here playing for the Ottawa Senators in 1997, says he got the idea for a splash design a few years earlier while playing for the Montreal Canadiens, which was owned by the Molson family. For that reason the original idea was to mimic beer, but he continued to use the splash design (with new colors) for each of the teams he went on to play for. Robert Laberge/Getty Images hide caption

Robert Laberge/Getty Images Young hockey fans of the 1990s had little trouble recognizing Tugnutt's masks. For about a decade leading up to his retirement in 2004, his were splashed with team colors — a nod to the Molsons, the brewing dynasty that owned the Montreal Canadiens, the team he played for when Tugnutt got the idea. But he brought the design with him wherever he went, just swapping in new team colors each time and rendering his mask readily recognizable for hockey fans.
Plenty of other goalie masks — from Curtis Joseph's rabid dog (for Cujo , naturally) to Eddie Belfour's eagle — have also gotten the household name treatment. So many, in fact, that 325,000 people annually flock to the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto for an exhibit that displays historic goalie masks with an awed respect befitting precious artifacts.
While the focus remains trained on the players protected by these flashy blends of art and athletics, the cottage industry of artists that has grown up around their production gets little attention. By one hockey historian's estimation, about a dozen major artists work with goaltenders in the NHL and NWHL, and dozens more ply their trade at other levels, such as minor leagues and youth hockey.
And those artists often develop just as intimate a connection with the mask they've created as the player who wears it.

Bruce Bennett/Getty Images ""Any mask that I've done, there's a story behind it,"" says Frank Cipra , the artist who designed Tugnutt's distinctive headgear. ""There's a key element in the design that each player wanted that meant something to them. And it meant something to me that I could carry that on for them and make them happy and proud.""
These days he says he doesn't do masks for NHL players anymore — he prefers the slower pace of the lower levels — but in the early 1990s, not long after he got started, Cipra was one of just a handful of artists who designed just about every mask in the league. And that meant a whole lot of work.
""I was working, no kidding, 24/7. It was just insane. The orders were coming from all NHL teams, the American [Hockey] League, U.S. college teams, the Olympics,"" he recalls. ""It was just nonstop.""

Harry How/Getty Images This sudden increase in demand could be traced to a commensurate increase simply in the number of goalies, according to Jim Hynes , who with Gary Smith wrote a history of goalie masks called Saving Face .
After the early '90s NHL expansions , ""you have minor league teams, you have 26 NHL teams — two goalies per team. All kinds of work for mask painters,"" Hynes explains. ""So you have new guys popping up now, you have companies getting into the business of making masks. Some of them could be mass-produced to be sold to goalies of all levels and ages, and the pros were getting their masks custom-made.""
Some artists — including Cipra — had deals with major equipment manufacturers, while others operated independently. Eventually, an influx of new artists raced in to meet the demand. That includes David Gunnarsson , the Swedish designer responsible for"

Interview Highlights On the leftward shift in the Democratic Party
I don't think we're going to address climate change by guaranteeing every American a federal job, which is what part of the Green New Deal was. I don't think we're going to address the spiraling inflation in health care by forcibly telling 150 million people that we're going to take away their private insurance. These are what a lot of Americans look at as facets or aspects of socialism.
Politics Senate Blocks Green New Deal, But Climate Change Emerges As Key 2020 Issue On focusing on economic issues instead of social policies
Certainly we want to address income inequality. Right. Absolutely we want to make sure that women have a right to choose, that civil rights and social justice are addressed aggressively.
But we've also got to recognize to win in Ohio and Michigan and North Carolina and Wisconsin, we're going to have to get more to those kitchen table issues that have to do with somebody's job, or how many jobs they're having to work just to balance a household budget.
Election 2020: Opening Arguments Kirsten Gillibrand Says If Trump Wants A War With America's Women, 'He Will Lose' On the identity fight within the Democratic Party
One of the things I've always loved about the Democratic Party is that it is a big-tent party, and it embraces opportunity for all people. I'm running for president because I think my life experience can address this. This Trump-fueled national crisis of division has been moving us backward.
I look at my experience of bringing people together — businesses and nonprofits, and Republicans and Democrats — and to really get things done; to get to near-universal health care, to have the No. 1 economy in the country for three consecutive years, I think that record stands for itself. ... I think in some [ways] I'm the only person running who has actually accomplished what everyone else is talking about.

Amanda Matlovich/National Geographic Amanda Matlovich/National Geographic Dr. Nancy Jaax (Julianna Margulies) finds Dr. Peter Jahrling (Topher Grace) and shakes him awake to make sure he is OK during the Ebola investigation.
Amanda Matlovich/National Geographic The Hot Zone , a six-part National Geographic miniseries that premieres Monday night, is based on a true story about Ebola.
In 1989, a shipment of monkeys from the Philippines arrived at a private commercial lab in Reston, Va. The intention was to use the macaques for testing. Only many of them died.
The lab wrapped infected monkey cells in aluminum foil and shipped them in a box to the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), in Frederick, Md.
The eventual finding: The monkeys had Ebola – a strain that came to be known as Ebola-Reston and that is, as it turns out, the only known strain of the potentially fatal virus that is not thought to be lethal in humans.
Thomas Geisbert , then an intern at USAMRIID, was a member of the team investigating the virus. As a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas, he continues working with viruses like Ebola.
National Geographic is hedging about accuracy — it says the series was ""inspired"" by the 1989 events. And they are airing a documentary on Wednesday at 11 p.m. about the virus: ""Going Viral.""
Goats and Soda Ebola 101: The Facts Behind A Frightening Virus Nonetheless, at a time when Ebola is still in the headlines, with an ongoing outbreak in Congo, we wanted to assess how the miniseries tackles the virus. What does it get right? What does it get wrong? So we asked Geisbert to critique and fact-check.
Geisbert says he's sure the series ""may be entertaining for the general public, but it is quite flawed in terms of any historical accuracy and there are numerous scientific flaws.""
A few of the flaws:
No blisters. In the opening scenes, a man in an African town becomes ill and breaks out in multiple large blisters all over his face. A doctor ultimately diagnoses him with Marburg, a viral cousin to Ebola. But while Marburg and Ebola can cause a rash, they wouldn't cause marble-size blisters as the show portrays, says Geisbert.
Dr. Jaax didn't ID the virus. Nancy Jaax, a U.S. army veterinary pathologist (played by Emmy winner Julianna Margulies) is depicted as identifying the virus. In fact, Geisbert says humbly, he was the one who identified the strain along with Peter Jahrling , then a medical officer at USAMRIID and now chief of the Emerging Viral Pathogens Section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. (He's played by Topher Grace of That '70s Show fame.) While Geisbert is named in the book on which the TV show is based, he's not a character in the miniseries.
Culturing clash. ""Medically speaking Nancy is a veterinary pathologist not a virologist or microbiologist,"" says Geisbert. ""The whole sequence of events where she is trying to culture the virus is a joke. Pathologists don't do that — virologists do.""
Ebola-Reston can't make humans sick. In the miniseries, a worker at the monkey lab gets sick and is taken to the hospital, seemingly because of his exposure to infected monkeys. In fact, one lab worker did get sick but the issue was his diabetes, says Geisbert, who adds that workers exposed to the strain did develop antibodies to Ebola as a result.
Glove goof. Nancy Jaax is wearing protective gear as she works to identify the virus in the TV show. She comes in contact with Ebola-infected monkey blood despite wearing gloves – and the blood touches an open wound. She did in fact have a glove issue in another case but not when investigating Ebola-Reston, says Geisbert. What's more, in the TV series she is quickly given the all-clear but at that time, says Geisbert, she would have had to be quarantined for at least days and possibly weeks while awaiting test results if there had in fact been exposure to the virus.
Despite the inaccuracies he saw in the series, Geisbert says, ""I do think raising public awareness [of Ebola] is not a bad thing.""
And he was gratified by the positive depiction of USAMRIID. ""The miniseries does showcase people who devoted their lives to science,"" he says. ""You may not get much accurate science, but you may say, 'Wow, that's a cool thing to do when I grow up. And that's a good thing.""

Group Prenatal Visits Are Catching On : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Jenny Gold,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/27/725821730/a-growing-number-of-people-are-getting-pregnancy-care-in-groups,"Enlarge this image Reporter Jenny Gold and her husband, Alex Gourse, with their newborn son at Prentice Women's Hospital in Chicago two days after his birth.

Courtesy of Bella Baby Photography I had always imagined going through pregnancy surrounded by family and friends. But when I found out I was pregnant, my husband, Alex Gourse, and I had just moved from San Francisco to Chicago. I knew almost no one.
I ended up finding a community where I least expected it: at a medical office.
CenteringPregnancy is group prenatal care offered by more than 600 practices across the United States. Rather than the standard 15-minute individual visits in an exam room, women who are due around the same time and their partners meet as a group for two hours with a clinician, usually a midwife.
In other words, take one of the most intimate chapters in a couple's life and have the two experience it with a bunch of strangers.
I was wary. It seemed like a convenient way to cram more patients through the door and give them less attention. But when, at my first prenatal visit at Northwestern Medicine, midwife Carol Hirschfield told me that the practice happened to be launching its first CenteringPregnancy group, I figured it might be a good way to meet people.
That turned out to be the best decision we made during the pregnancy.
We met up in the early morning on Thursdays, often bleary-eyed from another night of bad pregnancy sleep. The moms each stopped first for a quick weight and blood pressure check, and then we all gathered in a classroom that had previously been an operating suite. Seven couples were in my group, though there can be 10 or more.

Jenny Gold for Kaiser Health News One by one, each couple slipped behind a curtain in a corner of the room for a brief medical exam with one of the two midwives who led the group. Our bellies were measured, the babies' heartbeats were checked and we had a moment to share any major symptoms.
Meanwhile, the rest of the group milled around the main part of the room, a bit awkwardly at first. If we'd been in a waiting room for standard appointments, we might not have given one another more than a nod. But here, munching on banana bread baked by the midwives, we quickly discovered how much the experience of pregnancy gave us in common. Soon we were chatting about the struggles of no longer being able to sleep on our backs, the best pregnancy pillow to buy and the importance of foot rubs from our partners.
After the exams, we gathered in a circle of chairs to talk about all the crazy things happening to our bodies. In the very first activity, the midwives handed out laminated cards with pregnancy symptoms written on them — things like swollen feet or food cravings. We were to go around and read our symptom and then share whether it was something we had experienced. The very first card to be shared: vaginal discharge. And, with a few giggles, the ice was broken.
Northwestern Medicine started offering CenteringPregnancy in April 2018. Years of studies have found that babies born to women who receive group prenatal care are less likely to be premature, be underweight or spend time in the intensive care unit. Jenny Gold for Kaiser Health News hide caption
toggle caption Jenny Gold for Kaiser Health News We met monthly at first and then more frequently as we got closer to our due dates. The curriculum was based on workbooks created by the Centering Healthcare Institute in Boston and was focused on topics like nutrition, relationships, labor and delivery, and newborn care. We often started with a breathing exercise or a short icebreaker, followed by prompts and games to encourage us to share the details of our experiences and fears and to teach us how to take care of ourselves and prepare for our new lives as parents.
It didn't take much to get us talking, laughing and commiserating. Sometimes it felt a lot like a support group, and that's part of the point. The goal of CenteringPregnancy is to provide medical care and to educate but also to reduce stress and isolation, which can contribute to poor birth outcomes.
Years of studies — many focusing on teen and low-income moms — have found that babies born to women in CenteringPregnancy groups are less likely to be premature, be underweight or spend time in the intensive care unit. A 2016 study of a South Carolina program, for example, found that participating in CenteringPregnancy reduced the risk of premature birth by 36%. And that saved money — an average of $22,667 for every premature birth prevented under Medicaid, the state's health insurance program for the poor. Typically, the patient's insurance company will not know they have been a part of a Centering group, which is billed as standard prenatal care.

Jenny Gold for Kaiser Health News The CenteringPregnancy program was started in 1993 in Connecticut by midwife Sharon Schindler Rising, who was frustrated that she had to rush through patients' exams. Over the past five years, the number of practices that offer Centering has nearly doubled to 600; midwives still lead most of the groups. About half are in community health centers that serve mainly low-income women, but private practices like Northwestern have also started programs.
""I've been out-of-my-mind excited with how this has gone,"" Hirschfield told me one day in her office. ""I end every group by saying, 'Oh my God, they're learning so much more than our — quote-unquote — regular patients.' ""
Hirschfield said she was surprised by how open people have been about their lives, sexual relationships and bodies. ""There just isn't time for that when you have 15 minutes every couple of weeks to just really listen to the heartbeat and take your blood pressure and ask how your back is feeling."" If participants had additional questions or concerns, we could schedule separate individual visits or reach out via email.
Ariel Yellin Derringer, the other midwife who led our group, told me that so far, ""the biggest positive outcome here is the growth of community — having people go through the most difficult transition in their life with other women going through the same thing.""
She said it also has been rewarding professionally. ""We do so much educating during one-on-one prenatal care, and sometimes I feel like a broken record,"" Derringer said. ""I think, 'I could have done this with eight to 10 people and taken it three levels deeper, but we just don't have the time to do that.' ""

Jenny Gold for Kaiser Health News The practice has now had a year's worth of experience with the program, and Derringer said it has been easy to recruit patients to participate. So far, most of the sessions have been full. ""My vision in the future is really an opt-out as opposed to an opt-in,"" she said.
I worried at first that I might miss one-on-one attention during group visits. What I found instead was the Chicago tribe I'd been seeking. I managed to make it to our group's final session on our first day after leaving the hospital. Our son was one of the three brand-new humans in attendance.
We all went around in a circle and shared what the experience had meant for us. ""You don't feel as alone or neurotic when you can talk about things and everyone else is going through the same thing,"" said Grace Tuman. She surprised herself by getting teary as she spoke. I felt the same way.
We moved back to California just two months later, but it didn't mean the end of our group. Instead, we went from a pregnancy crew to a parenting crew, commiserating over email about nighttime wakings and reminding each other to breathe in the midst of the chaos. In April, my family flew back to Chicago to attend a reunion during a snowstorm. Even the midwives showed up.
It's a long way to travel, but this little community, forged at a medical office, is one I'm hoping to be a part of for a long time to come.

Why Does Infants' Tylenol Cost 3 Times More Than Children's Tylenol? : Shots - Health News : NPR,www.npr.org,Selena Simmons-Duffin,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/27/726327937/tylenol-for-infants-and-children-is-the-same-why-does-1-cost-3-times-more,"Enlarge this image Infants' Tylenol comes with a dosing syringe, while Children's Tylenol has a plastic cup.

toggle caption Ryan Kellman/NPR Infants' Tylenol comes with a dosing syringe, while Children's Tylenol has a plastic cup. Both contain the same concentration of the active ingredient, acetaminophen.
Ryan Kellman/NPR If you've ever had a little one at home with a fever, you might have noticed two options for Tylenol at the store.
There's one for infants and one for children. They contain the same amount of medicine — 160 milligrams of acetaminophen per 5 milliliters of liquid — but the infant version costs three times more.
What gives? It turns out, there's a backstory.
For decades, Infants' Tylenol was stronger than the children's version . The thinking was that you don't want to give babies lots of liquid medicine to bring down a fever — so you can give them less if it's stronger.
""It was three times more concentrated,"" says Inma Hernandez of the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy. Since it contained more acetaminophen, the active ingredient, she says, it made sense that it was also more expensive. ""The price per milliliter was five times higher,"" Hernandez says.
But there was a problem: Parents were making mistakes with dosing. Babies got sick — some even died . So in 2011, at the urging of the Food and Drug Administration, the maker of brand-name Tylenol, Johnson & Johnson, announced a change : Infants' Tylenol would be the same concentration as Children's Tylenol.
Shots - Health News Giving Medicine To Young Children? Getting The Dose Right Is Tricky Now it's the same medicine, but the price is still different.
A quick search online shows 4 ounces of Children's Tylenol selling for $5.99, and Infants' Tylenol also selling for $5.99, but for only 1 ounce of medicine. With many store brands of acetaminophen, it's the same story: The infant version is generally three times more expensive than the one for children.
Kim Montagnino of Johnson & Johnson said in a statement to NPR that Infants' Tylenol is more expensive because the bottle is more sturdy and it includes a dosing syringe, instead of a plastic cup. ""These safety features of Infants' Tylenol (dosing syringe, rigid bottle) are more expensive to manufacture than the dosing cup and bottle for Children's Tylenol,"" Montagnino wrote.
Hernandez doesn't buy it.
""The cup versus the syringe doesn't really explain the price difference in my opinion,"" Hernandez says. ""They're really cheap because they're just plastic. When we think of what's expensive in a drug, it's actually the active ingredient, and the preparation of that active ingredient in the formulation, not the plastic cup or the syringe.""
But Johnson & Johnson's explanation makes sense to Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and founder of the website Consumer World . ""There's an extra thing in the box, and extra things usually cost money,"" he says.
""Think of a spray cleaner. You can buy the spray cleaner in the spray bottle, and that costs a little more money. Or you can buy the refill that gives you more ounces but it doesn't have the sprayer on top — it's kind of the same concept.""
But this, of course, is not a spray cleaner. It's medicine. And parents are sensitive to marketing because the stakes are so high.
""I would certainly imagine that product-makers know that parents want to be very cautious when buying products for their kids,"" Dworsky says. ""Really, the lesson is — read the label. See what you're getting for your money.""
Pediatrician Ankoor Shah at Children's National Health System in Washington, D.C., knows how confusing all of this is for parents because he gets tons of questions from them about over-the-counter medications.
""The packaging and the dosing is not easy, it's not simple and — personal opinion — it's not parent-friendly,"" Shah says.
For instance, Infants' Tylenol doesn't say on the label what the correct dosing is for a baby under age 2. It just says ""ask a doctor."" Shah says he still uses a calculator to figure out how much to give a child, based on their weight, and gives slips to parents at kids' well visits. You can also find the information from reputable sources online .
He says whether you opt for the Children's or Infants' bottle of acetaminophen at the store, the most important thing is to get the dosing right.
""When you start giving more acetaminophen than recommended, there are serious side effects that could happen,"" he says.
The bottom line is: Know what you need. And if you need to spend that extra couple of dollars for the syringe and the special bottle to get the dosing just right, maybe the markup is worth it."
High Voter Turnout For European Parliamentary Elections,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260672/high-voter-turnout-for-european-parliamentary-elections,"High Voter Turn Out For European Parliamentary Elections High Voter Turn Out For European Parliamentary Elections Embed Embed
Centrists in Europe have lost their majority. After Europe's parliamentary elections over the weekend, nationalist and far-right parties got a boost in their share of power.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Over the weekend, the European Union held parliamentary elections. And this morning, we're getting the results. Voter turnout was high, and it left the EU's traditional center splintered. OK. We're going to have two views from Europe this morning, starting in Rome with NPR's Sylvia Poggioli.
Hi, Sylvia.
SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Hi, Noel.
KING: So let's start with the 3,000-foot view of results across the European Union. Who gained and who lost?
POGGIOLI: Well, you know, the populists did well in some places, but there was no hard-right takeover of the EU Parliament. As you said, turnout was high - 51% compared to 43% five years ago. Many young pro-EU voters cast ballots for Greens Parties. They did very well in northern Europe.
The populists won enough to deprive the center-left and center-right parties of the parliamentary majority they held for 40 years. So the centrists will have to create a wider alliance with other parties, but they've ruled out a coalition with the hard-right. In the end, the populists will get only around 25% of Parliament's seats. Nevertheless, there were some big populist victories. Here's Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the victorious hard-right league.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian).
POGGIOLI: He said, ""not only is the League the top party in Italy, Marine Le Pen is the top party in France. Nigel Farage is the top party in the U.K."" So Italy, France, the U.K. - it's a sign of a Europe that's changing. In fact, Marine Le Pen's hard-right party came in ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron's party. That's seen as an embarrassment for the champion of a stronger EU. And Italy's League is now the biggest party in the EU Parliament, winning 34%.
KING: What is going on? What helped these far-right populist groups win so many seats this time around?
POGGIOLI: Anger at EU bureaucrats for failing to deal with the economic stagnation and high unemployment in southern Europe after the global financial crisis and security concerns after several terrorist attacks. But most of all, it's the huge migrant influx over the last several years. Populist parties whipped up fear and anxiety with slogans like, invasion, and the threat to Europe's Judeo-Christian values. One of the most outspoken populists on this issue is Hungary's autocratic Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose party scored more than 50% in the vote.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: We reject migration. And we would like to see leaders in position of European Unions who reject the migration, who would like to stop it and not to manage it.
KING: All right. So these far-right nationalist parties gained some seats in this election. What do they do with them now?
POGGIOLI: Well, they'll probably be more spoilers than promoters of radical change because they're divided on many issues. Italy's Salvini wants looser rules on budgetary discipline, but German and other northern European populists reject that. Salvini wants other EU states to take in many asylum-seekers who landed in Italy, but Hungary's Orban and other east Europeans say, no way.
And there's Russia. Salvini and Le Pen admire Vladimir Putin, while the ruling populist party in Poland and other east European parties are wary of Russia's aims. So populists won't be able to reshape the European Union in their image, but they could obstruct and seriously slow down the legislative process.
KING: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome.
Thanks, Sylvia.
POGGIOLI: Thank you, Noel.
KING: All right. Let's go over to the United Kingdom, where the new Brexit Party stormed to victory. Outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party suffered an historic defeat, and NPR's Frank Langfitt is traveling outside of London.
Hey, Frank.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, Noel.
KING: So we said that the Brexit Party did well. How well did they do exactly? And how did they pull this off?
LANGFITT: They did a fabulous job. They - most of the ballots are now counted, and they got over 30% of the vote. Remember, this is a party that hadn't been around - only been around for a number of weeks, really. The ruling Conservative's a completely different story. They're under 10%, ending up in fifth place. This is the worst showing by the Conservative Party since the 1830s. The other major party, Labour - they did badly as well. They ended up in third place.
And I think what's really going on here, Noel, is that neither of these major parties ever staked out a clear position on Brexit. We've had paralysis here for three years politically in the country. And this left space for the Brexit Party and, of course, Nigel Farage - he's a very charismatic leader of the party - to basically take this ground and scoop up lots and lots of voters who want to get out of the EU and, frankly, want to get out of it now.
KING: I mean, it doesn't change the fact that British politics broadly are still in chaos. What are...
LANGFITT: It is.
KING: ...The lessons from this vote?
LANGFITT: You know, I think the lessons here are voters want clarity. They want to know exactly what a party is going to do at this crucial moment in the country's history. And the parties that had clear positions on Brexit - like the Brexit Party - did very well.
What's interesting is that you're going to now see, I think, candidates for prime minister on the Tory side - they are going to be talking a lot more about the idea of a no-deal Brexit, of just walking away from the European Union, even though every economist you talk to - for the most part - says that's going to cause a lot of damage. But both parties, I think - what you've seen after, you know, years of fudging and kind of fumbling, they've got to stake out clear positions on this big issue.
KING: Well, going into this, we heard that this vote was seen as a proxy for a second referendum on Brexit. Given that the Brexit Party did so well, does that mean that Britons would vote to leave the EU again if they had the chance?
LANGFITT: No, not necessarily. And while I think the Brexit Party deserves a ton of credit for what they've done - they've only been around - they've been around for less than two months. So what we have is, three years on, still an incredibly polarized United Kingdom and no path forward. So even as we have these votes, you see just how people are so set against each other on this huge issue.
KING: NPR's Frank Langfitt outside of London.
Thanks, Frank.

Selective Service Registration Comes Under Fire Again,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260693/selective-service-registration-comes-under-fire-again,"Selective Service Registration Comes Under Fire Again Selective Service Registration Comes Under Fire Again Embed Embed
Despite the all-volunteer military, men in the U.S. still have to register for the draft when they turn 18. But the fairness of the system, and its very existence, are again being questioned.
NOEL KING, HOST:
There hasn't been a draft in this country since 1973. That year, with the Vietnam War winding down, conscription ended; the U.S. military became an all-volunteer force. But to this day, young men still have to register with the Selective Service. That obligation has been questioned in the past, and it's coming under fire again. NPR's David Welna has the story.
DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: American citizen or not, here legally or not, if you happen to be a young man, Selective Service Director Donald Benton has a message for you.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DONALD BENTON: If you're 18 years old and you're in this country, you need to register for the Selective Service.
WELNA: If you don't, you could be fined up to a quarter-million dollars, denied federal student loans, barred from federal jobs and, at least in theory, jailed.
EDWARD HASBROUCK: I'm one of the people who was actually prosecuted and imprisoned back in the 1980s for refusing to register.
WELNA: That's Edward Hasbrouck. He spent 4 1/2 months in prison. At the time, he was one of more than half a million draft-aged men who failed to register. Hasbrouck says the Justice Department chose his case and those of a few others for show trials.
HASBROUCK: Mine went to an extremely gung-ho former combat Marine lieutenant in Boston who was then-assistant U.S. attorney by the name of Robert Mueller. It was actually his first high-profile case.
WELNA: The Selective Service has been a political football. President Gerald Ford actually mothballed it in the mid-1970s. It was revived by another president, Jimmy Carter, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JIMMY CARTER: I have determined that the Selective Service System must now be revitalized.
WELNA: That same year, at the Republican convention that nominated him to challenge Carter, Ronald Reagan panned the draft sign-up.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RONALD REAGAN: I'll tell you where I stand - I do not favor a peacetime draft or registration.
WELNA: But as president, Reagan did a U-turn and embraced draft registration. Still, it's been more than three decades since the Justice Department last prosecuted a draft resister. I asked Director Benton if someone who failed to register today would face prosecution.
BENTON: I'm not sure. And I think if we're not in an active mobilization, they likely do not pursue it.
WELNA: A blue-ribbon congressional commission is now weighing whether the Selective Service is worth keeping at all. When Benton appeared before that panel last month in Washington, he called his $26 million a year operation a national insurance policy.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BENTON: It is the responsibility of the United States government to be prepared for the next unexpected emergency; the Selective Service is that preparation. We are ready now because of our active registration program.
WELNA: The Selective Service tells NPR more than 16 million men are registered for a possible draft; most did that by checking a box while getting driver's licenses or applying for student loans. At the hearing, other experts warned this list of potential draftees, whose addresses don't get updated, is hardly reliable. Bernie Rostker directed the Selective Service during the Carter administration.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BERNARD ROSTKER: The current system of registration is ineffective and, frankly, less than useless.
WELNA: Meanwhile, a federal judge ruled this year that because all jobs in the military are now open to women, male-only registration is unconstitutional, a ruling the Trump administration's appealing. What's more, the Army estimates just 2% of potential draftees are both fit and inclined to serve. James Stewart is the Assistant Defense Secretary for Manpower.
JAMES STEWART: I mean, ultimately, that's what we want in our force, is those individuals that believe in this nation and are willing to fight for it.
WELNA: Meanwhile, every young man still has to sign up for the long-defunct draft. Whether women should, too, or no one at all, the commission's to advise Congress early next year. David Welna, NPR News, Washington.

Legendary Bart Starr, who played for the Packers from 1956 to 1971, was the first quarterback to win five NFL championships. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
A list of the greatest football players ever might easily include Bart Starr. The Green Bay Packers quarterback died yesterday at age 85. The team said he had been in failing health since a stroke in 2014.
NOEL KING, HOST:
You can think of Starr as the Tom Brady of his time, or maybe Tom Brady is the Bart Starr of this time. He played from the 1950s to the 1970s, and his team won five titles, including the first two Super Bowls in 1967 and '68.
INSKEEP: His most famous victory was the NFL championship in 1967, which is known as The Ice Bowl. It was about 15 degrees below zero on New Year's Eve in Green Bay. The Packers were facing the Dallas Cowboys. And with seconds left...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TED MOORE: Here are the Packers. Third down, inches to go to pay dirt (ph), 17 to 14, Cowboys out in front. Packers trying for the go-ahead score. Starr begins the count, takes the snap. He's got the quarterback sneak, and he's in for the touchdown, and the Packers are out in front - 20 to 17.
INSKEEP: Quarterback sneak.
KING: Years later, Starr talked to ESPN about that moment.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BART STARR: Felt wonderful. It was just the greatest experience and feeling that you could imagine.
KING: After he retired from playing football, Starr went on to coach the Packers for several seasons.
INSKEEP: To this day, the NFL gives out the Bart Starr Award each year. Here's his wife Cherry explaining the award in - to the 2019 winner, Calais Campbell.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHERRY STARR: It's given to the NFL player who best exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community.
KING: In 2014, Starr was able to give the award to one of his football heirs, Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers. In a statement yesterday, the Packers said Starr, quote, ""epitomized class.""

Army Surprised By Answers To Its Question: How Has Serving Impacted You?,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260665/army-surprised-by-answers-to-its-question-how-has-serving-impacted-you,"As part of a Memorial Day tribute, the U.S. Army asked service members to tweet the answer to the question: How has serving impacted you? The answers Army officials got were not what they expected.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Today is Memorial Day - a day when we remember Americans who died at war. But when the U.S. Army sent out some tweets last week asking about the effects of military service, some veterans and their families sent a strong message about the sacrifices they have made and are still making. NPR's Quil Lawrence has that story.
QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: The U.S. Army's Twitter account is usually official announcements and public relations videos. Last week, it tweeted a short video of a private first class talking about the Army's impact on his life.
(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)
NATHAN SPENCER: To serve something greater than myself - Army's afforded me the opportunity to do just that; to give to others, to protect the ones I love and to better myself as a man and a warrior.
LAWRENCE: And then U.S. Army asked, how has serving impacted you? The replies - 10,000 of them - did not come from new, young soldiers like the one in the video. And they weren't good Army public relations. They came from veterans and their surviving family members going back to World War II. They described a complete catalog of suffering from military service and its ripple effects.
Many wrote about crippling post-traumatic stress disorder. They pointed out that suicide, which strikes veterans at a higher rate than civilians, is now easily outpacing combat casualties. People replied that they had been raped while in uniform and then kicked out of the Army. They replied about ruined marriages from long deployments and mental health issues treated with drugs and alcohol, deaths from Agent Orange years after service in Vietnam, problems with the Department of Veterans Affairs. And a very few mentioned that the Army gave them self-confidence and skills and lifelong friendships.
Two days into the torrent of responses, the U.S. Army replied with a thank-you, saying, as we honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice this weekend by remembering their service, we are also mindful of the fact that we have to take care of those who came back home with scars we can't see. And then it added the toll-free Veterans Crisis Line, which is 1-800-273-8255.

NPR's Rachel Martin talks to sprinter Allyson Felix, an Olympic champion, about her contract with Nike through pregnancy.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Sprinter Allyson Felix has nine Olympic medals, including six gold medals. And she's not done. Yet contract talks with Nike, her sponsor, are at an impasse.
ALLYSON FELIX: And to me, you know, it's no longer about money. It's just about one thing simply, and that's the protection around maternity.
INSKEEP: She spoke with Rachel Martin about what to expect when a world-class athlete is expecting. Here's how she says Nike reacted to her news.
FELIX: The words, you know - they were congratulatory. And then things just got more difficult with the negotiations. And that's kind of where we became at a standstill - when I did want to push for, you know, protection around maternity. And it was something, you know, that I felt necessary just for the future and just how I know things to be around the culture in pregnancy in track and field.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: When you say you want protections for maternity, what does that mean explicitly?
FELIX: To me, that means that you don't have to rush back after pregnancies. Typically, also, your contract is pretty much kind of frozen when you become pregnant. And then it's kind of like, OK. You know, your job will be here when you get back. But you aren't paid, you know, in the meantime. And so that's something that, you know, I feel like definitely needs to change.
MARTIN: And then you mentioned the culture in professional sports around maternity and around pregnancy. What has been the culture?
FELIX: This is not, you know, just a Nike issue. This is - for me, this is the industry. And it's - you know, it's bigger than just one company. But what I have seen happen and witness happen with friends is that you typically, you know, become pregnant, and you feel that you have to hide it. You know, there's this feeling of fear.
MARTIN: I mean, presumably, Nike and other corporations - the argument is if you're not running, then we don't pay you.
FELIX: Yeah. And I definitely understand that. But I think that it becomes bigger than that, you know? When your image is being used, when you've been marketed for years and years and, you know, when your name is still out there, I do think that you are still being used, and your story is out there. And then, many times, you are still doing appearances, and you're doing work on behalf of the company. And you are still training. You know, you're not going to miraculously get back on the track and be on your top form. So I've worked much harder than ever before to be able to be back and be at top form when I do step back on the track.
MARTIN: There are other women in this fight with you. We saw Alysia Montano and Kara Goucher share similar stories. What does it mean to have them alongside you?
FELIX: Well, to me, Alysia and Kara are really just heroes, you know, to speak up on this. I just applaud them for starting this conversation. It's a tough thing to do, you know - to step out and not really know how you're going to be, you know, accepted. And they bravely started this conversation.
And so I think, you know, when a few people start talking, we see that change happens. We've seen these companies step up and say that they are going to change their policy. They are going to change the way that they do things. And none of this would have happened if no one would have said anything. You know, this has been going on for a very, very long time. So I'm grateful for them for stepping forward and for being brave and for speaking on something that can be hard to talk about.
MARTIN: Allyson Felix is a track and field sprinter. She's the only female track and field athlete to ever win six Olympic gold medals.
Thank you so much for talking with us.
FELIX: My pleasure.
INSKEEP: Now, on Friday, after Allyson Felix told her story to Rachel, Nike sent a letter to its athletes. Nike agrees that its contract terms have created, quote, ""unintended and unnecessary implications for our female athletes who become pregnant."" The company says it's working to fix that. So we called back Allyson Felix to ask if she is satisfied.
FELIX: I think it starts to, but there's definitely more to be done. I would - I have not seen any language of what those actual terms are going to be. And so I look forward to see what that looks like. And then, also, there's a lot of other companies that we hope will step up as well, you know? And this is an industry-wide problem. And I think it's great that, you know, Nike is taking a step in the right direction. But, you know, we'd love to hear these other companies as well. It would be great, you know, if everyone could really just get on board.

The High Cost Of The Opioid Epidemic For Communities,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260651/the-high-cost-of-the-opioid-epidemic-for-communities,"State and local governments say the prescription opioid epidemic is costing them billions of dollars. They're suing big drug companies to recoup some of those costs.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The state of Oklahoma claimed another settlement with a drug company. Teva Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay the state $85 million. That's compensation for the company's role in the opioid crisis. Another company, Johnson & Johnson, has not settled, and a trial begins this week. This is all part of a sweeping trend. Hundreds of local and state governments across this country are suing pharmaceutical firms. North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann covers opioid litigation for NPR News.
Hi there, Brian.
BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.
INSKEEP: What are the costs that state and local governments are facing across this country that give them any standing to demand these big settlements?
MANN: Yeah. So what's really interesting here, Steve, is we've already seen more than 200,000 people die so far from prescription pain medication overdoses. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control. But there's still this big, expensive fight underway to keep opioid-dependent people alive. And I traveled to Summit County, Ohio, to learn more about how one community is responding. And I want to start with a guy named Richard Milhof. When the epidemic started, he saw it up close.
RICHARD MILHOF: A lot of my friends are passed way. They've overdosed and died.
MANN: I meet Milhof in the town jail and Barberton, a working-class town just outside Akron, Ohio. We actually talk through the bars of his cell. Police say they found him carrying a small amount of heroin, and they're holding him until he can see his caseworker. Milhof tells me a lot of people close to him got hooked on pain pills.
MILHOF: Almost every single friend that I had that I grew up with is dead because of it.
INSKEEP: Heroin used to be a painful but fairly manageable problem in Summit County. Then the number of prescriptions for opioid medications surged. Jerry Craig, who heads the county's main addiction treatment program, says drug companies created a vast, new hunger for opioids, snaring people who didn't know the risk.
JERRY CRAIG: I think they are as complicit in this as the dealers that are dealing it on the streets. And for that, I think that they should pay a price.
MANN: When the supply of prescription pain pills started drying up in 2016, Craig says desperate people turned to the black market. They bought heroin often laced with deadly fentanyl and carfentanil.
CRAIG: Three hundred and forty overdose deaths that year in Summit County alone - and our overdoses went from three a day to over 12 a day.
MANN: In this way, Summit County looks a lot like the rest of the country. The human cost has been enormous. But local officials around the U.S. say the epidemic also carries an actual dollar cost.
DONNA SKODA: We had no cash on hand. We had to start looking for grants.
MANN: Donna Skoda heads Summit County's public health department. She says everything had to change once the opioid crisis hit - more law enforcement, more rehab beds, needle exchange programs. She points to one aspect of the county's operations where the budget exploded - foster care.
SKODA: It's been the increase in the number of children they've had to take for safety reasons. I mean, it's just doubled. And then not to mention the children that have been orphaned - so it just complicates everything. But it has been devastating.
MANN: In this one Ohio county, taxpayers have spent nearly $70 million the last few years responding to the crisis. The cost of law enforcement alone rose more than 40%. But it's not just the county on the hook for this epidemic. In my three days on the ground in Summit County, I found city governments, schools, nonprofits, hospitals all scrambling to cope. Mike Hughes is a doctor at Barberton's hospital.
MIKE HUGHES: We knew that we needed to do something different.
MANN: They launched a pilot program last year, inviting anyone suffering from addiction to come to the emergency room. They started running ads on local television.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: They're open 24/7, 365. And when you need help, you can walk right in.
MANN: Hiring more nurses cost half a million dollars a year - money the hospital didn't have. Hughes says they didn't have any choice. People were dying, so they launched the program using donated money. A lot of the work in Summit County is still happening on a shoestring, through donations, volunteers and property-tax dollars.
INSKEEP: OK, so wow. Brian Mann, is this the kind of expense for which state and local governments want to be compensated?
MANN: That's exactly right, Steve. So Summit County alone - they told me that the price tag for this opioid epidemic there could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Multiply that times all the counties and cities around the U.S. struggling with this, and you'll get a sense for just how big the pressure is on drug companies as these lawsuits move forward.
INSKEEP: Now, we started with news that Teva Pharmaceuticals has settled with one state - the state of Oklahoma. What's Oklahoma do with that money?
MANN: Right. So $85 million - some of that will go to local governments, who need that cash to help pay for things like law enforcement and rehab programs. Experts say that could save lives. And I will say, Steve, this is beginning to look like a trend. More and more of these small and mid-sized drug companies are scrambling to get clear of these lawsuits through settlements. Again, the claims are that their marketing really got millions of Americans hooked. I do want to say it's important Teva denies any wrongdoing, despite this settlement. But Teva is still being sued by other local and state governments around the country.
INSKEEP: Wow - might face more pressure to settle elsewhere. But not everybody is settling everywhere. We should note that trial that is supposed to begin tomorrow, if I'm not mistaken, in Oklahoma also, against Johnson & Johnson - what's at stake?
MANN: Yeah, so Oklahoma's attorney general, Mike Hunter, is now focused on this one, big company. And this is where these lawsuits could get really interesting. If these huge companies with deep pockets, like Johnson & Johnson, are held liable for a sizable part of cleaning up the opioid epidemic, these payouts could jump very quickly. We've been talking about millions of dollars here, Steve. But this could jump into the billions, so people are watching Oklahoma closely this week. And they're going to be watching again when an even bigger test trial gets under way later in the year out in Ohio.
INSKEEP: This has got to be a challenge if you're a pharmaceutical company CEO because you can't just cut one check and settle one lawsuit. If you settle one, you have to anticipate more lawsuits all across the country.
MANN: That's right. And in some jurisdictions, people have been pushing for what's called a global settlement, similar to the tobacco settlements back in the 1990s, where it would sort of resolve all of this at once, get the industry out from under this and sort of, you know, mark a fresh beginning and also route billions of dollars to these communities that need this help desperately. But so far, that kind of big settlement just hasn't been reached.
INSKEEP: Brian, thanks.
MANN: Thank you, Steve.

Trump's Visit To Japan Is Overshadowed By Trade Tensions,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260644/trumps-visit-to-japan-is-overshadowed-by-trade-tensions,"Trump's Visit To Japan Is Overshadowed By Trade Tensions Trump's Visit To Japan Is Overshadowed By Trade Tensions Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
President Trump and his Japanese counterpart held a news conference Monday after the two met to talk about trade. Trump wants Japan to even out the trade imbalance with the U.S.
NOEL KING, HOST:
President Trump says he is not, quote, ""personally bothered"" by recent short-range missile tests that North Korea has been conducting. He said that this morning in a joint press conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The president is in Japan for a four-day state visit, and NPR's White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe is traveling with him.
Hi, Ayesha.
AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hello.
KING: All right, so President Trump says he is not personally bothered by these North Korean missile tests. What did Shinzo Abe, standing next to him, have to say about that?
RASCOE: Well, after Trump kind of downplayed North Korea's latest missile launches, Abe had this to say.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE: (Speaking Japanese).
RASCOE: So for those that don't speak Japanese, through a translator, we heard him call the test a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution. And he said it was regrettable that North Korea was taking these actions. So Trump and Abe say they're on the same page. And largely, they do seem to be. But there are some differences there.
KING: Trump also seemed to be making some promises today on the podium next to Abe. What was he offering? What was he saying he's going to do or the U.S. is going to do?
RASCOE: Well, over and over again, you had Trump talking about how he expects to make all these deals on national security or on trade with various countries. What you didn't hear was how he will actually make that happen. He said he expects an agreement with China. Here's more on that.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think some time in the future, China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal. And we look forward to that.
RASCOE: But he didn't say how those two countries will be able to come together. Talks have fallen apart, and the countries are now trading tariffs and retaliating against each other. He also says he wants a quick deal with Japan. He said there may be a big announcement on this in August, but he didn't say how the countries are going to kind of come together on the issue of car exports. Japan does not want tariffs, and Trump has said he's considering this. And he hasn't taken that option off the table.
KING: So this is interesting because Abe said today that Japan would be buying more than 130 F-35 - excuse me - more than 100 F-35 warplanes from the U.S. That is about trade, right? Explain what's going on there.
RASCOE: Well, it's about national security and building up the military, but it's also something that the Japanese can point to as helping to lower that trade deficit. These F-35s cost a lot of money, and it's a huge investment. And they can say, look. We're doing business with the U.S. We're not trying to take advantage of you on trade.
KING: This trip - the president's trip has gone on for the past several days. What has he been doing while he's been in Japan?
RASCOE: Well, this trip has really been all about kind of showing the close ties between Trump and Abe and Japan and the U.S., so there was some golf. And then there was also a sumo competition. There was the meeting with the new emperor. And so they have been really trying to show that the U.S. and Japan are united. And Abe's gone out of his way not to criticize Trump, even when it comes to North Korea, and, basically, really showered Trump with praise.
KING: Was there anything notable about the meeting with the new emperor? - anything interesting.
RASCOE: Well, it was interesting just to see President Trump and the first lady meet with the emperor. They shook hands. President Trump was standing on this kind of raised platform and listening to the national - U.S. national anthem and the Japanese national anthem. So, I mean, there was just a lot of ceremony that went on with this and a lot of - kind of historic.
KING: Pomp and circumstance - the president's going to be back in Japan at the end of June for the G20 summit. He's going to meet with world leaders there. He has a busy next month or so, doesn't he?
RASCOE: Yes, he's going to Europe next week - stopping in London, going to France. He may not get as warm a welcome, especially in London, where there were big protests the last time he was there.
KING: Yeah.
RASCOE: And at the end of June, Trump will be back in Japan for the G20.
KING: NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe.
Thanks so much, Ayesha.

"Sen. Cotton Keeps Politics Out Of His New Book, 'Sacred Duty'",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260637/sen-cotton-keeps-politics-out-of-his-new-book-sacred-duty,"NPR's Rachel Martin talks to Sen. Tom Cotton about his book: Sacred Duty: A Soldier's Tour at Arlington National Cemetery . Cotton served in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a platoon leader at Arlington.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Several times a day, members of the Army's Old Guard play ""Taps"" at Arlington National Cemetery at a funeral or at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
(SOUNDBITE OF BUGLE PLAYING)
KING: That lone bugle can signify both the end of the day and also a time to reflect. In the middle of all of the partisan fighting in this country, this Memorial Day, we're going to take a few moments to reflect with Tom Cotton. Cotton was a platoon leader in the Old Guard. He served at Arlington between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Tom Cotton is now a Republican U.S. senator, and he's written a book called ""Sacred Duty: A Soldier's Tour At Arlington National Cemetery."" His book has nothing to do with politics. He told Rachel Martin that it was important to keep politics out of it when talking about Arlington.
TOM COTTON: It holds a special place in the hearts of our fellow citizens, that it's a place of unity and reconciliation, which is a bit of an irony because Arlington had its start in the Civil War, you know, a time in which Americans raised swords against each other - so much so that the Department of the Army had to take an old plantation across the river and turn it into a graveyard for our war dead because all the cemeteries in Washington were filling up. And I think probably because it had that origin in the ashes of the Civil War, as I describe in ""Sacred Duty,"" that it has become an almost mythic place in the hearts of our fellow citizens.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Who are the people who serve in the Old Guard?
COTTON: It's a diverse group. It's men and women. It's young and old. Some of these are privates coming straight from basic training at age 18. They were - they were plucked out because they were tall and physically fit and had high test scores. And some of them are sergeant majors who have had six or seven deployments.
MARTIN: The precision is notable. You stand at attention. You don't move for 75 minutes sometimes. You're supposed to carry a sword till its tip is a certain distance from the ground. These are just a few examples. But what is the relationship between that kind of precision and honor?
COTTON: When a family comes into the cemetery, we want them to have that last perfect image of honor. And everything that an Old Guard soldier does - whether it's his level of physical fitness and, therefore, his image, the cleanliness and precision of his uniform, the way he marches, the way he and his fellow soldiers carry a casket or fire the three-round volley - it's all designed to ensure that the family is focused solely on their fallen hero and the military honors rendered to them.
MARTIN: This is very important work, clearly. It's very sober work. But can you describe something called fallouts?
COTTON: Yeah, so a fallout is when a soldier falls out of ceremony. We have what's called a supernumerary, which is Latin for one above the number. And he generally comes out with the formation and hides behind a nearby tree or bush. So he's there in case someone falls out. So for instance, I recall a very hot summer day in August of 2007 when I was standing in formation, and the last man in the first rank passed out standing up, fell like a tree that had been cut - just face planted, face forward.
MARTIN: Oh, no.
COTTON: Now, we're all trained for this. So he just laid there, and no one else moved. The assistant non-commissioned officer in charge came over and scooped him up underneath, by putting his hand under his ceremonial belt and dragged him off the field. And the supernumerary marches out in ceremonial form, picks up that soldier's rifle, stands back up and falls into formation.
MARTIN: Wow.
COTTON: So you still have a perfect formation. It's an example of the level of detail that the Old Guard takes our ceremonial and our funeral planning to...
MARTIN: Yeah.
COTTON: ...That even for those very rare contingencies, when a soldier can't make it through a formation, that we have a plan in place to ensure that the ceremony or the funeral ends exactly as it would have even if nothing had happened.
MARTIN: You served in the Old Guard between two deployments. The United States was engaged in two wars at the time. And you saw, visibly, the cemetery change as a result of the remains that were coming home.
COTTON: I did, unfortunately. And I can see that today. In fact, I performed a group burial in October of 2007 for the crew and passengers of Easy 40, a Black Hawk helicopter shot down just outside of Baghdad earlier that year. And there are photos that you can see of me and the other Old Guard soldiers performing that funeral. And behind us is the eastern half of Section 60, where those killed in action in the war on terror are buried. And it's almost entirely green field.
And today if you go to the cemetery, you'll see that Section 60 is almost entirely filled with new headstones - not all from Iraq and Afghanistan but the lion's share. And that's a toll that is a reminder of us of just the kind of sacrifice that our warriors and their families have to lay down on the altar of freedom to keep this country free.
MARTIN: The book is called ""Sacred Duty: A Soldier's Tour At Arlington National Cemetery."" It's written by Senator Tom Cotton.
Thank you so much for talking with us.
COTTON: Thank you.

They were last in the finals 49 years ago.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
St. Louis hockey fans have been waiting almost half a century for this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KENNY ALBERT: For the first time in 49 years, the St. Louis Blues are headed to the Stanley Cup Final.
(CHEERING)
INSKEEP: That's Kenny Albert on the call for NBCSN last week. If you didn't hear him over the deafening roar, he was saying the St. Louis Blues haven't been in the Stanley Cup finals in 49 years. And tonight they are back facing the team that knocked them out of the series back in 1970, the Boston Bruins.
NOEL KING, HOST:
The Blues have never won the Stanley Cup, but when that franchise was first born they seemed like they'd be the next sports dynasty.
DAN O'NEILL: It's funny. They went to the finals their first three years - '68, '69 and '70. And, you know, you just sort of thought that that was just going to be a regular thing.
KING: Dan O'Neill is a sports reporter in St. Louis and wrote the book ""When The Blues Go Marching In."" He says the team's hard luck has made it pretty hard to be a hockey fan in a baseball town like St. Louis.
O'NEILL: People have the impression that St. Louisans get up in the morning and play catch before they eat breakfast. The Cardinals have dominated the landscape here, and so the Blues have always sort of played second fiddle. Now that's changed. If you drive around St. Louis now and you flip around the radio stations, they're talking about the Blues. And that's really unusual.
INSKEEP: Yeah. Because most years over the past half-century, the Blues have not given fans very much hope. Earlier this year, they were in last place, but since then they've thrilled St. Louis with a turnaround.
O'NEILL: They don't have a bunch of high-scoring forwards or household names, but they've just been an incredibly resilient team that doesn't get down. So that's why I think they have a chance, and it should be a terrific series.
INSKEEP: The Blues play the Bruins tonight in Boston.

Political Fallout Escalates After SF Police Raid Journalist's Office,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260620/political-fallout-escalates-after-sf-police-raid-journalists-office,"The San Francisco Police Officers' Association is calling on the chief of police to resign for his handling of a raid on a reporter's home. The reporter had refused to disclose the name of his source.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Who should be held accountable after police in San Francisco raided a freelance journalist's home and office? They say they were looking for information on who leaked him a police report connected to the death of the city's public defender. First Amendment lawyers say the search violated California laws that protect journalists. Initially, many city officials stood by the raid or were silent. But as criticism increased, the police chief apologized, and now the union representing San Francisco police officers is calling on the chief to resign. From member station KQED, Sonja Hutson reports.
SONJA HUTSON, BYLINE: Two weeks after the raid on Bryan Carmody's home and office, police chief Bill Scott on Friday apologized and then criticized his own department's investigators for a, quote, ""lack of due diligence"" in seeking search warrants and in the way they dealt with Carmody as a journalist. But the police union says Scott shouldn't be blaming the investigators. Tony Montoya, president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, says Scott himself was involved in every step of the investigation.
TONY MONTOYA: For the chief to deny any knowledge or to not claim that he had as much knowledge as he has, to save his own skin, to me was just - is just unacceptable.
HUTSON: The case has been making headlines even before the raid. It began with the death of the city's beloved public defender Jeff Adachi in February. The next day, several news outlets ran stories with a leaked police report about the death. It revealed Adachi was at a friend's apartment with a woman who was not his wife and that officers found empty bottles of alcohol and marijuana gummies. The leak enraged city officials.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
HILLARY RONEN: To have that type of maligning going on of a public official in San Francisco is disgusting.
HUTSON: That's San Francisco supervisor Hillary Ronen speaking at a city hearing in April.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RONEN: We want a full investigation, and we want accountability.
HUTSON: A few weeks later, police showed up at freelance journalist Bryan Carmody's home with sledgehammers and a search warrant. He let them in.
BRYAN CARMODY: Their guns were out as they searched my property. They handcuffed me right away, and I was in handcuffs for the next six to seven hours.
HUTSON: Police took cameras, computers and cellphones - everything Carmody needs to operate his business. While First Amendment advocates were quick to condemn the raid, city officials known to be very liberal were not. Here's Mayor London Breed a few days after the raid.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LONDON BREED: Our role is to, you know, follow the law. And the judges ultimately make the decisions. And so at this point, you know, I support their decision.
HUTSON: Five days after the raid, supervisor Hillary Ronen became the first public leader to criticize it.
RONEN: I'm just surprised that it wasn't obvious from the get-go to more people. It tested our city's values and commitment to free press.
HUTSON: Then Mayor Breed reversed course, writing in a tweet, I am not OK with police raids on reporters. More elected officials quickly followed Breed in criticizing the raid, all the way up to Senator Kamala Harris. Now, at Breed's request, an outside agency will take over the criminal investigation of the leaked report. Police say Carmody is suspected of being a possible co-conspirator in the leak rather than being a passive recipient of the documents. And there are three outstanding court motions in the case, including one to unseal the application for the search warrants, which could shed light on why they were approved by judges in the first place.

It appears populists and nationalists are gaining more seats in Europe's Parliament. And, Teva Pharmaceuticals agrees to settle Oklahoma opioid case.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
President Trump's disagreement with Japan's prime minister demonstrates his personal brand of diplomacy.
NOEL KING, HOST:
That's right. The president has been visiting Tokyo. He met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Their summit came after North Korea tested missiles. Now, Japan and key figures in the Trump administration say that testing violates U.N. resolutions, but President Trump says he's not bothered by it.
INSKEEP: One of many things heard by NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe, who is traveling with the president - is currently in Japan. Hi there, Ayesha.
AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hello.
INSKEEP: So we should mention, the news conference at which the president made that remark next to Shinzo Abe came after a lengthy meeting. What came out of it?
RASCOE: So really, this trip overall was about showing how close the U.S. and Japan are, how close Trump and Abe are. And that was on display here at the press conference. Abe, in particular, was very complimentary of Trump. He repeatedly said how he wanted to praise Trump for taking a new approach with North Korea. He even said that Trump was responsible for cracking Kim Jong Un's shell of distrust. But, as you mentioned, there were some divisions there. Trump downplayed North Korea's latest missile launches. And Abe had this to say.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE: (Speaking Japanese).
INSKEEP: I guess we should do a little translation here...
RASCOE: For those that don't speak...
INSKEEP: Yeah. Go ahead, please.
RASCOE: Yeah. For those that don't speak Japanese, he called the test a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution. And he said it was regrettable that this happened. So even though the countries are saying they're on the same page - and, largely, they do seem to be - there are some differences there.
INSKEEP: What else was the president saying as he stood next to the Japanese prime minister?
RASCOE: Well, over and over again, Trump was talking about how he expects to make all these deals on national security or on trade with various countries. What you didn't hear was how he will actually make it happen. He said he expects an agreement with China. Here's more on that.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think sometime in the future, China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal. And we look forward to that.
RASCOE: But he didn't say how those two countries will be able to come together. Talks have really fallen apart. The countries are now trading tariffs and retaliating against each other. He's also talking about a quick deal with Japan and said there may be a big announcement on this by August.
But he didn't say how those countries are going to come together on the issue of car imports. Japan does not want tariffs. And Trump has said that he's looking at that. He's considering it, and he hasn't taken that off the table.
INSKEEP: Let me ask about one thing that was said there about China, Ayesha. Is this correct? The president also said China wants to make a deal. They're ready to make a deal with us, the United States, but we're not ready to make a deal. Did he say, again, he's comfortable just having higher and higher tariffs against China?
RASCOE: That was much of what he was saying. Obviously, he continues to state inaccurately that China is paying all the tariffs. It is importers who are paying - U.S. importers who are paying the tariffs. But he basically is now kind of saying that China wishes they would have made the deal; they're kind of suffering. And we - and now we're not ready to make a deal. They have to kind of come to us, basically - or come to the U.S. to make the deal.
INSKEEP: But the U.S. is selling a bunch of F-35 fighter planes to Japan.
RASCOE: Yeah. So this is a product of Japan's efforts, obviously, to build up their military, but also to win over some favor from the U.S. and lower that trade deficit which Trump is so concerned about. So this is a way - these F-35s are not cheap. And so they cost a lot of money.
INSKEEP: OK. Ayesha, thanks so much.
RASCOE: Thank you.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
INSKEEP: OK, huge election result here - centrists in Europe have lost their majority.
KING: That's right. Over the weekend, the European Union held parliamentary elections. Nationalist and far-right parties gained seats, but they did not win in a landslide that a lot of people had predicted. Liberals and Green parties also did very well. And it's notable that this was the highest turnout for European elections in 25 years.
INSKEEP: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli has been following the elections from Rome. Hi there, Sylvia.
SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.
INSKEEP: What do you make of all this?
POGGIOLI: Well, the bottom line is, as you said, the populists did well in some countries. But those fearful forecasts of a hard-right victory across the EU did not pan out. One reason seems to be a very high turnout - overall, something like 51% compared to 43% five years ago. And that's apparently thanks to young, pro-EU voters who cast ballots for Greens. Those parties scored very well in Northern Europe.
The populists did succeed in depriving the center-left and center-right parties of the majority they held for 40 years in the European Parliament. They've gained 5% from the last EU elections. But populists are expected to get only around 25% of Parliament seats. Nevertheless, there were some standout populist victories.
Here's the victorious Matteo Salvini, Italian deputy prime minister and leader of the hard-right League.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian).
POGGIOLI: So, clutching a rosary, Salvini said, ""not only is the League the top party in Italy. Marine Le Pen is the top party in France. Nigel Farage is the top party in the U.K. So Italy, France, the U.K. - it's a sign of Europe that's changing."" And, you know, Marine Le Pen's hard-right party came in ahead of the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, the champion of a stronger EU. And the League, here in Italy, scored 34%, and that makes it the biggest party in the EU Parliament.
INSKEEP: Well, what is driving the far-right in multiple countries to gain?
POGGIOLI: Well, you know, EU bureaucrats have been accused of dealing very poorly with many recent issues. There was the economic stagnation following the global financial crisis, very high unemployment rates, especially among the young in Southern Europe, mass-casualty terrorist attacks that raised concerns over lack of security - but of course, most of all, the refugee crisis that led to an influx of unprecedented numbers of migrants in Europe.
Populists have fueled fears and anxiety over what they call an invasion. Here's the autocratic prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, whose party scored more than 50% in the EU vote.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: We reject migration. And we would like to see leaders in position of European Unions who reject the migration, who would like to stop it and not to manage it.
INSKEEP: OK. Sylvia, from that one quote, we can figure out what far-right means in Hungary. But does it mean the same in all European countries? What do they all stand for?
POGGIOLI: No. There's a - you know, they're not united on all issues. For example, Italy's Salvini wants much looser rules on budgetary discipline. That's rejected by German and other North European populists. Salvini also wants other member states to take in many of the refugees that are in Italy. Hungary's Orban and other East Europeans rule that out. So they won't be able - the populists won't be able to reshape the European Union in their image, but they could seriously obstruct and slow down the whole legislative process.
INSKEEP: Sylvia, thanks for your insights.
POGGIOLI: Thank you, Steve.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome.

INSKEEP: In this country, the state of Oklahoma has settled with a second pharmaceutical company for its role in the opioid crisis. Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals will be paying the state $85 million. That follows an earlier settlement with Purdue Pharma, the makers of the painkiller OxyContin, for $270 million.
KING: Yeah, this case against Teva isn't unusual. It's one of hundreds happening across the country. Local and state governments are suing the drug industry. They say the companies marketed and incentivized the sale of opioids, and that contributed to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths across the country. In the state of Oklahoma alone, thousands of people have died.
INSKEEP: We're joined now by Brian Mann of North Country Public Radio, who covers opioid litigation for NPR - which, Brian, I guess, gives you a lot to do.
BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yeah, there's a lot these days.
INSKEEP: And good morning. How important is this latest settlement?
MANN: Well, there's a big practical side to this, Steve. Local governments in Oklahoma will now get some cash to help pay for things like law enforcement and rehab programs that could save lives. But this is also part of a growing trend, with drug companies around the U.S. trying to get out from under this legal and public-relations cloud. They're accused of getting millions of Americans hooked on opioid medications through the use of this aggressive and misleading marketing. And that's just been a huge burden on the entire industry.
INSKEEP: Now, the news here is out of Oklahoma. But we should note there are many governments - state and local governments - in many states who are suing pharmaceutical companies. And I gather you've been travelling around talking with people in some of the areas that are suing.
MANN: That's right. I traveled out to Summit County, Ohio, to see how that local community is dealing with this and the costs. And I spoke to Richard Milhof. He's struggled with addiction himself. And says a lot of his neighbors got hooked on these prescription opioid medications.
RICHARD MILHOF: A lot my friends are passed away. They've overdosed and died...
MANN: I'm very sorry. I hope...
MILHOF: Almost every single friend that I had, that I grew up with, is dead because of it.
INSKEEP: Wow. One sense of the human cost. And then there's the dollar cost in government after government after government.
MANN: That's right. This heavy burden is falling on local governments around the country. They're paying for everything from law enforcement to, you know, needle exchange programs. I spoke with Donna Skoda, who heads Summit County's public health department. And she told me about kind of a surprising aspect of this, Steve. The county's budget exploded because of the need for new foster care.
DONNA SKODA: The increase in the number of children they've had to take for safety reasons, I mean, it's just doubled - and then not to mention the children that have been orphaned. So it just complicates everything. But it has been devastating.
MANN: In this one Ohio county, taxpayers have spent nearly $70 million the last few years responding to this crisis. Local officials across the U.S. say this is the kind of financial burden that Big Pharma should pay for.
INSKEEP: Brian, I think your reporting is suggesting to us why it might be that not all pharmaceutical companies have settled their lawsuits - because they might face lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit in city after city and state after state, right?
MANN: That's exactly right. And of course, back in Oklahoma there is still a suit there against Johnson & Johnson, one of the nation's biggest corporations, the biggest drug maker. They've denied any wrongdoing. But, you know, if big firms like this are found liable for cleaning up the opioid mess, the payouts could grow fast from the millions of dollars into the billions. So this is going to be watched very closely.
INSKEEP: Brian, thanks so much.
MANN: Thank you, Steve.

The group that maintains the tank admits a mistake. They tried to repaint it traditional olive drab. The colors seemed wrong when they started, but they thought it would dry differently. Writing to the Bluefield Daily Telegraph, the group said at least the yellow tank complements their red faces.

Selective Service Registration Comes Under Fire Again,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260693/selective-service-registration-comes-under-fire-again?station=KXJZ_FM,"Despite the all-volunteer military, men in the U.S. still have to register for the draft when they turn 18. But the fairness of the system, and its very existence, are again being questioned.
NOEL KING, HOST:
There hasn't been a draft in this country since 1973. That year, with the Vietnam War winding down, conscription ended; the U.S. military became an all-volunteer force. But to this day, young men still have to register with the Selective Service. That obligation has been questioned in the past, and it's coming under fire again. NPR's David Welna has the story.
DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: American citizen or not, here legally or not, if you happen to be a young man, Selective Service Director Donald Benton has a message for you.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DONALD BENTON: If you're 18 years old and you're in this country, you need to register for the Selective Service.
WELNA: If you don't, you could be fined up to a quarter-million dollars, denied federal student loans, barred from federal jobs and, at least in theory, jailed.
EDWARD HASBROUCK: I'm one of the people who was actually prosecuted and imprisoned back in the 1980s for refusing to register.
WELNA: That's Edward Hasbrouck. He spent 4 1/2 months in prison. At the time, he was one of more than half a million draft-aged men who failed to register. Hasbrouck says the Justice Department chose his case and those of a few others for show trials.
HASBROUCK: Mine went to an extremely gung-ho former combat Marine lieutenant in Boston who was then-assistant U.S. attorney by the name of Robert Mueller. It was actually his first high-profile case.
WELNA: The Selective Service has been a political football. President Gerald Ford actually mothballed it in the mid-1970s. It was revived by another president, Jimmy Carter, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JIMMY CARTER: I have determined that the Selective Service System must now be revitalized.
WELNA: That same year, at the Republican convention that nominated him to challenge Carter, Ronald Reagan panned the draft sign-up.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RONALD REAGAN: I'll tell you where I stand - I do not favor a peacetime draft or registration.
WELNA: But as president, Reagan did a U-turn and embraced draft registration. Still, it's been more than three decades since the Justice Department last prosecuted a draft resister. I asked Director Benton if someone who failed to register today would face prosecution.
BENTON: I'm not sure. And I think if we're not in an active mobilization, they likely do not pursue it.
WELNA: A blue-ribbon congressional commission is now weighing whether the Selective Service is worth keeping at all. When Benton appeared before that panel last month in Washington, he called his $26 million a year operation a national insurance policy.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BENTON: It is the responsibility of the United States government to be prepared for the next unexpected emergency; the Selective Service is that preparation. We are ready now because of our active registration program.
WELNA: The Selective Service tells NPR more than 16 million men are registered for a possible draft; most did that by checking a box while getting driver's licenses or applying for student loans. At the hearing, other experts warned this list of potential draftees, whose addresses don't get updated, is hardly reliable. Bernie Rostker directed the Selective Service during the Carter administration.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BERNARD ROSTKER: The current system of registration is ineffective and, frankly, less than useless.
WELNA: Meanwhile, a federal judge ruled this year that because all jobs in the military are now open to women, male-only registration is unconstitutional, a ruling the Trump administration's appealing. What's more, the Army estimates just 2% of potential draftees are both fit and inclined to serve. James Stewart is the Assistant Defense Secretary for Manpower.
JAMES STEWART: I mean, ultimately, that's what we want in our force, is those individuals that believe in this nation and are willing to fight for it.
WELNA: Meanwhile, every young man still has to sign up for the long-defunct draft. Whether women should, too, or no one at all, the commission's to advise Congress early next year. David Welna, NPR News, Washington.

Army Surprised By Answers To Its Question: How Has Serving Impacted You?,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260665/army-surprised-by-answers-to-its-question-how-has-serving-impacted-you?station=KXJZ_FM,"As part of a Memorial Day tribute, the U.S. Army asked service members to tweet the answer to the question: How has serving impacted you? The answers Army officials got were not what they expected.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Today is Memorial Day - a day when we remember Americans who died at war. But when the U.S. Army sent out some tweets last week asking about the effects of military service, some veterans and their families sent a strong message about the sacrifices they have made and are still making. NPR's Quil Lawrence has that story.
QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: The U.S. Army's Twitter account is usually official announcements and public relations videos. Last week, it tweeted a short video of a private first class talking about the Army's impact on his life.
(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)
NATHAN SPENCER: To serve something greater than myself - Army's afforded me the opportunity to do just that; to give to others, to protect the ones I love and to better myself as a man and a warrior.
LAWRENCE: And then U.S. Army asked, how has serving impacted you? The replies - 10,000 of them - did not come from new, young soldiers like the one in the video. And they weren't good Army public relations. They came from veterans and their surviving family members going back to World War II. They described a complete catalog of suffering from military service and its ripple effects.
Many wrote about crippling post-traumatic stress disorder. They pointed out that suicide, which strikes veterans at a higher rate than civilians, is now easily outpacing combat casualties. People replied that they had been raped while in uniform and then kicked out of the Army. They replied about ruined marriages from long deployments and mental health issues treated with drugs and alcohol, deaths from Agent Orange years after service in Vietnam, problems with the Department of Veterans Affairs. And a very few mentioned that the Army gave them self-confidence and skills and lifelong friendships.
Two days into the torrent of responses, the U.S. Army replied with a thank-you, saying, as we honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice this weekend by remembering their service, we are also mindful of the fact that we have to take care of those who came back home with scars we can't see. And then it added the toll-free Veterans Crisis Line, which is 1-800-273-8255.

Political Fallout Escalates After SF Police Raid Journalist's Office,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260620/political-fallout-escalates-after-sf-police-raid-journalists-office?station=KXJZ_FM,"The San Francisco Police Officers' Association is calling on the chief of police to resign for his handling of a raid on a reporter's home. The reporter had refused to disclose the name of his source.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Who should be held accountable after police in San Francisco raided a freelance journalist's home and office? They say they were looking for information on who leaked him a police report connected to the death of the city's public defender. First Amendment lawyers say the search violated California laws that protect journalists. Initially, many city officials stood by the raid or were silent. But as criticism increased, the police chief apologized, and now the union representing San Francisco police officers is calling on the chief to resign. From member station KQED, Sonja Hutson reports.
SONJA HUTSON, BYLINE: Two weeks after the raid on Bryan Carmody's home and office, police chief Bill Scott on Friday apologized and then criticized his own department's investigators for a, quote, ""lack of due diligence"" in seeking search warrants and in the way they dealt with Carmody as a journalist. But the police union says Scott shouldn't be blaming the investigators. Tony Montoya, president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, says Scott himself was involved in every step of the investigation.
TONY MONTOYA: For the chief to deny any knowledge or to not claim that he had as much knowledge as he has, to save his own skin, to me was just - is just unacceptable.
HUTSON: The case has been making headlines even before the raid. It began with the death of the city's beloved public defender Jeff Adachi in February. The next day, several news outlets ran stories with a leaked police report about the death. It revealed Adachi was at a friend's apartment with a woman who was not his wife and that officers found empty bottles of alcohol and marijuana gummies. The leak enraged city officials.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
HILLARY RONEN: To have that type of maligning going on of a public official in San Francisco is disgusting.
HUTSON: That's San Francisco supervisor Hillary Ronen speaking at a city hearing in April.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
RONEN: We want a full investigation, and we want accountability.
HUTSON: A few weeks later, police showed up at freelance journalist Bryan Carmody's home with sledgehammers and a search warrant. He let them in.
BRYAN CARMODY: Their guns were out as they searched my property. They handcuffed me right away, and I was in handcuffs for the next six to seven hours.
HUTSON: Police took cameras, computers and cellphones - everything Carmody needs to operate his business. While First Amendment advocates were quick to condemn the raid, city officials known to be very liberal were not. Here's Mayor London Breed a few days after the raid.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LONDON BREED: Our role is to, you know, follow the law. And the judges ultimately make the decisions. And so at this point, you know, I support their decision.
HUTSON: Five days after the raid, supervisor Hillary Ronen became the first public leader to criticize it.
RONEN: I'm just surprised that it wasn't obvious from the get-go to more people. It tested our city's values and commitment to free press.
HUTSON: Then Mayor Breed reversed course, writing in a tweet, I am not OK with police raids on reporters. More elected officials quickly followed Breed in criticizing the raid, all the way up to Senator Kamala Harris. Now, at Breed's request, an outside agency will take over the criminal investigation of the leaked report. Police say Carmody is suspected of being a possible co-conspirator in the leak rather than being a passive recipient of the documents. And there are three outstanding court motions in the case, including one to unseal the application for the search warrants, which could shed light on why they were approved by judges in the first place.

Steve Inskeep talks to former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who discusses the EU parliamentary elections that concluded Sunday. Bildt is now co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
How do Europe's election results look to a politician in the center? The European Parliament elections did not go well at all for traditional parties of the center-right and center-left. Populist parties gained. Far-right parties gained. Euroskeptic parties gained. More Liberal and Green parties also gained. Our next guest once led a center-right party in Sweden. In the 1990s, Carl Bildt was Sweden's prime minister and led his country into the European Union. He's now on Skype from Stockholm. Welcome to the program, sir.
CARL BILDT: Thank you.
INSKEEP: How do you read the election results?
BILDT: Well, what happened was not really what a lot of people were fearing, that there would be a surge of the far-right populists. I mean, they did fairly moderately increase, if you look at the overall figures - Italy being the disturbing example, where they did extremely well. Deputy Prime Minister Salvini otherwise didn't do particularly well.
So the big increases are really the Liberals and the Greens. And that means that is really shifting alliances in the center. As you pointed out the, center-right EPP lost somewhat. The Social Democrat lost somewhat. But that was sort of compensated by the Greens and the Liberals, while the extremes didn't do that well.
INSKEEP: I guess we should just explain for Americans who maybe don't follow this every day.
BILDT: Yeah.
INSKEEP: I'm looking at a chart of European Parliament seats. There are multiple parties, which I guess are actually party coalitions, since you have various parties with various names in various countries. And they have coalitions at the European Parliament level. The center-right and center-left are still there. They're still pretty big. But you do note the gain among the Greens.
But also there is this populist gain. I'm even thinking, particularly, of the United Kingdom, where there's this brand new Brexit Party that got more votes than any party, even as, as you note, the Greens did really well. And other parties that favor staying in the European Union went fairly well. I'm trying to find one unified message from all of that.
BILDT: Yeah. And I don't think you should look at the U.K. because that's a rather special case.
INSKEEP: OK.
BILDT: Because there's a sort of meltdown going on there. But as you pointed out, the Brexit Party became the biggest party. But they really only replaced the U.K. party that was there before. Farage was very strong in the 2015 or 2014 European elections as well. But overall, if you look at the trends, if you can see, as you say, this was 28 national elections, the populist right did extremely well in Italy, Salvini - didn't do well at all in Germany, lost their seats in the Netherlands. Marine Le Pen, that's sort of the far-right party in France...
INSKEEP: Right.
BILDT: ...Came on top of President Macron but did less well than five years ago. So it's difficult to see that as sort of surge in the support for her.
INSKEEP: OK.
BILDT: Really, sort of the Greens and the Liberals were the winners of the day, somewhat as a surprise - has to be said. And then another result that should be noted is the fairly significant increase in turnout - not in every country, but in most of the countries, significant increase in interest in these elections, which I think is a healthy sign.
INSKEEP: Is the danger that the European Union is seen as being in actually what's driving that higher turnout?
BILDT: Well, I think that, first, there has been a more interesting debate in a number of countries. Secondly, I think there's an increasing awareness of - that we live in a - we live in a world of Brexit, of Trump, of Putin, of China. And it is more important for Europeans to stay together and see what we can do together. That - that reluctant recognition, I think, has been one of the themes that have been there, in the debate, in virtually every country.
INSKEEP: So you are pushing, in a way - or not pushing. But you're - you're advocating a different view of these elections than some might see. Despite some gains from the populists, it sounds like you - you perceive some bedrock support for the idea of a united Europe.
BILDT: Yeah. I mean, there was an increase by the - by the far-right - but, I mean, fairly marginal (ph) and far less than most people had predicted or most people had feared. And there was a bigger gain for the Greens and the Liberals than people had anticipated. The decline for the main parties, the EPP, center-right main party and the Social Democratic Party, was broadly foreseen.
INSKEEP: When you mentioned the various threats that Europeans may feel that they face, you mentioned Vladimir Putin of Russia. Of course, there was a huge controversy over Russian interference in the U.S. election in 2016. There has been some investigation of Russian involvement in the Brexit debate in the U.K. Was Russia perceived as some kind of player in these elections?
BILDT: As some kind of player, most probably. But that's hardly news. I mean, the Russians have been active with propaganda and with political means to try to influence European countries forever. It normally backfires. There was, of course, the scandal in Austria - you might have noted that - where it was disclosed that they had been - or the far-right party have been trying to - believing that they went into some sort of agreement with Russia in selling out Austrian interests. That has collapsed the Austrian government and led, of course, to significant loss for that particular party.
INSKEEP: So when you look at this mix of seats and party groups in the European Parliament, do you see a parliament that can function and move forward on any particular agenda?
BILDT: I think it's going to be a more complicated parliament than before because in this - the still-sitting Parliament, you had the EPP, center-right and the center-left, grouping together, had a majority. And they often agreed on things. They no longer have that majority. And they will have to go into coalition agreements on different issues with, primarily, the Liberals, I would say - guess - and to some extent, the Greens - hardly with the far-right. So it's going to be a somewhat more complicated parliamentary work ahead, during the next five years. And then, of course - then of course, it's all done in a co-decision procedure, with the 27 or 28 governments.
INSKEEP: Going to be complicated.
Mr. Bildt, thanks so much.
BILDT: Thanks.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. An old Army tank was not painted for camouflage. Residents were surprised when the tank in a Bluefield, W.Va., park was painted bright lemon lime. The group that maintains the tank admits a mistake. They tried to repaint it traditional olive drab. The colors seemed wrong when they started, but they thought it would dry differently. Writing to the Bluefield Daily Telegraph, the group said at least the yellow tank complements their red faces.

"In Trump's Japan Visit, Golf, Sumo Wrestling — And A Raft Of Policy Differences : NPR",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727280758/in-trumps-japan-visit-golf-sumo-wrestling-and-a-raft-of-policy-differences,"In Trump's Japan Visit, Golf, Sumo Wrestling — And A Raft Of Policy Differences Facebook

The optics and the rhetoric of President Trump's state visit to Japan aimed to show two allies at their closest in history, at the start of a new Japanese emperor's reign. Trump is the first state guest to visit since Emperor Naruhito ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1. On Sunday, he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shared a round of golf, attended a sumo wrestling match and had a barbecue dinner.
But on Monday, a joint press conference with the two leaders revealed the two countries struggling to manage differences over a raft of policy issues — in particular, bilateral trade, North Korea and Iran.

One of Japan's top concerns is that the U.S. is threatening tariffs on Japanese car exports to the U.S. if a deal is not reached in six months. Those exports are a mainstay of the Japanese economy, and Tokyo is unnerved to hear that its chief ally classifies Japan's trade surplus as a security threat.
""When I talk about a security threat, I talk about a balance sheet,"" Trump said at Monday's press conference at the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo.
In its defense, Japan points out that it produces more cars in the U.S. than it exports there, and that investment has surged under the Trump administration, creating tens of thousands of U.S. jobs.
President Trump acknowledged that Japan has lowered its trade surplus, with plans to purchase more than 100 U.S. F-35 warplanes, more than any other ally.
Trump is expected to highlight that purchase on Tuesday, when he plans to visit the port of Yokosuka, home to both U.S. and Japanese warships. Japan's legislature has approved plans to convert helicopter carriers to accommodate F-35s, giving it its first aircraft carriers since World War II.

Trump suggested that any trade deal would have to wait until after Japan's parliamentary elections in July. Washington has its hands full with an ongoing trade war with China, and Abe could lose votes if he makes big concessions to the U.S. before the poll.
Analysts say Abe seeks to cement a two-thirds majority in Japan's parliament to achieve his long-held goal of rewriting Japan's U.S.-drafted postwar constitution , which limits the role of Japan's emperor and its military.
""I think he thinks of this as unfinished family business,"" says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus in Tokyo. ""This is something that his grandfather Kishi Nobusuke had wanted to do. So I think that he feels that this would bring completion to his political career.""
Nobusuke served as Japan's prime minister from 1957 to 1960.

Washington is still eager to strike a trade deal, though, because Japan has signed trade agreements with big agricultural producers, including Australia and Canada, allowing their farmers and ranchers to grab market share from their U.S. competitors. The Trump administration has criticized Japan's move as unfriendly.
""What you're looking at is a U.S. government that is demanding what it could have had, and is unfortunately not in a position to acknowledge that,"" says Brad Glosserman , deputy director of the Center for Rule-making Strategies at Tama University in Tokyo.
Previously, the U.S. had proposed and then negotiated a trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership , Glosserman points out, but Trump walked out on it.
""I'm not bound by anything that anybody else signs, with respect to the United States,"" Trump said at Monday's press briefing. The TPP, he said, ""would have destroyed our automobile industry and many of our manufacturers.""
Trump reiterated his indifference to North Korea's short-range missile tests this month , despite criticism of the launches from his own national security adviser, John Bolton. The tests also worry South Korea and Japan, both of which are within the missiles' striking range. So are some U.S. military bases in these countries.
But Trump pointed to the lack of nuclear and long-range missile tests as signs of his diplomatic success with North Korea. ""I am very happy with the way it's going, and intelligent people agree with me,"" he said.
Abe is the only regional leader who has not met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and therefore has less to offer the U.S. as a mediator.
This is not the case with Iran, with which Japan has long had friendly ties. Japan has also been highly reliant on Iranian oil, but has had to cut that reliance due to U.S. sanctions. Prime Minister Abe is considering traveling to Iran next month, and at Monday's briefing, he pledged to do whatever he could to mediate.
Japanese media have reported that Tehran would like Tokyo to mediate with the U.S. on its behalf.
Japan has supported the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which President Trump pulled the U.S. out of.
""This is one of the few issues on which Japan very clearly takes a position that is contrary to the U.S. government. And usually, Abe's pretty good about positioning himself to be the faithful ally"" of the U.S., says Daniel Sneider , a Japan expert at Stanford University.
All the policy talk on the second full day of Trump's visit stood in sharp contrast to the first day, which was centered around golf, sumo wrestling, burgers and steak. The schedule was clearly calculated to please Trump and highlight the closeness of the two leaders.
Trump and Abe ""are good friends, it seems, but that is not the issue,"" says Kunihiko Miyake , a former diplomat and now research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies in Tokyo.
""This is not just for Mr. Trump,"" he says, ""this is for the president of the United States."" And once the ceremonies are finished, the U.S. and Japanese leaders must cooperate on facing urgent strategic challenges, including the rise of Iran and China."

The U.S. Army issued a tweet ahead of Memorial Day weekend with a question for service members and veterans: ""How has serving impacted you?""
Among the thousands of responses: harrowing tales of trauma, depression and sexual assault.
In a thread, an Army tweet that preceded the question featured a video by Pfc. Nathan Spencer, a scout with the Army's First Infantry Division.
In the video, Spencer says, ""To serve something greater than myself. The Army's afforded me the opportunity to do just that, to give to others, to protect the ones I love, and to better myself as a man and a warrior.""

— U.S. Army (@USArmy) May 23, 2019 Soon after the U.S. Army tweeted its question, thousands of responses began flooding in. Many people tweeted about the positive impact military service had on their lives, but others posted stories of post-traumatic stress disorder, illness and suicide brought on by experiences ranging from seeing loss of life to sexual assaults in the military.
One man responded, ""How did serving impact me? Ask my family."" He wrote of a ""Combat Cocktail"" which included ""PTSD, severe depression, anxiety. Isolation. Suicide attempts. Never ending rage.""
The “Combat Cocktail”: PTSD, severe depression, anxiety. Isolation. Suicide attempts. Never ending rage. It cost me my relationship with my eldest son and my grandson. It cost some of my men so much more.

— Cory Schabacker (@CorySchabacker) May 26, 2019 Responses to the U.S. Army's Twitter post now number more than 11,000. The frequent references to PTSD don't come as a surprise to Marsha Four, national vice president of Vietnam Veterans of America.
""When you're in war, that's what happens,"" she said Monday in Washington, sitting near the Vietnam War Memorial. ""I was a nurse. I dealt with death and dying every day. I dealt with people's fear and their rage and their loneliness.""
Different wars may be fought for different reasons, and with different weapons, but some things remain the same, she said. ""And that is: death, fear and — one thing I never forget is the smell of blood. It's a very, very old and dark smell, and it's something you never forget.""
In addition to PTSD, another common theme on Twitter was the reports of sexual assault while serving in the military. One woman wrote of suffering from depression and anxiety, and said she ""still can't deal well with loud noises. I was assaulted by one of my superiors. When I reported him, with witnesses to corroborate my story, nothing happened to him. Nothing. A year later, he stole a laptop and was then demoted. I'm worth less than a laptop.""

— Mike Schmidt (@MikeSchmidt69) May 26, 2019 Four, the former Army nurse who now works with the Vietnam Veterans of America, said serving in the Army changed her life completely, because after the war she found a home in the community of veterans. Without her time in the Army, ""I would never have been able to be in the position I'm in, knowing that this is where I could find my purpose — to be part of something bigger than I am, to know that I've contributed, that my life has been worthy.""
The U.S. Army responded to the outpouring on May 25, tweeting: ""To everyone who responded to this thread, thank you for sharing your story. Your stories are real, they matter, and they may help others in similar situations. The Army is committed to the health, safety, and well-being of our Soldiers.""
In a separate tweet , it said: ""As we honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice this weekend by remembering their service, we are also mindful of the fact that we have to take care of those who came back home with scars we can't see.""
To everyone who responded to this thread, thank you for sharing your story. Your stories are real, they matter, and they may help others in similar situations. The Army is committed to the health, safety, and well-being of our Soldiers.
— U.S. Army (@USArmy) May 25, 2019 On the same day, the Army also posted a tweet with a link and phone number for the Veterans Crisis Line .
According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, there are approximately 20 million veterans in the U.S., and fewer than half receive VA benefits or services. The department says suicide rates among veterans declined slightly from 2015 to 2016, the most recent year for which it has data, but that the suicide rate was still 1.5 times greater than for nonveteran adults. A VA report last year found that more 6,000 veterans have died by suicide each year from 2008 to 2016.
If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (En Español: 1-888-628-9454; Deaf and Hard of Hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.

Elton John: The 'Fresh Air' Interview,www.npr.org,Terry Gross,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/726098002/elton-john-the-fresh-air-interview,"The film Rocketman is based on John's life story. In 2013, he talked about his elaborate stage outfits, his fear of sex as a young man and how Liberace's example encouraged him to focus on the piano.
Hear The Original Interview Music Interviews A More Reflective Leap On Elton John's 'Diving Board' DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. The new Elton John biopic ""Rocketman"" opens Friday. We're going to listen back to Terry's interview with him. After announcing his retirement last year, Elton John embarked on what he says is his global three-year-long final tour, which he's named the Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour. It's a long and winding road that began some 50 years ago. In 1969, he recorded this demo of ""Your Song,"" which became his first hit single when a fully produced version was released in 1970.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""YOUR SONG"")
ELTON JOHN: (Singing) It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside. Well, I'm not one of those who can easily hide. I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did, I'd buy a big house where we both could live. If I was a sculptor - but then again, no - or a man who makes potions in a traveling show. I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do. My gift is my song, and this one's for you. And you can tell everybody...
BIANCULLI: Elton John co-wrote ""Your Song"" with lyricist Bernie Taupin. They wrote many other hits together, including ""Rocket Man,"" ""Crocodile Rock,"" ""Honky Cat,"" ""Tiny Dancer,"" ""Bennie And The Jets,"" ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" and ""Candle In The Wind.""
Terry Gross spoke with Elton John in 2013, right before he paid tribute to Liberace at the Emmy Awards. It was during the period he was performing at Caesar's Palace in Vegas doing a show he called The Million Dollar Piano. Elton John has a flair for the extravagant. But when he and Terry spoke, he had just recorded a new stripped-down album called ""The Diving Board"" featuring him performing reflective songs backed by piano, bass and drums with some extra instruments on several tracks. He wrote the songs on the album with Bernie Taupin. Terry began the interview with a song from that album called ""Home Again.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""HOME AGAIN"")
JOHN: (Singing) The world had seven wonders once upon a time. It's sure enough the favored nations aided their decline. And all around me, I've seen times like it was back when. But like back then, I'd say amen if I could get back home again. If I could go back home, if I could go back home. If I'd never left, I'd never have known. We all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end spending all of our time trying to get back home again.
TERRY GROSS, HOST:
Elton John, welcome to FRESH AIR. What a great treat to have you on our show. Thank you so much for coming.
JOHN: Well, it's great to be here. Thank you.
GROSS: This album has, I think, a kind of different sound to it. You know, your voice is deeper. There's a sense in the songs of looking back, of reflecting on the past, both the historical past and the personal past.
JOHN: Yes.
GROSS: And I'm wondering if that mood and if that kind of lyrical cohesion was something that you and Bernie Taupin intended, or is it just the way it worked out?
JOHN: I think it's just the way it worked out. I think the album has its mood and its sound because T Bone Burnett, who produced the album, took me out to lunch, or we went to lunch. And we decided to talk about my solo album. I had done a record with Leon Russell before with him called ""The Union."" And T Bone suggested that I go back to my original lineup live on stage, which was just piano, bass and drums.
And he said, you know, you became a success with piano, bass and drums live, but you never recorded with piano, bass and drums as a template. And I (laughter) - I couldn't believe it because he was absolutely right. I'd - the sound that made me famous, I had never made a record using that sound. And I think the fact that we went in with just three musicians - piano, bass and drums - and put all of the tracks down like that made the sessions very relaxed.
I had no idea what the lyrical content would be, and I never have done with Bernie. But I think at our age - I mean, I'm 66, he's 62 - it's a reflection on we are - where we are in our lives. It's a very adult album. It's a very sparse album compared to the albums I've made before. And I'm very relaxed. I'm very happy with my personal life. When I started the album, I had one son. When I finished the album, I had two sons. I think subconsciously all that played into the end sound of the end product. The relaxed mood that - which I played and which I sang was just a joy. And I've never had that ever happen to me before when making a record.
GROSS: You know, I know you don't write the lyrics. But we know part of the lyric in ""Home Again"" is we all dream of leaving, but wind up in the end spending all our time trying to get back home again. So I know Bernie Taupin wrote that, not you. But does that express at all a sentiment that you share?
JOHN: Of course, because I'm a traveling gypsy. Every musician is a - you know, a wanderer. They spend their life traveling around. But it's not just about musicians or people in the armed forces who spend a long time away from home. It's about the casual worker who, you know, goes away for two three days and - you know, away from his family.
There's something about when you think about coming home, whether it's three days or three months. And you get excited about the fact that you are going to walk through your back door, sit at your kitchen table - because that's where everybody congregates, and that's where you spend most of your life, in the kitchen - and you can smell your family, and you can just be surrounded by your things. And no matter where I am in the world, I always look forward to coming home.
GROSS: T Bone Burnett, as you mentioned, heard you. When you first started performing in America, he heard you at the Troubadour. And those shows that you did there have become, you know, kind of famous in rock history. Tell us what you did there and tell us a little bit about who you were then.
JOHN: Well, the ""Elton John"" album was a very orchestral album. The cover of the album was very dark - you know, very dark with a picture of myself on it. And I think most people in America that had heard the album up to that point didn't know what to expect live on stage. They thought maybe I was going to be some shy, introverted piano player, singer who came on and was very Randy Newman-esque (ph), whereas we'd been playing for over a year in Britain, year and a half, with the band - Nigel Olsson on drums and Dee Murray on bass - and we were far from that.
I - you know, I emerged on stage in hot pants and boots, like, Doc Marten (ph) boots with wings on them. We - you know, we were a rock outfit more than anything else. And then the songs from the ""Elton John"" album, like, 60 years on were given a radical different treatment live on stage. So I think that played in - to my advantage. So - because people didn't expect me to come on and be full pelt rock and roll. They thought it was going to be kind of a sedate evening of a nice new British singer-songwriter, and it wasn't the case at all.
And I think, as it has happened a lot in my career, it's kismet. It's luck. It's just being in the right place in the right time. And it certainly was then. And the Robert Hilburn review from the LA Times kind of took two years off my work schedule because it spread round the country like wildfire. And it meant that I didn't have to play second on the bill in LA or New York, but it made my name a household name in those kind of big cities.
However, you know, America is a large country, and I spent two years touring with other people - playing second on the bill - and paying my dues, which I loved because I was playing with people like Derek and the Dominos and Leon Russell and really getting a lot of experience. And that's the best thing to do. I wasn't ready to headline big stadiums or big arenas because I'd just, you know, come from playing to 500, 600 people in England and playing to 200 people at the Troubadour and then went straight into playing Anaheim Convention Center with Leon Russell, which was 5,000 or 6,000 people. So it was an incredible experience to happen so quickly.
GROSS: So the clothing that you described wearing at the Troubadour - that so surprised people because they were expecting something more Randy Newman-esque. Could you have done that in your hometown? Did you have to leave to be able to dress that way onstage?
JOHN: I was dressing that way in England anyway just for the stage purposes.
GROSS: Right.
JOHN: I mean, we're all fashion-conscious in those days - very much so. But for stage, there was a designer in London called Mr. Freedom who gave me all these clothes and said, you know, go for it. And as a child - as a teenager, I was kind of not allowed to wear fashionable clothes - winklepicker shoes or chisel-toed shoes - and I always wanted to. So I've often said I lived my teenage years in my 20s when I sort of left home. And I became Elton John success. Then it became Elton John excess.
(LAUGHTER)
JOHN: If you get - you know, everything I couldn't do when I was younger I did 10 times over. You know, Hollywood Bowl - which was the biggest show that I've done up to that point in my career - was very, very funny when you look back at it. It's quite outrageous. I was introduced by Linda Lovelace. There was the Pope, the Queen coming down the stairs. And then I came out in this big marabou outfit. But I was having the time of my life. I was becoming the person that I wanted to be and no holds barred. It was very exciting and a lot of fun.
GROSS: So if you're just joining us, my guest is Elton John. He has a new album called ""The Diving Board."" And I want to play something else from the album. This is ""Oceans Away."" It's a song about men who fought in World War II and survived. Do you want to say a few words about the song before we hear it?
JOHN: I am - I get very moved when it's Armistice Day in England, which is November - or Veteran's Day in America - or anytime you see someone who's fought in a war marching to remember the ones that have fallen. Bernie wrote this song about his father, who didn't die in the war. My mother fought in the war - my dad didn't, but my mum did in the Second World War. And they fought so that I wouldn't have to. And this song is really about those people. They should never be forgotten. They should always be remembered. I'm a great believer in the old being very wise. And sometimes, they get treated very badly, and we discard them too readily. And this song is about paying tribute to what they did. And let's not ever forget them. Let's never forget these people and the countless people that died - millions who died on our behalf in World War I, World War II and subsequent wars after that.
GROSS: So this is Elton John from his new album, ""The Diving Board."" This is ""Oceans Away.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""OCEANS AWAY"")
JOHN: (Singing) I hung out with the old folks in the hope that I'd get wise. I was trying to bridge the gap between the great divide. Hung on every recollection in the theater of their eyes, picking up on this and that in the few that still survived. Call them up and dust them off. Let them shine - the ones who hold onto the ones they had to leave behind, those that flew and those that fell, the ones that had to stay beneath a little, wooden cross oceans away.
BIANCULLI: That's ""Oceans Away"" from Elton John's album ""The Diving Board."" We'll continue Terry's interview with him after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF ELTON JOHN SONG, ""SIXTY YEARS ON"")
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's interview with Elton John recorded in 2013. The new biopic about him, ""Rocketman,"" opens Friday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: You mentioned your mother fought in World War II. What did she do?
JOHN: She was a gunner. She was an ack ack girl, as they say. She was on the guns. And she was - she loved every single minute of it. I can tell you I think life was pretty amazing. I mean, it was it was frightening, but it was also, you know, camaraderie at its best. So, yes, she fought, and she fired the guns. And knowing my mother as I do, it was a perfect job for her.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSS: Was she a tough mother?
JOHN: She was disciplined, yeah - and quite rightly so. She was a good mother and very disciplined and worked very hard for me and, you know, encouraged me to be who I am not just personally but professionally, whereas my father wasn't too keen on the idea of me becoming a rock 'n' roll musician. We grew up - or I grew up after the Second World War in the '50s in England. And times were bad. And times were tough. I think food was rationed. We never went without. But it was - you know, it was a very conservative era to be brought up in. And then Elvis Presley came along and kind of changed the world, which he did. And then, of course, it led to The Beatles and a whole revolution of music and a whole revolution of society, as well - social behavior, social acceptance, whatever. And so my mother encouraged me and was very great about me being gay. But she always encouraged me to follow my musical dreams, which I'm very grateful for.
GROSS: When you say your mother was great about being gay, at what age was she great about that?
JOHN: Well, I didn't really - now, I didn't sleep with anyone, Terry, till I were 23. So I really didn't know - in the '50s, you weren't taught about sex whatsoever. It was never talked about. People used to snoop behind their curtains and look at the neighbors and, you know, if a girl became pregnant in your part of the world, she was shipped off to the countryside. Things - I was never told a thing about sex. So I was, you know, very naive, as were my friends, as well. But me so, especially. And so I didn't really know what I was until I came to America and I had sex in America. That was the first time I had sex, was in San Francisco in 1970. And it was with someone of my own sex, and someone who I knew who was English who happened to be in San Francisco at the same time.
I suspected my homosexuality. But I'd never acted out on it 'cause I was afraid of sex. It's awful to be afraid of sex. But I'm afraid that's what the '50s did to people. That, you know, it was just, sex is disgusting, it shouldn't be talked about. Nudity is disgusting, and we just don't talk about those kind of things.
GROSS: Well, I want to play another song from your album ""The Diving Board."" And if you're just joining us, my guest is Elton John. And this is a song called ""Oscar Wilde Gets Out."" And it's very relevant to what we're talking about 'cause it's about him getting out of prison after serving two years for a conviction of gross indecency because he was gay. And again, Bernie Taupin wrote the lyric, but what does this song mean to you?
JOHN: Well, (laughter), whenever I got a set of lyrics, I'd go into a studio, Terry, with nothing planned. I get a set of lyrics when I go into the studio, and I look at them. And T Bone and I said, well, that looks like an interesting song, (laughter), with the title. And, yeah, we we recorded and wrote this one first on the album because it's such a great and interesting story about someone who was betrayed by his lover and became infamous because of this. And it was a no-brainer to write this one first.
GROSS: The opening piano line in this is very, I'd say, catchy. But it's a very sober line. Is that - did that come first for you?
JOHN: Yes. The intros - every song on the album has a piano intro. In fact, when you played ""Oceans Away,"" that's the first time I'd ever recorded in my whole life a piano and vocal just on its own. Which sounds astonishing, seeing as I'm a piano player and a singer. And ""Oscar Wilde"" is the second track, and it has that intro. Goes (singing) da-da, da, da, da, da. Da-da, da, da, da, da. Just a very melancholic intro. And a sad intro. It has a sadness to it. Which, you know, is the story of Oscar Wilde.
And it's also part of my classical education when I went to Royal Academy of Music, that you can tell on this album that my classical roots or the education I received at the Royal Academy of Music bore a lot of fruit. I went there from 11 to 15, and it had such a huge influence on me. And I'm very grateful for that because it gives me a distinctive kind of style.
GROSS: OK. Great. So let's hear ""Oscar Wilde Gets Out."" And this is from Elton John's new album ""The Diving Board.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""OSCAR WILDE GETS OUT"")
JOHN: (Singing) Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail. Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails. Shaking fists and razors gleamed. You never stood a chance. When the ink ran red on Fleet Street, you turned your eyes to France. Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves. Your biting wit still sharp enough to slice through every page. Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown. The bitter pill you swallowed tasted sweeter going down. And looking back on the great indifference, looking back at the limestone walls, thinking how beauty deceived you, knowing how love fools us all.
BIANCULLI: That's ""Oscar Wilde Gets Out"" from the album ""The Diving Board."" We're listening to Terry's 2013 interview with Elton John. We'll hear more of their interview in the second half of the show. Elton John's biofilm ""Rocketman"" opens in theaters this week. I'm David Bianculli, and this is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BENNIE AND THE JETS"")
JOHN: (Singing) Hey, kids, shake it loose together. The spotlight's hitting something that's been known to change the weather. We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around. You're going to hear electric music, solid walls of sound. Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet? Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh Bennie and the Jets. Oh, but they're weird and wonderful. Oh, Bennie, she's real keen. She's got electric boots, a mohair suit, you know, I read it in a magazine. Oh, buh-buh-buh Bennie and the Jets. Hey, kids, plug into the faithless. Maybe they're blinded but Bennie makes them ageless. We shall survive. Let us take ourselves along.
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross, back with more of Terry's 2013 interview with Elton John. The new biopic about him, called ""Rocket Man,"" opens Friday. Terry spoke with him in 2013, after the release of his album ""The Diving Board,"" a collection of reflective songs written with John's longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin. Some of their many hits include ""Rocket Man,"" ""Crocodile Rock,"" ""Honky Cat,"" ""Tiny Dancer,"" ""Benny And The Jets,"" ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"" ""Your Song"" and ""Candle In The Wind."" Elton John was trained as a classical pianist, but it wasn't what he really wanted.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
JOHN: I didn't want to be a classical musician. But I went to school Monday to Friday, and from the age of 11 to 15, I was - went to the Royal Academy on a Saturday morning in London on Marylebone Road. And I had played classical music. I mean, I played classical music before I went to Royal Academy because you had to play classical music to get in there. And it was a great experience, even though it was - in the '50s it smelt of fear.
GROSS: (Laughter).
JOHN: I mean, it has a whole new, different feeling now. You have to realize that Elvis Presley kind of only just happened there. So there was - it was a really, really very strict and severe place. But I went there, and I met a lot of friends who subsequently have had a huge impact on my recording career.
Looking back on it now, those five years spent there were invaluable to me because I learned so much. It had a huge effect on the way I wrote, the way I constructed chord sequences, and it's just a wonderful place to be. And after all that time of being so fearful of being and afraid of going on a Saturday morning because if you got something wrong, you were told and rapped over the knuckles, that now, 40-odd years, 50 years later, it's the most wonderful place to be, and I have a wonderful relationship with it.
GROSS: We are recording this right before you perform at the Emmy Awards (laughter).
JOHN: Right.
GROSS: And our listeners will be hearing this after you've performed at the Emmy Awards. And you're doing a tribute to Liberace because the movie about him, Behind The Candelabra, is nominated for, like, 15 Emmys, and who knows how many, if any, it will have won by the time this was broadcast. But anyways, you know, he was - you could say, oh, you'd look at Liberace, and of course, you'd think he was gay, but, you know, he wasn't publicly out, and I think it was an era when it was, like...
JOHN: (Laughter).
GROSS: ...It was OK to be gay, as long as you didn't mention it (laughter), as long as, like, they didn't have to hear it. Yeah?
JOHN: Well, of course, he - Liberace came to England, and there was a columnist in the Daily Mirror who said he was gay, a guy called Cassandra - well, that was his pseudonym. And Liberace sued and won. And you know, he said, I'm not gay. And he won the libel case. When I was young and I watched ""The Liberace Show"" or any show that came from America that, you know, was musical, it was pure magic. The Americans did things on a bigger scale. Liberace, because he played the piano, I was very much interested in. It was - he was a good pianist, but he was not a great pianist. And I was enchanted by him, and I loved him. You know, his dialogue with the audience was very, very funny, especially when he did live shows.
And I did get to meet him. I did the ""Royal Variety"" show with him in London at The London Palladium. And I planned my two big outfits, and I thought, well, Liberace, I've got to do something special. So I had two fabulous Lurex suits made in red, white and blue. And they were hanging up, you know, very proudly in the dressing room. And then Lee - who he liked to be called, Liberace - Lee walked in with trunk after trunk. He wore that outfit with the lightbulbs in it.
GROSS: (Laughter).
JOHN: And you know, so my attempt to, you know, go one up on Liberace failed absolutely miserably. But he was so charming and so lovely and very, very funny and very, very intelligent. And he was a huge influence on me. It was like, he was being who he was. He wasn't publicly out, but he didn't give a flying monkey's about what he was wearing; he just went for it. And that was who he was, and that, of course, influenced me when I started wearing the clothes.
And you know, it, subconsciously, must've - you know, if you're stuck at a piano and you're not a lead guitarist or lead vocalist, you're kind of at a nine-foot plank, and you have to do something about it. So my thing was to leap on the piano, do handstand and wear clothes that would attract attention to me because that's the focus for 2 1/2 hours or two hours. I'm not walking around the stage. I'm not moving. So he gave me that idea, probably subconsciously, because before then I'd never seen anyone dressed like that.
GROSS: You know, I was reading a 1973 Rolling Stone interview with you in which you said that your act is going to become a little more Liberace-ized (ph). And I thought, wow, in 1973, you were thinking about making your act more Liberace-ish (ph).
JOHN: Well, it was - all my stuff has been done with firmly tongue-in-cheek. You know, I wasn't a heartthrob - David Bowie or Mick Jagger or Rod Stewart in those days. You know, I was Elton at the piano. And I, you know - I just had to turn the attention on to something comedic or even more outrageous than it was. Of course, with those kind of things, as is my want in everything I do, I took it too far, and it - you know, it became - in the beginning, it was natural; I didn't think about it. It was like, oh, yeah, let's do this, let's do that. And then it became, like, oh, what am I going to do next? And that's the dangerous side. It's like, you think about it too much.
In the end, it became tired, and it became too much, and it became less fun. I think a lot of the critics of the costumes put people off me. They weren't listening to the music as more or less looking at what I was wearing. I was singing great songs, but I was also wearing, you know, a giant chicken outfit at the time.
GROSS: (Laughter).
JOHN: And being helped onstage by Mr. Universe, on his shoulders. So you know, anything like that, it was - you know, it was all down to me. It was my fault if anything - you know, if they didn't like what I was wearing, then I couldn't really do much about it. But...
GROSS: But this is such an...
JOHN: ...You know, I had to take responsibility for it.
GROSS: This is an interesting moment in your life because you have this new album, ""The Diving Board,"" that's very stripped down, you know. It's basically, you know, piano, bass, drums and then some extra instruments on some tracks. But at the same time, you're playing at Caesars in Vegas with your million-dollar piano show, and that sounds like quite an extravaganza. I mean, you're - literally, have a million-dollar piano, which I'm going to ask you to describe.
JOHN: It lights up. You can show films on it. You can show video. It was a suggestion from Yamaha, who made my piano, said, you know, we're coming up with an idea for you. And you know, the first show I did in Las Vegas was a red piano; I had a red piano. And then we had to think, well, if we're going to go back, what can we do? And they came up with this idea before we ever thought of going back to Vegas. And I thought, well, if I go back to Vegas, this sounds like a great idea. You know, and it's - I introduce - the piano has a name. She's named Blossom, after Blossom Dearie.
GROSS: (Laughter) Oh, I love Blossom Dearie.
JOHN: I love Blossom Dearie, too. She was such a big influence on me...
GROSS: Really?
JOHN: Great, great pianist.
GROSS: I never would have guessed that. I never, ever would have guessed that.
JOHN: Yeah. People like her and Mose Allison, you know, they had (singing) that kind of little voice that sang like that.
Blossom Dearie was a big thing for me. She was just - you know, no one sounded like Blossom Dearie. She was incredible. So those people - you have to realize that English people were so - or British people were so attuned to those kind of musicians because we didn't have any of those kind of musicians in our country.
BIANCULLI: We're listening to Terry's 2013 interview with Elton John. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF ELTON JOHN SONG, ""HONKY CAT"")
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2013 interview with Elton John. His bio film ""Rocket Man"" opens in theaters this week.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GROSS: You've described yourself as being shy when you were growing up. And you're certainly not shy onstage, not in how you dress, not in how you perform - not in anything. So what's the connection between the extravagance onstage (laughter) and the extroversion onstage and the shyness that described you as a boy, before you became a performer?
JOHN: Well, initially, I mean - I think performers are all show-offs, anyway, especially musicians. You have to - unless you show off, you're not going to get noticed. And you can stay there and just, you know, play, and you won't get noticed. But for me, music - it's so passionate. I have to give it my all every time I go onstage, and that comes from seeing performers like Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino and Elvis Presley. You know, you look at those performance, and they gave you the - Frank Sinatra, same thing. Great performers gave great performances, and that's the way I've always thought.
Onstage, it was always comfortable for me because that's where I felt at home. Offstage, it was a different situation; I was still shy offstage. And I've - fortunately, my shyness and my inability to communicate and really have great conversations or be part of the gang - in inverted commas - led me to the drug addiction, which, you know, blighted my life for 16 years. Because I thought by doing that, it would make me join in, and I did. And you know, cocaine made me talk forever. It - the most nonsensical rubbish that you could ever think of. But it - for me, I thought, well, that's going to open me up, and it did, and it led to 16 years of drug abuse, which, you know, I put to rights in 1990.
And I had no balance in my life, Terry. I was, you know, this one person onstage and this person offstage who really didn't know much about living. I'd progressed onstage as a performer, but I hadn't progressed as a human being. And I was - you know, fame makes you very self-absorbed. I was very, very famous all around the world because I was a global artist; I went all around the world, and that leads you into a little bubble, and it leads you to become very insular. I had people around me who were very controlling. So I didn't like confrontation, so I just delved into drug addiction and alcohol addiction.
And until I got sober in 1990, I really hadn't grown up at all. So when I did get sober, at that point, I had a lot of catching up to do with the personality onstage, with the real person offstage. And to attain the balance in my life, I had to learn to walk again, basically. I had to learn how to function as a human being, and I really enjoyed that process. I mean, when people go to rehab and come out, they go through a difficult period, a lot of people; I never had that. I was so glad to be rid of all that crap, that, for me, to learn again and to function as a human being and learn how to participate in the human race again was just pure joy.
And in 1993, I met my partner, David. In 1993, I did ""The Lion King."" So great things came my way. But I met someone who was willing to be in a relationship, but only if it was a 50-50 relationship. Before I had the relationship with David, you know, I tended to take hostages.
GROSS: (Laughter).
JOHN: Because they had to fit in with what I did. And I - you know, you take them around the world, you buy them Versace shirt and a Cartier watch, and then within six months, they hate your guts because they have no life. And I did that repeatedly, time and time again. I had to learn how to share, how to take part in a proper relationship. And since that, I've been 23 years now, clean and sober, and the most amazing things have happened to me. So it was just - it was a - the '90s were a great time. It was like I became alive again. I functioned, and it was terrific. And I haven't stopped since then, and I've never regretted getting sober.
And I would never - even though I don't take it, you know, lightly, I can tell you, I won't have a drink again, and I won't have a drug again because my life is so brilliant that, you know, I regret wasting those 16 years. But it was necessary to go through those 16 years to come out as the person I am now.
GROSS: You seem to be the kind of person who, when you do something, you go all the way. So, like, with clothing, it's going to be, you know, extravagant. You're not going to have like one pair of great glasses; you're going to have, like, probably hundreds. And you know, with drugs - you know, and with songs, like, you write so many songs, and you do so many performances. And with drugs, it was probably hard for you to just do it part-way (ph), and you went all the way with that.
JOHN: Oh, yeah. I could - (laughter) of course, it was. I mean, I can't have one tie, I can't have one car - I can't have one of anything. I'm just an addict in everything. And you know, I had the appendicitis happen to me this year, which was six weeks of having a burst appendix and doing 24 flights, nine shows and a summer ball at the house of AIDS (ph).
GROSS: I don't even understand how you survive that, a burst appendix and you're still touring.
JOHN: I don't know how, either. But it's - I should actually be dead because if my body hadn't have been such a good - had protection, and it stopped me getting Peritonitis, I would have been on a flight, and I wouldn't be here. And so that was another sign. You know, as soon as that happened, David and I said, I don't have to work 12 months a year. I'm the sort of person - and you nailed it just now by saying, if I had done 100 shows last year, I want to do 120 this year. Why? I don't know.
GROSS: (Laughter).
JOHN: I'm afraid that's part of my Achilles heel, is the way I think like that. I'm so kind of driven that you think stop it, you know. And so we - David and I sat down after the appendix thing had happened and said, you know, I don't have to work. I don't have to - I'm going to maybe work six months a year and take my kids to school. But the work became, like the drug addiction, the clothes - anything in my life - it became - it's become an addiction; I'm addicted to working.
GROSS: Early in your career - this is the story the way I've read it - you know, that you auditioned for Liberty Records. They didn't like your singing well enough to sign you, but they thought, well, maybe you could write songs. And they gave you lyrics that were written by Bernie Taupin, which is how you got hooked up with him.
JOHN: Yeah. I was in a band. I didn't like playing in the band. I didn't like where we were musically. I was very shy. I was a little overweight. But I answered this advertisement. And I went to see the guy in the office. And he - I said, I can sing, and I can write songs. And I said, but I can't write lyrics. And he said, well, here's somebody who writes lyrics who's just - you know, he had a - piles of stuff on his desk - tapes, lyrics. But it was in a brown envelope, and I took it home. And that was Bernie.
And if I hadn't have had the courage or the leap of faith to make - answer that advertisement when I was very shy - it's just one of the most incredible things that's ever happened to me. It - that changed my life - that whole thing, that advertisement in the New Musical Express, the fact that I had the courage to do it. When I look back now, I can't really understand how I had the courage to do it, knowing how timid I was at that point and how, you know, I just - my self-esteem wasn't very good, but I - anything rather than playing to people eating food when I was playing.
So, you know, I took the leap of faith. It changed my life. Forty-six years on, I'm still writing songs with the guy. And it just - without that, I would probably still be working a record store or - well, there aren't any record stores now, so I'd probably be doing something else.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSS: So would it have ever occurred to you to look for a lyricist to collaborate with?
JOHN: Because I knew I couldn't write lyrics. And people say, well, you're very verbose. You're very articulate. How come you can't write your own lyrics? Well, that is a very great disservice to people who write brilliant lyrics. Some people can actually write their own lyrics and their own songs. I can't. I realized at an early age or when I tried to write songs that I wasn't very good at it.
And you know, I enjoy the process of writing to his lyrics and the weird process of him giving me a lyric, me going to a studio and never writing with him in the same room. It's a magical event. He's a very - and always has been a very cinematic storyteller in his lyrics. There's a visual. So as soon as I look at the lyrics, visually, I can see what's going on.
And I don't know how it works, Terry. It's kind of a bit ""Twilight Zone""-ish, to say the least. But it has worked. And it's as interesting now and as fun now as it was when I first wrote the first song to his lyric because that excitement of writing something and then seeing his reaction has never, ever dimmed. It's always been as exciting as it was in the first - when I wrote the very first song.
GROSS: Well, Elton John, I'm so grateful you were on our show. Thank you so much for doing it.
JOHN: Thank you. I've really enjoyed it.
GROSS: I really enjoyed it, too. And it occurs to me - should I have been calling you Sir Elton?
JOHN: No, no, no. No one calls me Sir, thank you.
GROSS: OK (laughter). I feel better already (laughter).
JOHN: No, don't worry about that, for God's sake.
GROSS: OK (laughter).
JOHN: No, I get called much worse things than that.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSS: OK. Well, thank you so much, and be well.
JOHN: Well, thank you. And give my love to Philly, OK?
GROSS: Will do.
BIANCULLI: Terry Gross talking with Elton John, recorded in 2013. The biopic ""Rocketman"" about the life and music of Elton John opens Friday. Elton's global final tour is scheduled to end in 2021.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD"")
JOHN: (Singing) When are you gonna come down? When are you going to land? I should have stayed on the farm. I should have listened to my old man. You know you can't hold me forever. I didn't sign up with you. I'm not a present for your friends to open. This boy's too young to be singing the blues. (Vocalizing). So goodbye, yellow brick road, where the dogs of society howl. You can't plant me in your penthouse. I'm going back to my plough, back to the howling old owl in the woods, hunting the horny-back toad. Oh, I've finally decided by future lies beyond the yellow brick road.
BIANCULLI: Coming up, Ken Tucker reviews new records by two musicians who were part of the first wave of British punk rock in the 1970s - Nick Lowe and Wreckless Eric. This is FRESH AIR.

'Love Starvation/Trombone' And 'Transience' Speak To Past Sans Nostalgia,www.npr.org,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727332688/love-starvation-trombone-and-transience-speak-to-past-sans-nostalgia,"In their recent releases, Nick Lowe (along with Los Straitjackets) and Wreckless Eric have created new music that connects to old music without maudlin nostalgia or huffy defensiveness.
DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. Nick Lowe and Eric Goulden were both part of the first wave of British punk rock in the 1970s. Goulden performed under the name Wreckless Eric, and Lowe produced Eric's best-known song, ""Whole Wide World,"" in 1977. Now both men have new, separate recordings. Lowe has a four-song EP he's cut with the band Los Straitjackets. It's called ""Love Starvation/Trombone."" Wreckless Eric's new album is called ""Transience."" Rock critic Ken Tucker reviews both.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LOVE STARVATION"")
NICK LOWE: (Singing) I woke up early with love starvation, hugging my pillow all alone in a rickety bed. Baby, if it's any consolation, the needle's in the red. It only hit me when I went by a mirror. That's when I saw what was written all over my face. I'm suffering love starvation, a very bad case.
KEN TUCKER, BYLINE: At age 70, Nick Lowe still makes awfully spry music. It helps, he knows, to hook up with new collaborators who are, if not young themselves, at least younger - Los Straitjackets, the Nashville-based instrumental outfit with whom Lowe has now recorded two EPs. The song that started this review is a new Nick Lowe tune called ""Love Starvation."" Lowe also has a music nerd's appreciation for obscure oldies, like his cover of a song produced by Phil Spector in 1961 for the singer Sammy Turner. This is Nick Lowe and Los Straitjackets' beautiful version of ""Raincoat In The River.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""RAINCOAT IN THE RIVER"")
LOWE: (Singing) I'm gonna throw my raincoat in the river, gonna toss my umbrella in the sea. The sun's gonna shine like never before. It ain't gonna rain on me no more because my baby's coming back to me. Hey, can't you see my raincoat in the river sinking down ever further out of sight? For each drop of rain that fell on my face, I know we'll share a sweet embrace because she'll be back in my arms tonight. Well, the rain kept dripping...
BIANCULLI: As a bratty punk in the 1970s, Eric Goulden made his mark as Wreckless Eric with the great single ""Whole Wide World."" Now in his 60s, Eric is looking back on his youth, specifically as the son of his father. Like a lot of mature men, Eric now sees the virtues of the parent he used to rebel against, recognizing similarities and acknowledging the debts we owe our dads.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""FATHER TO THE MAN"")
WRECKLESS ERIC: (Singing) My dad worked in a factory. I tried it too, but I couldn’t do with the tedium of the everyday. I flunked out, I'm not ashamed to say. While he was steady, I was a flake. I lived my life from scrape to scrape. Now I’m older, I’m a lot like him - history coming back again. I’ve got this name and it doesn’t fit. I don’t know what I can do about it. They say the child is the father to the man. I’ll just do what I can.
TUCKER: This album ""Transience"" contains eight songs, and among those backing him up is Amy Rigby, to whom he is married and who made one of 2018's best albums, ""The Old Guys,"" which was produced by Eric. Like Nick Lowe, Eric has always favored music that sounds bashed out quickly. The idea is to be artful about seeming artless. You can hear this aesthetic at work on a lurching, clattering song such as ""Strange Locomotion.""
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""STRANGE LOCOMOTION"")
WRECKLESS ERIC: (Singing) Strange locomotion over the ocean. We can find a better place. Strange locomotion. If you got the notion, get on over the ocean. Take yourself a big, fat plane. Get some strange locomotion. Up and down, off the ground. Strange, strange, strange locomotion. Up and down, way off the ground. Strange, strange, strange locomotion.
TUCKER: The achievement for both Nick Lowe and Wreckless Eric is to have made new music that connects to old music without maudlin nostalgia or huffy defensiveness. These are men comfortable with the old guys they've become, refusing to let age dim their passion for the music that means the most to them. In other words, they rock.
BIANCULLI: Rock critic Ken Tucker reviewed new recordings by Nick Lowe and Wreckless Eric. On tomorrow's show, helping your kids survive and thrive in their college years. We talk with psychologist B. Janet Hibbs and psychiatrist Anthony Rostain about the challenges of parenting one of the most stressed-out generations of teens. Hibbs helped her son navigate his way through severe depression and anxiety. Their book is called ""The Stressed Years Of Their Lives."" Hope you can join us.

4 Takeaways From The European Parliament Election Results,www.npr.org,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727293356/4-takeaways-from-the-european-parliament-election-results,"Enlarge this image A woman exits a voting booth with curtains depicting the European Union flag in Baleni, Romania, on Sunday. Andreea Alexandru/AP Andreea Alexandru/AP A woman exits a voting booth with curtains depicting the European Union flag in Baleni, Romania, on Sunday.
Andreea Alexandru/AP Europe's traditional centrist coalition lost its majority in the European Union's parliamentary elections Sunday, with far-right populist parties and liberal, pro-European Union parties both gaining ground. The results suggest a complicated future for the EU, as voters look for new ways forward.
More than 50% of European voters turned out last week to vote in the parliamentary elections, the highest turnout in two decades and a sharp increase from the last election in 2014.
Here's what you need to know about the results.
The center-left, center-right coalition lost its majority. The center-right group known as the European People's Party (EPP) and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) held 54% of the seats before the vote. Now they're down to 43% , according to Sunday's results. The two blocs together lost more than 70 seats, along with the majority they held for decades, according to NPR's Sylvia Poggioli .
The results suggest that European centrists will have to reach out to and unite more broadly with liberal coalitions in order to effect change — and maintain authority — in the EU.
The far-right gained ground — but not as much as expected.

Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images Matteo Salvini, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the right-wing League party, speaks at a news conference following the European Parliament election results on Monday in Milan.
Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images Populist, euroskeptic parties across Europe saw gains, but less than what some preelection polls had predicted — and what pro-EU forces had feared. And the various nationalist parties' differences over issues like migration and attitudes toward Russia could cloud prospects for a united right.
""What happened was not really what a lot of people were fearing, that there would be a surge of the far-right populists,"" former Swedish Prime Minister and now co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations Carl Bildt told NPR on Monday. ""There was an increase by the far-right, but fairly marginal and far less than what people had predicted.""
Because the gains were smaller than expected, the far-right likely won't be able to reshape the future of Europe by itself, says NPR's Poggioli, but it may be able to obstruct the legislative process. Many attribute the victories on the far-right to high unemployment rates, security concerns after several terrorist attacks and tensions over migration.
In France, the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen narrowly beat French President Emmanuel Macron's party coalition. Though Le Pen's party won by less than 1%, with 23% of the vote, she dubbed it a ""victory for the people"" on Twitter.
The League, Italy's far-right populist party led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, saw a sweeping victory , garnering more than 34% of the country's vote.
""Not only is the League the top party in Italy, Marine Le Pen is the top party in France, Nigel Farage is the top party in the U.K. So Italy, France, the U.K., it's a sign of a Europe that's changing,"" Salvini said at a press conference after the victory.
In Hungary, the nationalist Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán took more than 52% of the vote.
In Austria, conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's Austrian People's Party won the election Sunday, but Kurz was ousted Monday when he lost a no-confidence vote stemming from a scandal that erupted last week over its coalition partner, the far-right Freedom Party. That party fared worse than it had in the previous European election.
Though many of the far-right parties of Europe share the goal of weakening the European Union, they clash on other pressing issues. In Italy, for instance, Salvini, though anti-immigration, has advocated for the relocation of asylum seekers across the EU . Hungary's Orbán has pushed to close borders.
""We reject migration; and we would like to see leaders in position in the European Union who reject migration, who would like to stop it and not manage it,"" Orbán wrote in a statement after casting his vote Sunday.
Europeans are concerned about the environment. The Greens, a party coalition focusing on environmental issues, went from 52 seats in the European Parliament in 2014 to 69 in 2019, making them the fourth largest voting bloc in the EU.

Kay Nietfeld/Picture Alliance Via Getty Images The results, the strongest ever for the Greens, indicate that many Europeans are growing increasingly concerned about climate change and the environment. Recently, across northern Europe, young people have been protesting what they see as governmental inaction on combating climate change.
In Germany, the Greens took 21% of the vote, second only to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, part of the center-right EPP European parliamentary bloc. Since the last election in 2014, Merkel's party lost 6 percentage points, while the Greens gained nearly 10 points.
The Greens also saw gains in France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, Denmark and Belgium, among others.
""The Greens and the Liberals were the winners of the day,"" Sweden's Carl Bildt told NPR.
The U.K. doubles down on Brexit Enlarge this image Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage arrives at a Brexit party on Monday in London. Peter Summers/Getty Images Peter Summers/Getty Images Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage arrives at a Brexit party on Monday in London.
Peter Summers/Getty Images Voters in the United Kingdom weren't initially even supposed to participate in this election; they were supposed to have left the EU by the end of March. But with several delays — and plans for leaving now set for October — U.K. voters had to take part, and gave the new Brexit Party, led by populist Nigel Farage, more than 30% of the vote.
In contrast, Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party ended up in fifth place, with 8.7% of the vote. ""This is the worst showing by the Conservative Party since the 1830s,"" says NPR's Frank Langfitt.
The Labour Party also fared poorly, down 10 percentage points since 2014. Both the Labour and Conservative parties wavered on finding a clear position on Brexit, and the vote seems to indicate, Langfitt says, that voters rewarded clarity on the issue of leaving the EU. Liberal Democrats and other pro-EU parties did well.
""Never before in British politics has a new party, launched just six weeks ago, topped the polls in a national election,"" Farage said after his election as a member of the European Parliament. ""There's a huge message here, a massive message here.""

Evan Vucci/AP The optics and the rhetoric of President Trump's state visit to Japan aimed to show two allies at their closest in history, at the start of a new Japanese emperor's reign. Trump is the first state guest to visit since Emperor Naruhito ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1. On Sunday, he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shared a round of golf, attended a sumo wrestling match and had a barbecue dinner.
But on Monday, a joint press conference with the two leaders revealed the two countries struggling to manage differences over a raft of policy issues — in particular, bilateral trade, North Korea and Iran.

Evan Vucci/AP One of Japan's top concerns is that the U.S. is threatening tariffs on Japanese car exports to the U.S. if a deal is not reached in six months. Those exports are a mainstay of the Japanese economy, and Tokyo is unnerved to hear that its chief ally classifies Japan's trade surplus as a security threat.
""When I talk about a security threat, I talk about a balance sheet,"" Trump said at Monday's press conference at the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo.
In its defense, Japan points out that it produces more cars in the U.S. than it exports there, and that investment has surged under the Trump administration, creating tens of thousands of U.S. jobs.
President Trump acknowledged that Japan has lowered its trade surplus, with plans to purchase more than 100 U.S. F-35 warplanes, more than any other ally.
Trump is expected to highlight that purchase on Tuesday, when he plans to visit the port of Yokosuka, home to both U.S. and Japanese warships. Japan's legislature has approved plans to convert helicopter carriers to accommodate F-35s, giving it its first aircraft carriers since World War II.

Evan Vucci/AP Trump suggested that any trade deal would have to wait until after Japan's parliamentary elections in July. Washington has its hands full with an ongoing trade war with China, and Abe could lose votes if he makes big concessions to the U.S. before the poll.
Analysts say Abe seeks to cement a two-thirds majority in Japan's parliament to achieve his long-held goal of rewriting Japan's U.S.-drafted postwar constitution , which limits the role of Japan's emperor and its military.
""I think he thinks of this as unfinished family business,"" says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus in Tokyo. ""This is something that his grandfather Kishi Nobusuke had wanted to do. So I think that he feels that this would bring completion to his political career.""
Nobusuke served as Japan's prime minister from 1957 to 1960.

Evan Vucci/AP Washington is still eager to strike a trade deal, though, because Japan has signed trade agreements with big agricultural producers, including Australia and Canada, allowing their farmers and ranchers to grab market share from their U.S. competitors. The Trump administration has criticized Japan's move as unfriendly.
""What you're looking at is a U.S. government that is demanding what it could have had, and is unfortunately not in a position to acknowledge that,"" says Brad Glosserman , deputy director of the Center for Rule-making Strategies at Tama University in Tokyo.
Previously, the U.S. had proposed and then negotiated a trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership , Glosserman points out, but Trump walked out on it.
""I'm not bound by anything that anybody else signs, with respect to the United States,"" Trump said at Monday's press briefing. The TPP, he said, ""would have destroyed our automobile industry and many of our manufacturers.""
Trump reiterated his indifference to North Korea's short-range missile tests this month , despite criticism of the launches from his own national security adviser, John Bolton. The tests also worry South Korea and Japan, both of which are within the missiles' striking range. So are some U.S. military bases in these countries.
But Trump pointed to the lack of nuclear and long-range missile tests as signs of his diplomatic success with North Korea. ""I am very happy with the way it's going, and intelligent people agree with me,"" he said.
Abe is the only regional leader who has not met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and therefore has less to offer the U.S. as a mediator.
This is not the case with Iran, with which Japan has long had friendly ties. Japan has also been highly reliant on Iranian oil, but has had to cut that reliance due to U.S. sanctions. Prime Minister Abe is considering traveling to Iran next month, and at Monday's briefing, he pledged to do whatever he could to mediate.
Japanese media have reported that Tehran would like Tokyo to mediate with the U.S. on its behalf.
Japan has supported the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which President Trump pulled the U.S. out of.
""This is one of the few issues on which Japan very clearly takes a position that is contrary to the U.S. government. And usually, Abe's pretty good about positioning himself to be the faithful ally"" of the U.S., says Daniel Sneider , a Japan expert at Stanford University.
All the policy talk on the second full day of Trump's visit stood in sharp contrast to the first day, which was centered around golf, sumo wrestling, burgers and steak. The schedule was clearly calculated to please Trump and highlight the closeness of the two leaders.
Trump and Abe ""are good friends, it seems, but that is not the issue,"" says Kunihiko Miyake , a former diplomat and now research director at the Canon Institute for Global Studies in Tokyo.
""This is not just for Mr. Trump,"" he says, ""this is for the president of the United States."" And once the ceremonies are finished, the U.S. and Japanese leaders must cooperate on facing urgent strategic challenges, including the rise of Iran and China.

According to a recent poll by Smithsonian magazine, 67 percent of women in the U.S. military report having been sexually harassed or assaulted. For men, it's six percent.
And last year, there were nearly 7,000 cases of sexual assault reported in the military. But the actual number is likely much higher.
Why are misogyny and sexual misconduct so rampant in the armed forces? What's protecting this behavior? And what can be done to end it?

"Johnson & Johnson Opioid Trial To Begin In Oklahoma, Could Set Precedent",www.npr.org,"Mike Hunter, Okla. Attorney General",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/724093091/this-case-will-set-a-precedent-first-major-opioid-trial-to-begin-in-oklahoma,"Purdue Pharma Agrees To $270 Million Opioid Settlement With Oklahoma
With hundreds of similar cases pending — especially a mammoth case pending in Ohio — the state's strategy will be closely watched.
""And of course lurking in the background is the multi-state litigation in Cleveland, where there will ultimately be a settlement in all likelihood, but the size of the settlement and the terms of the settlement may be influenced by Oklahoma,"" says Ausness.
'There's nothing wrong with producing opioids'
But the legal case is complicated. Unlike tobacco, where states won a landmark settlement , Ausness points out that opioids serve a medical purpose.
""There's nothing wrong with producing opioids. It's regulated and approved by the Federal Drug Administration, the sale is overseen by the Drug Enforcement Administration, so there's a great deal of regulation in the production and distribution and sale of opioid products,"" Ausness explains. ""They are useful products so this is not a situation where the product is defective in some way.""
There's nothing wrong with producing opioids. ... They are useful products so this is not a situation where the product is defective in some way. Richard Ausness, University of Kentucky
It's an argument that has found some traction in court. Recently, a North Dakota judge dismissed all of that state's claims against Purdue, a big court win for the company. In a written ruling that the state says it will appeal, Judge James Hill questioned the idea of blaming a company that makes a legal product for opioid-related deaths.
""Purdue cannot control how doctors prescribe its products and it certainly cannot control how individual patients use and respond to its products,"" the judge wrote, ""regardless of any warning or instruction Purdue may give.""
Now the Oklahoma case rests entirely on a claim of public nuisance, which refers to actions that harm members of the public, including injury to public health.
""It's sexy,"" Ausness says. ""You know 'public nuisance' makes it sound like the defendants are really bad.""
If the state's claim prevails, Big Pharma could have to spend billions of dollars in Oklahoma helping ease the epidemic. ""It doesn't diminish the amount of damages we believe we'll be able to justify to the judge,"" Hunter says, estimating a final payout could run into the ""billions of dollars.""
Hunter's decision to go it alone and not join with a larger consolidated case could mean a quicker resolution for the state, or no money all, Ausness says.
""Particularly when we're talking about [attorneys general], who are politicians, who want to be able to tell the people, 'Gee, this is what I've done for you.' They are not interested in waiting two or three years [for a settlement], they want it now,"" he says. ""Of course the risk of that is you may lose.""

Looking for treatment
Oklahoma has the second highest uninsured rate in the nation and little money for public health. The state is trying to win money from the drug companies to pay for treatment for people like Greg, who uses drugs and is afraid he'll lose his job if we use his last name.
Greg and his wife Judy say they haven't been able to find the integrated treatment that Greg needs for both his opioid addiction and his bipolar disorder. It's either one or the other.
""They don't give you ... a treatment plan for both,"" Judy says. ""They just say, 'Here, you can talk to this person.' They don't recognize that it's like self-medicating.""
The couple live in Guthrie, Okla., about an hour north of the courthouse where the opioid trial will take place. Greg says he's been addicted to opioids for 11 years. People with prescriptions sell him their pills — sometimes Greg binges and takes 400 milligrams of morphine at once, a huge dose.
Of the $270 million Purdue settlement, $200 million is earmarked for an addiction research and treatment center in Tulsa, though no details have been released. An undisclosed amount of the $85 million Teva settlement will also go to abating the crisis.
Judy hopes that the treatment center may eventually help Greg.
""I wish he would stop using [opioids], but I love him. I'll always be here,"" she said.

"To Control Wildfires, Western Officials Are Urged To Follow South's Lead",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358726/to-control-wildfires-western-officials-are-urged-to-follow-souths-lead,"The South is the nation's leader in setting small wildfires on purpose, to prevent massive ones like those out West. One big reason is that so much land in the South is privately owned, not public.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
In the American West, wildfires are growing bigger and more intense as the climate warms. There is a push to prevent them by setting smaller fires on purpose. As Grant Blankenship of Georgia Public Broadcasting explains, that's a technique the South has been using for years.
GRANT BLANKENSHIP, BYLINE: I'm standing in a grassy valley in the low mountains of west Georgia. Smoke is rising from the trees on the ridge, and a helicopter is raining fire from the sky.
(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER WHIRRING)
BLANKENSHIP: It's dropping thousands of little incendiary devices. They look like pingpong balls. When they hit the ground, they ignite and spread more flame.
(SOUNDBITE OF FIRE CRACKLING)
BLANKENSHIP: Then at just the right moment, two firefighters on ATVs with flamethrowers set fire to the grass at the edge of the road, robbing the main blaze of fuel and stopping it dead.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Look, look.
BLANKENSHIP: This 900-acre fire stayed low to the ground, out of tree canopies, and after about 15 minutes, all that's really left to do is clean up just as Nathan Klaus promised when he briefed the fire crew earlier in the morning.
NATHAN KLAUS: This probably never - hopefully never going to go without fire again. And it certainly won't be at the risk that it was for a wildfire.
BLANKENSHIP: When he isn't the burn boss, Klaus is an ornithologist with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The DNR has been burning these woods for 17 years. Now there's no more duff or kindling for wildfire on the forest floor. That's the kind of stuff that contributes to the massive wildfires in the West. Plus the Bachman's Sparrow, a bird that's been missing here since the 1960s, it's been coming back.
KLAUS: We've got bobwhite quail. We're hoping for northern pine snake.
BLANKENSHIP: Every year, Georgia intentionally burns around a million acres of forest. That's close to 30 times the size of California's prescribed burns. That's according to data from the National Interagency Fire Center and compiled by the nonprofit Climate Central. So why does the South burn so much more of its forests? In part, that has to do with who owns the trees.
WALKER RIVERS: This is my 40th season of performing prescribed burns.
BLANKENSHIP: That's Walker Rivers. He's a consulting forester, a fire freelancer. He's showing me a plot he's been burning for its owner since 1995. It's tall pines, low grasses and blackberries. Those are for the turkeys.
RIVERS: They love blackberries.
BLANKENSHIP: Oh, turkeys do?
RIVERS: Oh, yes.
BLANKENSHIP: And the owners love hunting as much as they love selling pine trees. According to the Georgia Forestry Commission, 90% of the state's forests are privately owned. Trees are family wealth in the South. When a plot of pine trees matures about once a generation, a family will cut them and cash in. But the slow-growing knotty hardwoods crowd out the pines, so they get burnt out along the way. Rivers says out West where the federal government owns most of the land, there isn't the same profit motive to burn out the wildfire kindling. And there are other challenges, too.
RIVERS: They need to be doing prescribed burning. They need to be managing the fuel. But they don't do it. It's hands off. So you see the results of that.
BLANKENSHIP: In the Pacific Northwest, the results have been decades of wildfire fuel piling up largely unchecked in the region's forests. That's the major finding of a new study by Ryan Haugo of the Nature Conservancy and others. And Haugo says climate change will only make Western wildfires more destructive in the future.
RYAN HAUGO: Yes, that's definitely a concern of ours that with repeated or with large, extensive, high-severity fire, some areas that are forest now will no longer be forest in the future.
BLANKENSHIP: Haugo says grasses could take over where today ponderosa pines stand. To prevent that, he says, Western states need to find a way to make controlled burning as routine and common as it is in the South. For NPR News, I'm Grant Blankenship in Macon, Ga.

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) As long as you're white, male and from an elite college like your writing staff.
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) We need to hire a woman.
DENIS O'HARE: (As Brad) Would a gay guy work?
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) No.
MONDELLO: Who they hire is Mindy Kaling, who just happens to have written this movie's script.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LATE NIGHT"")
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) I need you to help me change this show.
MINDY KALING: (As Molly Patel) No more tantrums and no withering looks like that one.
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) That's my face.
MONDELLO: ""Late Night"" leads a parade of films that center on women this summer, including ""Where'd You Go, Bernadette"" based on the bestselling novel of that title and starring Cate Blanchett.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE"")
CATE BLANCHETT: (As Bernadette Fox) I have this one shot to launch my second act, so step aside 'cause I am about to kick the hell out of life.
MONDELLO: Awkwafina plays a woman in the drama ""The Farewell"" whose family is keeping a secret.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE FAREWELL"")
AWKWAFINA: (As Billi) What's wrong, Dad?
DIANA LIN: (As Jian) Your nan is dying.
TZI MA: (As Haiyan) She doesn't know, so you can't say anything. The family thinks it's better not to tell her.
AWKWAFINA: (As Billi) Why is that better?
MONDELLO: There's also a feminist take on ""Hamlet"" called ""Ophelia"" and told from her point of view.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""OPHELIA"")
DAISY RIDLEY: (As Ophelia) Hamlet, we can escape now. Come.
CLIVE OWEN: (As Claudius) I think Ophelia is dangerous.
MONDELLO: Elsewhere a woman journeys from Scotland to Nashville to become a country singer in ""Wild Rose."" ""The Kitchen"" features Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish as mob wives who take over when their gangster husbands go to prison. An all-female nautical team circles the globe in the documentary ""Maiden,"" and the author Toni Morrison waxes irreverent in another documentary, ""The Pieces I Am.""
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""TONI MORRISON: THE PIECES I AM"")
TONI MORRISON: A friend of mine called me up early in the morning and said, Toni, you won the Nobel Prize. And I remember holding phone thinking she must be drunk.
MONDELLO: While we're talking documentaries, let's mention a couple about musicians, another theme of the summer. There's ""David Crosby: Remember My Name"" about the 77-year-old rock star's often-challenging journey through life and Ron Howard's affectionate operatic portrait ""Pavarotti.""
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""PAVAROTTI"")
LUCIANO PAVAROTTI: I learned to love people.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You're a trusting person.
PAVAROTTI: Are you joking? I will not exist if I don't trust people.
MONDELLO: There's also a musical biopic that got a four-minute standing ovation last week at the Cannes Film Fest.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ROCKETMAN"")
TARON EGERTON: (As Elton John) So how does a fat boy from nowhere get to be a soul man?
MONDELLO: It's called ""Rocketman.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ROCKETMAN"")
EGERTON: (As Elton John) I'm thinking of changing my name to Elton.
EVAN WALSH: (As Elton Dean) That's my name.
EGERTON: (As Elton John) Yeah, I know.
MONDELLO: Taron Egerton did his own singing as Elton John, and the director is the guy who got called in at the last minute to rescue ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" a film to which ""Rocketman"" would very much like to be compared. Two other films take a sideways look at famous musicians. ""Blinded By The Light"" is the true story of a kid who grew up in Maggie Thatcher's England obsessing over a singer who was not popular with his friends or with his Muslim Pakistani family.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""BLINDED BY THE LIGHT"")
VIVEIK KALRA: (As Javed) Who's that?
AARON PHAGURA: (As Roops) The boss.
KALRA: (As Javed) Whose boss?
PHAGURA: (As Roops) Springsteen - he's more what your dad listens to.
KALRA: (As Javed) Not my dad.
MONDELLO: And the most eccentric musician movie this summer is ""Yesterday"" about a band that suddenly disappears from the memory of everyone in the world except one guy who's been doing cover versions of their songs for years.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""YESTERDAY"")
HIMESH PATEL: (As Jack Malik, singing) Yesterday...
LILY JAMES: (As Ellie Appleton) When did you write that?
PATEL: (As Jack Malik) I didn't write it. Paul McCartney wrote it - the Beatles.
JAMES: (As Ellie Appleton) Who?
MONDELLO: No one except Jack has ever heard of the Fab Four.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""YESTERDAY"")
PATEL: (As Jack Malik) John, Paul, George and Ringo, the Beatles.
MONDELLO: Not a glimmer.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""YESTERDAY"")
PATEL: (As Jack Malik) Do you genuinely not know who the Beatles are?
JAMES: (As Ellie Appleton) Genuinely.
PATEL: (As Jack Malik) Then I'm in a really, really, really complicated situation.
MONDELLO: Also a situation where he could get really, really, really rich releasing their songs. Other comedies include the social satire ""The Last Black Man In San Francisco"" about gentrification and reclaiming your heritage; a wonderfully shaggy, entirely improvised goof involving civil war memorabilia called ""Sword Of Trust"" and ""Stuber"" about an extremely mild-mannered guy named Stu who drives for Uber. He's played by Kumail Nanjiani. And one night...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""STUBER"")
DAVE BAUTISTA: (As Vic) Compton.
MONDELLO: ...He picks up Dave Bautista.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""STUBER"")
BAUTISTA: (As Vic) I'm LAPD. Let's go.
NANJIANI: (As Stu) Well, do you have a more specific address?
BAUTISTA: (As Vic) Compton.
NANJIANI: (As Stu) Stop yelling neighborhoods. That's not how Uber works.
MONDELLO: Also mild-mannered - Jesse Eisenberg determined to become bolder in ""The Art Of Self-Defense"" by enrolling in a very weird karate class.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE ART OF SELF-DEFENSE"")
ALESSANDRO NIVOLA: (As Sensei) Today's lesson - to kick with your fists and punch with your feet.
JESSE EISENBERG: (As Casey) That makes perfect sense.
MONDELLO: The opposite of mild-mannered are the kids in ""Good Boys,"" an R-rated comedy that's sort of an elementary school ""Superbad.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""GOOD BOYS"")
BRADY NOON: (As Thor) Two weeks into sixth grade, and I'm already a social piranha.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, chanting) Sippy cup, sippy cup.
NOON: (As Thor) Does this look like a sippy cup? No, it's a [expletive] juice box 'cause I'm not a [expletive] child.
MONDELLO: ""Good Boys"" is clearly not suitable for children. But there are plenty of films that are, many of them with Roman numerals after their titles - ""Angry Birds 2"" (ph), ""Secret Life Of Pets 2,"" ""Toy Story 4""...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""TOY STORY 4"")
TOM HANKS: (As Woody) Bonnie made a friend in class.
(CROSSTALK)
BONNIE HUNT: (As Dolly) Oh, she's already making friends.
HANKS: (As Woody) No, no, she literally made a new friend. I want you to meet Forky.
TONY HALE: (As Forky) Hi.
TIMOTHY DALTON: (As Mr. Pricklepants) He's a spork.
MONDELLO: ...And the digital live-action remake that's been wetting appetites since the vocal cast was first announced.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE LION KING"")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Nants ingonyama...
MONDELLO: ...""The Lion King"" with Donald Glover as Simba, Beyonce as Nala and, as Mufasa, bringing us full circle in the circle of life, the familiar rumble of James Earl Jones.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE LION KING"")
JAMES EARL JONES: (As Mufasa) Remember.
MONDELLO: A summer where everything you see exists together in a delicate balance. I'm Bob Mondello.

"Bill Buckner, Red Sox Scapegoat Later Embraced By Fans, Dies",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358719/bill-buckner-red-sox-scapegoat-later-embraced-by-fans-dies,"Former Boston Red Sox first-baseman Bill Buckner has died at 69. Best known for a fielding error that helped cost Boston the 1986 World Series, Buckner was cheered by Red Sox fans in recent years.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Being remembered for a mistake is hard. Being the living symbol of 86 years of futility is just about impossible. That is what Bill Buckner was to Boston Red Sox fans for two decades.
Buckner died today at the age of 69. He was an All-Star player, won the National League batting title in 1980. He had a very good 22-season career, might have been remembered as a great career, if not for one moment. 1986 - the World Series between the Red Sox and the New York Mets.
Late in Game 6, the Red Sox had a two-run lead. They were one strike away from winning their first world championship since 1918. But the Mets tied the game in the 10th inning with a runner on second base. A hit would give them the win and force a Game 7. Turns out all it actually took was the most famous error in baseball history.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
VIN SCULLY: Little roller up along first, behind the bag. It gets through Buckner. Here comes Knight. And the Mets win it.
KELLY: That little roller went right though Bill Buckner's legs. The Mets won, and then they went on to win the World Series the next night. Buckner's error turned the first baseman into a scapegoat. ""Buckner Boots Big Grounder"" was the next day's headline in the Boston Herald. Fans piled on. The media piled on. One reporter allegedly called Buckner's wife to ask if Buckner was contemplating suicide. And Buckner received death threats.
The public scorn was so intense that after he retired, he moved his family to Idaho. Few people there cared who Buckner was or what role he'd played in the 1986 World Series. It wasn't until 2004 that Buckner and Boston were on their way to making peace.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOE BUCK: Back to Foulke. Red Sox fans have longed to hear it. The Boston Red Sox are world champions.
KELLY: It started with the Red Sox finally winning their first World Series in 86 years' time. And, of course, sweet victory heal all wounds. Still, it took another four years for Buckner to come home to Fenway Park.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Won't you please welcome him back to Boston and let him know that he is welcome always? No. 6, Bill Buckner.
(CHEERING)
KELLY: Fans there giving Buckner a two-minute ovation. Later, when he was asked if he'd had second thoughts about returning to Fenway, Bill Buckner struggled to hold back tears.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BILL BUCKNER: I really had to forgive the - not the fans of Boston, just per se, but I would say - I would have to say, in my heart, I had to forgive the media, you know, for what, you know, they put me and my family through. So you know, I've done that. I'm over that.
KELLY: In the next day's Boston Herald, the headline was, ""All Is Forgiven.""
Bill Buckner died today, surrounded by family, after a long battle with dementia. He was 69 years old.
[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this story, we incorrectly say that the Mets went on to win the World Series one night after Bill Buckner’s error. In fact, the decisive seventh game was played two nights later.]

"France Won't Take Its ISIS Fighters Back, But It Doesn't Want Them Executed Either",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358705/france-wont-take-its-isis-fighters-back-but-it-doesnt-want-them-executed-either,"France doesn't want to bring back French ISIS members captured in Iraq, but French authorities are dismayed that an Iraqi court has sentenced four of them to death.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
In Iraq, a court has sentenced four French members of ISIS to death. They're among a dozen French citizens who were captured and handed over to Iraqi authorities to be tried. And they illustrate what happens when a country - in this case, France - decides not to try their citizens at home. NPR's Jane Arraf has been following the trial. She joins us from Irbil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq in the north of Iraq. Hi, Jane.
JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.
KELLY: So tell us more about who these ISIS fighters are.
ARRAF: So a lot of these are dual nationals, some from North Africa. The ones that have been sentenced to death Sunday and Monday, they include a postal worker, a truck driver, a military contractor. And they're all appearing in Baghdad's counterterrorism court. So these prisoners come in, and they're dressed in yellow shirts and trousers. There are rows of seats with French consular officials as well as journalists watching. And they're brought in, and they stand in this wooden dock kind of like a cage.
So one of the men was brought in. He's an Algerian French citizen, 33 years old. And he told the judge he was actually tortured in detention. So the judge postponed his case for a medical investigation. Another one came in. He actually started to cry. I mean, very often, they don't react at all, but this man started to cry. And the judge asked him to lift up his shirt to see if he'd been tortured. He appeared not to have been, according to the judge, and they proceeded with it. And he was sentenced to hang.
A lot of these people are saying that they didn't fight for ISIS, but Iraq says it has evidence that they did. And even if they didn't fight, its terrorism laws are so sweeping that even being convicted of being a member of ISIS can land you with the death penalty.
KELLY: And why does France not want to try these? You mentioned some of them are dual nationals, but they're French citizens. Why don't they want to try them in France?
ARRAF: Well, part of it is France was the country where most of the Western Europeans who went to fight for ISIS came from. And France, like other countries, is worried that if they bring them back, they won't have the evidence to convict them there. It's a much higher bar there, particularly since the crimes were committed in this region. Also there's a lot of public opposition to bringing them back.
KELLY: And opposition, I guess, to if they're not able to convict based on evidence in Western Europe, then these people might just be let go and released back onto the streets.
ARRAF: Absolutely. But here's the big problem. They've been sentenced to death. And France, along with almost every other European country, bans the death penalty. At the same time, it did not oppose them being brought to Iraq from Syria where they were captured knowing that they could well be sentenced to the death penalty.
KELLY: So what has been the reaction in France to these sentences?
ARRAF: So France is basically saying that ISIS members need to be held accountable for their crimes where they committed the crimes, in this case partly Iraq. And it said they were making sure that they had the assistance of defense lawyers. And there is an automatic appeal for this. It normally doesn't result in overturning the conviction, but France has said that it is noting to Iraqi authorities that it opposes the death penalty. Now, that's not expected to carry a lot of weight. But there you go.
KELLY: You mentioned that some of these people were transferred over from custody in Syria. What happens to - there's something like 1,200 foreigners still in custody in Syria. What happens to them?
ARRAF: So that is a really big question because these are people from more than 30 different countries. And the Kurdish Syrian forces there can't really handle them. They don't have the capacity. Also it's a region that's not really recognized by anyone. They have all these people because that's where ISIS made its last stand in Syria. That's where they were defeated. The Kurds there are saying they need an international tribunal. They need other countries to step up and put these people on trial, put their own citizens on trial but preferably somewhere here in the region.
KELLY: And transferring more to Iraq, is that another option?
ARRAF: That is a possible option. And Iraq is seemingly willing to put some of these people on trial if, of course, it's compensated for the cost of doing so. But there, again, as we saw today in the trial, there is the risk of torture. There is the fact that these trials aren't considered being run to international human rights standards or Western legal standards. But ISIS and what's left of ISIS and the trials are this huge, lingering problem that everyone is still trying to grapple with.
KELLY: NPR's Jane Arraf in Irbil that's in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, thanks very much.
ARRAF: Thank you.

Analysis: Voters Choose A New Direction For Europe's Future,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358698/analysis-voters-choose-a-new-direction-for-europes-future,"Roger Cohen, columnist for The New York Times , analyzes the European Union vote for NPR's Mary Louise Kelly, including the high turnout and the success of the EU's green parties.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Roger Cohen is here to help us understand a little bit more about what these election results mean. He is a columnist for The New York Times. He joins us now from Paris.
Roger Cohen, welcome.
ROGER COHEN: Thank you, Mary Louise.
KELLY: So the story going into the elections here was that they would reflect the rise of the far-right, the rise of the populist parties in Europe. And those parties did make gains, but they didn't win as big as a lot of people were expecting. What do you think happened?
COHEN: Well, there were significant gains for the populist far-right, particularly in Italy, where Matteo Salvini got 34% of the vote compared to about 6% five years ago - and also in Britain, where Nigel Farage, with his Brexit Party, also got over 30%. But I think in the end, there was also a reaction to the current situation from the Greens, who did very well. And the liberal democratic parties managed to maintain a majority.
It was never thought that the far-right parties would gain a majority in the Parliament. It was thought that they would make headway, and they did - just not quite as dramatic. Still, you get somebody like Viktor Orban in Hungary getting 54% there. So I would say it's still significant. And what's very significant is the collapse of a lot of the mainstream parties.
Here in France, you have the complete collapse of the Socialist Party. You have the complete collapse of the moderate right. In Britain, you have the collapse of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. So there are new forces emerging in Europe, and that's not going to change.
KELLY: Well, let me tease out a couple of things you touched on there. Number one, Green parties did very well. What does that tell us about the state of Europe?
COHEN: Well, it tells us that despite the nationalist surge, there are a lot of people - young people, in particular - who are deeply concerned about climate change and who understand that this issue, like, I would say, most issues in the world today, cannot really be tackled at a national level. They require a transnational response. They require a European response. And so in this European election, they mobilized.
KELLY: Is there a generational thing going on here, too? Younger voters tend to skew...
COHEN: Definitely, definitely.
KELLY: ...Toward the Green parties.
COHEN: These are younger voters. Look, there's a great deal of weariness, even disgust, with politics as usual. We've been seeing that since 2008. It's given birth to the populist, rightist surge that we all know about and that we've observed, also, in the United States.
But that's not the only form it takes. It's also taken the form of this sudden rise of the Greens. There are various splinter parties also on the left. And if I was to name one overwhelming characteristic of this election, it's that the parties that we've gotten used to having govern Europe are fading away.
KELLY: So big picture - if you look at these election results and you're trying to figure out where Europe is headed, what message did voters deliver?
COHEN: Well, it was not a bad day for Europe. The European Union is not about to disappear. It's not about to be taken over by far-right, anti-European populist parties. That said, there's immense dissatisfaction across Europe with the way politics have been conducted over the last five to 10 years, certainly since the economic meltdown of 2008. And that is expressed in the virtual demise of parties that have been at the center of European politics for decades, like the Socialist Party in France, like the two main parties - centrist parties in Italy.
And you're seeing a lot of dissatisfaction expressed but not a demand for the complete breakup of the European project. On the contrary, people voted in far greater numbers in these elections for a long time. What does that mean? That means they're engaged in the European idea.
KELLY: Roger Cohen, thanks so much.
COHEN: Thank you very much indeed.
KELLY: He's a columnist for The New York Times, speaking to us there from Paris about this past weekend's European elections.

"Far-Right, Green Parties Break 40-Year Centrist Majority In EU Parliament",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358691/far-right-green-parties-break-40-year-centrist-majority-in-eu-parliament,"Far-right wins in Sunday's EU parliament elections produced more of a strong ripple than a wave, but the centrist coalition that has governed for 40 years did lose its majority.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
The elections for the EU Parliament are over. The results are in, and the dust is settling. There was not a massive far-right populist wave as many had predicted, though populist wins did cause - call it a strong ripple. And the coalition of mainstream centrist parties lost the majority after dominating the European Union for the last 40 years. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley is in Paris, and she begins our coverage.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: In France, the European Parliament election was also about President Emmanuel Macron. The fervently pro-EU leader invested hugely and personally in the campaign. So when Marine Le Pen's National Rally narrowly beat Macron's party, she used her victory speech to press for change at home.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French).
BEARDSLEY: Le Pen demanded that Macron dissolve the French National Assembly to reflect the new reality. The elections for the EU Parliament had implications for domestic politics in many countries. In Britain, where the Brexit Party added 24 seats while the mainstream Tories and Labour were pummeled, Nigel Farage called the vote a mandate for a hard Brexit now.
Turnout was more than 50% across the EU, the biggest in 25 years. At this polling station in Paris, 30-year-old physiotherapist Jean Baptiste Perche (ph) said he felt a sense of duty.
JEAN BAPTISTE PERCHE: You can't judge what's going on in Europe if you don't vote, so I think it's important.
BEARDSLEY: Green parties made huge gains, and environmentalists are now the third largest bloc in the Parliament.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian).
BEARDSLEY: As expected, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's right-wing League came in first place in Italy. The populist darling aims to bring Europe's far-right together.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SALVINI: (Speaking Italian).
BEARDSLEY: ""The vote shows the rules must change,"" he said. ""A new Europe is born, one that is tired of the elites being in power and of finance and multinationals."" But European Union expert Douglas Webber doesn't believe the disparate Euroskeptic parties will be able to come together to make big change. He says they don't agree about relations with Russia, free markets or even about migration.
DOUGLAS WEBBER: For example, Italy would like other member states to take more of the refugees that are currently in Italy. But governments, such as that of Mr. Orban in Hungary, of course, are opposed to this.
BEARDSLEY: Webber says the new parliament, now more fragmented, will have to build new coalitions and alliances to govern. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris.

Need A Child Care Subsidy? This Mom Would Tell You Not To Hold Your Breath,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358684/need-a-child-care-subsidy-this-mom-would-tell-you-not-to-hold-your-breath,"Nationwide, the demand for subsidized child care exceeds the supply: Only 1 in 6 eligible kids actually get subsidies. In Sacramento, mom Jacquelyne Gettone has been on the waiting list for a decade.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
To another story now, finding quality, affordable child care, which can be tough, especially for families living paycheck-to-paycheck. Every state in the country follows - every state in the country offers federally subsidized child care, which is meant to offset some of the costs. But only about 1 in 6 kids who qualify for the care actually receive it. From member station KQED, Katie Orr reports on what daily life is like for one mom on the waitlist for subsidized child care.
KATIE ORR, BYLINE: It's 5:30 in the morning, and like every weekday, Jacquelyne Gettone is up preparing for the day. She quickly irons the blazer she'll wear to work and the shirt her 2-year-old son, Matthew, will wear to day care. Before too long, she hears Matthew crying in the bedroom, and she goes to scoop him out of bed.
JACQUELYNE GETTONE: Good morning, Matty (ph).
MATTHEW GETTONE: (Crying).
GETTONE: Come on, Papa.
ORR: The toddler is still sleepy and a bit fussy. But there's little time to ease him into the day. They need to be out the front door by 6. She takes Matthew to a day care she can afford about 30 minutes away. She works in downtown Oakland, another 40 minutes away from there. Without a car, they face a complex commute involving a combination of Uber rides and commuter train trips that can take anywhere from 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
GETTONE: In between waiting on Ubers, depending on if an Uber is three minutes away or 20 minutes away, it's, like, a gamble.
ORR: After a short ride to the station, Gettone hurries to catch her train. Little Matthew has chosen this very moment to have a meltdown, as 2-year-olds do.
MATTHEW: (Crying).
GETTONE: I feel like that too, sometimes.
ORR: So Gettone picks him up while I grab the toddler-sized car seat she carries with her each day. She sprints down the stairs to the train and just barely makes it. As she and Matthew settle in, I have to wonder, how does she do this each day on her own?
But while she's alone in handling her daily commute, Gettone is not alone in waiting for a subsidy that would help her afford child care. Katie Hamm, with the Center for American Progress, says in most of the country, it costs about $10,000 a year to enroll a child in a day care center. And she says a lot of people just can't afford that without subsidies.
KATIE HAMM: So in nearly every state there is either a long waiting list or there are just a lot of families turned away, and the state doesn't even bother keeping a waiting list.
ORR: For Gettone, a subsidy could help her save money for other things, like a car. But it's unlikely she'll receive one. Matthew's been on the waiting list for over a year. Her 12-year-old daughter, Margeaux, has been waiting since she was a baby and never got off the waitlist. Hamm says that's also a common occurrence. One reason for that, there simply aren't enough child care providers.
HAMM: There's not a lot of profit to be made in child care. So to operate a child care, to have highly qualified teachers and a curriculum and materials, is an expensive proposition.
ORR: In fact, Hamm says, about half of Americans live in child care deserts, where the need for care far outweighs the supply of licensed care providers. But while the picture looks bleak, there may be some reason for hope. Child care is still a rare bipartisan issue in Congress. As part of a two-year federal spending agreement in 2018, lawmakers allocated about $5 billion to support state-subsidized child care, the largest ever increase. This year, Congress is proposing an additional 2.4 billion. For NPR News, I'm Katie Orr in Sacramento.
