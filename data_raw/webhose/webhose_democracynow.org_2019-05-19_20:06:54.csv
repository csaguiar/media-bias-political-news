Joe Biden’s Son Hunter Is Invested in China’s Mass Surveillance Program Used to Monitor Uyghurs | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/7/joe_bidens_son_hunter_is_invested,"Joe Biden’s Son Hunter Is Invested in China’s Mass Surveillance Program Used to Monitor Uyghur Muslims Story May 07, 2019 investigative journalist for The Intercept.

As the United Nations accuses the Chinese government of setting up massive camps in the far-west Xinjiang province to imprison an unknown number of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims, Human Rights Watch reports that China is carrying out mass surveillance there using a mobile app that lets authorities monitor the Muslim population. We speak with investigative reporter Lee Fang about an unexpected investor in Chinese surveillance: Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son. And we speak with Human Rights Watch China director Sophie Richardson. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. Donate Related Story investigative journalist for The Intercept. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : I just want to let people know, for people who are reading about this, Uyghur is spelled U-Y-G-H-U-R. That’s Uyghur. We are joined also by Lee Fang, investigative journalist with The Intercept , to look at the unexpected investor in Chinese surveillance: Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. Fang’s most recent article is headlined Chinese Fund Backed By Hunter Biden Invested In Technology Used To Surveil Muslims . Lee, thanks for joining us again on Democracy Now! Explain what you learned.
LEE FANG : Amy, thanks for having me. China’s sprawling police state relies heavily on a high-tech security apparatus to monitor, track and incarcerate those viewed as a threat to the Chinese state. That’s dissidents, activists, journalists and increasingly the entire Uyghur Muslim population in Western China. And a key component of this security apparatus is the collection of biometric data. This biometric data collection comes from a number of private sector firms. One of the major Chinese startups involved in this biometric data collection is a company called Face++. This is a facial recognition software company, a Chinese company. It provided a key license to the app that Sophie has explained, and it’s also used in security cameras all over the country. Now, in the last week we have seen a number of Western reports scrutinizing the Chinese investors that stand to profit, that have invested in Face++. But in our story on Friday, we revealed that there are a number of American investors that also stand to profit from this mass surveillance that are also invested in Face++, one of whom is Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And Lee, how exactly did — and when — did Hunter Biden form his Chinese investment company, Bohai Harvest RST ? How did that come about?
LEE FANG : Well, over the last 10 years, Hunter Biden has been involved in a number of investment opportunities and business deals. In 2008, he de-registered as a lobbyist and transitioned into this investment career. In 2014, he traveled to China and formed this very exclusive investor partnership with the Chinese government, partnering with the Bank of China. That’s one of the largest state owned banks. And in 2017, Hunter Biden and his company, Bohai Harvest RST , participated in the C Series investment round in Face++, helping the company raise over $400 million, bringing its valuation to currently over $3 billion. So he’s far from a passive investor. In fact, this business deal shows that he has been given really exclusive access to investing in some Chinese—China’s most largest technology companies. And he certainly stands to benefit as this company continues to grow.
AMY GOODMAN : There are Democrats who have pointed out that this issue of Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, the presidential candidate’s son, is being pushed by, oh, The Daily Caller and Fox to discredit Biden. Your response, Lee Fang?
LEE FANG : Look, the tactic by special interests, both domestic and foreign, to put politicians on the payroll of any interest group seeking to seek influence over a powerful politician is a bipartisan issue. It is not a right-wing issue or a left-wing issue. I can go through a laundry list of Democrats and Republicans in Congress who have had family members, sons and daughters or spouses, that were added to lobbying firms or corporations to peddle influence.
And this dynamic extends certainly to the White House as well. The Trump sons, including Don Jr., have received exclusive licensing agreements and permits to expand Trump hotels in Indonesia and in India and so on. Ivanka has received special licenses to sell her products in China. We see this dynamic and this criticism, in addition to the Biden family, coming from folks from across the ideological spectrum, and it is not particular to the China issue.
In 2003, one of the most controversial votes Joe Biden took—he joined with Republicans to pass the 2003 bankruptcy bill. At the time, one of the largest credit card issuers in the country was MBNA , which was lobbying for that legislation. MBNA hired Hunter Biden as a consultant at a time when they were lobbying for Joe Biden to pass that law. In 2014, when Joe Biden was engaged in high-stakes negotiations in Ukraine at a time at the height of Russian aggression in that region, Hunter Biden was hired and placed on the board of a major Ukrainian fracking company, paid as much as $50,000 a month.
And now with this China issue, we’re seeing a lot of criticism of Joe Biden and his son, because again, Hunter Biden gained exclusive access to this very unusual investment vehicle, investment deal, with the Chinese state at a time when Joe Biden was leading negotiations, traveling between Beijing and Washington, D.C., as the vice president. And it will pose serious conflicts of interest as Joe Biden seeks the presidential nomination.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That’s one thing I wanted to ask you about. Because clearly, this would, to some critics of the corporate wing of the Democratic party, this will definitely give them cause to raise that this is a repetition of the Clinton family’s corruption issues over their dealings with foreign governments as well.
LEE FANG : Well, that certainly may be a political issue, but it is also a genuine policy concern for any observer or any critic of U.S.-China relations. And look, it is not exclusive to the Biden family. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, was once a big critic of China policy, of China human rights. Later he became a big proponent of trade relations with China and kind of ended his very vocal criticism of China. Later, actually after the 2016 election, Mitch McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chow, was added to the board of Bank of China. There are many instances, both Republican and Democrat, where China has attempted to seek influence with powerful policy figures.
Joe Biden, I should note, has long been a friend of China. In 2000, when there was a major vote about permanent normal trade relations with China, Joe Biden rallied Democratic support and he basically argued that China does not pose an economic threat to the U.S. That China, at the time—this was in the year 2000—had the economy of the size of the Netherlands, and that China would never pose a threat to American manufacturing. So Joe Biden has been a friend of China for a very long time, and it appears China has been very friendly to the Joe Biden family as well.
AMY GOODMAN : Sophie Richardson, I wanted to ask you about this Foreign Policy article that was out in March headlined U.S. Firms Are Helping Build China’s Orwellian State . Can you talk about this and how this relates to the mass surveillance, particularly of the Muslim community in China?
SOPHIE RICHARDSON : Sure. Just picking up on one of Lee’s points, I think American companies and funds and portfolios of investments that are engaged with Chinese surveillance companies need to stop right now and have a long, close look at what exactly they are invested in, and where they actually want to be putting money. But we looked at one particular company, a Massachusetts-based medical technology firm called Thermo Fisher Scientific, which we found to be selling DNA sequencers to the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. For which they had the right export licensesÑlet’s be clear about that. But they were doing so at a time when we were documenting the Xinjiang authorities imposing compulsory collection of DNA samples from everyone across the region between the ages of 12 and 65, under the guise of a free public healthcare program.
And we went to this company several times and said, “What’s your due diligence strategy to make sure that your sales and operations aren’t contributing to human rights violations?” And they never really answered that question. Members of Congress asked them. And finally The New York Times wrote about their activities, at which point the company said, “We’ve decided to stop selling this particular technology in that particular region.” But we don’t know what they continue to sell to other parts of the country. And the reality is we still aren’t any clearer about what strategies they have in place to answer that due diligence question. And I think that applies equally to any company—American, European, Australian, anyone’s companies—that are doing business in a region that has been labeled by U.N. experts as a rights-free zone.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you about a separate China-related issue. Last week, tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong marched peacefully against a proposal that would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China for trial, where they would obviously face fewer protections than in Hong Kong, which has long operated under the “one country, two systems” mantra. Could you talk about that and your concerns about that?
SOPHIE RICHARDSON : Sure. I think if this agreement goes ahead, we have gone really from “one country, two systems” to “one country, one system” because it would effectively gut some of the protections that have long been available to people in Hong Kong, but not in the rest of Mainland China, if they are to be extradited. There are all sorts of ramifications for knowing the evidence against you and having access to counsel. And it has been seen widely in Hong Kong in the last couple of weeks as a serious encroachment, particularly in Hong Kong’s judicial independence and integrity. And that is an institution in Hong Kong that has always stood the territory apart from the rest of the mainland, and if it loses that kind of authority and integrity, it really is seen as Hong Kong just becoming another part of the mainland.
AMY GOODMAN : And finally, on this trade negotiation that is taking place this week, Sophie, President Trump announcing plans to increase tariffs $200 billion, from 10% to 25%. Also threatening to impose new tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese products.
Your thoughts about this move, regarding trade with China? And just as the Trump administration says they will not impose any kind of sanctions related to what we are talking about.
SOPHIE RICHARDSON : We don’t particularly have a view on things like tariffs. We have a lot of views on the use of sanctions, particularly the Global Magnitsky sanctions, which are meant to be imposed on individuals or entities that are credibly alleged to have been involved in serious human rights violations. So people like the current Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo would clearly be a target for precisely these kinds of sanctions. And especially given Secretary Pompeo’s and other administration officials’ willingness to be publicly very critical of China’s actions in Xinjiang, the fact that the administration is not going ahead with these kinds of sanctions is not just giving China a free pass and enabling it; it is really undercutting the very purpose of those sanctions at all.
And so it is also worth pointing out that this is an administration that doesn’t seem to have trouble sanctioning lots of different people and companies for different kinds of behavior. And so the unwillingness on this particular matter is seriously problematic and really effectively is saying to the Chinese government, “Do what you want in Xinjiang,” and saying to Uyghurs, “We’re not actually really concerned about what’s happening to you or your family members.”
AMY GOODMAN : Sophie Richardson, we want to thank you very much for being with us. China director for Human Rights Watch. We’re going to link to your whole comprehensive report .

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We end today’s show looking at Republican efforts to suppress the vote in Florida. Civil rights groups are decrying what they say is a new poll tax after the Florida Senate passed a bill Friday that would require formerly incarcerated people with felony convictions to repay all fines and fees to courts before their voting rights are restored. This comes six month after voters in Florida approved a measure to restore voting rights to 1.4 million people with nonviolent felonies who have fully completed their sentences, overturning a Jim Crow-era law aimed at keeping African Americans from voting. One in five African Americans in Florida and 10% of the state’s adult population have been ineligible to vote because of a criminal record.
AMY GOODMAN : Nearly 65% of voters approved the constitutional amendment to reenfranchise people with former felony convictions in November. It was hailed as the biggest win for voting rights around the country in decades with the potential to sway the 2020 election and beyond. But the Florida legislature’s vote threatens to keep tens of thousands from the ballot boxes. Florida Democrats are urging Republican governor Ron DeSantis to veto the legislation, saying in a statement “If the voter suppression measures go into effect, DeSantis will be known as the Jim Crow Governor.”
We go now to Desmond Meade, President of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, chair of the Floridians for a Fair Democracy. He spearheaded Amendment 4, which has reenfranchised 1.4 million Floridians, including himself. Or so he hoped. Desmond Meade, welcome back to Democracy Now! What is going on here? The amendment passed overwhelmingly. Explain what the governor and the legislature—governor hasn’t signed this yet, but—are pushing.
DESMOND MEADE : Yes. First of all, good morning, Amy, and thank you for having me back again on your show. I will start off by saying that what we were able to accomplish in November of 2018 still remains intact. At the heart of Amendment 4 was the fact that we abolished a 150-year-old Jim Crow law in Florida. Prior to Amendment 4 passing, anyone convicted of a felony offense faced a lifetime bar from voting. And so we effectively removed that. And no matter what the legislature comes up with, that victory still remains intact.
AMY GOODMAN : But what about this—what people are calling a poll tax? How are they going to limit the 1.4 million people who potentially could become voters again?
DESMOND MEADE : When you talk about the impact that the restoration of voting rights would have even on future elections, when we look at the impact of this legislation, it only—we’re estimating that it impacts about 700,000 returning citizens. That leaves another 700,000 who would not be impacted at all by this legislation. And as an organization that speaks for or on behalf of returning citizens, what we’re focused on mostly is how can we engage those 700,000 people and get them registered to vote and get them voting? Because at the end of the day, you’re talking about a state in which it took only took 30,000 votes to decide the governor, 15,000 to decide the congressman and about 100,000 to decide the president of United States.
Now, as a relates to the legislation that is before the governor now to sign, there are still some gems in that legislation that would allow the 700,000 that are impacted to have a much easier pathway to voting. In that legislation, they give the judge—a judge has the authority to waive those financial obligations or convert them to community service hours. And so that is some bright spots that’s in that legislation coming out. And that is what we are moving forward on.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Desmond, in terms of the impact of the original referendum vote, Florida has 21 million people. It’s the third-largest state in the union, clearly the largest battleground state. And the impact on the presidential election of 2020 that could be had by those 700,000 at least getting registered—what has been the progress so far in getting people registered?
DESMOND MEADE : So one of the things—first of all, our organization has already registered over 5,000 returning citizens. And then there are multiple organizations that are out there registering folks. And we have returning citizens that are registering on their own. And so there are literally thousands of returning citizens that have already been added to the roster, myself included. I registered to vote in January. I received my voter registration card and looking forward to participating. I think what is crucial, what is important for us as returning citizens, is that we are looking to impact every election along the lines of the issues that impact people with felony convictions and their family members. We’re looking to impact elections based around criminal justice reform.
AMY GOODMAN : Why do you choose to use that term “returning citizens”?
DESMOND MEADE : When we first started, what we found was that when you refer to someone as an ex-con or ex-felon, you actually increase the likely of them recidivating. We’ve heard that if you call a child stupid growing up, eventually that child will believe that. And so we are a group that is committed to increasing public safety. We are a group that is committed to becoming assets in our community. And so we use the term “returning citizens” to put a more positive energy out there, to encourage folks who have made mistakes in the past that they are not less than human, that they are a citizen, that they are a human being that can be contributing members of society.
AMY GOODMAN : Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the Florida gubernatorial election to DeSantis in November, tweeted “Amendment 4 got a million more votes than me and a million more votes than Governor Ron DeSantis. The governor would be well advised to veto this poll tax. Voters spoke loud and clear — we believe in second chances.” We have 10 seconds, Desmond Meade. Do you think DeSantis is signing off on this?
DESMOND MEADE : Chances are he is going to sign off on it. We know that during his campaign, he called for implementation legislation. We believe that there should not be implementation legislation. Is this the legislation that we would like? No, we don’t like it. But we know that there are some gems in it, and we’re going to do our best to create a more inclusive and vibrant democracy in the state of Florida, and we will have an impact in 2020 and beyond.
AMY GOODMAN : Desmond Meade, we want to thank you for being with us. President of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, chair of the Floridians for a Fair Democracy. I’m Amy Goodman with Juan González. Thanks for joining us. The Up Next"

Cecile Richards: Georgia’s New “Fetal Heartbeat” Bill Criminalizes Women Who Seek Abortions | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/8/cecile_richards_georgia_s_new_fetal,"co-founder of Supermajority and former president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s talk about what has just happened in Georgia. The Republican governor who beat Stacey Abrams, Brian Kemp, who was secretary of state—and she has sued over his both remaining secretary of state in charge of the elections and running for governor. But the Republican governor, Brian Kemp has signed into law a six-week abortion ban, or so-called “fetal heartbeat law.” It bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, something that typically happens just six weeks into a pregnancy and before many women realize they’re pregnant. This is Kemp speaking at the signing of the bill on Tuesday.
GOV . BRIAN KEMP : The LIFE Act is very simple, but also very powerful. A declaration that all life has value, that all life matters, and that all life is worthy of protection. I understand, like the others have said, that some oppose this legislation. I realize that some may challenge it in the court of law. But our job is to do what is right, not what is easy. We are called to be strong and courageous, and we will not back down. We will always continue to fight for life.
AMY GOODMAN : So that’s Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp, the latest in a series of attacks on reproductive rights across the U.S. Last month, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also signed into law a six-week abortion ban. Legislation doesn’t include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. More than two dozen other states are considering legislation to ban or restrict abortion in various ways. Among the slew of strategies are trigger bans to make abortion completely illegal in a state should Roe v. Wade be overturned, as well as six-week abortion bans. Respond to Kemp, and then what’s happening across the country.
CECILE RICHARDS : Obviously, the hypocrisy of this, of just that clip you played, is underscored by the fact that in fact, there is a crisis in this country, and it is maternal mortality rates, which are the highest in the developed world. I actually believe Georgia has the second-highest rate of maternal death related to pregnancy of any state. So if there is actually a medical crisis in Georgia, it’s about women dying as a result of complications from childbirth. So that’s on the one side. If Governor Kemp actually wanted to do something about a real problem, that is something that they could address, but you hear him say nothing about that. And of course it’s higher for women of color—I think three times the rate for black women than it is for white women.
This bill, though—not only is it unconstitutional, and I believe will be declared so, but one of the things he doesn’t mention is that it actually criminalizes women as well. It doesn’t just make abortion illegal; it basically would allow women to be convicted and either sentenced to death or to life imprisonment in Georgia. So we are now going from not only making abortion illegal, but criminalizing women who make this decision that has been constitutional now for more than 40 years in the United States of America. And I think it directly relates back to the work we talked earlier about in Supermajority. I think women are tired of basically being seen as a special interest, as a side issue. These are issues that affect every single woman in this country.
AMY GOODMAN : So what exactly are you going to be doing? You talked about mobilizing women. Are you registering women?
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, I think eventually as we get into next year. But right now, women are raising their hands saying they want to be trained. And we actually just did a call yesterday with about 1,500 women, the first folks that signed up to do a call. They want to be trained in activism. They want to know how to actually affect legislation. And they absolutely are going to be part of designing a New Deal for Women so in this all-important presidential election, Amy, as well as all the other elections that are going to be going on, that candidates and anyone who wants to be elected has to respond to the issues that women care about. And so that will be a lot of the organizing work we’re doing both online and offline in the coming months.
AMY GOODMAN : Four Democratic women have now announced their plans to run for president. The significance of this for you? And will you be endorsing?
CECILE RICHARDS : I think the importance of—obviously, there’s no way to overstate the importance of women running for president, and I am thrilled that they are, and I think they are raising issues that have long been needed to be raised. I think it is disturbing to see what I believe is a real double standard in how they are being treated versus the many, many, many men that are running for president. You know, two thirds of political reporting is still done by men. And so I am hoping that both through Supermajority, through other folks that follow the media, we can actually be lifting up the important work that these women have done. As you probably know, these are women who in large part have never lost a political race. And so when people talk about women being unelectable, I think it’s really important look at their record, because it stands up really in contrast to a lot of the men who are actually in the race right now.
AMY GOODMAN : Today the House Ways and Means Committee is holding its first-ever hearing on paid family and medical leave. What do you want to see come out of this hearing?
CECILE RICHARDS : I think, one, it’s incredibly important that you are reporting that. I think it has been underreported. We are the only developed country with no nationally mandated family leave policy. This is an issue that every person in the country that I talk to raises—the difficulty of taking care of their families, of their children, of their loved ones, of their parents. I think the important thing, and where I believe Supermajority can play a real role, is lifting up what is happening in Congress so that anyone in the United States Senate is held accountable about where they vote on this issue. This should be and could be the first thing that the new president signs into law.
AMY GOODMAN : And just a correction—what I said earlier that you questioned—52% of white women voted for President Trump in 2016, although Pew put it at something like 47%, not 52%, of white women voted for Donald Trump according to the Pew Research Center. They found 45% voted for Hillary Clinton.
CECILE RICHARDS : Yeah, there have been different numbers come out. Definitely a plurality of white women. But one of the things I think is also worth looking at, Amy, is in this last election in 2018 where we elected a record number of women to Congress, a record number of women of color to Congress, actually for the first time in years, white women split their votes evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates. Now, that’s not true across the board; it depends on the state. But I do think there is really a growing recognition that there are opportunities to talk to women about the important issues they care about and how the candidates stand on those.
AMY GOODMAN : How is it that though there is a clear pro-choice majority in this country—
CECILE RICHARDS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —most states are imposing some kind of abortion ban?
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, because if you look at who’s actually—I mean, look at my home state of Texas, where we have had the most gerrymandered districts for years and have been fighting in court forever. So I would say the state legislatures in a lot of these states, including Texas, are not representative of the majority of people. You pile on that, as we know, the restrictions on voting for people in this country–Georgia, Texas, many, many states—we don’t have a representative democracy. One of the things we need in this country is we need democracy reform. And I know that’s something that Stacey Abrams is fighting for. Andrew Gillum, other folks. This is really important, because we can’t have a true democracy that represents a majority of people unless everybody can vote and every vote is counted.
AMY GOODMAN : Finally, how much does your mother, Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas, influence—her legacy influence what you’re doing today, moving from Planned Parenthood to Supermajority?
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, I would like to think that Ann Richards would be one of the early folks to sign up for Supermajority. She believed so profoundly in the importance of democracy representing all people. Not only women; people of color, and people who have been underrepresented. And I think that’s actually what most people in this country believe. And I’m grateful to mom. I’m grateful to the obviously centuries of women, people of color, of women of color who fought to make this a stronger democracy. And now it is on the rest of us to keep that going.
AMY GOODMAN : Cecile Richards, thanks so much for being with us. Co-founder of Supermajority, former president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. When we come back, Congress holds the first hearings on the ERA—that’s the Equal Rights Amendment—in more than three decades. Stay with us.

"Headlines for May 08, 2019 | Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/8/headlines,"Iran to Suspend Part of Nuclear Deal Citing U.S. Sanctions May 08, 2019
Iran has announced it will stop complying with parts of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal and resume high-level enrichment of uranium in 60 days if other signatories of the deal do not take action to shield Iran’s oil and and banking sectors from U.S. sanctions. This comes a year after the Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal. In a speech earlier today, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran wants to stay in the nuclear deal but that it is rolling back its commitments due to Washington’s actions. In the short term, Rouhani said Iran would stop exporting excess uranium and heavy water from its nuclear program.
Hassan Rouhani : “The Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action, the JCPOA , is here and it remains in place. But today we have shown the flipside of the JCPOA coin. This is the same [nuclear deal] that states if the other parties are failing to meet their obligations, then we can also reduce our obligations in the deal. Today, we are announcing a reduction of our obligations under the deal. We are not leaving the [nuclear deal].”
Russia responded by blaming the United States for provoking Iran into rolling back the terms of the nuclear deal. The Iranian-American author Trita Parsi said, “Trump has initiated a chain reaction that will make America and the world less safe.” Topics: Pompeo Makes Surprise Visit to Iraq As U.S.-Iran Tensions Mount May 08, 2019
Iran’s announcement comes just days after the Trump administration moved to deploy a carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the region claiming there was a “credible threat by Iranian regime forces.” On Tuesday, U.S. officials announced four B-52 bombers would be part of the deployment. Meanwhile Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a surprise visit to Iraq on Tuesday to meet Iraq’s prime minister and discuss Iran’s presence in Iraq. UN Rapporteur Slams U.S. For Using Sanctions to Precipitate Humanitarian Disasters May 08, 2019
This comes as a high-ranking United Nations official is openly criticizing the United States for imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran Cuba, and Venezuela that could lead to mass starvation.
UN Special Rapporteur Idriss Jazairy said, “Real concerns and serious political differences between governments must never be resolved by precipitating economic and humanitarian disasters, making ordinary people pawns and hostages thereof.” A recent report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research and economist Jeffrey Sachs estimates 40,000 people may have died in Venezuela since 2017 because of U.S. sanctions. 1 Dead, 8 Injured in Colorado School Shooting Near Columbine May 08, 2019
In Colorado, an 18-year-old student was killed and eight were injured on Tuesday in a school shooting at the STEM School Highlands Ranch south of Denver. Authorities have taken two students into custody. Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock spoke to reporters outside the school.
Sheriff Tony Spurlock : “Two individuals walked into the STEM school, got deep inside the school and engaged students in two separate locations. … We do have eight students that are in area hospitals right now. Several of them are in critical condition. … Both of the suspects we believe are students of the STEM school. … They are not injured.”
The STEM School Highlands Ranch is located just seven miles from Columbine High School where 12 students and a teacher were shot dead 20 years ago on April 20, 1999. The school is also about 20 miles from Aurora Colorado where a gunman killed 20 people at a movie theater in 2012. Tuesday’s shooting in Colorado came a week after two students were killed and four were injured in a mass shooting at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. NYT : Trump’s Tax Records Show He Lost Over $1 Billion Between 1985 and 1994 May 08, 2019
The New York Times has obtained tax information on Donald Trump showing that his businesses lost $1.17 billion from 1985 to 1994. While Trump continues to refuse to release his tax returns, the Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts for a 10-year period ending in 1994. In multiple years during that stretch Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual taxpayer in the country. In 1990 and 1991, Trump lost more than $250 million each year — more than double any other individual U.S. taxpayer, according to IRS documents. In eight of the 10 years Trump paid no federal income taxes. House Prepares to Hold Barr in Contempt as Justice Dept. Advises Trump to Invoke Executive Privilege May 08, 2019
Tension continues to escalate between Congressional Democrats and the Trump administration. The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to vote today on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to provide lawmakers with an unredacted copy of the Mueller report. The Justice Department is now advising Trump to invoke executive privilege over the entire unredacted report and underlying evidence. In related news, the White House has directed former counsel Don McGahn not to comply with a congressional subpoena to hand over documents related to the Russia probe. Meanwhile FBI Director Christopher Wray appears to have directly contradicted Attorney General William Barr on whether federal authorities spied on the Trump campaign in 2016. Last month Barr said “spying did occur.” On Tuesday Wray says he has not seen any evidence of illegal surveillance. Georgia Enacts One of Nation’s Most Restrictive Abortion Bans May 08, 2019
Georgia’s Republican governor Brian Kemp has signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law bans abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which often occurs at around six weeks into pregnancy before many women even realize they are pregnant. The new law goes into effect on Jan. 1. The American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood Southeast and the Center for Reproductive Rights have announced plans to challenge the abortion ban. Reproductive rights groups are also challenging “fetal heartbeat” bills that were recently passed in Mississippi and Kentucky. Uber & Lyft Drivers Strike Ahead of Uber’s Wall Street Debut May 08, 2019
In labor news Uber and Lyft drivers are planning to strike today in over a dozen cities ahead of Uber’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange. While Uber is expected to be valued as high as $90 billion dollars, the drivers say they have not benefited from Uber’s success, citing low earnings and no benefits. Uber driver Esterphanie St. Juste is taking part in the strike in Los Angeles.
Esterphanie St. Juste : “Well at first, you know, it was good because I was able to make probably I would say easily over a $1,000 a week and still have two days off so it seemed to make sense at the time. … Well now I haven’t had a day off since January because I can’t afford to have a day off.” Tens of Thousands of Teachers in Oregon to Walk Out of Classes May 08, 2019
Tens of thousands of teachers in Oregon are planning to walk out of classes today forcing at least 23 school districts to preemptively cancel school. The teachers are calling for legislators to increase school funding and reduce large class sizes. Sandra Bland’s Family Calls For Probe of Her Death to be Reopened After Cell Phone Footage is Aired May 08, 2019
The family of Sandra Bland is calling for authorities to reopen an investigation into her death. The 28-year-old African-American woman died in a Texas jail cell in 2015, three days after she was arrested for allegedly failing to signal a lane change. Authorities have claimed Sandra Bland committed suicide while in jail by hanging herself with a garbage bag, but her family has long rejected this claim. On Monday, the Dallas TV station WFAA aired cellphone video filmed by Bland capturing the moment when she was pulled over. In the 39-second video, you can see the officer — Brian Encinia — drawing his stun gun and saying, “I will light you up.” Attorneys for the Bland family say the cellphone video proves the officer lied when he had claimed he felt his safety was in jeopardy when he pulled over Sandra Bland. Pamela Anderson Visits Julian Assange in London Prison as He Fights Possible Extradition to U.S. May 08, 2019
The actress Pamela Anderson visited Wikileaks founder Julian Assange at the high-security Belmarsh Prison in London on Tuesday. Assange is serving a 50-week prison sentence for skipping bail in Britain and faces possible extradition to the United States to face charges related to the Chelsea Manning leaks. Pamela Anderson spoke outside the prison after seeing him.
Pamela Anderson : '’Obviously, it's been very difficult to see Julian here and to make our way through the prison, to get to him was quite shocking and difficult. He does not deserve to be in a supermax prison, he has never committed a violent act, he is an innocent person. … He’s sacrificed so much to bring the truth out and we deserve the truth and that’s all I can say. I’m sorry I just feel sick. I feel nauseous.”
Pamela Anderson was wearing a cloak covered with references to the history of free speech in Britain as well as prisons, tyranny and the Levellers. Trump Pardons Soldier Who Murdered Naked Unarmed Iraqi Prisoner May 08, 2019 Image Credit: Free Michael Behenna/Facebook
President Trump has pardoned a former U.S. soldier who was found guilty of “unpremeditated murder. ” In 2008 First Lt. Michael Behenna drove an unarmed Iraqi prisoner into the desert for an interrogation. He then stripped the prisoner naked, interrogated him at gunpoint and then shot him in the head and chest. Behenna was initially sentenced to 25 years in 2009. He was released on parole in 2014. Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union criticized Trump’s move. She said, “This pardon is a presidential endorsement of a murder that violated the military’s own code of justice.” Topics: Iraq The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

Billion Dollar Loser: NYT Report on Trump’s Taxes & Massive Losses May Prompt Fraud Investigation | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/8/billion_dollar_loser_nyt_report_on,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , Democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman. In a major exposé, The New York Times has obtained tax information on Donald Trump that shows his businesses lost more than a billion dollars from 1985 to 1994. While Trump continues to refuse to release his tax returns, The Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts for a 10-year period ending in ’94. In multiple years during that stretch, Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual taxpayer in the United States. In both 1990 and ’91, Trump lost more than $250 million, more than double any other individual U.S. taxpayer, according to IRS documents. In eight of the 10 years, Trump paid no federal income taxes.
To unpack these revelations, we are joined from Rochester, New York, by David Cay Johnston, the twice Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter formally with The New York Times , now founder and editor of DCReport.org_. He has been reporting on Donald Trump since the 1980s. His most recent book—_It’s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America . And he has just published a piece in The Daily Beast . It’s headlined Trump’s Tax Leak Hints at Potential Fraud Investigations . It begins, “The myth of Donald Trump the modern Midas who turns to gold all that he touches died Tuesday afternoon.”
David Cay Johnston, welcome back to Democracy Now! What were you most surprised by in this New York Times exposé? And explain exactly what they got a hold of. It wasn’t the actual tax returns of Donald Trump from the ’80s to ’90s. What was it?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : The Times got from a source who properly had them what are called tax transcripts. The IRS takes information from your tax return and puts it into a summary that tax agents work from. So it is the official numbers. And The Times has some of Fred Trump’s tax returns. Fred is Donald’s father. And the numbers line up perfectly for those areas where they would need to be consistent. So we can rely that this is highly accurate data on what Trump told the IRS in his tax returns.
AMY GOODMAN : Who would have access to this kind of information, David?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Oh, a lot of people. If you have taken out a mortgage, you signed a form saying that you submitted to having your tax information given to your lender. When Trump was raising money on Wall Street, he might have had to supply this. Litigants may have gotten it. And of course, his own family and staff and advisers would have this information. So there are numerous copies out there of this and other Trump tax information, just as with the 2005 Trump tax return that was mailed to my home here in Rochester.
AMY GOODMAN : So talk about exactly what has been exposed. He lost more than a billion dollars, more than any U.S. taxpayer?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Yes. Almost two cents of every dollar reported as losses one year by everyone in the United States were reported by Donald Trump. And what this shows is something I’ve been saying and writing about Trump for 30 years: he is a terrible businessman. His business model is not to get an enterprise, to nurture it, to grow it, to make it more profitable over time. His business model is the same as a mob bust-out. Get your hands on an enterprise, squeeze all the cash out of it, don’t pay your vendors, try to cheat as best you can your employees, don’t pay the bankers—and Trump once said, “I borrowed money knowing I wouldn’t pay it back”—and then leave the carcass and go on to the next deal.
That’s why the Art of the Deal is so significant in all of this, because Trump’s business model is to rip off one person after another who gets involved with him thinking he will make them wealthy while he is destroying their wealth. Donald is, after Bernie Madoff, arguably the greatest wealth destroyer in American history.
AMY GOODMAN : President Trump tweeted at 4:00 a.m. this morning, Eastern time, “Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did–and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!,” Trump tweeted, 4:00 this morning. Your response, David Cay Johnston?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, buildings are depreciated by owners and many big real estate developers routinely report losses on their tax returns. But Donald didn’t have anywhere near the value in the buildings he controlled to take the kind of losses you are seeing. And he doesn’t mention things like he bought the old Eastern Air Lines Shuttle with its broken-down, aging, gas-guzzling jets and lost $7 million a month, and did numerous other business deals where he just lost money left and right. So he has taken a little element of truth—if you’re a major real estate family, you probably don’t pay income taxes—and tried to make that cover all this other stuff in terms of losses that are way out of proportion.
But more importantly, Donald Trump held himself out as this great dealmaker, this genius businessman. He pushed himself into the front of the pantheon of the economic heroes who were lionized in the '80s for making money without any regard to how they made it, when he didn't belong in their league at all. To those of us who have been covering him closely and not buying at the surface what he says but checking the facts, the broad story here isn’t true. The size of the losses, however, is stupendous. Much larger than I ever imagined.
AMY GOODMAN : Who was backing him? Talk about the banks. And there seems to be some unexplained large sum of money that he got at that time, $52.9 million.
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Yeah. Trump reported one year almost $53 million of interest. Now, if he held treasury notes, that means he had over $660 million of treasury bonds. And if it were junk bonds, more than $350 million. We know from other things that Trump had to disclose over the years that he didn’t have a portfolio anywhere like that. So the question is, did he report some income that was from some other source he was trying to hide as interest? And then the question would be, was it benign or nefarious?
And I would point out that this was during or right after the period when we know that Donald Trump was very deeply entangled with the international cocaine trafficker Joseph Wexelbaum. So deeply entangled and did so many favors for him that I’ve said, and I’ll say again, the only logical explanation for his conduct is that Donald was in the cocaine trafficking business with Joe Wexelbaum. And Donald, if you’re listening, sue me if you think you can prove what I just said isn’t true.
The backers of Trump were banks up until 1990 when he could not pay his bills as they came due. And Donald and I had a conversation one day where I said, “So how much are you worth, Donald?”“Three billion dollars.” I said, “I don’t believe you.” And he was agitated about that. But I said, “Donald, I’m a reporter. I’m a journalist. I can pay my bills as they come due. If you actually had $3 billion, you would find a way to pay your bills.” By the way, later that day he told another reporter he was worth $5 billion, which tells you that he just makes this up.
He is a con artist. He’s a criminal. He is a fraud. And once the banks realized that they had been had, nobody would loan money to him anymore, except Deutsche Bank, which was the preferred bank for Russian oligarchs—that is the criminal gang around Vladimir Putin—to launder their money.
AMY GOODMAN : You have written that Congress should investigate fully what we know Trump was—that Trump was faking his wealth and may have been vulnerable to foreign espionage. You also say the new reporting by The Times also hints at what may be more Trump tax fraud in which there is no statute of limitations when it is criminal rather than civil. What does that mean, criminal?
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON : Well, we don’t seriously enforce the criminal tax laws in this country. There are over 150 million tax returns filed this year and there will be maybe 800 prosecutions, and many of those will be connected to either drug trafficking or bribing politicians. It is one of the major shortcomings in our law. But Donald Trump had two civil tax fraud trials and he lost both of them. And at one of them, his own longtime tax lawyer and accountant, who was also his father’s tax lawyer and accountant, Jack Mitnick, testified under oath “that’s my signature on the tax return but neither I nor my firm prepared that tax return.” That is criminal tax fraud.
And that Donald Trump was not prosecuted at the time goes to how he has been very effective at hiring lawyers to intimidate journalists, to persuade governments that he is not worth the time to go after and cheat the system. So if Congress gets its hands on his tax returns—and I’m confident they will, and if not, they will get his returns from New York State, which are virtually identical—I am sure they will show that Donald Trump, like Richard Nixon, is a criminal tax cheat. And let’s remember Richard Nixon’s lawyer went to prison. The only reason Richard Nixon didn’t go to prison was he was pardoned by Gerry Ford.
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you very much for being with us. A small correction—I said Trump tweeted at 4:00 a.m. this morning; it was actually 7:00 a.m. It was 4:00 a.m. California time.

Activists and lawmakers testified last week before a House Judiciary subcommittee in the first congressional hearings on the Equal Rights Amendment in more than 35 years. The constitutional amendment was approved by Congress in 1972, and was ratified by 35 states over the next decade — three states short of the required total needed by a 1982 deadline. Nevada and Illinois have since ratified the amendment. A bill by Rep. Jackie Spear would eliminate the 1982 deadline, leaving the ERA just one state away from becoming a part of the U.S. Constitution. We speak with co-presidents and CEOs of the ERA Coalition/Fund for Women’s Equality: Carol Jenkins and Jessica Neuwirth.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” Those are the words of the Equal Rights Amendment, which may be heading toward ratification decades after it was first considered by the American public following a powerful hearing on Capitol Hill last week. Activists and lawmakers testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee in the first Congressional hearings on the ERA in more than 35 years. The constitutional amendment was approved by Congress in 1972 and was ratified by 35 states over the next decade, three states short of the required total needed by a 1982 deadline. Nevada and Illinois have since ratified the amendment. A bill by Congressmember Jackie Speier would eliminate the 1982 deadline, leaving the ERA just one state away from becoming a part of the U.S. Constitution. This is actor and activist Patricia Arquette speaking at the hearing.
PATRICIA ARQUETTE : Why didn’t women achieve full constitutional equality in 1787 or 1982? Because the country wasn’t ready? Well, I hope you’re ready now! Because women have been waiting 232 years for equality in this country and it has failed them. Legislators have blocked the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment for decades. But we’re done waiting.
AMY GOODMAN : For more, we’re joined by the co-presidents and CEOs of the ERA Coalition/Fund for Women’s Equality, Carol Jenkins and Jessica Neuwirth. Jessica Neuwirth is also the author of the book Equal Means Equal: Why the Time for an Equal Rights Amendment is Now . Carol Jenkins and Jessica Neuwirth, we welcome you both to Democracy Now! Carol, let’s begin with you. What is it that you see could happen in 2019, 2020 that hasn’t happened in U.S. history?
CAROL JENKINS : Well, two things. The Coalition is now working on two ways forward to the ERA being ratified. One is we need the 38th state. We think we’re very close to that. We got as far as 37 and a half states. Virginia’s Senate passed it; the House denied it. So we call that getting as close as you can get, without getting there. We think Virginia will be the next possibility for us as well. There is an election in November, and if they manage to turn the state blue, they could take up the ERA again in January. So we’re just that close. The other states, 13 unratified states, all working for that. The reason that we were in the Judiciary Committee last week was to get Jackie Speier’s bill marked up and voted on, and that would be the removal of the deadline completely, which is a barrier to the conversation. Not necessarily a barrier to ratification, but to the conversation about the Equal Rights Amendment.
AMY GOODMAN : Jessica Neuwirth, you have been organizing and writing about this for decades. Explain the history of the Equal Rights Amendment, especially for young people who may have no idea what this is all about.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : I was in college when the 1982 deadline passed, so I wasn’t an active part, actually, of the first wave of ERA activism in the 1970s. But really it goes all the way back to 1923, right after women got the right to vote in 1920, and Alice Paul and others drafted the Equal Rights Amendment. It was introduced in 1923, finally passed in 1972. I think there’s just a long history of movement. And it came so close—even in 1982, just three states. And if you talk to people who were active then, it was literally just a handful of votes in a couple of states that made the difference. So now with the power of social media and all of these new young women and men who have grown up really in a different culture where I think this is not only a no-brainer, it is just absurd to them that we don’t have constitutional equality. Which is also true around the world. I think people look at us and they just don’t understand why we wouldn’t have this basic provision in our Constitution, which almost every other constitution has.
AMY GOODMAN : So let me go to the testimony, the hearing that took place last week. I want to go to the House Judiciary Committee hearing. In her opening remarks, Kathleen Sullivan said the U.S. Constitution is exceptional in not including a gender equality clause.
KATHLEEN SULLIVAN : The United States Constitution, the world’s oldest written constitution, is also the only major written constitution in the world that lacks a provision declaring that men and women are equal. And now is the chance to correct that omission, that stain, that embarrassment about our Constitution, through the ratification by just one more state of the 1972 amendment. Just to give some examples, the French constitution provides that the law guarantees to the women in all spheres rights equal to those of men. The German constitution provides that men and women have equal rights, and that nobody shall be prejudiced or favored because of their sex. The Constitution of India provides that the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of sex. And every written constitution promulgated since World War II contains a sex equality provision.
AMY GOODMAN : How is it possible that the ERA hasn’t been passed, Carol Jenkins? Talk about that history. And what polls do you have showing how many Americans—what percentage of Americans support this?
CAROL JENKINS : Well, the research that we’ve done indicates that 94 percent of all Americans of every color, political persuasion, age support equality—constitutional equality—for women. The problem is that 80 percent of those people think that we already have it. They cannot believe that in the United States, we do not have this in our Constitution. So I think that it has been a long journey, almost 100 years, if we get this, since Alice Paul introduced it in 1923, that we have been on this march towards equality.
AMY GOODMAN : What states are you focusing on, if it’s just one state away?
CAROL JENKINS : If it’s just one state away, we’re looking at Virginia. Louisiana has a possibility. Arizona. They all say—and we put it in the terms of there is the math and there is the magic. The math in many instances is against us just by a little bit, or by a lot. But magically, what could happen if a person who has not supported the ERA suddenly wakes up and says, “It’s time for this to happen. It’s just unconscionable that the Constitution of the United States does not include women.”
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about intersectionality and the ERA ? The importance of African-American leadership around the ERA ?
CAROL JENKINS : Well, we are at this moment because of women of color, because of black women. Pat Spearman in 2017 magically got Nevada to ratify the ERA . And those of us who had been working on this for years looked at each other and we said, “Does this count?” And our legal people said, “Yes, it does count.” And then the next year, Illinois did the same thing. Extraordinary. Juliana Stratton, who’s now the lieutenant governor there, was a powerful voice in the Illinois House to make sure that the ERA got passed. And now in Virginia, we have several black women who are in the forefront, including Jennifer McClellan in the Senate, Jennifer Carroll Foy, who was the chief sponsor in the House of Delegates. And remember, we came so close. That was shockingly close. One vote away from the ERA .
AMY GOODMAN : Jessica Neuwirth, how does the ERA address transgender discrimination?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : The ERA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. And right now, actually, the Supreme Court has a case—has taken a case, and will decide what that word means, and whether it includes transgender.
AMY GOODMAN : Let me go back to 1976. This is Good Morning America hosting a debate between Phyllis Schlafly and Betty Friedan, on the Equal Rights Amendment. This is conservative activist Schlafly, who was at the time the chairwoman of the Stop ERA campaign.
PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY : The ERA is a big attack on the rights of the homemaker. The laws of every state make it the obligation of the husband to support his wife, to provide her with a home, to support their minor children. The woman in the home can draw social security benefits based on her husband’s earnings, even though she has been a homemaker all her life. Now, all these things will be lost when you apply a rule that says that everything must be equal. Now until you can make it equal for men to have the babies just like women, then it is a double burden to the women to say that the rules for family support should be equal on the husband and the wife. ERA ends up in taking away the right of the wife to be supported by her husband.
AMY GOODMAN : So that’s Phyllis Schlafly. You’re smiling right now.
CAROL JENKINS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : The conservative activist who tried to and successfully stopped the ERA .
CAROL JENKINS : Yes. The good old days.
AMY GOODMAN : But that is what someone is going to have to say if they’re going to say no to it today. Talk about why you feel it is critical today and even talk about your own story. You were a famous newscaster. You’re a journalist. The lack of pay equity.
CAROL JENKINS : Well, precisely. When people say to us, “Why would you need the equal rights amendment?” I say, “Look at our country.” Who are the poor people in our country? It’s the women in this country. Families headed by women who cannot feed their children, cannot find homes. They are homeless. They are impoverished. Corporations have made billions and billions of dollars by paying women less than they pay men. It is a good business strategy, but it’s a very poor strategy for equality in this country. So we cannot go on diminishing the rights of women in the United States. How many years have we done this, you know, Pay Equity Day? It is so infuriating. It doesn’t change.
AMY GOODMAN : Explain Pay Equity Day. We just passed it.
CAROL JENKINS : Right. It’s the amount of time—the date at which in the next year a woman or a woman of color, a black woman, Latina woman would equalize what a white man made the year before. For Latina women, it’s November. I mean, that is almost a full year of working before she matches that income. It’s a disgrace. And so we think that pay equity, that eligibility to recourse in sexual and domestic abuse, pregnancy discrimination—these are all things that would be affected by the ERA .
AMY GOODMAN : Jessica Neuwirth, how are you moving forward on this right now? What’s the actual organizing going on, on the ground? And what would change? Carol was just describing pay disparities. What would it mean to have this amendment in the Constitution?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Well, just one example. Phyllis Schlafly talked about women who are in the home. More and more women are in the workforce and there are some women who never could afford to be in the home. And one of the many reasons we need the ERA , as Carol mentioned, is pregnancy discrimination. There are women who are getting fired every day because they’re taking too many bathroom breaks while they’re pregnant. They have no effective legal recourse. So I think the ERA would give women in areas like pregnancy discrimination, gender-based violence, recourse that they have been denied in many, many cases and continue to be denied. And at the same time, I think it is really important for us at a higher level to put in the foundational document of our country and in the bedrock of law that women are equal, and to finally send out the message we’re no longer going to be treated as second-class citizens. And in terms of organizing, it has been an explosion across the country. What we see is this groundswell.
AMY GOODMAN : What has to happen first? We have 30 seconds.
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : So what has to happen is we need the committee, the Judiciary Committee, to do a markup and a vote. We need the House and the Senate to remove the deadline. And we need one more state.
AMY GOODMAN : The Senate is Republican. Would they approve it?
JESSICA NEUWIRTH : Well, we’re just two votes away, we think, from a majority in the Senate, which is what we need. Just two more Republicans. And I think we’ll get there.
CAROL JENKINS : Senator Cardin and Lisa Murkowski are sponsoring the bill to remove the deadline in the Senate. Susan Collins has signed on. So we’re working on Republican support as a bipartisan issue.
AMY GOODMAN : We will certainly continue to follow this. Carol Jenkins, Jessica Neuwirth, co-presidents of the ERA Coalition/Fund for Women’s Equality.

Supermajority: Cecile Richards Teams With Alicia Garza & Ai-jen Poo to Mobilize Women Voters in 2020,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/8/supermajority_cecile_richards_teams_with_alicia,"co-founder of Supermajority and former president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. As the 2020 election season heats up, we turn now to the launch of a new political action group by three prominent women’s rights activists. It’s called Supermajority. Its goal is to train a new generation of women activists to take on grassroots campaigns and electoral politics.
PERSON : Women are the majority of Americans.
PERSON : We are the majority of voters.
PERSON : We are the majority of grassroots volunteers and donors.
PERSON : Our government should look like this.
PERSON : [translated] Our government should look like us.
PERSON : [translated] Our leaders should fight for us.
PERSON : The only way we can make that happen is by standing shoulder-to-shoulder—
PERSON : —with women who believe this, too.
CECILE RICHARDS : Maybe you have fought for change for decades.
ALICIA GARZA : Demanding equality in your home, in your workplace, from your government.
PERSON : Maybe you’re just getting started.
PERSON : Let’s work together.
PERSON : Supermajority is a new organization for women who want to build our collective power and use it to change this country for good.
PERSON : Because one of us can be dismissed.
PERSON : Two of us can be ignored. But together—
PERSON : We aren’t just the majority.
ALICIA GARZA : We are a supermajority. And we are unstoppable. Let’s make sure the entire country knows it.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s the promotional video for Supermajority. The new political action group was founded by Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza; Ai-jen Poo, the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance; and former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who joins us now in our studio. Cecile, welcome back to Democracy Now! . First time in this position, as one of the heads of Supermajority.
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, one of the founders. I think there’s so many women now that are coming out of the woodwork to do this work.
AMY GOODMAN : So explain what you’re doing.
CECILE RICHARDS : I spent 12 years at Planned Parenthood organizing women around a certain set of issues, particularly reproductive health and healthcare access. My colleagues, Alicia and Ai-jen, have been doing the same work with different groups of women. And we realized that actually there are even millions more women that we haven’t organized and that, particularly since this election, have been raising their hand and saying, “I want to do more. I’ve never been civically engaged. I’ve never been politically involved.”
And so we’ve spent the last few months actually traveling across the country listening to women about what they need and want. And what they want is they want to be activists. And as you saw in the video, I think there is a sense that women are—we’re the majority of voters. Fifty-Four percent of voters last election were women. We are the volunteers. We are increasingly the donors, increasingly the candidates, and it is time for political equity. So that’s the idea behind Supermajority. We want to build a multiracial, intergenerational movement to increase women’s power, political power and civil engagement.
AMY GOODMAN : You’ve talked about a New Deal for Women.
CECILE RICHARDS : Well, that’s what I think. And I think Alicia and Ai-jen would say the same, which is, women again do most of the work around political campaigns and candidates, and yet the issues that women talk to us about on the road—the lack of affordable child care in the United States, the fact that maternal mortality rates are at epidemic levels, the fact that equal pay gets a lot of lip service but we never actually make progress— these are issues that we believe need to be front and center of any political campaign. And although I’m so grateful that there are so many women running for president raising these issues, they need to be raised by anybody who wants to be president of the United States.
AMY GOODMAN : How did you come up with the title Supermajority?
CECILE RICHARDS : I guess it’s just that women, I think, aren’t just the majority; I think women have superpowers, and they’ve been expressing that and showing that. And I think actually I think it has kind of caught on. In fact, just—we launched I guess a week ago, and we’ve now had more than 80,000 folks sign up, and that’s before we really even begin to get on the road. So I feel like there’s a real need and interest in the country, particularly among women who want to become better activists, more effective activists. They want to know what other women are doing and how they can support them as well.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Alicia Garza. Alicia is away, so we were not able to bring her on with you today. Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter. In 2017, she spoke on Democracy Now! about how women of color must be included in political organizing, especially against sexual assault and harassment.
ALICIA GARZA : The reality is, women of color, immigrant women, black women who are low-wage workers are extremely vulnerable to this kind of abuse and violence. And frankly, because of the lack of protections that exist, or to be honest, the marginalization that these communities already experience in our society, in our economy and in our democracy, there really is not only not conversation about the prevalence in which this is happening to women of color and immigrant women in the service industry, but there is also not a lot of conversation about what do the solutions look like outside of criminalizing the perpetrators or the survivors themselves. And so it was very important—
AMY GOODMAN : So that’s Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, who is one of the co-founders of this new organization, with Cecile Richards and Ai-jen Poo, called Supermajority. So how do you organize this multiracial coalition? I mean, when it came to voting in 2016, wasn’t it something like 62% of white women voted for President Trump?
CECILE RICHARDS : I don’t think that is the number, but definitely a plurality of white women voted for President Trump. Look, I think that this is work that women want to do, not only to learn how to be better activists, to work across issues, but also to work across race lines. Because I think there is a real recognition among a lot of white women that we cannot continue to rely on women of color to sort of save this country or save us from ourselves, and it is important that we do this work as well and intentionally and in a multiracial way.
I’ve been an organizer my whole life, Amy, and so this is to me a very important and exciting moment where I’m seeing women across the country—in Midwestern states, in Southwestern states—come into rooms with women they’ve never met before and say, “This is the most exciting thing I’ve ever been able to do, is actually meet with women who also care passionately about the same issues I do, and we need to do this work together.” I’m so glad you had the clip from Alicia. I think she is one of the most phenomenal leaders in this country. And Ai-jen as well. But there are thousands and thousands more, and that is really what we’re seeking to do, is to make sure that these women’s voices are being lifted up, that they are feeling empowered and supported and that they can be active in getting other women involved.
AMY GOODMAN : What will be the role of unions? Supermajority Education Fund’s leadership committee includes Mary Kay Henry—
CECILE RICHARDS : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : —the international president of SEIU . How will you reach into unions?
CECILE RICHARDS : Of course, I came out of the labor movement, so I have enormous respect for the work that not only the labor movement is doing particularly, and the teachers’ movement. As we know, there have been wildcat strikes by teachers, overwhelmingly who are women, across the country.
AMY GOODMAN : Oregon teachers are striking today.
CECILE RICHARDS : It shouldn’t be on the public school teachers of this country to save the public education system, but this is where we see, over and over again, women basically taking action where government is failing them. So absolutely the teachers, the labor unions. They also, the majority of these organizations are women, and they want to work across issue lines as well. And I am really grateful to Mary Kay for being an important leader in not only the labor movement but in understanding that we can build the power of women across this country.
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about a comment of the new head of the NRA , Carolyn Meadows. She is there because Oliver North was just ousted. She apologized after coming under fire for attacking fellow Georgian, Democratic freshman Congressmember Lucy McBath, who lost her son to gun violence a few years ago—Jordan Davis, in Florida. He was a teenager who was shot dead when he was sitting in a car in a gas station parking lot. Meadows said, “The reason Lucy McBath won was not because she was anti-gun, but because she was a minority female.” Your thoughts?
CECILE RICHARDS : Well of course that was one of the worst—there are so many things about this—obviously—let me go back. Lucy McBath is a national hero. The fact that a woman who went through what she did, lost her child and then committed herself to addressing the criminal justice system in this country is phenomenal. And the fact that she is in Congress is so fantastic. Of course, she was elected in a majority Anglo district. She was not elected because she was a woman of color, but frankly despite the fact that she was a woman of color. And I think it is an enormous testament to her, to her candidacy, to her leadership. And it’s also a testimony to the important role that Stacey Abrams is playing and has played in the state of Georgia to increase participation of all people, but particularly people of color.
Because you opened the topic of Georgia—which I hope we will talk about in a minute, because of this outrageous bill that has been now signed by the governor—I spent time in Georgia with Stacey. Obviously, if every person in that state had been allowed to vote and if their vote had been counted, Stacey Abrams would be governor today and would be serving as well is having Lucy McBath in Congress.

Kill List Exposed: Leaked Obama Memo Shows Assassination of U.S. Citizens “Has No Geographic Limit” | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2013/2/5/kill_list_exposed_leaked_obama_memo,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : The Obama administration’s internal legal justification for assassinating U.S. citizens without charge has been revealed for the first time. According to a secret Justice Department document obtained by NBC News, the Obama administration claims it has the legal authority to target citizens who are, quote, “senior operational leaders,” of al-Qaeda or “an associated force” — even if there’s no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S.
In September 2011, a U.S. drone strike in Yemen killed two American citizens: Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan. The following month, another U.S. drone strike killed al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who was born in Denver.
AMY GOODMAN : The document obtained by NBC News is described as a “white memo” that was provided to members of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees as a summary of a classified memo prepared by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. Last month, a federal judge denied a request by the American Civil Liberties Union and The New York Times for the Justice Department to disclose its legal justification for the targeted killing of Americans.
The Obama administration’s secrecy around the drone program is expected to be a top issue at this week’s confirmation hearing of White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to be director of the CIA . Brennan has been dubbed by critics to be Obama’s “assassination czar.”
Joining us now is Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU and director of the ACLU’s Center for Democracy.
You’ve looked at the white memo. This is something you’ve been asking for for quite some time, Jameel. Talk about its significance. Go through it with us point by point.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Sure. Well, it’s a very significant document, and it’s a remarkable document, and it’s something that everybody really ought to read, in the same way that everybody ought to read the torture memos from the last administration. It sets out, or professes to set out, the power that the government has to carry out the targeted killing of American citizens who are located far away from any battlefield, even when they have not been charged with a crime, even when they do not present any imminent threat in any ordinary meaning of that word. So it’s a pretty sweeping power that’s been set out. And the memo purports to provide a legal justification for that power and explain why the limits on that power can’t be enforced in any court.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : The confidential Justice Department white paper that you’re talking about, Jameel Jaffer, introduces a more expansive definition of “self-defense” or “imminent attack” than any articulated by the U.S. government before. It reads, quote: “The condition that an operational leader present an 'imminent' threat of violent attack against the United States does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.” Can you talk about the significance of that and how exactly “imminent” is defined in this document—
JAMEEL JAFFER : Sure.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : —or not defined?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Yeah, well, I mean, I think you—you know, you have to start with the acknowledgment that there are circumstances in which the government has the authority, and maybe even the responsibility, to use lethal force. Even if you think about it domestically—somebody is running down the street, waving a gun around, threatening civilians—the government doesn’t have to go to a judge beforehand to seek a warrant to carry out that use of lethal force. But that’s a situation in which the threat is imminent, in the ordinary meaning of the term: There’s not time to go to a judge; there’s not time for deliberation.
But the kind of imminence that the government is defining here, or the way that the government has defined the term here, is much, much broader. They’re talking about situations in which the person presents no immediate threat, there’s no known plot. These people are located far away from any actual battlefield, so you’re not talking about a situation in which there are battlefield exigencies that the government has to worry about. You’re really talking about something that looks a lot more like a law enforcement context. And in that context, the traditional rule is the government has the authority to use lethal force only in very narrow circumstances. And this memo really redefines those circumstances entirely.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s turn to Attorney General Eric Holder, a comment he made last March when he outlined what the White House billed as the legal rationale for its claimed right to kill U.S. citizens who belong to al-Qaeda or associated forces.
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER : It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact that some of the threats that we face come from a small number of United States citizens who have decided to commit violent attacks against their own country from abroad. Based on generations-old legal principles and Supreme Court decisions handed down during World War II, as well as during this current conflict, it’s clear that United States citizenship alone does not make—does not make such individuals immune from being targeted.
AMY GOODMAN : Jameel Jaffer, respond to Attorney General Eric Holder.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, it’s not a question of immunity. This is kind of a straw man. Nobody is arguing that Americans are entirely immune from the government’s use of lethal force. The question is: Under what circumstances can the government use lethal force? And again, for a very good reason, those circumstances have traditionally been defined very narrowly. Now what the government is doing is creating an extremely broad category of people who can be targeted without judicial review before the fact, without judicial assessment of the evidence after the fact. It’s a very dangerous thing that the government is doing.
And I think that at some level, I think the people who have written this memo and the people who are exercising this authority in the Obama administration must be convinced of their own trustworthiness. But even if you accept that the people who are now in office are trustworthy in this sense, this power is going to be available to the next administration and the one after that, and it’s going to be available in every future conflict, not just the conflict against al-Qaeda. And according to the administration, the power is available all over the world, not just on geographically cabined battlefields. So it really is a sweeping proposition.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : But what does it mean, though, that it’s not an official legal memo, it’s a white paper? Does that have any legal significance or implications?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, you know, some people have been saying that this is a kind of transparency that the administration, through these kinds of leaks, is giving the public the ability to assess the strength of the administration’s legal arguments. And the truth is that this is really just a briefing document, it’s not a legal memo. It does tell us a little bit about the authority that the government is claiming, but the actual legal memos are still secret. We’ve been litigating for those memos now for 18 months or two years. The administration has refused to release them. We have just appealed one case to the 2nd Circuit here in New York, to the appeals court here in New York.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Can you explain the case? What is the case that your organization, the ACLU , is—
JAMEEL JAFFER : So, there are two—there are two Freedom of Information Act cases that we’re litigating right now. One is—one is here in New York, and the other one is in D.C. One of them is an effort to get the legal memos. We’re litigating that case with The New York Times ; they have a parallel request. The other case, which is in D.C., is about, principally, civilian casualties, the question of who has been killed in these—in these drone strikes, because the administration has not released numbers. And we’re reliant on the work of very good organizations outside the administration to do that kind of work. We think that the administration should release its own numbers. So—
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And “who has been killed,” you mean U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizen who have been killed.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Right, absolutely. So, most of the people who are being killed in these drone strikes aren’t U.S. citizens, right? There have only been four U.S. citizens—three in 2011, one in 2002. The rest have been noncitizens killed, some of them in Pakistan, some of them in Yemen, some of them in Somalia. According to the figures of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the U.K., we’re now talking about somewhere on the order of 4,000 people who have been killed with these drones.
And the administration still hasn’t released the legal memos that purport to justify that program. So, one of the cases that we’re litigating, the one here in New York, is the effort to get that justification. This memo, this briefing paper, provides us a little more information about that justification, but it’s not the justification itself. For the same reasons that the government was right in 2009 to release the torture memos, we think the government should release the targeted killing memo.
AMY GOODMAN : Let’s get specific. I saw you in Sundance at one of the premieres of Jeremy Scahill and Rick Rowley’s film called Dirty Wars: The World Is a Battlefield . And it tells the story, among others, of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, 16-year-old kid born in Denver, killed in a drone strike two weeks after his father was killed in a drone strike in Yemen. Talk about his case and how this relates.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Right.
AMY GOODMAN : When does the U.S. stop? What is the justification for killing this 16-year-old boy?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, so two things about that. First, I think one of the most chilling aspects of the power that the government is claiming here is that they’re claiming the authority to do all of this in secret, not just keep it secret from the courts or keep their justification secret from the courts, but keep the exercise of this power secret, so they can carry out these killings of American citizens, among many others, without even acknowledging to the public or to any court that they have exercised that authority. And that really is a chilling proposition. But that’s one thing, and that’s one of the things that they’ve done in the Abdulrahman case: They have failed to acknowledge that they actually carried out this killing, although everybody knows it to be true.
But we have other litigation which we’re doing with the Center for Constitutional Rights. It’s a constitutional case on behalf of the three U.S. citizens who were killed in 2011, including Abdulrahman, the 16-year-old. And that’s a case in which we are raising claims under the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment, the due process clause, arguing that the government does not have the right, again, except in these extremely narrow circumstances, to carry out targeted killings without judicial review. And the government’s response to that lawsuit has not been to defend their authority on the merits. They’re not actually saying, “We have the right to do this.” They haven’t actually filed any of those arguments in court. Instead what they’re arguing is: This question of whether the government acted lawfully or not is a political question committed to the political branches, and the judges have no role to play, no role whatsoever to play, in assessing whether the killing of an American citizen was lawful or not.
AMY GOODMAN : How does it stop? Where does it stop? You kill them in Yemen, American citizens and others—no trial, no charge. What about in the United States?
JAMEEL JAFFER : There’s no line. You know, if you look at the memo, the briefing paper that was released yesterday, there’s no geographic line. And you can remember how most of the country reacted when President Bush declared the authority to hold American citizens detained in the United States: Most of the country said, “You can’t be serious. You’re going to treat the United States as part of the battlefield. You’re going to detain American citizens inside the United States as enemy combatants.” And now, the Obama administration—you know, if you accept the memo on its face, you accept the briefing paper on its face, the Obama administration is making, in some ways, a greater claim of authority. They’re arguing that the authority to kill American citizens has no geographic limit.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I want to turn to comments made by John Brennan, John Brennan who is Obama’s counterterrorism adviser and now his pick for CIA director. He made these comments last May and publicly confirmed that the United States has used drones to conduct targeted killings overseas.
JOHN BRENNAN : President Obama believes that, done carefully, deliberately and responsibly, we can be more transparent and still ensure our nation’s security. So let me say it as simply as I can: Yes, in full accordance with the law, and in order to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States and to save American lives, the United States government conducts targeted strikes against specific al-Qaeda terrorists, sometimes using remotely piloted aircraft often referred to publicly as “drones.” And I’m here today because President Obama has instructed us to be more open with the American people about these efforts.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : That was Obama’s nominee for CIA director, John Brennan, speaking last May. Jameel Jaffer, your comments on what he said about drone attacks?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, this is—this is, I think, you know, in some ways, good timing for the release of this briefing paper, because, you know, as you mentioned, John Brennan has been nominated to head the CIA . There’s going to be a vote on his nomination later this week. And some senators have said that the nomination should not go forward unless the administration is more forthcoming with its legal analysis, unless they release the OLC memo. And I think that’s exactly right. The administration should release that memo. There are also open questions about the role that Brennan played in the torture program, and those questions, too, ought to be answered before the vote goes forward. So, you know, I think it’s good timing. There are some very serious questions that ought to be asked by—
AMY GOODMAN : Do you think the Democrats will be asking these questions of a Democratic administration?
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, you know, there were a group of senators yesterday that wrote to the administration asking for the release of the legal memo and seeming to connect the release of the legal memo to—to these votes, to the Hagel vote and to the Brennan vote. And I think that that’s an important thing. And it was a group led by Senator Wyden. So I think that there—you know, there are definitely senators who think this is important. And if people can make it known to their senators that they think it’s important, I think that would be a very good thing.
AMY GOODMAN : And your thoughts on John Brennan being the CIA pick? Already, four years ago, when President Obama wanted to do it the first time around, he was forced to withdraw his name because there was such outcry.
JAMEEL JAFFER : Well, right. I mean, I definitely have reservations about it. I think that there are these questions, these important questions about his role in the torture program. And also, you know, people have said that John Brennan is an advocate for transparency about the drone program. If that’s true, now is the right time to release the OLC memo, the legal counsel memo. And I think that the debate about his nomination should be informed by whatever’s in that memo.
AMY GOODMAN : We had a report in headlines about Open Society Justice Initiative—and you’re a fellow at the Open Society right now, on leave from the ACLU—putting out a new report that’s revealed a detailed look at global involvement in the CIA’s secret program of prisons, rendition and torture since 9/11. The initiative says 54 countries aided the CIA until President Obama stopped the program in 2009. It’s called “Globalizing Torture,” also reveals at least 136 people were held by the CIA during those years—the largest tally to date. How significant is this?
JAMEEL JAFFER : I think it’s a hugely significant report. I think it’s the most comprehensive report thus far about the people who are held by the CIA and what happened to them, and also the complicity of other countries in the CIA’s program. Some of those other countries have begun to grapple with the question of accountability for their role in that program. As you know, the United States has not. The Obama administration has interfered with civil suits that seek to hold officials accountable for their role in that program, and it has failed to bring criminal charges against senior officials who supervised the program. But I think it’s a very important thing, what the Open Society Justice Initiative has done here, and I think that it will create pressure not just on other countries to begin to grapple with that question of accountability, but on the United States, as well.
AMY GOODMAN : Final question on this issue of targeted killings: Is this President Obama’s answer to attempting to close Guantánamo? You don’t need prisons if you kill people before they go to prison.
JAMEEL JAFFER : I hope not. You know, without more information about who it is that the administration is killing and on what basis, it’s difficult to make—to draw a conclusion on that question. But I think when you see the kinds of authority that the government is claiming in briefing papers like this, it certainly raises the question about to what extent this program, the drone program, is in fact a substitute for detention.
AMY GOODMAN : And as you said, don’t they say—don’t the documents say that they will kill someone if it puts U.S. personnel at risk?
JAMEEL JAFFER : That’s right. I mean, I think that one of the—you know, one of the really troubling things about the document is the way that it defines this phrase, “Capture is infeasible,” because once you see that phrase in the first paragraph, “Capture is infeasible,” it sounds like a real restriction on the government’s authority to use lethal force. But halfway through the memo, they redefine the phrase, “Capture is infeasible,” to mean something more like: “Capture is inconvenient.” And once you redefine the phrase in that way, then you’ve opened up the possibility of the use of lethal force much more broadly. And again, it does raise the question of whether they are using the use of lethal force as a substitute for detention, and even if they’re not, whether that possibility is open for another administration in the future.
AMY GOODMAN : Jameel Jaffer, I want to thank you for being with us, deputy legal director of the ACLU , director of the ACLU’s Center for Democracy. Coming up later in the broadcast, we’ll speak with Dan Ellsberg, famous whistleblower for the Pentagon Papers. We’ll also speak with Jacob Appelbaum, who just lost a case.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : An alarming new report by a panel of leading scientists warns that human activity is causing the disappearance and deterioration of wildlife at a rate that could represent an existential threat to humanity within our lifetimes. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released its conclusions earlier this week and found that one million species could go extinct in the foreseeable future unless current trends are reversed. The study estimates the global extinction rate is “already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it averaged over the past 10 million years.”
It is the largest and most comprehensive global study of biodiversity ever. It took three years to complete and is based on 15,000 scientific papers. The landmark report singled out industrial farming and fishing as major drivers of the crisis and called for transformative change to arrest present trends of biodiversity loss and species extinction. The report will be released in full later this year. This is chair of the U.N. panel, Sir Robert Watson.
SIR ROBERT WATSON : We’re losing species at a historical rate. Potentially 500,000 to a million species are threatened with loss. We have lost much of our native forests, much of our native wetlands. And effectively, biodiversity needs to be considered as an equally important issue as climate change. It is not just an environmental issue; it is an economic issue, a development issue, a security issue, a social, moral and ethical issue.
AMY GOODMAN : To talk more about the report, we’re joined by two guests. In Minneapolis, Kate Brauman is with us, one of the coordinating lead authors of the U.N. science report, environmental scientist at University of Minnesota. And here in New York, Ashley Dawson is joining us, professor of post-colonial studies at City University of New York Graduate Center and College of Staten Island. His books include Extinction: A Radical History . We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Kate Brauman, you’re one of the lead authors on this report. A million species going extinct? Explain.
KATE BRAUMAN : It is really shocking. What we have done is that a bunch of experts have looked at really what the trends look like for many, many different species, including insects. And looking at those trends, it is quite clear that up to a million species, 25% of all of the animals on earth, are threatened with extinction, many within the next couple of decades, unless we change our activities.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What most surprised you, Kate, about this report as you were working on the research?
KATE BRAUMAN : The thing to me that is the most shocking is really just what the picture looks like when we bring it all together. So this report is an assessment. It is designed to bring together the incredibly large existing body of research. This was not designed to do new research. And so much of this has been known. What we have done is really bring together all the pieces and lay them out clearly so that we can see what a big problem this is.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the threat to biodiversity, ongoing species extinction and climate change?
KATE BRAUMAN : What we see is that there are a lot of different drivers that are causing this to happen and that they all interact with each other. So probably the biggest threat to species to date has been land use change. We have made so many changes on the earth, particularly through farming, but also through roads, through timber harvest, and that has had a tremendous impact. But it interacts with climate change. And so what we see is that these interacting effects of land use change, climate, pollution, species extraction—that they all work together to really make huge threats to the environment and to us as humans.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I want to bring Ashley Dawson into the conversation. Ashley, you have written an entire book on the radical history of extinction. Your response to this report?
ASHLEY DAWSON : Well, the report, I think, is really a landmark report. And it shows that the crisis we face isn’t just one of climate change. In some ways it is comparable to the IPCC report from last October which really sounded a really important alarm about the system that we face and its potential collapse. But what this shows is it’s a crisis of multiple different dimensions and that it’s driven by an economic system which is fundamentally destroying the terrestrial systems that we all depend on.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I’d like to turn to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s recent comments on the Arctic. Just hours after the release of the U.N. report, Pompeo celebrated the shrinking levels of sea ice in the region, saying it opened up new opportunities for trade. He also called for the exploitation of natural resources in the Arctic.
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO : The Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance. It houses 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil, 30 percent of its undiscovered gas and an abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds and millions of square miles of untapped resources. Fisheries galore […] Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade […] Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century Suez and Panama Canals.”
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So scientists warn that melting sea ice in the Arctic due to climate change will have catastrophic effects on coastal cities, biodiversity and the global economy. President Trump of course has called climate change a Chinese hoax. So Ashley, your response to what Pompeo said just hours after this U.N. report was released?
ASHLEY DAWSON : I think it typifies the kind of extractivist attitude, which as I said, is destroying the planet. To give one concrete instance, we have been exploiting land so much and degrading land that we only have about 60 harvests left. Right? Sixty agricultural harvests left.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What does that mean?
ASHLEY DAWSON : It means about only 60 more years of food, potentially. So we’re not only talking about a kind of crash of biodiversity and potential extinction for a lot of species out there; we’re talking about a kind of fundamental crisis of humanity, its relationship to the natural world and our relations to one another.
AMY GOODMAN : And he’s saying, if the ice melts, it opens up possibilities for trade. It means you can get another Panama or Suez Canal.
ASHLEY DAWSON : Yeah, it gives new meaning to Naomi Klein’s term “disaster capitalism.” Right? I mean, this is really about yoking the planet as we push it towards unsustainability.
AMY GOODMAN : I want to get your response to this as well, Kate Brauman. That if the sea ice melts, just opens up opportunities for trade.
KATE BRAUMAN : Well, I will say that I see it as an opportunity, but as an opportunity for doing things better. One of the things we talk about a lot in this report is that we are not hopeless. That there are a lot of potential ways that we can have a better future. And one of those is really having better intergovernmental cooperation. The Arctic is a place where intergovernmental cooperation has happened in the past. And we have the opportunity to really manage and steward these resources in a positive way that can be a model for the way we think about the planet. Part of that is going to be really integrating what we know from indigenous and local cultures, many of whom have lived in these regions for a long time, into the way that we do management.
AMY GOODMAN : Ashley Dawson, you talk about radical conservation. What does that look like? And you particularly talk about cities. I am intrigued by the title of your book–_Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change_.
ASHLEY DAWSON : Right. So right now, we have a system of agribusiness that’s based on using fossil fuels for pesticides, fertilizers, and exploiting the land as much as possible. And we clearly need to shift. And one of the things that’s really wonderful about this report is that it explicitly talks about shifting that system to one that is based on agro-ecology. Using natural inputs. Not using all of these pesticides that are destroying pollinators like bee populations and other insects.
And we don’t just need to think about that happening outside cities, right? Now the majority of humanity lives in cities. And so cities can also be a place for rewilding, for increasing some of the wetlands, for instance, that we have plowed under, and by doing that, for absorbing more carbon. So I agree with Kate about how this report is sounding an alarm but it’s also calling for really important shifts in attitude and material changes that can put us on a different course.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What does that say, Ashley, about the kind of structural transformations that would be required minimally for the economic system that governs at this point large parts of the planet, which is based on endless expansion and consumption by larger and larger numbers of people at greater levels?
ASHLEY DAWSON : I think it’s the greater levels that’s really key. The report does talk about the issue of population increase, but it also makes it quite clear that it’s inequality and a kind of capitalist system that’s based on constantly ramping up consumption of natural resources that is at fault, and that we need to shift away from that system.
AMY GOODMAN : What is the alternative?
ASHLEY DAWSON : The alternative is a kind of Green New Deal for the planet, and the authors of the system talk about that. They say quite explicitly that we need a value shift and a material shift towards more sustainable forms of engagement with the planet.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Kate, this report comes on the heels of several other climate reports, biodiversity reports. What is it that this report says that these other reports have not concluded?
KATE BRAUMAN : This report does a couple of different things. It brings together a wider body of evidence and really makes a point of elevating what we know from indigenous and local cultures. It makes a really explicit tie from human activities to biodiversity to human well-being. And then it points us in positive directions for the future. I think Ashley really summed this up right—we are identifying the need to really have transformational change, to redefine what it means to live well in a way that reduces our consumption and changes our production.
AMY GOODMAN : Let me ask you, Ashley Dawson, about the anthropocentric nature of the report as it frames species’ survival as a matter of human survival, perhaps concerned that humans won’t care that a million species will go extinct unless it is put in terms of human beings going extinct.
ASHLEY DAWSON : Right, right. Well, there is something about the report that is influenced by the times we live in. It is called a report not just on biodiversity, but ecosystem services. And so that kind of neoliberal calculus is very evident from the report’s title itself. But I think that the report is sounding these alarm bells and not discounting the innate validity and importance of the natural world and of other life forms. It just wants to emphasize how intertwined we all are at this point and how we can’t break that link.
AMY GOODMAN : Kate Brauman, if you would like to respond to that?
KATE BRAUMAN : I agree; it is an anthropocentric take. And that I think is very important. Because as Ashley says, we are not separate or unlinked from the environment. Stewarding the environment, whether we’re doing it for personal gain or because we care, is what we as humans are doing. And that brings us to the center in ways that I think are very important in terms of moving forward and changing our behavior and changing this trajectory.
AMY GOODMAN : And do you see policymakers responding?
KATE BRAUMAN : I think so. One of the things that is so exciting about this is that it is a report of the governments. There are 132 member states who were part of his platform, and they approved this document. This is something that governments say “we think is important.”
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both for being with us. Of course, we’re going to link to the report. Kate Brauman is one of the coordinating lead authors of the new U.N. report on extinction. Environmental scientist at the University of Minnesota, speaking to us from Minneapolis. And Ashley Dawson is a professor at the CUNY Graduate Center.

AMY GOODMAN : A United Nations inquiry has found Israeli forces may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity by targeting unarmed children, journalists and the disabled in Gaza. The report , released by the U.N. Human Rights Council Thursday, looked at Israel’s bloody response to weekly Great March of Return demonstrations, launched by Palestinians in Gaza nearly a year ago, targeting Israel’s heavily militarized separation barrier. The report found Israeli forces have killed 183 Palestinians, almost all of them with live ammunition. The dead included 35 children. Twenty-three thousand people were injured, including over 6,000 shot by live ammunition. Santiago Canton chaired the U.N. commission.
SANTIAGO CANTON : The commission has found reasonable grounds to believe that the Israeli security forces committed serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. These violations clearly warrant criminal investigation and prosecution, and we call on Israel to conduct meaningful investigations into these serious violations and to provide timely justice and reparations for those killed and injured.
AMY GOODMAN : Another member of the U.N. independent commission, Sara Hossain, described how Israeli forces targeted civilians and journalists in Gaza.
SARA HOSSAIN : We are saying that they have intentionally shot children, they have intentionally shot people with disabilities, they have intentionally shot journalists, knowing them to be children, people with disabilities and journalists. And some of the children—not all of the children are visibly children perhaps, but many of them are. As Commissioner Murungi just said, the journalists were all marked with press vests, that we investigated. And the people with disabilities, as I said, a double amputee in a wheelchair, a person using crutches, they were visibly that. And they’ve been shot at by snipers, who also have spotters available with them, who have very high-level technology available to see who is out there in the field.
AMY GOODMAN : The U.N. report called on nations to arrest, quote, “persons alleged to have committed, or ordered to have committed, the international crimes,” unquote, or to seek their extradition. The U.N. also demanded Israel immediately lift the blockade on Gaza. Israel’s acting foreign minister dismissed the report as “theater of the absurd.” However, grieving Palestinians welcomed the report, including Raeda Ayoub, whose teenage son Mohammad was killed during the Gaza protests.
RAEDA AYOUB : [translated] We are happy that someone is supporting Gaza’s children, and we are happy that they are supporting us to defend Gaza’s children and youth in Gaza against the crimes committed by the occupation.
AMY GOODMAN : The U.N. report was issued Thursday, the same day Israel’s attorney general announced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing an indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
For more, we’re joined by two guests. Sara Hossain is a member of the U.N. independent commission that led the Gaza investigation. She’s also a barrister practicing in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. She joins us from Dhaka, Bangladesh. And here in New York, scholar Norman Finkelstein, author of many books, including Gaza: An Inquest into Its Martyrdom .
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Sara Hossain, let’s begin with you. Tell us about the most significant findings of your report and how this report came into being.
SARA HOSSAIN : I’m sorry. I couldn’t hear that.
AMY GOODMAN : Please explain the findings of the report.
SARA HOSSAIN : Sure. I mean, this report was commissioned as basis of a resolution by the Human Rights Council. And accordingly, we’ve conducted investigations for about six months now with trained investigators and a team of experts. I should mention, we haven’t been given access to Gaza or to Israel, which obviously has hampered us quite considerably. But nevertheless, we have been able to interview witnesses, and we have been able to interview many victims, as well, some in person and some remotely. We’ve also been able to gather an extraordinary amount of documentary material, including video and drone footage, social media content, as well as all of the affidavits and other testimonies. So, based on that, we’ve come to our assessment.
AMY GOODMAN : And talk about the most significant findings.
SARA HOSSAIN : The most significant, I think, is just the number of killings and the numbers of injuries. There are 183 Palestinians who have been killed in the course of the period that we have investigated, which is from the 30th of March to the 31st of December. As you know, the demonstrations are continuing, and killings and injuries have continued to be reported, but we’ve just covered this particular period. We also found, as you said, over 6,000 injuries to Palestinians caused by live fire. We found that four Israeli soldiers had been injured during this time, and two Israeli soldiers had also been killed, but both of those were outside the particular parameters of the investigation. They weren’t in the context of—they weren’t at the protest sites, although one of them was within the protest times. And I think, amongst the numbers of killings, what we also found, which was of great concern, was the fact that protected—groups who are protected categories in international law, protected persons, such as children, people with disabilities, and also health workers and journalists, were amongst those who were both killed and injured in large numbers.
AMY GOODMAN : The U.N. report calls on states to arrest “persons alleged to have committed, or ordered to have committed, the international crimes.” What exactly does that mean?
SARA HOSSAIN : Well, our investigation is done according to the standard of reasonable grounds to believe. It’s not a criminal investigation. We have made some preliminary findings based on the facts as we found them, and applying international human rights law and international humanitarian law where that was relevant, given that we’re speaking about the context of an occupation and the context—in certain contexts, the conduct of hostilities. So we’ve made these findings, but we believe that these need to be taken further. We’ve called on Israel itself to conduct investigations, and we understand that Israel has opened at least five investigations into the incidents that we’ve found. But we are not clear why it has not opened a larger number of investigations. We think that’s the first thing that should happen. We’ve also asked for the international community to look into this. We are going to present our findings, hand them over to the high commissioner for human rights of the United Nations. And I think then it’s for other bodies to take this further. As—
AMY GOODMAN : I want to go to acting Israeli foreign minister—

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , Democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And I’m Nermeen Shaikh. Welcome to our listeners and viewers around the country and around the world. In India, the sixth phase of voting has concluded in a highly anticipated parliamentary election that is widely seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is seeking a second term in office.
More than 100 million people were eligible to vote in this penultimate phase. India’s election commission reported voter turnout was just over 63%. The turnout in the first five phases averaged 67%, roughly the same as in the 2014 elections that brought Modi to power. India is the world’s largest democracy with 900 million eligible voters. The final phase of voting will take place on May 19th and vote-counting will begin on the 23rd.
Modi’s Hindu nationalist BJP won a landslide victory in 2014. Modi’s main opponent in this election is Rahul Gandhi’s Congress party. Gandhi’s father, grandmother and great grandfather have all served as prime minister of India.
AMY GOODMAN : Modi’s government has been criticized for a crackdown on civil society, targeting political opponents, journalists, human rights activists, lawyers and writers. Human rights groups have also raised the alarm on attacks against vulnerable populations, especially Dalits and Muslims.
To talk more about the elections as well as other issues from Kashmir to capitalism to climate change, we are joined by world-renowned, award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy. She won the Booker Prize in 1997 for her first novel The God of Small Things . Her second novel, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness was long-listed for the Booker Prize in 2017. A collection of her nonfiction writing titled out in June.
Arundhati Roy is in New York for the PEN World Voices Festival. She delivered the Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture on Sunday night at Harlem’s historic Apollo Theater. Welcome back to Democracy Now! , Arundhati. It’s great to have you here.
ARUNDHATI ROY : Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN : So yesterday as you were giving your speech, you were lamenting that you couldn’t be in India, because your city, New Delhi, was voting. Can you explain the six-week-long Indian elections and how you see them as a referendum on the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi?
 six-week-long election of course has to do with the fact that there are 900 million voters and just the logistics of that, dealing with the logistics of that, is cumbersome and difficult. Although I don’t recall elections being strung over such a long period before, so there is more esoteric stuff in that which I don’t want to get into. But there is also a lot of anxiety in India about the election voting machines, the EVMs and so on.
But yeah, it’s a referendum on Modi in a way, because oddly enough, he seems to have—in his sort of desire to project himself, he has not just burned everybody else, but even his own party. So in many places, there are people who are standing for elections who say—who people don’t even know, because they just say, “Never mind who the local person you are voting for is; it’s a vote for Modi.”
Now what does Modi stand for? Of course the core of him is the far-right, Hindu nationalist core. And that core group will remain with him. But in the 2014 elections, he had added another layer, which was the layer of “I am the development prime minister.” The slogan in Hindi was [inaudible] meaning like “development with everybody and for everybody.” So a lot of people sort of forgot about his somewhat gruesome past and voted in the hope that he was going to move India forward economically. And that never happened. He shot the tires off that moving car with demonetization and this tax that you mentioned.
So likely, he is going to lose that second layer that he had put on, the fur coat that he had put on, the business suit that he had put on for the previous elections. And now he is just campaigning brazenly on Hindu nationalism, on national security, on terrorism and all of that. So he is likely going to rally his base but lose the support that actually brought him into power last time.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Can you explain, Arundhati, his main rival, Rahul Gandhi? Last night when you spoke at the Apollo Theater, you said that even though you had previously been very critical of the Congress party, you have been impressed with Rahul Gandhi and his campaigning in this election. So could you explain what he stands for, what the Congress party is proposing, and why you think he may actually beat Narendra Modi?
ARUNDHATI ROY : OK, so this is not true that Rahul Gandhi is the main rival. Rahul Gandhi is surely being—I mean, the Congress party is the only other sort of national party, but in fact what has happened is very interesting because the BJP and the Hindu nationalists have the centrifugal force that’s rallying around Modi, and the force that’s against him is actually dispersing into a kind of federalism.
So what is likely to happen is that the Congress will be the glue that holds together a whole lot of regional political parties, who are the ones—especially in let’s say UP, in the biggest, most populous state in India, Uttar Pradesh, which sends most members to Parliament, which would be crucial for any party to win, the Congress has no presence—literally no presence in UP. It will be regional political parties which will actually eventually defeat Modi and then there will be a coalition which will be held together by the Congress.
But Rahul Gandhi, of course as you said, he comes from the Gandhi family. And the Congress is a party that I myself have written against, when they were in power. Rahul Gandhi was a very sorry figure in the 2014 elections. But I have been very impressed by how—he didn’t really have power. He was not the secretary of the party at the time. Now he is the secretary of the party. And yes, he comes from a kind of entitled political dynasty, but—
AMY GOODMAN : Explain who he comes from.
ARUNDHATI ROY : Well, he is the grandson of Indira Gandhi, who was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru. So it is a long line of very—I mean, the founders of modern Indian politics in some ways. They did a lot of right and a lot of wrong. And went down. Rahul Gandhi went down. And he has had to fight his way back. In a way, his legacy has been more of a disadvantage in some ways, you know? So I admire anybody who has been able to come back in that way.
He has been able to actually drag the discourse of Hindu nationalism and this cretinized conversation about—if you look at the kind of things that the BJP are saying in campaigning—the members of Parliament, people who are standing—saying things like, “We will shave all the Muslims and force them to become Hindu.” You know, the level of the discourse there. And he, and especially through this manifesto, which is a—which has sort of rolled back what I see also as a troublesome legacy of the previous Congress party, which initially was really very pro-free market, very very pro-privatization, the privatization of education, the destruction of the environment in ways.
And here this manifesto actually talks about the right to education, the right to public education, the right—I mean, it promises a living wage to the bottom 20% of the population. Which you can argue that it’s not revolutionary. But not revolutionary—it is revolutionary for a centrist party. It surely is—that kind of welfare economics. But when you look at the fact that now you’re talking about people are just not even getting enough nutrition, not getting enough to survive, I think at this point of time, I do agree with the idea of a living wage.
The BJP has sort of crashed the earlier Rural Employment Guarantee program. People who are involved in the right to information have been killed—writers, journalists, activists. So there’s something that is dragging that whole cesspit of—pulling it out of the cesspit and at least bringing the conversation back to a sort of sane place. And so this Rahul Gandhi has done, I think, and I admire him for that.
AMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about the climate for these elections? It’s mind-blowing that they go on for six weeks. Most people in the world couldn’t understand something like that. But the climate that has been set by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi? And also describe his background.
ARUNDHATI ROY : His background is interesting in the sense that soon after the 9/11 attacks, Modi was appointed the chief minister of a state called Gujarat. Now, whether it had anything to do with the attacks or something to do with the massive earthquake that had really devastated Gujarat, but actually Modi was not a member of the legislative assembly. He was not elected to office in any way. He was just appointed, dropped in as the chief minister. And within months of that, there was what is now known as the Gujarat pogrom, in which approximately 2,000 people were slaughtered in broad daylight on the streets of Gujarat. Within months of that, he called an election and won hands-down.
So after that, there has been no looking back. And quite soon after the Gujarat massacre, the captains of industry as you call them, the big CEOs of the big corporations, had a big meeting in Gujarat, and said that—endorsed him as their future prime ministerial candidate. That was interesting because they saw a man who they could—I think they saw that authoritarian figure as being somebody who could implement the new neoliberal economic policies which were coming up against a lot of protest. And they thought, “Here is a man who can crush these troublesome people.” Not Muslims, necessarily, but everybody who is now protesting displacement and protesting privatization.
So when he came to power, he had the backing of the sort of crazed far right as well as a lot of corporate money. And of course, after he announced the policy of demonetization in which like overnight he just declared—nobody seemed to know, not even his finance secretary or finance minister. He just appeared on TV one night and declared 80% of India’s currency was no longer legal tender. First of all, regardless of what the economic reasons for doing it were, which turned out to be rubbish, but no one in history has ever done something like that. Like I said, it just shot the wheels off, the tires off the cars. The moving car. A moving car. And mysteriously, it completely devastated all other political parties, but the BJP has enhanced its wealth several times over after that.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : In fact, you have said the BJP has more money than all the other parties put together. So could you talk about the role of money in the election?
ARUNDHATI ROY : Well, that’s the thing. I mean, if you look at—now you have to be a rich person to stand for election. You have to have a lot of money. And of course, the corporate support would mean that there are certain corporations like Reliance, which is the biggest one in India, which owns, let’s say, 27 TV channels. So the combination of money, of a complete control on the media, and what used to be a complete control on the social media, which has now been shaken a little bit.
But if I were to sort of try and predict what is going to happen in the elections—the results, which will be out on the 23rd—I would say that no one is going to win. There is going to be a lot of bargaining to form a coalition government. I think it’s likely to be a non- BJP coalition government. But the fact that no one is going to win—
AMY GOODMAN : You go against the polls on that.
 polls might be older. But I think there’s a—yeah, I do go against the polls if those are the polls. Certainly I don’t think they’re going to win. But I just want to say that I think the fact that no one is going to win is a great victory. A great victory. Because it just looked like this juggernaut would just crash through us and stay there for years and years. So for people, other parties, people who have fought without that kind of money, without that kind of media.
And I really—I don’t know how to explain it on an American TV channel, but I want to say that everything about Indian elections, everything is about caste. Like if you came there, you wouldn’t even understand the words and the language in which the analysis is done. And it’s like in Bihar, they won’t understand Kerala. In Karnataka, they won’t understand Bangalore. Because it is all deeply caste-driven.
So what has actually moved against the Modi government—and this is very important because you too are facing a kind of white supremacist regime—the RSS , which is—so yesterday when I spoke, I said liberals and secular people have consistently played down the link between the BJP and the RSS . The RSS , the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, is a right-wing proto-fascist “cultural guild” as it calls itself, set up in 1925. And the BJP more or less functions as its parliamentarian department. But the RSS makes all the decisions. The prime minister belongs to the RSS . The secretary of the BJP belongs to the RSS . Most of the ministers belong to the RSS . And as I say, it was set up in 1925. Its enemies are declared Muslims, Christians, Hindus. It has always been against the Indian Constitution. It wants India declared a Hindu Republic.
Now against this RSS , which is basically controlled and run by—I mean, the politburo, if you like, of the RSS are Brahmins, a group of Brahmins. And against this, what is going to defeat them is not Rahul Gandhi. It is a different mobilization of the lower castes or the lower castes in brackets, you know. The Dalits. The what is classified as other backward castes. So it’s actually a pretty revolutionary thing, a movement much deeper than elections. But I won’t go on, because I think people won’t understand here what I’m saying.
AMY GOODMAN : And the internationalizing of what you see, the RSS , what they represent? Narendra Modi’s relationship with President Trump and what you see the comparisons are?
ARUNDHATI ROY : Well, firstly, let me say that it was not only President Trump. Even Obama came there and embraced Modi. Macron came there and embraced Modi. Trump hasn’t come there and embraced Modi, but Modi has come here and embraced Trump. All of it has got to do with business deals.
But below that, the connection between the RSS and very many “alt-right” groups here, there is an ideological convergence, because at the center of it is the idea of Aryan supremacy. And so they, like the far-right groups here, very much admire the caste system as the ancient arbiter of social hierarchy. So there is a lot of dealings and social connection between all of that. A great admiration for the caste system, a great admiration for the fact that human beings are not equal. They were never meant to be equal. So there is a convergence there.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to break and then come back to our discussion, and we’re going to talk to you about other things as well. You see Kashmir is a possible flashpoint, a nuclear flashpoint that people should be very aware of. We’re going to talk about the latest news about Julian Assange. Sweden says it is reopening an investigation against him. He is currently in jail. And we want to talk about issues like climate change and capitalism.

A new collection of her nonfiction writing, titled My Seditious Heart , will be out next month. Links Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Thank you, Arundhati, for reading from your lecture last night at the Apollo. Could you say a little bit more about—I mean, as the writer of two beautiful novels as well as literally hundreds and hundreds of literary nonfiction, what you see as the role of literature in this context? You referred to it, in fact, in that same lecture, this context, as a blitzkrieg of idiocy. And the other point you made about literature being essential, fiction being essential to saying what cannot in any other context be said? And you cited Kashmir.
ARUNDHATI ROY : Well, yes, I cited Kashmir, and I cited James Baldwin, who says that “and they wouldn’t believe me, precisely because they knew that what I was saying was true.” So basically, I think—to me, the reason—I wonder sometimes, in this age of so much WhatsApp and video and Netflix and movies and living in a country where so many people are either semi-literate or illiterate, why is it that a certain kind of writing, like say my essays and even my books now, they are translated—
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Your novels.
ARUNDHATI ROY : —my novels—spontaneously into so many languages. Into 51 languages in the case of The Ministry . Many Indian languages. When I go to speak in places like anywhere in India, literally thousands show up. Why? Not because I am some superstar, but because everybody is looking to understand what is happening at this moment, when really the era that we think we know and understand is coming to an end. And this is the simplest way of saying a complicated thing, you know? Literature is.
And I feel that the radical understanding now has to come from not thinking of climate— “Oh, I’m a specialist in climate change”; “I’m a specialist in river valleys”; “I’m a specialist on Kashmir”; “I’m a specialist—.” You know, this kind of compartmentalization is actually reducing the real problem that we have. Because now you have to understand there’s a connection between caste and climate change and capitalism and nationalism and internationalism. And I think this is where literature and a way of grappling with history as a kind of supple narrative is important.
AMY GOODMAN : Telling truths, as you quote James Baldwin, saying it is easier to often tell those truths in fiction rather than nonfiction. Which is your preferred way of writing? As we move into your next book coming out in June—1,000 pages of your nonfiction essays.
ARUNDHATI ROY : Well, as I said in my lecture yesterday, people—apart from which is my preferred way, other people have their preferred forms of my writing. But to me, they are both part of my body. They are both part of the way I think. And I would only say that the nonfiction that I have written has always been an urgent intervention. And together, somehow when I looked at it together, the urgency put together over 20 years creates a special kind of narrative, a special kind of history. Because even the nonfiction I see when I read it—
AMY GOODMAN : We have five seconds.
ARUNDHATI ROY : —I’m always telling stories.

Our guest for the hour, Arundhati Roy, the winner of the Booker Prize for her first novel The God of Small Things . Her second novel, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness was long-listed for that same prize in 2017. Now, a collection of her nonfiction writing is coming out called My Seditious Heart . It is over a thousand pages and will be out in June. Last night, you gave an impassioned address at Harlem’s historic Apollo Theater. The address that you gave was called the Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture, and you titled it “A Place for Literature.” Can you share a little of it with us?
ARUNDHATI ROY : Sure. As the ice caps melt, as oceans heat up and water tables plunge, as we rip through the delicate web of interdependence that sustains life on earth, as our formidable intelligence leads us to breach the boundaries between humans and machines and our even more formidable hubris undermines our ability to connect the survival of our planet to our survival as a species, as we replace art with algorithms and stare into a future in which most human beings may not be needed to participate in or be remunerated for economic activity, at just such a time we have the steady hands of white supremacists in the White House, new imperialists in China and neo-Nazis once again massing on the streets of Europe, Hindu nationalists in India, and a host of butcher princes and lesser dictators in other countries to guide us into the unknown.
While many of us dreamt that another world is possible, these folks were dreaming, too. And it is their dream, our nightmare, that is perilously close to being realized. Capitalism’s gratuitous wars and sanctioned greed have jeopardized the planet and filled it with refugees. Much of the blame for this rests squarely on the shoulders of the government of the United States. Seventeen years after invading Afghanistan, after bombing it into the Stone Age with the sole aim of toppling the Taliban, the U.S. government is back in talks with the very same Taliban. In the interim, it has destroyed Iraq, Libya and Syria. Hundreds of thousands have lost their lives to war and sanctions. A whole region has descended into chaos, ancient cities pounded into dust.
Amidst the desolation and the rubble, a monstrosity called Daesh, ISIS , has been spawned. It has spread across the world, indiscriminately murdering ordinary people who had absolutely nothing to do with America’s wars. Over these last few years, given the wars it has waged and the international treaties it has arbitrarily reneged on, the U.S. government perfectly fits its own definition of a rogue state. And now resorting to the same old scare tactics, the same tired falsehoods and the same old fake news about nuclear weapons, it is gearing up to bomb Iran. That will be the biggest mistake it has ever made. The original content of this program is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License .

"Arundhati Roy: Capitalism Is ""a Form of Religion"" Stopping Solutions to Climate Change & Inequality",www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/13/arundhati_roy_capitalism_is_a_form,"world-renowned, award-winning author of The God of Small Things and The Ministry of Utmost Happiness . A new collection of her nonfiction writing, titled My Seditious Heart , will be out next month. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Arundhati, I would like to now turn to another issue, which you also raised in your lecture last night, and that is climate change. Another award-winning Indian writer, Amitav Ghosh, has written about climate change in his most recent book titled The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable . Ghosh discusses two key publications on climate change that were written in 2015—the Encyclical on Environment and Climate Change by Pope Francis and the Paris Climate Agreement.
Ghosh points out several differences in the two texts, writing that the Encyclical doesn’t hesitate to “criticize the prevalent paradigms of our era. Most of all it is fiercely critical of the idea of infinite or unlimited growth.” He goes on to say, quote, “In the text of the Paris Agreement, by contrast, there is not the slightest acknowledgment that something has gone wrong with our dominant paradigms. The current paradigm of perpetual growth is enshrined at the core of the text of the Paris Agreement,” Ghosh writes.
Now during your lecture last night, you said that those most responsible for creating the problem, the problem of climate change “will see to it that they profit from the solution that they propose.” So could you elaborate on that?
ARUNDHATI ROY : Well, the thing is for me, for so many years, people—let’s say in India—have been fighting this very idea of progress, of infinite growth, of this form of development which has resulted now in what we call jobless growth, what everybody knows to be the case. You have nine individuals who own the same amount of wealth as the bottom 500 million. This is what infinite growth has led to—infinite growth for some people.
So I remember years ago, I wrote an essay which ended by saying, “Can we leave the bauxite in the mountain?” Because I think that’s ultimately the question. Can you look at the mountain and not just calculate its mineral worth? Can you understand that a mountain has much more than just the value of the minerals in it? And there is—it’s a civilizational issue, right? That for people who have lived there, have known that mountain, they know it sustains not just the people. It’s not just a question of who is getting displaced. But how does, for example, that bauxite mountain—which stores water and waters the plains all around it, which grows the food, which sustains a whole population—but it’s meant for a corporation that is given the mining contract. It’s just, how much does that bauxite cost? Can we store it and trade it on the futures market?
So this idea that you will never question your idea of progress, you will never question the comfort of the Global North. And by Global North—now and the elite South, and the downtrodden North, you know? It is like what I said, that the elite of the world have all seceded into outer space, and they have a country up there, and they look down and say, “What is our water doing in their rivers, and what’s our timber doing in their forests?”
So there is a psychotic refusal to understand that the survival of the species is connected to the survival of the planet, you know? Because this sort of progress is a kind of church now. It is not amenable to reason. So it is very difficult to know how any real conversation can happen, which is why I said yesterday that the only real conversation that is happening is a conversation in which the language around climate change is being militarized. Because the U.N., underneath every conflict which appears to be a conflict between a tribe and a tribe, or a country and a country, is increasingly climate change, is increasingly the shrinking of resources and people collecting together to claim them and therefore, the growth of this kind of nationalistic or identity or tribal politics.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you make a connection between the issue of climate change and the issue of the growing inequality in the world? Certainly, it is massive in the United States. And in India, the growing inequality has increased enormously. You have this Oxfam report that just came out revealing billionaire fortunes in India increased by 35% last year as the poorest remain in debt. But that connection, that link of capitalism, between the two?
ARUNDHATI ROY : The connection is just capitalism, isn’t it? I mean, it’s pretty clear now. That any sort of attempt—I will give you a very good example. Like a month or two ago, the Supreme Court of India, based on a case that a wildlife NGO had filed, said that two million indigenous people should be evicted from their forest homes with immediate effect. Why? Because that forest needs to be preserved as a sanctuary. But when, for the last 25 years, people were fighting against projects which were decimating millions of hectares and acres of forest, nobody cared. And it was the same people that were being displaced. Then it was for progress; now it is for conservation. But it is always the same people who have to pay the price.
And when you are talking about evicting two million of the poorest people, stripping them of everything they ever had, there is little outrage. When the Congress party announced that it is going to have a scheme in which 20% of the poorest people will get a living wage, everyone just exploded. Like, how can you think of doing this? Because it strikes at the core of unregulated capitalism. Any sense of talk of equality or justice seems to just have the same effect that blasphemy has in religious societies. That is what capitalism has become—a form of religion that will brook no questioning.
AMY GOODMAN : We have to break again, but when we come back, we would like you to share a part of your lecture last night with us, that you gave at the historic Apollo Theater in Harlem. Arundhati Roy, the great writer who has written two novels and many books of essays. Her most recent, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness . The God of Small Things before that.

Arundhati Roy on Why She Admires WikiLeaks & Opposes Assange’s Extradition to the U.S.,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/13/arundhati_roy_on_why_she_admires,"Arundhati Roy on Why She Admires WikiLeaks & Opposes Assange’s Extradition to the U.S. Story May 13, 2019 world-renowned, award-winning author of The God of Small Things and The Ministry of Utmost Happiness .

In Sweden, prosecutors are reopening an investigation into sexual assault allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and are seeking his extradition to face charges in Sweden. Prosecutors had dropped the investigation in 2017 because they said the case could not proceed while Assange was holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he lived for seven years before being forcibly removed by British police last month. Assange has since been sentenced to 50 weeks in jail in Britain for skipping bail in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden. Assange has denied the sexual assault accusations. Assange previously faced another sexual misconduct allegation but its statute of limitations expired in 2015. The United States is also seeking Assange’s extradition over the publication of leaked documents by Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, which showed evidence of U.S. war crimes in Iraq. We speak with award-winning writer Arundhati Roy, who has criticized the arrest of WikiLeaks founder and Editor-in-Chief Julian Assange. Roy and other public intellectuals in India called for Assange’s immediate release, writing in a statement, “The journalism WikiLeaks and its Editor-in-Chief stand for is a journalism of outrage — outrage against the injustices and atrocities that take place round the world — but always with an eye to factuality, substantiation, and precision… If the U.S. had charged Assange and Wikileaks for publishing classified material, the legal case would have been no different from charging The New York Times with publishing the Pentagon Papers”.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So Arundhati, you are one of six public intellectuals in India who criticized the arrest of WikiLeaks founder and editor-in-chief Julian Assange in London last month. In a statement, the signatories of the statement called for his immediate release, writing “The journalism WikiLeaks and its Editor-in-Chief stand for is a journalism of outrage–outrage against the injustices and atrocities that take place round the world–but always with an eye to factuality, substantiation, and precision. If the US had charged Assange and Wikileaks for publishing classified material, the legal case would have been no different from charging The New York Times with publishing the Pentagon Papers,” the statement said.
AMY GOODMAN : In Sweden, prosecutors are now reopening an investigation into sexual assault allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and are seeking his extradition to face the charges in Sweden. The U.S. is also seeking Assange’s extradition over the publication of leaked documents by Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, which showed evidence of U.S. war crimes in Iraq.
So this latest news that just broke today—many people feel that Sweden has been under enormous pressure to say they have reopened an investigation on sexual assault and rape charges against Assange so that he will also be called back to Sweden and that ultimately, what he is most concerned about is being extradited to the United States. He has said he doesn’t want to be sent to Guantánamo Bay. Why have you gotten involved in this case? And these latest allegations today, do they concern you?
ARUNDHATI ROY : Well, I met Assange a few years ago at the Ecuadorian embassy. I was and am an admirer of WikiLeaks. The trouble is of course that there is a sort of—these issues of sexual assault are separate, in my mind, from the idea of his extradition to the U.S. Now, I don’t know—I am unable to read what this new demand by Sweden is. Is it really to try him for rape, or is it because the U.S. feels it can get him extradited from Sweden easier than it can from England, from London? I don’t know. I don’t know.
But I think it is absolutely right that if you are going to send Julian Assange to Guantánamo Bay, then you are really attacking people who publish news that the world needs to know. Although the charge against him they are trying to say is that he was trying to help and encourage Chelsea Manning to hack into the Pentagon computers, which I think is a flimsy charge.
AMY GOODMAN : Many journalists are deeply concerned about this, because when they are working with a source and a source says, “How do I get this information to you?” it is very difficult when the government says, “You solicited this,” when a source is trying to be protected and trying to figure out the safest way to get information they feel is critical to understanding, in this case, war, Iraq War, Afghanistan War, State Department memos.
ARUNDHATI ROY : It’s outrageous, basically, because what about all of the documents that Snowden leaked? People have published them. Are they going to be put into prison? What about the people who helped Snowdon to escape? Are they going to be put into prison? Where does this end then? So it’s a very serious step. It’s not about Assange. It’s not about whether he’s a nice man or a not-nice man or whether he raped someone or didn’t. If he did, he should be punished for it. That’s a separate matter from this. And we oughtn’t to get into this mess about oh, would it be—is it OK because you like him or you don’t like him. It’s not about him as a person. I don’t know him personally. And if he has indeed raped somebody, he should be punished for that. But that is not the same thing as the WikiLeaks enterprise. And that enterprise concerns us all. All of us.

In Pakistan, a Saturday attack on a luxury hotel in the port city of Gwadar has killed at least five people, according to local reports. Four hotel employees and a special forces soldier died in the raid that was claimed by separatist group, the Baloch Liberation Army. Topics: Burkina Faso: Gunmen Kill 6 People, Incl. Priest and Burn Down Church May 13, 2019
In Burkina Faso, gunmen have shot dead six people, including a priest, during the celebration of Mass in a church in the north of the country, before burning down the church. Attacks by extremist militias have been on the rise since 2017, although no group has claimed responsibility for Sunday’s killing. Topics: At Least 65 Migrants Drown After Boat Sinks in Mediterranean, U.N. Reports May 13, 2019
The U.N. reported at least 65 people drowned when a boat carrying migrants across the Mediterranean sank Friday. The migrants came from a range of countries including Bangladesh, Libya, Morocco and several sub-Saharan African nations. This is a survivor of the shipwreck from Egypt, Mandour Mohamed.
Mandour Mohamed : “…There were 75 of us. We sailed a little bit then, because of how many people were on the boat, the [boat] started filling up with water. It then sunk and capsized. This was 12 o’clock at midnight. We kept floating in the water until 8 o’clock in the morning. A small Tunisian boat then came to our rescue. They came and took us, along with the Tunisian army. Thank god, we are here in Tunis.”
Although the number of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean has gone down since its peak in 2015, the U.N. warns the journey is increasingly fatal for those who undertake it. According to the International Organization for Migration, nearly 2,300 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean last year. Topics:"

Will John Bolton’s Dream to Bomb Iran Come True?

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , Democracynow.org , The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I’m Juan González. Welcome to all of our viewers and listeners across the country and around the world. The Pentagon has reportedly drawn up a plan to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East if President Trump decides to take military action against Iran. The New York Times reports the Pentagon presented the proposal on Thursday after National Security Advisor John Bolton requested a revision to an earlier plan. Bolton has long advocated for attacking Iran. According to the Pentagon, far more than 120,000 troops would be needed if a ground invasion was ordered.
This comes as tension continues to escalate between the United States and Iran. The United States recently deployed the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the region claiming there was a credible threat by Iranian regime forces. Meanwhile, Iran has announced it will stop complying with parts of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal and resume high-level enrichment of uranium within 60 days if other signatories of the deal do not take action to shield Iran’s oil and banking sectors from U.S. sanctions. The U.S. has attempted to cut Iran off from the global economy even though Iran has remained in compliance with the nuclear deal.
AMY GOODMAN : In another development from the region, four oil tankers, including two Saudi tankers, were damaged off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on Sunday. Saudi Arabia described it as a sabotage attack. Unnamed U.S. officials have been quoted in the media blaming Iran but no evidence has been presented. Iran has described the incident as a conspiracy orchestrated by ill-wishers. On Monday, President Trump was asked about what happened.
REPORTER : Mr. President, are you concerned about the attacks on oil tankers in the Middle East?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : We’ll see what happens. It’s going to be a bad problem for Iran if something happens; I can tell you that. They’re not going to be happy. They are not going to be happy people.
REPORTER : What do you mean by that?
REPORTER : [Inaudible]
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : You can figure it out yourself. They know what I mean by it.
AMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is claiming drones carried out attacks on two Saudi oil pumping stations earlier today. A Houthi-run TV station in Yemen had earlier reportedly said the Houthis had carried out an attack inside Saudi Arabia. On Monday, the European Union urged the Trump administration to show maximum restraint following a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and European union diplomats in Brussels. Today, Pompeo is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Iran and other issues. Meanwhile, Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif is in India today. Up until recently, India was the second largest importer of Iran’s oil behind China, but India cut off sales after the Trump administration withdrew waivers allowing them to import Iranian oil.
We are joined now by a former Iranian ambassador, Seyed Hossein Mousavian. He is a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. From 2003 to 2005, he served as spokesperson for Iran in its nuclear negotiations with the European Union. He is the author of The Iranian Nuclear Crisis: A Memoir and most recently, Iran and the United States: An Insider’s view on the Failed Past and the Road to Peace . Welcome back to Democracy Now! , Ambassador Seyed Hossein Mousavian. It is great to have you with us. Very serious times, as The New York Times reports that the U.S. is preparing to send 120,000 troops to the region, to the area around Iran. Is reportedly drawing up plans. Can you talk about the significance of this?
SEYED HOSSEIN MOUSAVIAN : Yes, good morning. Actually, I expected such a situation after Ambassador John Bolton was nominated as national security advisor. I have written many op-ends, articles during last year that it’s going to happen. Because even this morning, if you look at USA Today , two high-ranking American congressmembers, Senator Murphy and Representative Himes, they have an op-ed saying that John Bolton and Pompeo are leading the U.S. into a war with Iran. Some days before, another two very high-ranking congressmembers, Senator Durbin, they had the same op-ed saying that John Bolton is taking the U.S. to a war with Iran.
Therefore, it is clear John Bolton wrote an op-ed at New York Times calling for attacking Iran, bombing Iran as the only option, as he said. He was allied with the terrorist group of Iranian terrorist group MEK . He gave lecture. He invited them to rule Iran. He called for regime change. Therefore, everyone knows what is the strategy and the mindset and the plan of Ambassador John Bolton. This is not confidential issue.
Second, the fact is that the Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu for many years has been pushing the U.S. to attack Iran. He has huge influence at White House. You remember when President Trump withdrew from Iran nuclear deal. Some days later, Bibi Netanyahu said, “I asked him to leave the JCPOA .” The Iranian nuclear deal. “It was me who made him to depart from the deal.” After President Trump designated Iranian army as a terrorist group, again, Bibi Netanyahu publicly said, “It was me who asked President Trump to designate Iranian army as a terrorist group.” Therefore, this is very obvious, well-known.
The third issue is the fact bin Salman and bin Zayed, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and Emirate, they have been pushing U.S. for many years to attack Iran. You remember Secretary of State John Kerry three times revealed that in any meeting—he said—we had with Saudis, Israelis, the Emiratis, they were asking only to attack Iran, attack Iran, attack Iran. Therefore, the four B’s team—John Bolton, Bibi Netanyahu, bin Salman, and bin Zayed—now they have excellent position at the White House to push the U.S. the dream they have had for years and years and years—to drag the U.S. into a war with Iran.
That’s why I would say what the American congressmembers have frequently warned, Iranians have warned, Europeans they have warned, is happening, unfortunately. That would be extremely dangerous for the U.S., for the region, for Iran, for international community. Because look at the situation in the Middle East today. What happened after the U.S. attacked Iraq? Who were encouraging the U.S. to attack Iraq? It was John Bolton. It was Bibi Netanyahu who came to U.S. congressmember and publicly, in front of hundreds of members of the Congress, said, “We have evidence that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and supporting [inaudible].” And they pushed President Bush to attack Iraq. And after that, everyone understood there was neither weapons of mass destruction nor evidence of any support of Saddam Hussein of [inaudible].
Therefore, everyone understand Iraq scenario is on the table exactly—although—I mean, I should say, personally, I believe President Trump really does not want war. Even he is not after regime change in Iran. But they are taking him exactly gradually, inching him to a war with Iran. And look at the situation—I mean, the consequences of U.S. attack on Afghanistan. After 17 years, over 50% of Afghanistan now is in the hands of Taliban, and the U.S. is crying to negotiate with Taliban for a face-saving after thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Afghanis, they have been killed. Five thousand, six thousand of Americans, they were killed in Iraq. And look at the Yemen situation.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Ambassador Mousavian, given the scenario you’ve laid out of the context of everything that has happened in the past, how do you see this latest news of these four commercial ships that were sabotaged and Iran claiming that they believe a third country is behind these attack? How do you see this as the buildup of a pretext to attacking Iran?
SEYED HOSSEIN MOUSAVIAN : Exactly. This is exactly what I have said for many months. How they would drag President Trump to a war. This would be such incidents in the region. It is not new. I have said for many months, in many articles and interviews, malicious attempts by conspirators, conspiracy attempts in order to blame either to attack the U.S. facilities in the region or to kill some American soldiers in the region or to attack American allies, facilities in the region. You just read last week some articles by Israeli papers saying that we have information that Iran is going to attack oil infrastructure of American allies in the region. This is the scenario. This is the conspiracy plan which they want to leave no option for President Trump unless to attack Iran.
AMY GOODMAN : Ambassador, we’re going to break and then come back to this discussion and also figure out how this all started to spiral with President Trump pulling out of the deal that you helped to negotiate, the Iran nuclear deal. We’re speaking with Ambassador Seyed Hossein Mousavian. This is Democracy Now! We will be back with him at Princeton University in a moment.

We want to turn to President Trump last Thursday who was speaking at an impromptu news conference. He said Iran’s leadership should sit down and talk with him about giving up Tehran’s nuclear program. Trump declined to answer a reporter’s questions about why he deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Group to Iran over what was described as unspecified threats.
REPORTER : What did Iran do to prompt you to send an aircraft carrier to the region? Is there a risk of military confrontation?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well, they were threatening, and we have information—we have information that you don’t want to know about. They were very threatening, and we just want to have—we have to have great security for this country and for a lot of other places.
REPORTER : Is there a risk of military confrontation, sir?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I guess you could say that always, right? Isn’t it? I mean, you know, always. I don’t want to say no, but hopefully that won’t happen. We have one of the most powerful ships in the world that’s loaded up and we don’t want to have to do anything. What I’d like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me. […] We just don’t want them to have nuclear weapons. Not too much to ask. And we would help put them back into great shape.
AMY GOODMAN : “I’d like to see them call me,” President Trump said. We are still with Princeton University professor, Ambassador Seyed Hossein Mousavian, Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Can you respond to what Trump said? And also, let’s talk about the stranglehold of the sanctions that the U.S. is continuing to tighten against Iran. The effects that’s having on the ground, ambassador?
SEYED HOSSEIN MOUSAVIAN : Yes, I think President Trump made a big mistake to depart from the nuclear deal. Practically, it was President Trump who left the negotiation table because Iran and the big powers, the P5+1, they were negotiating at the level of foreign ministers and deputy ministers for years. And during even President Obama, you remember John Kerry and the Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, if not every day, they were weekly in touch negotiating, meeting, emailing.
When President Trump left the deal, practically he left the negotiation table. Therefore, he should be blamed for leaving the negotiation, not the Iranian side. And he is welcomed back again to the forum of P5+1 to return to the nuclear deal, to open dialogue and negotiation with Iran and with the other world powers if there is any other issue beyond the nuclear to negotiate. This is number one.
Number two, there is well-known by many nuclear scientists worldwide, even International Atomic Energy Agency, saying that the Iranian nuclear deal was and is the most comprehensive agreement during the history of nonproliferation. And Iran has accepted commitment for transparency measures and limitations on the nuclear program, which no other member of NPT , Non-Proliferation Treaty, has ever accepted. Therefore, Iran has accepted the maximum level of transparency based on the reports of the IAEA and the United Nations.
Third, the IAEA , International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the sole agency to judge about the nuclear program of the members, for two years in 14 reports, has confirmed Iran has fully complied with the nuclear deal, therefore, there has been zero failure on the Iranian side.
The deal was approved by the United Nations Security Council in United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. The U.S. violated. It was the U.S. who violated the deal, departed, and now, and worse, which is really an unprecedented phenomena during the history of international relations and United Nation, is the fact that the United State is punishing the other member of United Nation for complying with the resolution 2231 to supporting implementing the Iran Nuclear Deal. We have never had a U.N. Security Council member to punish the other members just because they are implementing the deal.
Therefore the U.S. is discrediting the highest level of international body on security and political, which is the United Nations Security Council.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Ambassador, on that point specifically, President Trump did not only pull out, as you say; he is now trying to punish anyone who stays in the deal. Iran has waited patiently for a year for the other signatories to demonstrate that they’re going to continue implementing it. So how do you place the announcement that they may begin enrichment again in the context of this year-long wait to see what the Europeans and the other signatories would do about the plan?
SEYED HOSSEIN MOUSAVIAN : Exactly. See, it is not for—it is actually for two years. From the day one, President Trump has started to impose new sanctions. Based on JCPOA , the U.S. and EU, they are committed not only to reintroduce the nuclear-related sanctions, but not to reimpose new sanctions. Therefore, the U.S. has violated and is punishing the other members for implementing the deal. Iran has been patient for two years, implementing the deal with zero benefit.
Now Iran has decided on two measures, which is not a break of nuclear deal, because the U.S. latest sanctions prevented the export of excessive amount of enriched uranium. Based on the nuclear deal, Iran has accepted always to keep 300 kilogram and export the excessive amount to Russia of enriched uranium, and 130 tons of heavy water and to export the excessive amount to Oman. Now it is the U.S. has put sanctions on Iran not to export the heavy water, the excessive amounts to Oman, and not to export excessive amount of enrichment to Russia. Therefore, Iran has no other option. Iran cannot practically export, therefore Iran would be forced to have excessive amount, therefore it is not a violation by the Iranian side. Iran has been forced by the U.S. not to export.
However, Iran has warned the other P5+1 members that, “I have been waiting for two years for you. You have done zero. If you cannot implement the deal, I’m not going to implement the deal forever unilaterally. This is an international agreement. This is multilateral agreement. If the U.S. cannot comply, you should comply. If none of you are going to comply, I’m going to gradually depart from the deal.” That’s why now Europe, Russia, China, India, every country is blaming the U.S., not Iran.
AMY GOODMAN : A U.N. official recently criticized the U.S. for imposing these unilateral sanctions on Iran, on Cuba and Venezuela that could lead to mass starvation, he said. UN Special Rapporteur Idriss Jazairy said “Real concerns and serious political differences between governments must never be resolved by precipitating economic and humanitarian disasters, making ordinary people pawns and hostages thereof.” As we wrap up, the reality on the ground for the Iranian people right now, and what this could mean also for the government when the people are suffering as much as has been described?
SEYED HOSSEIN MOUSAVIAN : You’re completely right. Eighty millions of Iranians are suffering from U.S. sanctions. And practically the strategy of John Bolton is a war, a sanction war, economic war on Iranian nation in order to push them to bring a regime change within inside Iran. Within Iran. Therefore, practically they are punishing the Iranian nation. This is really a big humanitarian disaster because even Iranians, they cannot import medicine. They cannot import food.
And when Foreign Minister Zarif was here some weeks ago, he just wanted to test the humanitarian humor of the U.S. side. He proposed for exchange of prisoners. Regardless of whether the Iranian prisoners in the U.S. are guilty or not, or the U.S. prisoners in Iran are guilty or not, he proposed exchange of prisoners as a humanitarian gesture. And immediately, the White House declined. While we had such a humanitarian exchange during President Obama, but President Trump declined. Therefore, we understand now there is zero humanitarian good will from the U.S. side, and the policy is really economic war punishing the Iranian nation.
AMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you so much for being with us, ambassador.

The Apology: Eve Ensler's New Book Is the Letter She Wishes Her Abusive Father Had Written,www.democracynow.org,mail@democracynow.org (Democracy Now!),05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/14/the_apology_eve_enslers_new_book,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , Democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman with Juan González.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: The Apology . That’s the name of a groundbreaking new book by the world-renowned playwright and activist Eve Ensler that imagines what it would mean for a survivor of abuse to hear the words she has been waiting for her entire life—”I’m sorry.”
AMY GOODMAN : Eve Ensler’s father sexually and physically abused her throughout her childhood beginning when she was just five years old. His abuse caused immeasurable physical and emotional damage but he never apologized for his behavior. So decades after the abuse and his death, Eve Ensler decided to write an apology for him. The result is a stunning new book in which Eve writes to herself from her father’s perspective.
In the book’s introduction, she writes, “I am done waiting. My father is long dead. He will never say the words to me. He will not make the apology. So it must be imagined. For it is in our imagination that we can dream across boundaries, deepen the narrative, and design alternative outcomes.” Eve Ensler is the well-known author of The Vagina Monologues . Over 20 years ago in 1998, she launched V-Day, an international movement to stop violence against women and girls. She has dedicated her new book to every woman still waiting for an apology. Eve Ensler, welcome back to Democracy Now!
EVE ENSLER : Thank you. Good morning. Very happy to be here on the publication date.
AMY GOODMAN : Well, it is really an honor to be here as you launch this book. Eve, talk about what prompted you to do this extremely unusual book, act. I mean, what you must have gone through to write this.
EVE ENSLER : Well, I think there were several factors that kind of inspired me to do this. One was having worked in the movement to end violence against women for 21 years and looking at the recent iteration of #MeToo, how many women have broken the silence, how many women have told their stories, how many women have called men out. We see a few men losing their jobs, white men in particular getting them back fairly quickly. We see a couple of people maybe going to prison, some losing status.
But I was thinking in all of this time, particularly in this recent, when have we heard a man who has been accused come forward and make a thorough, deep, authentic accounting and apology for his deeds? And not only could I not think of one example, but I went back in thousands of years of patriarchy and think, when have I ever read that happened? When has a man ever come forward and—and I mean an apology, where you detail an account of the harms you have done and the actions you have taken, were you go inside the feelings, the hearts, the body of your victim to try to experience what she felt. Where you take full accountability for your actions and you evidence, through that, a process of self interrogation, which means you could not possibly do that act again.
We have seen a few men come forward who have spoken out about being called out, but they seem to be more kind of self-piteous rants about the loss of jobs or the loss of face. And then I thought to myself, well, I have been waiting 60 years for an apology from my father who died 31 years ago. Maybe I could write the apology I need to hear, to write the words that I need in order to get free, and possibly that could be a blueprint for what we could begin in our movement as the next stage of reckoning.
Because we can only call out men—like punishment is such a weird thing, right? It curtails behavior momentarily, but it doesn’t necessarily educate or transform people so that they will not repeat the behavior again. We have to move to the next level where we create a pathway and we create an impetus and men are catalyzed to begin to make deep and thorough accountings, and look at themselves and say, “What about my childhood brought me here? What about toxic, racist patriarchy brought me here? What in my own history do I have to go back and re-examine and look at? And how do I make amends so that my victim or the person I have harmed can be released from this story and move on?” That was the basic premise.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: It’s a really powerful book. What you have to do in order to achieve that goal is to actually, in essence, do an autobiography of your own father, go into his own development, his own history, what he was feeling. And I’m wondering—it must’ve been emotionally draining to have to write this.
EVE ENSLER : Slightly. [laugh] I mean, I think for many of us—and I just want to say this book is an offering; it’s not a prescription. I think there are many people who have no desire for an apology and don’t want to hear an apology, and I was certainly that way for many, many years of my life. It’s not a have-to. It’s like, if this works for you, do it.
But I will say something. You know, for so many years my father was this monolithic monster to me, right? And yet I was in a kind of paradigmatic vice with him, right? I was still victim to his perpetrator. My whole life has been framed by that paradigm, right? All my work. My writing has been framed. So my refusal to really know my father kept me in that paradigm because he remained monolithic monster to my victim.
The process of entering my father, or should I say letting my father enter me—because I do feel to a large degree he was very present through the writing of this book—I feel like I went into a strange trance state for four months, where I felt he was present with me and talking to me. I don’t even know some of the language that he wrote in this book. It’s not my words. It’s not my voice. Learning about my father’s story, where he came from, the steps in his own childhood, and his own patriarchal upbringing, and his own abusive upbringing that led him to become the person—were profoundly healing for me.
Because I think most survivors are caught in the why. Right? Whether you have survived racial abuse or gender abuse or—you are caught in, “Why?” Why would someone beat me up because of the color of my skin? Why would my own father—why would my own father try to kill his daughter? Why? Why? And doing this book, I began to unpack the why. It was like, oh, this happened to my father, and this. That isn’t justification; it’s explanation. And I think there is a big difference between justification and explanation. I think when you deepen—Emma Goldman once said, “We can’t forgive people until we understand people.” And I think that gave me a pathway to begin to say, “Oh.” Now, that didn’t mean it wasn’t incredibly painful to go into my father and learn about my father and feel his pain, because for so long, I didn’t want to.
AMY GOODMAN : Talk about what happened to you. You talk about your father as Shadow Man. Explain what happened.
EVE ENSLER : Well, I think for my father, he was brought up in that era—he was a child that was born long after the last child in the family, like 15 years. He was going to be that golden boy who was going to take the family to a whole new direction and raise their economic status. And he was adored. But adoration is a very damaging thing. It doesn’t allow you to be a human being. You can’t be messed up. You can’t make mistakes. You can’t be tender. You can’t cry. You can’t be lost.
So my father, all those feelings that he had, he just kept pushing underground and pushing underground and pushing underground. And then he kind of created this very charming veneer which he adapted from the movies and Cary Grant and all those kind of contemporary movie stars at that time. So all that dark, disturbing—the stuff he was not allowing him to accept got pushed under. And I think at my birth, the kind of birth of his tender baby daughter, evoked so much tenderness in my father and so much vulnerability in my father that he had no capacity to deal with that because he had smothered his own. He had smothered his own heart. He didn’t have any way to go, “Oh, my God.” And so what he did is what the Shadow Man would do. He went for it. He had it. He raped it. He grabbed it. He took it. He diminished it. You know what I mean? He conquered it. He had dominion over it, rather than just letting himself be at the mercy of it.
I was listening to Arundhati Roy the other night talk about leaving bauxite in the mountains. Can you just look at the mountains? Can you just leave the bauxite in the mountains? And I was thinking, it is no different than women’s bodies or a little girl’s body. Can you just honor the tenderness? Can you just look at the tenderness and appreciate the tenderness? And the answer is, if you don’t have a capacity to be vulnerable, if you don’t have a capacity to stand in your own tenderness, no, you have to seize it and dominate it and exploit it and take it. And sex is the way and rape is the way to avoid that tenderness. So I think that began the journey.
AMY GOODMAN : So this started when you were like five years old?
EVE ENSLER : Mmhmm. Mmhmm.
AMY GOODMAN : And how did you recall these memories?
EVE ENSLER : Like I said, I have known pieces of my story. I have never allowed myself to really put it all down, to just go, “Here is what happened.” And I think in writing the book, because I was writing it from my father’s point of view, I suddenly had memories that I had never had before. Because he was the carrier of the memories. Do you know what I mean?
And I’ll tell you something interesting that I learned, and I want to say this to other survivors: we carry our perpetrator inside us. We carry them. If someone enters your body, if someone beats you, if someone harasses you, if someone rapes you, they enter you. And particularly family members, because we live with them. We know their movements. We know their footsteps. We know what the sound of a cocktail sounds like after four. We know what that can do to us, if they’re going to beat us, if they’re going to harm us.
So I had been in dialogue with my father for many, many years, whether it was conscious or not, inside me. And what I realized in the course of writing this book is that we can actually turn the perpetrator inside us in another direction. I actually could change my father inside me from a monster to an apologist, from a monolithic creature to a broken, real human—tender human being.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And the impact on the rest of your family and the failure of others around you, especially in terms of your mother, to protect you?
EVE ENSLER : Well, that’s a really interesting question. Last night, somebody was asking at the Y event, they were talking about women, white women who voted for Trump, and are there parallels.
AMY GOODMAN : And you are talking about the 92nd Street Y, where you are interviewed by Glenn Close.
EVE ENSLER : Right. And James Naughton performed the piece so beautifully. And I was thinking, you know, my mother was a woman who had grown up very poor from Missouri. She did not have money. She met my father, who was this charming exterior New Yorker. And it was her road out. It was her economic road out. And by the time my father began doing what he was doing, she already had two children. Right? She had no money. She had no formal education. What was my—
AMY GOODMAN : Your brother and sister.
EVE ENSLER : Yeah, my mother had no formal education. So where was she going with her children? And I also think at that time, whether my mother knew it consciously, unconsciously—no one talked about any of this at that moment. I don’t think my mother felt agency enough in her life to protect her children. And at one point she actually said to me, “I sacrificed you. I sacrificed you.”
AMY GOODMAN : Did she say this when you were a child or as a woman?
EVE ENSLER : As an adult, when I confronted her about what happened. Several months after I talked to her, she said, “I sacrificed you. You were what I had to give up to keep the way of life that we had.” And I think sometimes fear, terror—my father was terrifying. I think in some ways my mother was the fourth child. Do you know what I mean? We were all under the tyranny of his bullying, of his anger, of his violent outbreaks, of sort of like the state of mind that we’re in, in America today. [laugh]
AMY GOODMAN : You were the keynote speaker at your graduation. What was your dad’s response?
EVE ENSLER : Mm. Oh, that was a horrible moment. Yes, I gave the keynote speech on feminism and racial justice. I was 22 years old. I walked outside to light a cigarette because I was completely—and my father was there, and he lit my cigarette. This was after I spoke to thousands of people. And he had a cigarette. He stood there silently. Never mentioned the speech. Never said a word about the speech. Time passed. Eventually he said—reached in his pocket and he handed me a check for $1,000, he shook my hand and said, “Have a good life.”
It was as if someone had taken a fist and punched it into the center of my being and knocked me out. And I have to tell you, it sent me on a very bad path for many years. You know, drugs, alcohol. It was like the final crushing moment. I think even if a person abuses you and incests you and beats you, it’s still your father. You still want their approval. You still want their love. So for me, it was like here I had done this, and it was like—boom.
AMY GOODMAN : So he raped you and physically assaulted you constantly throughout your childhood and teen years. When did he stop?
EVE ENSLER : He stopped when—I came home from college. I think that was in my first or second year. And I said I wanted to be a writer and he said, “No, you’re going to be a lawyer or an accountant.” And I said, “No, I’m not.” And he picked up a chair, and he started to smash it over my head. And it was the first time in my life I stood up and I said, “If you ever touch me again, if you ever touch me again, you will never see me for the rest of your life.” And I walked out the door. And that was the first time my mother in all those years stood up for me. And she followed me up the road and she said, “I told your father that I’ll leave him.” And I said, “It’s a little late.” Ten years too late. But OK.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And during your adult years before his death, was there any kind of communication or—
EVE ENSLER : We had a few attempts. When I got sober, he was really unhappy, because he didn’t like the idea—it was very threatening to his sobriety. As a matter of fact, he mixed me a drink. We had occasional times when there would be these strange very failing attempts to connect. And he didn’t contact me before he died. He didn’t contact me at all. As a matter fact, a week before he died, he came out of his stupor—he died of lung cancer— and he said to my mother, “I don’t want Eve in my will and I want you to know if she ever tells you anything, she’s a liar.” And my mother said to me it was that that made her know I was telling the truth. Because why would he have said that out of his stupor?
AMY GOODMAN : What is the anatomy of the ingredients for an effective apology?
EVE ENSLER : Thank you for asking that. I think so deeply about what is an apology. And I think first of all, it’s a humbling. It’s making yourself vulnerable. It’s an equalizer. It’s going into the detailed accounting of what you had done. Because the liberation is in the details. It can’t be broad. It’s not like an “I’m sorry.”
“I did this. I did this. I did this.” It’s feeling what your perpetrator [sic] must have been feeling as you were doing it. It’s letting yourself open to the heartbreak of that, to the sorrow of that. It’s doing self-evaluation and self-interrogation where you look at what brought you to do that, what in your childhood, what in the culture, what in your religion, what in your fam, what in any part of your life drove you to do that behavior.
And then one of the things I really learned is like we live in a culture of diabolical amnesia. We deny what happens in our family. We deny what happens in our history from the beginning of indigenous peoples through slavery. An apology is a remembering. What occurred did occur. And so by doing that, we are actually reattaching the pieces of our own histories into a healing kind of cloth.
And I think when you make an authentic apology, there is an alchemy that occurs. When you hear someone who has gone through the steps I just outlined, something in your body, in your psychology, in your spirit releases. Because that person has gone thoroughly and deeply and authentically into themselves to become vulnerable to you, to become equal to you, to become connected to you again. And I think in a way, we need to now move in our movement, to, as Tony Porter at A Call To Men brilliantly says, we have called men out; now we need to call them in. Now we need to call them in.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I’m wondering, talking about halfhearted apologies, we have all heard the reports of Joe Biden attempting to semi-apologize to Anita Hill about the way he treated her during the Clarence Thomas hearings. Your reaction to that, and is that a perfect example of how not to apologize?
EVE ENSLER : It’s a perfect example. And I’m really proud that I have Anita Hill’s quote in my book, because when I wrote this book, I was thinking like, “Who are the people who are owed the biggest apology?” And certainly Anita. But I think what Anita Hill was saying—and I think it’s so critical—is there is accountability. What has your harm done? Not just to Anita Hill. What she was saying is what has your harm done to millions of women who were impacted by that decision for Anita Hill? The delegitimization of Anita Hill. The humiliation of Anita Hill. The putting Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court. What kind of decisions has he made over these years that have impacted? And I think what she was saying is, we want accountability. We want thoroughness. We want you to look at what are the impacts of your, to some degree, collusion with Clarence Thomas at that time.
Reading Jane Mayer’s article, she talked about how he was talking to them throughout that whole process. So I think that is an excellent example. And I think—you know, my father says to me in the book this really brilliant thing. He said—when he said it to me, I was shocked, because I really feel like he spoke to me. He said, “To be an apologist is to be a traitor to men.” Because there is a male code. “We don’t apologize.” Which is why I think we haven’t heard one in 16,000 years of patriarchy. That once one apology happens, once a man owns that he knows what he was doing was wrong, the whole story begins to crumble.
AMY GOODMAN : We just have 30 seconds, Eve Ensler. A message to women, a message to anyone still waiting for an apology?
EVE ENSLER : I think to men, the time is now to find a clergy, a persona, a counselor. Start to work on your apology. It’s a process. It’s a journey. It’s a practice. It takes time. And to women who can’t get an apology, write yourself one from your perpetrator. Work with somebody to support it. Do a thorough, thorough letter from the person who harmed you to yourself. The impact on me was profound. I feel free in a way I have never felt in my life. And I think this process—we just did this process at City of Joy in the Congo with the survivors who wrote letters from their perpetrators, and the outcome was astounding.

In Sri Lanka, a Muslim man was killed Monday in North Western Province, as ongoing violence and attacks against Muslim targets has led authorities to impose an indefinite curfew in the region. A nationwide curfew in the rest of the country has been relaxed.
A number of Muslim-owned businesses, homes and places of worship have been vandalized after two days of rioting in North Western Province, as Muslims celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. In response, Sri Lanka also again blocked popular social media networks and apps they say were responsible for the violent acts, including Facebook and WhatsApp.
Tensions in Sri Lanka have been on the rise since last month’s Easter suicide bomb massacre, which killed at least 257 people in churches and hotels. Topics: SCOTUS Rules Users Can Sue Apple For Allegedly Monopolizing Apps Market May 14, 2019
Back in the U.S., the Supreme Court ruled Monday that consumers can sue Apple for exercising a monopoly over the apps market. The court, however, did not determine whether or not Apple does in fact have a monopoly on the market and a class action lawsuit will likely now move ahead in lower courts. Apple charges a 30 percent sales commission to app developers while excluding them from making sales outside its “App Store.” Meanwhile, Apple has its own set of competing services like Apple News+ and an upcoming streaming service. Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberal justices in their 5-4 ruling. Topics: Reports: Israeli Security Firm NSO Group Hacked Whatsapp May 14, 2019
In more technology news, WhatsApp urged its 1.5 billion users to update their apps after it was revealed hackers found a way to remotely install surveillance software on smartphones and other personal devices via the popular messaging app. The attack was reportedly orchestrated by Israeli security firm NSO Group. NSO has been implicated in surveillance efforts on behalf of the Saudi and Mexican governments. The Committee to Protect Journalists warned that journalists, lawyers, activists and human rights defenders were the most likely targets of the attack. Whatsapp is owned by Facebook. Topics:"

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , Democracynow.org , The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I’m Juan González. Welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world. Alabama lawmakers voted to effectively ban abortion Tuesday, passing the most restrictive anti-choice law in the country in a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. The bill approved by the Senate Tuesday and the Alabama House last month bans abortions at all phases. Doctors could face up to 99 years in prison for performing abortions. The bill includes no exceptions for survivors of rape and incest. Its only exception is grave risk to the mother’s life. The legislation is now heading to the desk of anti-choice Republican Governor Kay Ivey, and many expect she’ll sign it. Opponents say they’ll challenge the bill in court should it become law, but that’s precisely the point. Architects behind the legislation want to use it to challenge Roe v. Wade, which recognizes the constitutional right to an abortion.
AMY GOODMAN : Just one day before Alabama passed the legislation, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer issued what many considered a dire warning from the bench, implying that Roe V Wade is in danger. He wrote the comments in a dissent for an unrelated case in which the court voted to overturn a 40 year-old precedent. Breyer wrote, “Today’s decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the Court will overrule next.”
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: This attack on reproductive rights is playing out in state legislatures across the country. Also on Tuesday, the Republican-led Michigan Senate passed bills to ban the most common method of second-trimester abortion and criminalize abortion providers. Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer is expected to veto the legislation. Last week, Georgia Republican governor Brian Kemp signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S., banning abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which often occurs at around six weeks into pregnancy, before many women even realize they are pregnant. The new law is set to take effect on January 1, 2020.
AMY GOODMAN : Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also signed into law a six-week abortion ban last month. The legislation does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Well, for more, we’re joined by Monica Simpson, executive director of Sister Song, Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective. She’s in Denver today, but she’s based in Atlanta, Georgia.
And we are joined by Jessica Mason Pieklo, legal analyst and vice president of law and the courts at Rewire.News. She is the co-author of Crow After Roe: How “Separate But Equal” Has Become the New Standard in Women’s Health and How We Can Change That . Her forthcoming book, written with Robin Marty, is The End of Roe v. Wade: Inside the Right’s Plan to Destroy Legal Abortion . We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Jessica, let’s begin with you. Explain what just happened in Alabama.
JESSICA MASON PIEKLO : What just happened in Alabama is that lawmakers launched a full frontal attack on legal abortion in the state and across the country with a law designed specifically to challenge Roe v. Wade in the long term and in the short term sow chaos in the state of Alabama for folks who need access to abortion.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about Justice Breyer’s warning, how that specifically might relate to Roe v. Wade in terms of his dissent in an unrelated case?
JESSICA MASON PIEKLO : Absolutely. On Monday, the Supreme Court issued a five-to-four decision in effectively a tax case, and Justice Thomas took the lead in that decision and upended 40 years of precedent. And that on the face has absolutely nothing to do with abortion rights, but as Justice Breyer noted, the path that the court took in getting to the outcome has absolutely everything to do with abortion rights when we look at the conservative wing of the court looking to enact an agenda that lawmakers at the states have volleyed up for them in these anti-choice bills. And so what justice Breyer did was go through the concept of stare decisis and precedent that the majority in this decision had overturned and suggested how that they could do the same thing when it came to other areas like abortion rights and contraception, for example.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Alabama State Senator Linda Coleman-Madison speaking at the debate yesterday before Alabama voted an almost total abortion ban.
STATE SEN . LINDA COLEMAN - MADISON : This bill to me appears to be about control. When the dust settles and if this bill passes on a roll call vote, you will be telling your wives, your daughters, your granddaughters and those who support this bill that you don’t value the worth of women. Regardless of how educated, how sound of mind, how competent, how knowledgeable, no matter how many degrees they have or how many of these same women you have paid your hard-earned money to educate, that their voice does not matter. We don’t trust you to make a decision that is the most personal and precious decision about your own body. And that includes your offsprings. Your grandchildren.
AMY GOODMAN : So that’s Alabama State Senator Linda Coleman-Madison speaking just before the Alabama State Senate followed the example of the Alabama House of Representatives and voted for the almost complete abortion ban. Jessica Mason Pieklo, go further in explaining exactly what it means. You know, putting doctors in prison for life if they perform the procedure. An 11-year-old kid who is raped by her father forced to bear her father’s child. Talk about why the no exceptions, what the legislature—what Alabama is hoping to do at the Supreme Court.
JESSICA MASON PIEKLO : Well, they are hoping quite clearly to upend legal abortion in any way that they can with this bill. And so by not having any exceptions, for example, they are taking a direct attack on the line of precedent in Roe that says states can enact certain measures before viability, for example, but there need to be exceptions maintained for the health of the pregnant person and their life, for example.
What is really happening here, though, that I think is most important to dive into, is that lawmakers have said very specifically that they know this bill is unconstitutional, that their design by passing this is to force a court challenge. And Republicans have spent the last two years packing the federal courts with ideologues who have promised, if given the opportunity, to upend Roe v. Wade. So this is a political campaign that is being waged in the courts right now because conservatives and Republicans really feel that they have the advantage here.
And we’re seeing in places where pregnant people are already criminalized for certain pregnancy outcomes. The impact of upending legal abortion is starting and has started in places, but what this does is put that on hyperspeed, and says very clearly that lawmakers don’t care what the law is. They don’t care that this is an unconstitutional ban; that’s the point of it. And so the question is whether or not the federal courts are going to do their job and not be ideological in this and apply the law. And should they do that, then this ban is dead in the water.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Monica Simpson, you’re usually based in Georgia. Could you talk about what has been happening in your state and this whole issue of this political offensive by the anti-choice forces? Clearly, there is an attempt not only to overturn Roe V Wade, but also to mobilize the anti-choice movement as we head into the presidential elections next year.
MONICA SIMPSON : Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me this morning. I will say that today those of us who have been doing this work in Georgia and have just faced the same battles that our folks in Alabama are facing as of yesterday, we are standing in solidarity with Alabama and all the other states and folks who are dealing with these issues all across the country.
And what we see and what we have been able to really come to grips with in this country is that this has been a steady and a very stealth approach that our opposition has taken against us at the state level. And what we are seeing here in Georgia, what we’re seeing now in Alabama, is that they are making a very clear message—that they do not care about us, they do not care about our ability to make our own decisions about our bodies, about our families, about how we want to create family.
And what we’re trying to do now, what we’re working to do collectively is to build our voices, to build our people power against that. But we have been seeing since 2011 over 400 different measures come through state houses that have been medically unnecessary, and they have been using their political agenda to really move this very clear message and to get us to the point that we are now. And so yes, we are at a point where we have to be ready to mount up all of our defenses against this, and that is exactly what we’re doing in Georgia, and that’s exactly what we’re going to be doing across this country.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp speaking last week after signing into law Georgia’s six-week abortion ban.
GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP : The LIFE Act is very simple but also very powerful. A declaration that all life has value, that all life matters and that all life is worthy of protection. I understand, like the others have said, that some oppose this legislation. I realize that some may challenge it in the court of law. But our job is to do what is right, not what is easy. We are called to be strong and courageous. And we will not back down. We will always continue to fight for life.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp speaking last week after signing into law the six-week abortion ban. Stacey Abrams, the Democratic politician who narrowly lost to Brian Kemp who was the secretary of state, the Republican governor’s race, tweeted after the bill was signed into law, “Bad policies like the forced pregnancy bill are a direct result of voter suppression. If leaders can silence Georgians’ voices at the ballot box, they can ignore Georgians’ voices when in office. We will fight back in court and at the voting booth,” she said. Monica Simpson, if you can talk about what happened on the ground in Georgia, and particularly how these abortion bans affect women of color?
MONICA SIMPSON : Absolutely. On the ground, we have been working together collectively. We, across different organizations—across our sectors of reproductive health, rights, and justice—formed the Georgia Coalition for Reproductive Health, Rights, and Justice to be in lockstep, to be in connection with each other as we were fighting on the ground, moving at the grassroots level all the way up to the state house house, to make sure that we were educating our communities, amplifying the needs and the voices of the most marginalized in our community, to really fight back against this.
And what’s interesting whenever I hear Kemp say that we need to make courageous decisions and that we should not make the easy decisions—there are so many things that Georgia could be actually fighting for that would actually impact the lives of those living in the margins. We are a state where we’re at the very bottom when it comes to maternal mortality and we see that black women are dying at a rate four times higher than white women in childbirth. We are a state that has yet to expand Medicaid. We are a state where we still need to be making sure that we are creating economic opportunities for people to be able to survive and thrive.
But instead of really focusing on those issues which have been what our folks on the ground have asked for of our elected officials, of the governor of our state, instead we’re moving forward measures that actually decrease access and put people at risk. And when we have things like a six-week abortion ban in place and if that’s something that moves forward, which we are going to fight every single day to make sure that it doesn’t, things like that, when you put those different measures in place, we know who gets impacted the most. It’s folks of color, marginalized communities, young people. Those folks—their lives are the ones that are most at risk.
So instead of listening to the folks of Georgia and listening to the needs of the people of Georgia, we have folks in office who are really focused on moving their political agenda and using our bodies and our wombs as collateral. And we say no more to that. And so we are working together collectively to build that people power to make sure that we are fighting this at every level that we must possibly can. But on the ground, we have been working diligently to build that collective power to make sure that we have what is necessary for us to fight this at every level.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Jessica Mason Pieklo, I’m wondering if you could talk about Ohio, a key obviously battleground state in the upcoming presidential race, and the abortion law there.
JESSICA MASON PIEKLO : Right. Well, we have seen Ohio try to enact as many anti-abortion measures as they can, including one of these six-week bans in addition to a ban on later abortion which is tied up in the courts. And you mentioned, Ohio is a battleground state. And I think it’s really important to bring this back into this idea of disenfranchisement and who is passing this and why. We have seen success from the last 40 years of having broader access to reproductive health services and the ability to plan families and to try and parent as we choose. And so it is no surprise that in those states where some of those advances have taken place in rapid form, we’re seeing such a pushback.
And so I so appreciate Stacey Abrams making that connection in terms of disenfranchisement. I don’t think we can say that enough. These are bills that are designed to keep people out of civic life and out of the political process. And so Ohio is an excellent example of this, where there is good support for abortion rights and access on the ground and in its citizenry, but the politicians are using the power that they have right now to try and stymie that. And it is important because Ohio sits in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and that is also a federal circuit court of appeals that has been newly made more conservative thanks to Trump appointees. And so again, when I talk about this as a political campaign that’s being waged in the courts, those are the dots that I hope people are starting to connect, because they are all connected.
AMY GOODMAN : Do you actually see Roe being overturned?
JESSICA MASON PIEKLO : That’s an excellent question. I do. I think that there are two paths that conservatives can take. They can continue on an incrementalist approach, which we are seeing them attempting in the states through various types of procedure bans, through TRAP restrictions that we have talked about previously on this show. Or they can go for the brass ring and go for Roe altogether. And we’re seeing them take that path now.
The question will be ultimately what stomach does Chief Justice John Roberts have for overturning precedent here. We’ve seen early indications that he is uncomfortable by some of the political nature of what is happening. However, when it comes to a substantive vote in defense of abortion rights, Chief Justice John Roberts has yet to cast one in favor of abortion rights on the merits. And so I think that it is well within our concern to think that Roe v. Wade could be overturned in the next several years.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to end with a video that went viral just a few months ago. It is Georgia Democratic State Senator Jen Jordan speaking against the abortion ban on the Georgia State Senate floor in March.
STATE SEN . JEN JORDAN : The deepest, darkest times of my life have occurred in the presence of and with my physician. You see, I have been pregnant 10 times. I have seen what many of you in here have called a heartbeat 10 times. But I have only given birth twice. I have lost seven pregnancies in varying points of time before 20 weeks, and one after five months. Her name was Juliet. I have laid on the cold examination table while a doctor desperately looked for a heartbeat. I have been escorted out the back door of my physician’s office so as not to upset the other pregnant women in the waiting area, my grief on full display and uncontainable. I have been on my knees time after time in prayer to my God about my losses. I have loved each and every single one of those potential lives, and my husband and I have grieved each passing. But no matter my faith, my beliefs, my losses, I have never, ever strayed from the basic principle that each woman, each woman must be able to make her decisions in consultation with her God and her family. It is not for the government or the men of this chamber to insert itself in the most personal, private and wrenching decisions that make every single day. And that is not some smily, happy statement that has been focus-grouped; that is the reality of our lives. […] And let me be clear. If you shirk the most basic duties you have to protect the fundamental rights of women today, then no doubt the women of this state will reclaim their rights after they have claimed your seats.

"As EPA Insists Weed Killer Roundup is Safe, a Jury Orders Monsanto to Pay $2B to Couple With Cancer | Democracy Now!",www.democracynow.org,,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/16/as_epa_insists_weed_killer_roundup,"As EPA Insists Weed Killer Roundup is Safe, a Jury Orders Monsanto to Pay $2B to Couple With Cancer Story May 16, 2019 attorney and the co-lead trial counsel for Alva and Alberta Pilliod in a lawsuit against Monsanto. 0 Donate
U.S. agribusiness giant Monsanto has been ordered to pay its highest damages yet in a massive lawsuit over the popular weedkiller Roundup. A jury ordered Monsanto to pay more than $2 billion in punitive damages to Alva and Alberta Pilliod, a couple who were both diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cancer after using Roundup on their properties for decades. Monsanto is owned by German pharmaceutical giant Bayer. The main ingredient in the weed killer Roundup, glyphosate, is said to cause the cancer. Attorneys estimate that there are thousands of similar cases against Roundup pending in courts around the country. Last year, a jury in California ordered Monsanto to pay $289 million in damages to a school groundskeeper who developed cancer after regularly using Roundup. The 46-year-old man, Dewayne Johnson, also has non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The EPA says that glyphosate is not carcinogenic, but other scientific studies and the World Health Organization have found that human exposure can in fact lead to cancer. We speak with attorney Brent Wisner, co-lead trial counsel for Alva and Alberta Pilliod. Donate Related Story attorney and the co-lead trial counsel for Alva and Alberta Pilliod in a lawsuit against Monsanto. I’m Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to the stunning verdict in the case against U.S. agribusiness giant Monsanto, which has been ordered to pay its highest damages yet in the third lawsuit over the popular weed killer Roundup. A jury has ordered Monsanto, which is owned by German pharmaceutical giant Bayer, to pay more than $2 billion in punitive damages to Alva and Alberta Pilliod, a couple who were both diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cancer after using Roundup on their properties for over 30 years. The main ingredient in the herbicide is glyphosate and is said to cause the cancer. This is plaintiff Alberta Pilliod.
ALBERTA PILLIOD : We have been fighting cancer for nine years now, Al longer than me. And it was caused by Roundup. It has changed our lives forever. We can’t do the things that we used to be able to do. And we really resent Monsanto for that fact. We wish that Monsanto had warned us ahead of time about the dangers of using Monsanto and that there was something on the front of their label that said “Danger, may cause cancer.”At that point, we could have used Roundup, but we wouldn’t have used it. But I’m sure a lot of other people would choose to. And they weren’t giving us any choice because from their ads, we felt that it was incredibly safe to use.
AMY GOODMAN : Attorneys for the plaintiffs estimate there are tens of thousands of similar cases against Roundup pending in courts around the country. Last year, a jury in California ordered Monsanto to pay $289 million in damages to a school groundskeeper who developed cancer after regularly using the weed killer Roundup. The 46-year-old man, Dewayne Johnson, also has non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Doctors say he is unlikely to live past 2020. Earlier this month, the EPA said glyphosate is not carcinogenic. However, other scientific studies and the World Health Organization have found human exposure can in fact lead to cancer. Well, for more, we’re joined by attorney Brent Wisner, co-lead trial counsel for Alva and Alberta Pilliod. Welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you start off by responding to this record verdict, Brent?–$2 billion–and what this says about Monsanto?
BRENT WISNER : We’ve been litigating this case for over three years now. And this obviously is the third trial that has gotten to a jury. And we have presented all the evidence and we’ve been growing–we have a growing mountain of evidence that we have been accumulating as part of this litigation. And I think we finally had a chance to show it all and show the jury that Monsanto has engaged in essentially corporate malfeasance for the last 45 years. And in so doing, I think the jury’s punitive damage award speaks volumes about what the evidence shows. A lot of people talk about how Monsanto–the EPA says it is safe or whatnot, but the simple fact is when you look at the evidence, it is overwhelming and juries are resoundingly saying “Stop it.”
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I’d like to go to a statement from Bayer: “Bayer is disappointed with the jury’s decision and will appeal the verdict in this case, which conflicts directly with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s interim registration review decision released just last month, the consensus among leading health regulators worldwide that glyphosate-based products can be used safely and that glyphosate is not carcinogenic, and the 40 years of extensive scientific research on which their favorable conclusions are based.” Brent Wisner, your response to what Bayer has said?
BRENT WISNER : Well, it’s is the same response that they–it’s the same thing they said to the jury. It’s the same thing they’ve been saying for the last three years. And it’s just simply nonsense. The simple fact is that the EPA has got it wrong on glyphosate. We have study after study after study showing that it in fact does cause a specific type of cancer called lymphoma. We see it happening in thousands of thousands of people across the country. Currently, this administration and this EPA will not take action against Monsanto. We’ve seen the internal documents, the text messages, the emails between senior EPA officials and Monsanto employees, and the simple fact is they know that this EPA will not take adverse action against them. It is a travesty that this truth about it causing cancer and this awareness that we’re trying to raise has to be done in the context of litigation. We only exist–these lawsuits only exist because the EPA has failed the American public for 45 years, and Monsanto is allowed to get away with reckless conduct with essentially impunity.
AMY GOODMAN : During the trial, numerous internal Monsanto documents and emails came to light including the July 2018 email from an analyst from the corporate intelligence firm Hakluyt. The email read, “A domestic policy adviser at the White House said, for instance, 'We have Monsanto's back on pesticides regulation. We are prepared to go toe-to-toe on any disputes they may have with, for example, the EU. Monsanto need not fear any additional regulation from this administration’.” After this email became public, the Center for Biological Diversity asked the Trump administration for public records to assess the pesticide industry’s influence on the EPA’s proposal to re-approve glyphosate. Can you talk more about this, Brent Wisner?
BRENT WISNER : Well, it’s really interesting. In the middle of trial, after we had rested our case-in-chief but before closing arguments, out of nowhere, the EPA issues an interim analysis. It was written by an individual, Billy Mitchell, who doesn’t have any higher or specialized education or training. And if you read the document, it literally reads like the opening statement from Monsanto during our trial. It was–Monsanto wants a report; EPA brings it. And that just shows you just that the level of capture of this agency that essentially does not work for the American public but works for industry–these documents from these corporate intelligence agencies, they just show us just how deep it runs. And it’s not just a political thing, but it’s actually in the staffers themselves. The fact that the White House is telling Monsanto, “We have your back”–I mean, it just tells us that we’re going to have to keep fighting this fight and that we are not going to get any support or help from the public agencies that ironically are supposed to be protecting the public health.
AMY GOODMAN : Very quickly, Dewayne Lee Johnson, you also represented him, the school’s groundskeeper who won $289 million in damages. The Pilliods won $2 billion. But actually, what happens in these settlements? How do you arrive at these numbers and do they actually get this? And what does it do to Monsanto?
BRENT WISNER : Whether or not Mr. Johnson will see the entire award is an issue that is currently being fought in courts and it’s on appeal. The Pilliods’ obviously award was substantially bigger, and that’s a product of the fact that Mr. Johnson’s case was actually rushed to trial because of his failing health, whereas the Pilliod case, we had had time to develop the full body of evidence. So that’s one of the reasons why the number is so big.
But I think when you look at the overall situation, what these numbers say is a clear signal to Monsanto and now Bayer that they need to do something. And the simple fact is currently, the leadership at Bayer is refusing to take responsibility for this health crisis that Monsanto created and they are refusing to do right by these people. And we are going to continue to file these lawsuits, take them to trial and get bigger and bigger verdicts until they finally do right by these people.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re talking thousands of lawsuits?
BRENT WISNER : Well over 13,000, and those are filed lawsuits. That is not counting the probably 20,000 or 30,000 lawsuits that are yet to be filed. I mean, this is a health crisis that we have, and Bayer needs to sit down with these lawyers and sit down with these victims and find a way through this. But right now, they’re choosing to fight. And if they want to fight, we’ll see them in court.
AMY GOODMAN : What happens to Roundup? We have 20 seconds.
BRENT WISNER : Hopefully, we get a warning. We want people to know and have a choice when they use the product. Hey, does it cause cancer? They have a right to know.
AMY GOODMAN : Should it be removed from the market?
BRENT WISNER : That’s a difficult question. People still smoke cigarettes. We know they cause cancer. At the end of the day, this is America. People have a right to make a choice. Whether it gets removed or not, that’s a different question. They deserve at least to know that it causes cancer.
AMY GOODMAN : Brent Wisner, we want to thank you for being with us, attorney and the co-lead trial counsel for Alva and Alberta Pilliod in a lawsuit against Monsanto. The Pilliods both developed cancer after using Roundup weed killer on property for decades. A California jury has just ordered Monsanto to pay the couple more than $2 billion in damages.

Nearly every country in the world except the United States took a historic step to curb plastic waste last week, when more than 180 nations agreed to add plastic to the Basel Convention, a treaty that regulates the movement of hazardous materials between countries. The U.S. is one of just two countries that has not ratified the 30 year-old treaty. During negotiations last week in Geneva, the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department joined the plastics industry in trying to thwart the landmark, legally-binding agreement. Despite this, the United States will still be affected by the agreement, because countries will be able to block the dumping of mixed or unrecyclable plastic wastes from other nations. The amended treaty will make it much more difficult for wealthy countries to send their plastic waste to poorer nations by prohibiting countries from exporting plastic waste that is not ready for recycling.

NERMEEN SHAIKH : We end today’s show with the growing crisis of plastic pollution. Nearly every country in the world, but not the United States, took a historic step to curb plastic waste last week when more than 180 nations agreed to add plastic to the Basel Convention, a treaty that regulates the movement of hazardous materials between countries. The U.S. is one of just two countries that has not ratified the 30-year-old treaty. During negotiations last week in Geneva, the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department joined the plastics industry in trying to thwart the landmark legally-binding agreement. Despite this, the United States will still be affected by the agreement because countries will be able to block the dumping of mixed or unrecyclable plastic wastes from other nations. The amended treaty will make it much more difficult for wealthy countries to send their plastic waste to poorer countries by prohibiting nations from exporting plastic waste that is not ready for recycling. Only around 9% of plastic is recycled.
AMY GOODMAN : The U.N. estimates there are 100 million tons of plastic waste in the world’s oceans. For more, we go to Anchorage, Alaska, where we’re joined by Pam Miller, co-chair of the International Pollutants Elimination Network, or IPEN . It’s a global network of NGOs dedicated to a toxics-free future. Miller is also executive director of Alaska Community Action on Toxics. Welcome to Democracy Now! , Pam. It is great to have you in from Alaska. Can you talk about what the U.S. is refusing to do and the significance of the problem?
PAM MILLER : Yes. It was appalling really to see the U.S. government behave in the way that they did at the Basel Convention last week, especially knowing that they are not a party to the Convention and yet they tried to thwart efforts to establish plastics waste under the Basel Convention because they have a vested interest. The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of plastics, mostly to developing nations. And this has created a global crisis of waste in countries in South and Central Asia as well as South America and Africa.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Explain how this entire process works. Is it possible for these developing countries to refuse to accept this plastic waste?
PAM MILLER : Under the new amendment to the Basel Convention, which had been proposed by Norway in 2018, yes, developing countries will now have the right to refuse imports from developed countries such as the U.S. so that they will have the right to refuse dirty plastics, mixed waste, that have created such a huge problem in so many countries, particularly in Asia where we see that, as you mentioned, most of these plastics cannot truly be recycled so they are essentially dumped on the land adjacent to communities where these plastics are burned, creating a huge health hazard to many communities in these developing nations.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : It was just last year that China put a ban on foreign waste imports. Can you talk about how much plastic waste was going to China and where that waste is now going?
PAM MILLER : Yes. So China did make this landmark decision, which was really important for their country to have the right to refuse this dirty plastic waste that’s highly toxic. These plastics are not only a physical hazard in the environment, but they’re also a human health hazard because they contain many toxic additives such as phthalates and bisphenols and persistent pollutants that are endocrine-disrupting and cancer-causing chemicals. So a country such as China made the decision, because this was such a huge problem in their country, to have the right to refuse it. Unfortunately then, the U.S. began shipping it to other countries in Asia such as Indonesia, as well as India, Malaysia and others.
AMY GOODMAN : American explorer Victor Vescovo recently broke the record for the deepest dive ever when he descended nearly seven miles into the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench. On the ocean floor, he saw new species of crustaceans but he also found a plastic bag and candy wrappers. This is Vescovo speaking shortly after the dive.
VICTOR VESCOVO : It wasn’t completely surprising, although it was very disappointing to see obvious human contamination of the deepest point in the ocean. Because when I first got to the bottom, it seemed very pristine, almost like a moonscape. And I did see life.
AMY GOODMAN : That’s American Explorer Victor Vescovo. If you can respond to that, Pam, and also just describe the scope of the problem. How large are these plastic islands that are floating around the world right now?
PAM MILLER : The problem of plastics in the ocean is just immense. The plastics in the Pacific Ocean are just a huge mass of hundreds of thousands of acres of plastics in a huge plastic dump in the Pacific Ocean. So it’s an immense problem. And it’s not just a physical threat in the marine environment, but as these plastics break up, certainly we’ve all seen the images of how plastics can choke sea life such as sea turtles and marine mammals and birds, but as these plastics break up, they create an even more insidious problem. They become micro-plastics, which then can be ingested by marine animals such as fish, marine mammals and others, which then pose a threat to human health because these plastics at sea not only contain toxic additives in themselves, but when they are at sea, they absorb persistent pollutants such as PCBs, flame-retardant chemicals such as PBDEs. These are highly persistent toxics and these plastics simply continue to absorb these toxic chemicals.
Then when they are ingested by marine life, these toxics are conveyed into the bodies of these animals which then create a problem for human health because we rely on fish and other marine life as a source of food. So it’s a very serious not only physical and unsightly problem to the marine environment, but it’s also a toxic problem that we really have to solve by stopping the production of plastic upstream. The production of plastic relies on fossil fuels, and ultimately, this is also a contributor to climate change. So the entire cycle of plastics production, waste disposal and use, is really a toxic hazard.
AMY GOODMAN : And circling back to the United States refusing to sign on to this global treaty, talk more about the significance of the U.S., the most powerful player in the world. Certainly a historic polluter when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. What does it mean when they don’t sign on to a treaty that would curb plastics?
PAM MILLER : The U.S. is not a very good player in the international convention arena, including the three chemical conventions that have met over the past three weeks including the Basel Convention, the Rotterdam Convention and the Stockholm Convention. The U.S. is party to none of those treaties. However, the U.S. Department of State and EPA show up and in the case of the Basel Convention, played a very negative role in trying to persuade a small handful of countries to go against the will of the majority of the countries who really wanted to include plastics in the Basel Convention.
So the U.S. played an extremely negative role. Their position that they vocalized in the plenary sessions and also in the contact groups that met to hash out the amendments really mirrored the positions of the plastics and the chemical industry. The American Chemistry Council was there representing the major petrochemical manufacturers. There were plastic waste trade companies and associations. The U.S. position was essentially the same. So it was really not only disappointing but appalling as an American citizen in an international arena such as this to see the U.S. behaving so badly.

“Inside Syria's Secret Prisons”: A Harrowing Account of How Assad's Torture Machine Crushed Dissent - Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/16/inside_syria_s_secret_prisons_a,"Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , Democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And I’m Nermeen Shaikh. Welcome to our listeners and viewers around the country and around the world. Inside Syria’s Secret Torture Prisons . That’s the title of a shocking exposé by The New York Times looking at how Bashar al-Assad’s government has jailed and tortured tens of thousands of Syrians since the uprising began in 2011.
According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, nearly 128,000 people have disappeared. They are presumed to be either dead or still in custody. The group estimates almost 14,000 individuals have died under torture. And the detentions are continuing, even as the fighting winds down. Over 5,600 Syrians were reportedly arbitrarily detained last year, a 25% jump over the previous year.
While the Syrian government has denied running a secret torture and detention program, more evidence, including internal Syrian government documents, has emerged showing the extent of the torture program. Over the past seven years, The New York Times has been documenting what takes place inside the secret prisons. The accounts are harrowing. The Times report includes graphic descriptions of torture, sexual violence and murder. One former woman inmate, Mariam Khlief, told The New York Times she and six other women were tortured and repeatedly raped in a basement cell, where “blood from violent rapes stained the floor.” Survivors also reported guards forced detainees to eat excrement.
AMY GOODMAN : A prisoner named Mounir Fakir recalled a guard who called himself Azrael, the angel of death, who was also a nurse at a medical facility where prisoners were often tortured and killed. Fakir told The Times up to six patients were chained naked to each bed. Fakir said patients were taken by Azrael at night and, “We’d see the shadow of someone hitting, we’d hear the scream, then silence — suffocating silence. In the morning we’d see the body in the hallway to the bathroom. You would see bodies piled. We stepped on our comrades’ bodies, barefoot.”
The New York Times also heard testimony from former prisoners who said they were forced to act like animals by a guard who went by the name of Hitler. The prisoners were beaten if they didn’t “bark or bray correctly.” A United Nations panel has said the conditions in the prison including the paucity of toilet facilities, rampant illness, minimal and rotten food and the absence of medical treatment are tantamount to extermination.
To find out more, we’re joined by the story’s author, Anne Barnard. She’s a reporter at The New York Times , a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. She was the New York Times bureau chief in Beirut from 2012 to 2018. It’s great to have you back on Democracy Now! , Anne. We last spoke to you when you were in Beirut. This is a horrific story. Talk about the scope, the number of people you believe have been detained, the number of people disappeared and killed in Syria’s prisons.
ANNE BARNARD : Unfortunately, nobody knows the exact number because the government keeps all of this behind closed doors and doesn’t release any information to the families of most of the people who are taken. But according to the Syrian Network of Human Rights, they have counted–not estimated, but counted—128,000 people who have been reported by their families or by witnesses to be taken by the security forces and not emerged from the prisons. Eighty-one thousand of those people, their families have not had any word from them whatsoever. So this is a sprawling system. Human rights groups estimate that the total number of Syrians who have passed through it could be in the hundreds of thousands.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And you have been working on this for several years, compiling this evidence as have a couple of other rights organizations, Amnesty International in particular. Now, I’d like to go to the Syrian government’s response to earlier research and documentation on these torture prisons. In an extended interview with Yahoo! News in 2017, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad claimed that Syrian refugees were “definitely aligned with terrorists,” and when he was shown photographs exposing the torture of political prisoners by his government, he dismissed the allegations as “fake news.”
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL- ASSAD : If you take these photos to any court in your country, could they convict any criminal regarding this? Could they tell you what this crime, who committed? If you don’t have this full picture, you cannot make judgment. It’s just propaganda. It’s just fake news. They want to demonize the Syrian government. In every war, you can have any individual crime. It happen all over the world, anywhere. But it’s not the policy.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So that was President Assad in 2017 responding to earlier reports. And in fact, he was shown photographs of these prisoners and then he denied the voracity of the photographs. How has the Syrian government responded at all to your much more extensive report and the fact that you make the case that his success in this war has been contingent on these prisons?
ANNE BARNARD : Well, they haven’t responded at all, which is pretty typical. They are not very responsive to direct queries from the press. Look, I think that their MO has always been to just deny, deny, deny anything no matter how much evidence there is. And he said to my face in 2016 when I met him in Damascus that, “We have a normal justice system operating here. Any family who is missing their relative should just go and ask.” But of course, families that I know personally, thousands of families, have been going for years to ask after their families. And sometimes family members are arrested for asking.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Where are they supposed to go? Where do they ask? Who do they go to?
ANNE BARNARD : They make the rounds of dozens of different security offices. There’s four different intelligence branches and each one operates dozens of torture and detention facilities.
AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times exposé begins with the story of Muhannad Ghabbash. His testimony, echoed by many other survivors, revealed that by 2012, “There was an industrial-scale transportation system among prisons. Detainees were tortured on each leg of their journeys, in helicopters, buses, cargo planes. Some recalled riding for hours in trucks normally used for animal carcasses, hanging by one arm, chained to meat hooks. Mr. Ghabbash’s new cell was typical: 12 feet long, 9 feet wide, usually packed so tightly that prisoners had to sleep in shifts.” Tell us Muhannad’s story, how you met him, how you learned of this situation and then why you say you think actually the uprising in 2011 was caused by this kind of sadistic, torturous prison system.
ANNE BARNARD : Muhannad Ghabbash was very typical of the types of people that were sucked into this system. He was a protester and eventually led peaceful protests in Aleppo when the uprising began in 2011. And he was arrested the first time in 2011, was arrested several times that year and in 2012, and was taken to a number of different facilities. He said he was like a tour guide to torture. He was forced to, as you said, act the roles of animals. He was—
AMY GOODMAN : This is in kind of pseudo-plays for officers.
ANNE BARNARD : Yes.
AMY GOODMAN : And guards at dinner.
ANNE BARNARD : Yeah. Kind of entertainment. But also, much more—I shudder to call it routine, but the more routine types of torture being hung by wrists, being put into stress positions and beaten until he made a false confession, which was something that happened to most of the prisoners.
Look, I think that the use of this system followed a playbook that Assad’s father began in Hama in 1982 when there was an uprising. The idea was to suck up the people who were nonviolent protesters because it’s easier to go after the ones that are violent. Of course there were all kinds of people arrested, but there was special focus on arresting civilian protesters because those are the biggest threat at the end of the day. We’re talking about a state with all the machinery of state power and violence at its disposal. It’s in a way easier for them to fight the people that pick up arms and it’s harder for them to face people that are using civil methods.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : You also say though in the piece that simultaneously, as the Assad regime was arresting more and more civilians, they also released radical Islamists who had been imprisoned for decades.
ANNE BARNARD : Yes. The Assad regime of course helped funnel jihadists into Iraq to fight the U.S. occupation there, and arrested many of them when they returned. Now, in one of the first big steps after the uprising began in 2011, a lot of those people were released, including the top leaders, the people who became in the future top leaders of the most hard-line Islamist rebel groups. At the very same time that those people were released into the population, they were vacuuming up people literally including followers of Gandhi, who followed an Islamic cleric who believed in nonviolence and called on people to adopt a form of jihad that was not violent but that was based on nonviolence. This person’s followers were among the civilian leaders of the revolution at the beginning, and many of them were killed right away or sucked into the prisons and have not come out.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to break and then come back to this discussion. Anne Barnard, a reporter at The New York Times , fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Her latest piece that came out Sunday in The New York Times , Inside Syria’s Secret Torture Prisons: How Bashar al-Assad Crushed Dissent . This is Democracy Now! We’ll be back with her in a minute.
∂∂ [ MUSIC BREAK ]
AMY GOODMAN : We’re continuing right now with Anne Barnard. She’s a reporter at The New York Times , fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Her latest piece Inside Syria’s Secret Torture Prisons: How Bashar al-Assad Crushed Dissent . I am Amy Goodman with Nermeen Shaikh. Anne, tell us the story of Mariam Khlief and what was happened to her.
ANNE BARNARD : Mariam is a woman from Hama, who—her crime was helping injured protesters, which was considered terrorism by the government, if it was—yeah, considered a form of terrorism. So she was arrested in 2012 and taken to one of the facilities in Hama. And she was raped, she said, every night by the chief of investigations of the prison, whom she–Colonel Suleiman. She knew him by name and documents that we have seen show that the head of investigations in that facility was in fact a Colonel Suleiman Juma. And she was held in the prison with a number of other women in a basement cell where the six women barely fit. They were taken to the colonel’s office and he used to even bring his friends to join him in raping them.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : I want to ask about another question that your piece raises, something that everyone has seen—the torture prisons are of course scarcely known about and scarcely covered in the media—but of course is the Syrian, the refugee crisis, the millions and millions, up to six million refugees who are now living outside their country. President Trump welcomed Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán to the White House on Monday. The far-right nationalist leader is known for his hard-line anti-immigration policies and rolling back Democratic institutions and checks on his power.This is Orbán and then Trump speaking from the Oval Office.
PRIME MINISTER VICTOR ORBÁN: We have some similar approaches, and I would like to express that we are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal migration, on terrorism, and to protect and help the Christian communities all around the world.
* PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP :* I know he’s a tough man but he’s a respected man and he has done the right thing, according to many people, on immigration. And you look at some of the problems that they have in Europe that are tremendous because they have done it a different way than the prime minister.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Orbán has closed down Hungary’s southern border, building a razor-wire fence to keep out refugees, many of them from Syria, and has also deported refugees already in the country. Now the Assad regime has conflated the refugees with terrorists. And in your piece, Anne, you say that many millions of Syrian refugees are now unlikely to return even once the war is over if these torture prisons remain in operation. And also the fact that Trump corroborated or said that what Orbán has done is right. And the fact that the U.S. in 2018 admitted only 62 Syrian refugees.
ANNE BARNARD : Right. I think that at the beginning of the Syrian conflict, Syrians would say, if this kind of rights violations are allowed to go with impunity in Syria, it will affect freedoms in the West. And that seemed at the time kind of histrionic, but in fact, what has happened is that refugees have flowed out of the country. The refugee crisis proved to be fuel for the rise of the right wing and the divisions within Europe and the rise of leaders like Orbán who is eroding civil liberties and certainly fighting immigration. And Trump is enjoying the same rhetoric, and as you saw, agreeing. Now, this just reflects Assad’s own conflation of refugees with terrorists, when in fact these are—terrorism, both ISIS and the violence of the state used against them, is what these refugees are fleeing.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the internal memos that you got a hold of? This question of—we just listened to Assad, the president. How much he knew and how much is being directed directly from the top?
ANNE BARNARD : This is a state where there is a very close coterie of advisers and officials around Assad and they decide almost everything. After the uprising began, there was a crisis cell that was created to respond to it, and it reported directly to Assad. The memos show that that cell ordered crackdowns on protesters, on people who tarnish the image of Syria in the foreign media. That just means people who talk to journalists, and these types of people.
Now later, the top security officials also asked for every death to be reported to them so that it was clear that they knew about the killings in detention. They referred to bodies piling up. They referred to the need to deal with all kinds of bad conditions that were leading to all of these deaths. Now, it sounds in a vacuum as if they’re try to correct these problems, but there’s no record in the 800,000 documents that have been smuggled out of Syria of anyone being punished for any of these actions. It really just shows that they were aware of them.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about your methodology? You’ve been working with this for years. What first prompted you—I mean, there is some coverage of the catastrophe of war in Syria, the obvious barrel bombing, all of that. But what about what is happening behind closed doors? Assad has been very careful. And what it means to talk to people about—those who survive, the lucky ones—about this level of torture they have endured?
ANNE BARNARD : So in a way, this is something that everyone knew in Syria in the sense that it’s not a new system. It has been around for a long time. But what we decided to do over the years—and of course, we did this while covering the daily news of Syria over the years—was to try to go deeper to try to get accounts of survivors who corroborated one another and were corroborated by documents. It took a very long time to get enough people who had their families safely out of Syria and felt safe to talk and to get documents and to basically—you know, over the years, many human rights organizations and journalists and lawyers worked on this issue. So we’re talking about evidence that has accreted over the years and adds up to this big picture.
Now, one of the toughest parts is speaking to the survivors about what they’ve been through. And we spoke to dozens of them, me and my wonderful team of Syrian and Lebanese colleagues. Now, you need to be sensitive when you’re dealing with victims of trauma and without sacrificing journalistic rigor, without sacrificing verification, but this was a long process. This had a huge emotional impact on us as well as of course on the survivors who had to retell their stories. So it took time, it took energy and it does sort of make you ask yourselves a lot of questions about humanity and how this kind of thing can continue to happen in the 21st century.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : How did you know what survivors to speak to? At some point, you tell a story of someone who sneaked out the names of some of the detainees. Can you talk about that?
ANNE BARNARD : Well, so in terms of who to talk to, basically, almost every Syrian that we talked to who had any connection to the protest movement, and even many who did not, had a relative or friend who was in the system. So it was not difficult to find people. And then through those people and also through networks of survivors, we would get different names of people, especially in our quest to find people that are willing to use their names. That was the toughest part.
But yes, Mansour Omari is one of the prisoners who worked together in a cell underground in a base run by the Fourth Division, which is controlled by Assad’s brother Maher. And this group of prisoners decided, “Let’s write down all the names of the people in our cell and get them out with whoever manages to get out first just to let people know, their families and the world, that these are the names of at least these people that we could identify here.” Now, they had to write the names in blood on a piece of fabric. They were sewed into the seam of a jacket. And Mansour was the first one to be released, and he managed to wear that jacket out—or a shirt, I guess—and to bring those names out to—first they were displayed in the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. They were shown to many different officials. And they were recently submitted to authorities in Sweden as part of a complaint by survivors trying to get Sweden, as France and Germany have done, to open a war crimes prosecution against Syrian officials on behalf of refugees and citizens who are in Sweden who have been subject to this system.
AMY GOODMAN : And the Syrian government is very aware of this and trying to protect themselves from any kind of war crimes or crimes against humanity charges. How are they doing this?
ANNE BARNARD : Well, first of all, by staying in Syria. There is already an arrest warrant against Jamil Hassan, who’s the head of the Air Force branch of intelligence, and against Ali Mamlouk, who is the top security official overall. And those guys just aren’t going to come to Europe to end up getting arrested. But there are lower-level officials, some of whom have joined the refugee flow and have been arrested once they have been identified in Germany and France.
Now they also in the memos, interestingly—one memo from the military intelligence department says when you make these death certificates about each detainee who dies—and remember, all these death certificates claim that the people died because their heart stopped. So that’s kind of a tautology. Of course when you die, your heart stops. And obviously, all these young people that are in the prisons are not all suddenly having an epidemic of heart disease. So the memo instructed them to write the memos in such a way as to ensure a judicial immunity from prosecution for the work of the intelligence officials in the future.
NERMEEN SHAIKH : One of the other things that you—an international mechanism that you point to—is the fact that the U.N. General Assembly has voted in favor of establishing the International, Independent and Impartial mechanism. What is the status of this, and what kind of mandate is it charged with, or will it be, if it’s established?
ANNE BARNARD : It has been established and funded, which is a big step. And that was done through a General Assembly vote in the U.N. in order to get around the impasse in the Security Council. The Security Council is blocked by Russia from referring Syria to the International Criminal Court. But the IIIM that you mentioned is a new body that is going to be kind of a clearinghouse for all the documents and court-ready evidence that’s being collected by different groups—Syrian and European groups—to try to build war crimes cases. Now, it has a mandate to build those cases for use in any future prosecutions in international or national courts, but it does not have the ability to arrest or charge anyone. It’s sort of like a prosecutor waiting for a court, I guess you could say.

John Bolton Is the World’s Worst Nightmare | Democracy Now!,www.democracynow.org,,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/16/john_bolton_is_the_worlds_worst,"John Bolton Is the World’s Worst Nightmare Column May 16, 2019 Donate
By Amy Goodman & Denis Moynihan
“Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.” —John Bolton, in a March 26, 2015, New York Times op-ed headlined, “To Stop Iran’s Bomb, Bomb Iran”
President Donald Trump campaigned as an isolationist, criticizing foreign military entanglements. As far back as 2013, he tweeted, “Can you believe that the Afghan war is our ‘longest war’ ever -bring our troops home, rebuild the U.S., make America great again.” He has made the point repeatedly as president. In an April 2018 press conference, discussing Syria, Trump said: “I want to get out. I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our nation. We will have, as of three months ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East over the last 17 years. We get nothing — nothing out of it, nothing.”
Despite his rhetoric, Trump’s every move in the Middle East now seems committed to conflict and potentially to war with Iran. John Bolton is clearly at the vanguard, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo backing him up.
Iranian diplomat Seyed Hossein Mousavian is a former senior negotiator for Iran on the nuclear issue, and currently a research scholar at Princeton University. Mousavian expressed his concerns this week on the “Democracy Now!” news hour:
“I expected such a situation after Ambassador John Bolton was nominated as national security adviser,” he said. Noting as well the influential roles of key Trump allies, Mousavian concluded, “The four B’s team — John Bolton, [Israeli Prime Minister] Bibi Netanyahu, [the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi] bin Salman and bin Zayed — now have excellent position at the White House to push the U.S. [into] the dream they have had for years and years and years — to drag the U.S. into a war with Iran.”
Citing at least half a dozen unnamed Trump administration officials, The New York Times reported this week that the Pentagon has submitted plans to ship 120,000 U.S. troops to the region in response to Iranian threats. While he denied the report, Trump declared nevertheless: “Now would I do that? Absolutely. But I have not planned for that. If we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.” The White House has ordered an aircraft carrier strike group and bomber wing to the region, as Bolton stated, “to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests … will be met with unrelenting force.”
British Army Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, a key commander of the multinational force deployed to Iraq and Syria, refuted the U.S. allegations, saying, “There’s been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria.” He was quickly rebutted by a spokesperson from U.S. Central Command, who said an attack from Iran was possibly “imminent.”
In the midst of these conflicting statements, the U.S. ordered nonessential personnel to vacate its sprawling “Green Zone” embassy complex in Baghdad, just 100 miles from the Iranian border. While U.S. officials have released photos of small Iranian boats with missiles, many observers in Europe, Iraq and the United States Congress say the missiles are likely defensive.
Meanwhile, U.S. ally Saudi Arabia is reporting that two empty oil tankers were sabotaged as they returned to be loaded with oil bound for the U.S. Once again, they have not said who did it.
The Trump administration is setting up a potential flashpoint, with U.S. and Iranian forces in close proximity. Any accident or skirmish could serve as a pretext for U.S. military escalation.
Bolton has not hidden his desire to effect regime change in Iran, in Venezuela, in Cuba and beyond. He beats the drums of war, but as a young Yale University graduate in 1970 with a draft number that likely would have landed him in Vietnam, he quickly joined the Maryland National Guard to avoid deployment. He wrote in his Yale 25th anniversary yearbook, “I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.”
Now, whispering into the ear of Trump, who received five draft deferments during Vietnam, including one in the spring of 1968 for “bone spurs,” John Bolton, along with Trump, is willing to send 120,000 or more U.S. troops into war.
Now is the time for everyone — including the anti-war movement here in the U.S., members of Congress and, yes, any dissidents within the Trump administration — to join with countries around the world, to declare forcefully to the chicken hawks: No war with Iran.
