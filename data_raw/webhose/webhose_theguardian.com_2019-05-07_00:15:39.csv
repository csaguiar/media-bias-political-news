Other than the fact poorly applied VAR is the same as poor refereeing, only slightly worse because it takes longer.
There may be no definitive answer Barney, but that, right there, is the definitive take on VAR.
I've long said there is no point to it as it can't guarantee better decisions every time. Hell, it doesn't guarantee better decisions most of the time.
All it does is produce interminable, needless delays that rarely remove debate."

We must hope that Europe doesn’t give in to exasperation with Britain | Andrew Rawnsley | Opinion,www.theguardian.com,Mark Palmer,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/07/we-must-hope-that-europe-does-not-give-in-to-exasperation-with-britain#127807591,"I think Andrew Rawnsley has made a very good and powerful point in this article about the need for the EU to exercise discretion and patience with our current turmoil and travails. The historical precedents he points to need emphasising. Vichy France, NS Germany and fascist Italy, as well as the collaborating Benelux countries were all founder members of the EU. Spain and Portugal were dictatorships well into the 1970s. Greece was a military dictatorship. The whole of Eastern Europe were totalitarian, repressive Communist dictatorships. In the 1970s West German democracy was seriously under threat from the activities of the RAF and hysterical over reaction (Heinrich Boell’s comment of a ‘mad war of 6 against 60 million’ in the Deutscher Herbst. Italian train stations (Bologna) were being blown up by the Brigade Nere, and politicians abducted and murdered by their fascist equivalents on the left.
I think Tusk and Merkel, both coming from a background of the unfree, undemocratic Europe of the past appreciate this, whereas Macron (somewhat typically of the French) has a blind spot towards his own country’s dark past.
We have, as a country, watched in horror much of what has happened in European history in the 20th century. Now others are watching in horror, bemusement and amusement at out attempts — because ultimately this is what Brexit is about — to come to terms with our own history and place in the world. The so called ‘cultural Brexit’. It took Germany 40 years to come to terms with its past.
The EU (particularly Macron and the French) would be well advised to show some humility in their dealings with a torn and riven nation."

The EU has spent more than enough time and effort to keep the UK in the EU, so we have learned that whatever concessions EU member states make they will never be enough to satisfy the demands of large parts of UK society.
Mr Rawnsley makes a strong case as to why the EU should be be prepared to the UK another extension to make up its mind. But he also (fairly) provides many arguments why the EU should not. I am more convinced now (with regret) that the latter arguments are more convincing. The reason is that no matter how long or short an extension is granted, no matter what other concessions are given, it will not be enough. In other words, it does not solve anything. Leaving the EU without an agreement is utter stupidity but it has one crucial advantage: it opens a new chapter."

It may be a turning point. A merica First nationalism, indulgent free market economics, Republican libertarianism and a political system in hock to corporate lobbying has just contributed to killing 356 innocent people. The more we know about the crashes of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia – after anti-stalling devices locked both aircraft into unrecoverable nose-dives – the more shocking the story becomes.
It is not just Boeing, a once magnificent company, that is being condemned – it is the US’s wider economic, political and regulatory structures. What is not required is a short-term software fix on the faulty MCAS system that automatically adjusts the plane’s flight trajectory, along with an improved safety manual and training for pilots, which is Boeing’s response so far. What is needed is a root-and-branch overhaul of the intersection between capitalism and democracy in the US. The current set-up – and the accompanying libertarian, anti-state, anti-regulation philosophy – literally kills people.
The story begins in 2011. Europe’s new Airbus 320neo, with its superb fuel efficiency and low operating costs, had picked up 667 orders at the Paris air show, a record for a commercial aircraft. Worse, American Airlines had done the unthinkable: it had ordered 130 of the new Airbus and 130 of the older one. Boeing’s relationship with American was foundational: it could always rely on the airline for its bedrock business, an insider, all-American affair. Now American had dared to buy European in unprecedented volumes: it was a competitive necessity to match rival airlines. Boeing had to respond. But instead of developing a whole new plane that could carry heavier, fuel-efficient engines, it made the fateful decision to bolt them on to a variant of its 737 series. Since the days of Orville and Wilbur Wright, the key to safe flying has been to organise the pitch of the plane so that its aerodynamics work to prevent stalling, a complex interrelationship between the angle and shape of wings, the distribution of weight and the power of the engines. If you intend to use a heavier, more fuel-efficient engine, it will throw everything out of kilter. Essentially, you have to design a new plane.

Boeing’s initial and correct reaction had been to commit to just that, but the process is enormously expensive and takes up to 10 years. The company had to react faster and keep its share price up, so the Max 8 was born, going into service in 2017. The technical problem was obvious. With heavier engines, the pitch of a plane with wholly different dynamics could be disturbed in some flying conditions. Hence the sensor in the front of the plane that would recognise changes in pitch and automatically adjust the wings to keep the plane stable, not in principle a bad idea, but one that requires hyper-reliability and a way for pilots to override the system when necessary.
In the world of aerospace, such judgment calls should have required an entire recertification process and verification by a third party. That did not happen. For decades, regulation in the US has been hamstrung by the libertarian charge that government is inefficient and always wrong, taxes are a coercive infringement of individual liberty, and regulation inhibits private sector dynamism. The Federal Aviation Authority has an enviable technical reputation, but over the past decade it has suffered from successive budget cuts and government shutdowns as the Republican party has waged war on federal spending and federal agencies. Donald Trump, before the crashes, said he wanted to privatise the agency and scale it back even more.
Boeing 737 Max In order to function at all, the FAA has had to delegate regulation to airlines and manufacturers – the fox looking after the chicken coop. Essentially, Boeing decided that the Max 8 did not need recertification and this decision was not challenged by the FAA. Moreover, Boeing undertook much of the safety work itself without any independent review, although as yet the outside world does not know to what degree. What we do know is that 1,000 Boeing employees are seconded to the FAA. Boeing then decided to market the Max 8 as part of the 737 family rather than as a plane with wholly different flight characteristics and a new automated software system that, crucially, did not allow pilots to override in an emergency using standard, practised techniques. Instead, they would need special training, which was not offered or provided.
Boeing report: pilots followed guidance but could not control Ethiopian plane Read more
When the first crash happened, Boeing did not ground all Max 8s; the FAA also failed to act. American prestige was at stake, along with Boeing’s commercial interests. Tellingly, after the second crash, the US was the last to ground the aircraft. But then Boeing is one of the US’s top 10 corporate lobbyists, contributing to Democrats and Republicans alike: juicy defence contracts, government backing for trade fights with Airbus and organising benign regulation costs money. But on safety it has backfired spectacularly.
Boeing is now enveloped in an existential crisis. The libertarian thinking the company exploited has caused a collapse in its reputation and reinforced a long-overdue reaction to the excesses of corporate America. In my Radio 4 documentary, Goliath , I report on the growing intellectual and political revolt against the US right’s attempt to muzzle US policy on challenging monopolies. No, the market will not automatically correct them, the doctrine that has held sway since the 1980s. Companies as disparate as Amazon, Boeing and Facebook need challengers, constraints on their power and tough independent regulators.
The conventional wisdom is that Trump’s re-election may be hard to stop. But it neglects growing alarm in the US about abuses of corporate power. The refrain is: “Let Donald Trump and his transport secretary, Elaine Chao (whose chief qualification for office is that she is the partner of the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell), go on the first 300 test flights when the Max 8 goes back into service.” Leading British Brexiters, so in love with all things American and distrustful of anything European, can fly with them. Until the US system changes, the rest of us may choose Airbuses.

BethAnn McLaughlin: ‘Too many women in science have to run the gauntlet of abuse and leave’ | Science,www.theguardian.com,theguardian.com,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/07/bethann-mclaughlin-sexual-harassment-in-science,"The neuroscientist talks about her website to expose sexual ‘harassholes’ in science. N euroscientist BethAnn McLaughlin is a leading campaigner in the US fight against sexual assault and harassment of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem). Assistant professor of neurology and pharmacology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, she launched the #MeTooSTEM website in 2018 so women had a place to tell their stories. Her work was recently recognised with an MIT Media Lab Disobedience award , which she shared with two other prominent #MeToo activists.
You began campaigning against sexual misconduct in science following an incident in 2015 in which you say you witnessed another faculty member at your university issue threats against a student who had filed a lawsuit against him and the institution (though the faculty member has denied any misconduct and was never found guilty of sexual harassment or retaliation ). What clicked inside?
Like most women in science, I had witnessed gender discrimination and seen sexual harassment – but I’m embarrassed to say I laughed it off [before the incident]. The way we treat cases of sexual misconduct on university campuses is an enormous problem. People found guilty can maintain their positions, keep their funding, get promoted, train students and go to off-campus meetings. It’s totally unacceptable and unsafe.
Does science have a particular problem?
A National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on sexual harassment released last year tells us that more than half of women have been sexually harassed by their colleagues in their science careers. Harassment of women in Stem is the worst of any sector outside of the military . We can’t have these conversations – why are there no women in tech, why are there not enough female professors? – and pretend we don’t understand that sexual harassment happens to most of them. Too many women have to run the gauntlet of abuse and leave.
Why is it important to give people a place to tell their stories about sexual harassment in science?
It is important for people to get a sense of their own narrative. University administrators have had them questioning their truth and sanity for so long. Sharing our stories also helps others understand the pervasiveness and insidiousness of these issues. Usually, aside from supportive friends or family, no one has recognised the wrong that has been done to these people. The biggest success of the #MeTooSTEM site is in us actually finding each other. Because universities want us to be silent and there’s no situation where that is part of anyone’s healing.
We need more apologies, more safe spaces at scientific meetings, more conversation and more data
You have coined “harassholes” to describe men who sexually harass women. Why do we need a new word?
One reason is because some publications don’t let me swear, but they will publish “harasshole”. My family is from Massachusetts and they have Massholes, which are obnoxious drivers. It wasn’t a stretch to come up with harassholes. But I also think it’s important that we do have language to help us understand who these folks are. We have phrases like “sexual misconduct”, “sexual harassment” and “gender discrimination” and those are important terms, but they don’t sum up our lived experience, which is “he’s a harasshole”. We all know these guys. Let’s humanise it.
Last year, you spurred the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to adopt a policy allowing honours to be stripped from scientists proved to be sexual harassers. You’ve also met Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest funder of biomedical research in the US; shortly after, he released a statement apologising to victims of sexual harassment and recognising that the NIH must do better. How have you got these organisations to budge?
I have a problem with people who call themselves leaders and refuse to lead in a way that is reflective of societal values. What was unique about these campaigns was they weren’t: “Hey NIH, please stop funding proved sexual harassers.” They were: “Hey, Francis Collins, I see you on Twitter. Why are you not doing anything about this?” That poking has moved things forward in ways people didn’t imagine possible.
You are active on Twitter through @McLNeuro and blog under the name Fighty Squirrel . Are social media helping move the needle?
I think we are getting traction in real time… things that used to take years now seem to be moving much faster. Tweets are calling people out for decades of bad behaviour. Some people are crashing wildly and publicly in ways that are necessary for progress.
Last summer, you ran a Twitter campaign to get the Rate My Professors site to drop its red chilli pepper “hotness” ratings for academics. Was it difficult to get action?
Rate My Professors, to its credit, responded within two days and it was gone. I did it because many of my female colleagues found the chilli pepper rating offensive… like it has anything to do with your teaching or your mentorship. My male colleagues also thought it was super-creepy to be looked at as “fair game”.
Last year you launched a petition calling on the NAS to eject sexual harassers from its ranks, and the NAS recently announced it will ask members to approve a change to its bylaws to enable proven sexual harassers to be ejected. But you say this isn’t going far enough – how so?
The NAS is essentially proposing to put the onus on victims to start the process – the victim would have to make the claim to the NAS, even in cases where universities or court cases have already concluded that either the NAS member was guilty of sexual misconduct or they would be found guilty so they paid money to silence victims. Marcia McNutt [the NAS president] is asking victims to be retraumatised and revictimised by filing a complaint. Election to the NAS is one of the highest privileges in science and engineering and medicine. It is abhorrent that the NAS keeps putting their stamp of approval on men who have grabbed and groped and assaulted women and victims have to keep proving the cases again and again.
Who’s next?
I’m just marching through the scientific societies and funders, starting with the largest. We also need more apologies, more safe spaces at scientific meetings, more conversation and more data. We want universities to start investing in #MeTooSTEM chapters on campuses to help us give professional advice, provide resources and advocate for people.
Aside from not harassing women, what should male scientists be doing to make things better?
Don’t enable harassholes by collaborating with them – don’t publish papers with them, put in grants with them, put them on student committees or invite them for talks. And call out harassing and diminishing words and behaviours when you see it.
What does redemption look like? Is there a way back for any of these harassers?
It’s not my problem. My problem is: is there a way back for these women who’ve been diminished.
Anita Hill , who testified to Congress in 1991 that she was harassed by then supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas , wrote to you thanking you for your work. She also said: “The impact on you and your career are not to be underestimated.” How has your scientific career been affected?
I don’t have a lot of confidence that I can send in my scientific work for review and it will be treated impartially; that there won’t be someone who has a finding of sexual misconduct who will see it as being in their best interests that I get knocked. And my research group has got a lot smaller; when your tenure is held up, you are not going to take on other graduate students.
You testified against your colleague, which you believe led to an investigation of you which, while it closed without any formal discipline, has been used to scupper your bid for tenure, and you are likely to lose your job. The matter is now with the Vanderbilt University chancellor. Your supporters have an online petition urging him to let you keep your position, and Vanderbilt students have staged sit-ins at his office. Is this a cautionary lesson in the price women pay for speaking up?
Right now, I worry a lot that anybody who looks at a profile of me and sees my current circumstance will say they never want to go through what I’ve gone through. The takeaway message from my story can’t be: “Now she’s taking coffee orders in Starbucks.”
You have been described as profane and confrontational. Is that fair?
I am definitely profane. I will take that one. There are a lot of people who have positions of power who have been way too comfortable for way too long. Women are losing their jobs. And fuck you – yeah it is personal.

Unsung Bletchley Park hero whose role in D-Day was equal to Turing’s | World news,www.theguardian.com,Vanessa Thorpe,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/07/unsung-d-day-hero-bletchley-turing,"Eric Jones is finally to be unmasked as the ‘king of calm’ in Hut 3 who channelled the work of the wartime codebreakers. N o contemporary war reports from the German front mention the name of Eric Jones. And there is not much information about him online – in fact there is more about a Welsh climber of the same name. But the Eric Jones who worked in secret at Bletchley Park in the 1940s is soon to be declared a figure of equal importance to Alan Turing .
Recently declassified documents show that Jones, the son of a Macclesfield textile manufacturer, was the man responsible for interpreting and prioritising all the covert intelligence that came into Britain from Nazi-occupied Europe and from spies working near the frontline.
They also show that his decision to force Britain’s rival military forces to work together may well have won the war and it certainly laid the groundwork for success on D-day . And what is more, Jones later went on to become the first head of the government’s listening station at Cheltenham, GCHQ.
According to David Kenyon, research historian at Bletchley Park, Jones can now at last be unmasked as “the spider in the centre of the information web”.
“It has become apparent from my research that Jones’s skill at putting together all the information coming in was crucial,” Kenyon told the Observer this weekend, ahead of the opening this week of a D-day exhibition at Bletchley Park. The exhibition will highlight for the first time a man known to his admiring circle of secret operatives as the “king of calm”.

“We can also now show that Bletchley was not working in monastic isolation, concentrating only on numbers and breaking codes,” said Kenyon. “It had to feed the right information out to politicians and to commanders in the field.”
The new immersive exhibition, D-day: Interception, Intelligence, Invasion , which opens on Thursday at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, will use film and memorabilia to focus on the meticulous preparations for the D-day landings. It will also, Kenyon said, shed fresh light on a time when, without Jones’s vital interpretation and cataloguing system, the vast amounts of intercepted and decoded enemy intelligence available once Turing and his team had cracked the German Enigma code would still have counted for nothing.
“What we have uncovered is a story of collaboration, and this is the first time it has been told anywhere,” said Peronel Craddock, head of collections and exhibitions at the wartime heritage attraction. “We really can say that Jones, by leading his team inside Hut 3, was at least equally important to Turing in this part of the story. And there we are talking about someone recently declared by the BBC as Britain’s leading icon .”
D-day documents that have now been examined for the first time in 75 years show the extraordinarily detailed briefings the invading forces had been given, not only about the level of resistance they were likely to meet, but also about the location of land mines and the height of fences.
As an example of the way information was brought together in Hut 3, Kenyon picks out news that came through, in spring 1944, that a German SS unit had been moved into Belgium. This was cross-checked against reports coming in from the ground of sightings of SS officers in a Belgian town and the evidence of covert aerial photography.
“When the story about Bletchley first broke in the 1970s, much of the detail stayed in the background,” said Kenyon. “What we can now see is the level of efficiency Hut 3 developed. It had to handle a huge organisational problem once there were thousands of messages coming in.
“After all, there is no point just breaking codes; you have to store them and then find them when you need them. On their own, the Enigma messages were just meaningless 250-word bulletins.”
Jones, who attended King’s School in Macclesfield, is thought to have learned how to handle people well during time he spent working at his father’s silk factory in Manchester, before he joined the RAF reserves and was seconded to the intelligence branch of the Air Ministry.

“He was not from a mathematical or cryptographic background,” said Kenyon, whose book, Bletchley Park and D-Day , out next month, is the first book on the subject since 1979. “It was his quick thinking and people skills that were really important.”
Jones was first sent to Bletchley Park in early 1942 at the age of 35 because it was in crisis. Rivalries between the allied forces’ espionage divisions were threatening the whole intelligence effort.
“Jones was sent in to investigate and wrote a report recognising there needed to be a multi-services approach. It is a report that won the war in many ways,” said Kenyon. “They asked him to stay on to implement his findings and then from around October and November they started to gear up for an invasion at some point.”
Further evidence of Jones’s talents came on the eve of D-day. Aware that many of his staff felt guilty about their lives not being at risk because they were so far from the action, he wrote a memo to all of them underlining how important their jobs were in saving lives. And the streamlined system he set up allowed the team at Bletchley to decrypt intelligence and share it with frontline commanders in Normandy within three hours.
Staff at Bletchley were referred to as “boffins and debs”. but in fact were drawn from across the population. They Included:
Bill Tutte A gifted mathematician from Newmarket, Suffolk, he deciphered the Nazis’ Lorenz code.
Jane Fawcett A debutante who later became an opera singer, she worked long hours in Hut 6, a women-only decoding room. In May 1941, she decoded a message about the German battleship Bismarck that led to its sinking.
Dillwyn “Dilly” Knox A Cambridge University papyrologist turned master codebreaker originally from Oxford, he worked on ancient Greek papyruses before the war and at Bletchley worked on the Enigma code until his death in 1943 at 58.

I've always preferred Campag - for it's drop-dead gorgeous looks - but always envy my wife's Ultegra slickness compared to my bike's slightly clunky changes."

...and we have a winner! I remember reading a report a few months back on why under-30s now are having a lot less self-reported sex than they used to. The conclusion was basically because people are less likely to be in a long term relationship than they used to be.
Society gives us the impression that single people are having a lot of casual sex. Even with dating apps out there though the reality is that you’re more likely to have more sex more regularly if you’re in a relationship."

I'm going to nitpick, though:
No, the market will not automatically correct them*, the doctrine that has held sway since the 1980s.
The market(s) might very well correct them, but over decades and with terrible collateral consequences - the premature deaths of many, and the ruin of many innocent lives. But in the end, the damage to Boeing will force it to change; likewise Facebook and all the rest. Markets will force crappy companies and crappy government policies to change: eventually.
Why wait, when faster, more efficient, more effective, more humane solutions exist; that's to say independent, objective regulation?
Why wait? Because there are ruthless, greedy people who think they can make a quick buck gambling with people's lives and get away with it.
But there are other threats - climate change is the biggest - that markets cannot correct, not least because the human-friendly environment doesn't have enough time left.

So, according to Will Hutton, if you choose a different engine for your aircraft, you have to re-design a ""new plane"", and according to Will Hutton, those dreadful Americans did not.
This is simplistic nonsense of the first order.
Anti-stall mathematical models are a feature of all modern aircraft, and this one went wrong, and badly so.
There are times, in the dark, over oceans, in poor visibility, when the pilots can get disorientated and instrument-confused, and in those circumstances an anti-stall model can be a life-saver.
Why anyone can attempt to turn this dreadful situation in to American-bashing without waiting for the full enquiry is simply lazy and reckless."

One has to hope that the resulting payouts to victims families, and damage to Boeing's reputation, will be sufficient to avoid something similar happening again (at least until the next time...). Meanwhile, one has to wonder how safe the ""technical fix"" will be (how much flight testing will they do, given the pressure to get these planes flying again?!), and of course one can only speculate on what other dodgy systems got waived through on these and other Boeing planes recently that we don't yet know about.

This they inculcate the public through saying that consumers are having their choices rescinded, and they shouldn't be denied the opportunity of buying automatic military weapons, of having flames fly out their taps, to buy medicine at massively inflated prices, to drink polluted water and now seemingly to fly on planes that drop out the sky.
In regards to the latter, as has been recently reported, the FAA has been gutted of funding and staff to the point where it's a tawdry shell, that allows companies like Boeing to basically just 'inform' the FAA how safe their new developments are."
