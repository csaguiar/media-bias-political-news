(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)
An idea floated by President Trump to send immigrants from the border to ""sanctuary cities"" to exact revenge on Democratic foes could end up doing the migrants a favor by placing them in locations that make it easier to put down roots and stay in the country, according to a report by The Associated Press.
Video The plan would put thousands of immigrants in cities that are not only welcoming to them, but also more likely to rebuff federal officials carrying out deportation orders. Many of these locations have more resources to help immigrants make their legal cases to stay in the United States than smaller cities, with some of the nation&apos;s biggest immigration advocacy groups based in places like San Francisco, New York City and Chicago. The downside for the immigrants would be a high cost of living in the cities.
The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University announced this week that an analysis found that immigrants in sanctuary cities such as New York and Los Angeles are 20 percent less likely to be arrested out in the community than in cities without such policies.
""With immigrants being less likely to commit crimes than the U.S. born population, and with sanctuary jurisdictions being safer and more productive than non-sanctuary jurisdictions, the data damns this proposal as a politically motivated stunt that seeks to play politics with peoples&apos; lives,"" said George Gascon, district attorney for San Francisco.
Trump has grown increasingly frustrated over the situation at the border, where tens of thousands of immigrant families are crossing each month, many to claim asylum. His administration has attempted several efforts to stop the flow and he recently shook up the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security.
The idea to ship immigrants to Democratic strongholds was considered twice in recent months, but the White House and Department of Homeland Security said the plan had been rejected.
Nonetheless, Trump said Friday he was still considering the idea.
""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,"" Trump tweeted. He added that, ""The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy - so this should make them very happy!""
The mayor of at least one such sanctuary city, Chicago, said she&apos;d welcome such an immigrant influx. “We have people who are routinely coming to this city. We have a whole infrastructure that’s built up to make sure that their rights are protected while the city of Chicago has, under the current administration, provided funding for various groups to help support asylum seekers and other people that are going through the immigration court system"" Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot said on CNN on Friday. ""I expect it will continue, if not expand upon, those kinds of resources.""
She added: ""We are a city that is a sanctuary city. We have immigrants from all over the world who call Chicago their home. They’ll continue to do that, and we’re going to continue to make sure that this is truly a welcoming community for those immigrants and we want them to come to the city of Chicago.”
The plan discussed by Trump would have financial, logistical and legal issues.
The transportation of immigrants who are arrested at the border to large and faraway cities would be burdensome and costly at a time when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is already stretched thin, having released over 125,000 immigrants into the country pending their immigration court since Dec. 21. They are currently being released mainly in border states.
Flights chartered by ICE cost about $7,785 per flight hour, according to the agency, and require multiple staffers, including an in-flight medical professional. The agency also uses commercial flights. Doing longer transports would increase liability for the agency, especially considering that many of the immigrants in its care are families with young children.
And despite the consideration given to releasing the immigrants on the streets to sanctuary cities, the Trump administration actually has plenty of jail space to detain families. As of April 11, the nation&apos;s three facilities to detain immigrant families were nowhere near capacity, including a Pennsylvania facility housing only nine immigrants.
It&apos;s also unclear how long the immigrants would stay in these cities because they are required to provide an address to federal authorities - typically of a family member - as a condition of their release.
""It&apos;s illogical,"" said Angela Chan, policy director and senior attorney with the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus. ""It&apos;s just alarming that they are spending so much effort and so much time to engage in political theater.""
The Trump administration has long pushed back against cities with sanctuary policies, which generally prohibit local authorities to cooperate with federal immigration police, often by refusing to hold people arrested on local charges past their release date at the request of immigration officers. Over 100 local governments around the country have adopted a variety of these polices
""New York City will always be the ultimate city of immigrants - the President&apos;s empty threats won&apos;t change that,"" New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio said in a statement.
But Trump seemed ready to step up his fight with the cities, vowing to ""give them an unlimited supply"" of immigrants from the border.

(AP Photo/Wilson Ring, File) A large, flightless bird, similar to an emu and native to both Australia and New Guinea, killed its owner when the man fell down on his property in Florida, authorities said Saturday. According to The Associated Press, the Alachua County Fire Rescue Department told The Gainesville Sun that a cassowary killed the man Friday on land near Gainesville, likely using its exceedingly long claws. The victim's name was not released, but reports said he was apparently breeding the animals.

Cassowaries are similar to emus and stand up to six feet tall, weigh as much as 130 pounds and have bright blue heads and necks. But that's not all that makes them distinctive.
According to the San Diego Zoo's website, cassowaries are the world's most dangerous bird, boasting a four-inch claw on each foot.
""The cassowary can slice open any predator or potential threat with a single swift kick. Powerful legs help the cassowary run up to 31 miles per hour (50 kph) through the dense forest underbrush,"" AP quoted the website as explaining.
AP said the fate of the animal in the Florida encounter was not known as of Saturday evening.

California man challenges federal law refusing 'immoral' trademark for clothing brand,www.foxnews.com,Paulina Dedaj,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-man-challenges-federal-law-refusing-immoral-trademark-for-clothing-brand,"Last Update 1 day ago California man challenges federal law refusing 'immoral' trademark for clothing brand Email
Los Angeles artist Erik Brunetti, founder of the streetwear clothing company ""F---,"" (rhymes with ""duct"") poses for a photo in Los Angeles Thursday, April, 11, 2019. (Associated Press) A California man whose company carries a provocative name is hoping that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule against a trademark law that he says restricts his First Amendment rights. A lawyer for Erik Brunetti, owner of the “F---” clothing brand (rhymes with ""duct""), will appear before the Supreme Court on Monday to challenge a federal trademarking law that allows officials to refuse trademarks that they deem “scandalous” or “immoral.”
A distinctive brand name, seen on Brunetti's hat, has led to a legal tangle. (Associated Press)
Brunetti called the provision an unconstitutional restriction of speech that should be struck down. He also said that the underlying process is arbitrary, and that trademarks more offensive than his could be approved depending on who handles the case.
John R. Sommer, Brunetti’s lawyer, makes the argument that an attorney from the South might find something “not nice” that wouldn’t faze a lawyer from the Bronx.
That means “you can register profanity if you’re lucky” and you get assigned a lawyer who allows it, he continued.
OLIVIA JADE’S TRADEMARK APPLICATION WAS REJECTED FOR PUNCTUATION BEFORE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL
The Los Angeles-based clothing brand at issue, which started in 1991, can still operate under Brunetti’s chosen name without a trademark, but doing so could be costly. For instance, Brunetti wouldn't be able to go after counterfeiters who knock off his designs.
The government is defending the century-old trademarking provision, arguing in court documents that the law encourages trademarks that are appropriate for all audiences. The U.S. position is that the measure isn’t restricting speech, but rather declining to promote it.
But there have been workarounds in the past that could help Brunetti’s case.

Two years ago, for example, the justices unanimously invalidated a related provision of federal law that told officials not to register disparaging trademarks. In that case, an Asian-American rock band sued after the government refused to register its band name, “The Slants,” because it was seen as offensive to Asians.
If Brunetti wins, the public is unlikely to notice a whole lot of change, his lawyer said. Retailers will decide what products are appropriate for their customers, and Target and Walmart aren’t going to carry Brunetti’s brand, Sommer said.

Two people were hospitalized for injuries not thought to be life-threatening, while others were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Yezak said. Some people had to be extricated from their homes.
Weather service meteorologist Monique Sellers said they&apos;ve received reports of downed trees, as well as damage to buildings and a transmission tower.
The storms are part of a large system moving through the southern United States, knocking out power to thousands and causing some flash flooding. The weather service said the system is expected to shift to the Ohio Valley and the Southeast on Sunday. More than 140,000 customers remained without power in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas late Saturday.

President Trump and a California mayor traded barbs over Twitter on Saturday, prompted by the president's repeated threats to release detained immigrants into “ sanctuary cities .” The exchange between Trump and Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf also appeared to be triggered, at least in part, by recent New York Times articles about the president's immigration policies.
""So interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other Sanctuary Cities NOT WANT our currently 'detained immigrants' after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule,"" Trump tweeted.

Schaaf fired back, saying: “It’s time to stop fanning hate and division @realDonaldTrump - I’ve been consistent and clear: #Oakland welcomes all, no matter where you came from or how you got here.”
Trump fired off another tweet soon after: ""Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or [sic] its poor management & high taxes!""
In 2017, California passed a “sanctuary state” law limiting cooperation between local authorities and federal immigration officials. Administration officials said Trump's proposal to dump undocumented immigrants in ""sanctuary cities"" was floated and rejected . Trump insists he is still giving the idea strong consideration, according to the Los Angeles Times .
White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said the administration was working with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to advance the plan.
""They have said they wanted all of these illegal aliens into their communities,"" Gidley said on Fox News'""Justice with Judge Jeanine.""""We're working with DHS, we're working with ICE, to try and make sure that happens because after all, it's what they want. They should not say 'This is retribution politically,' they should say, 'This is an olive branch."" Video
Schaaf told NPR on Saturday that her city would accept a busload of 5,000 migrants if it had to.
""My job as a mayor is to welcome people,"" she said. ""I don't build walls. It's our job to welcome everyone into our city, ensure their safety, ensure that their families can thrive. And that is my job no matter where those people came from or how they got there.""
""This is about an outrageous abuse of power,"" she continued. ""The idea that you could use human beings, families as instruments of political payback to use public resources to exact retribution on your political enemies.""
Mayors in other cities have also said they are willing to take in migrants.
“We have people who are routinely coming to this city.

This May 25, 2018 image from surveillance video released by the New South Wales Police Force shows Wachira ""Mario"" Phetmang, 33, entering a service station in South Hurstville, a suburb of Sydney. Authorities have identified an American suspect in the killing of Phetmang, a Thai national whose battered body was found bound, gagged and wrapped in plastic on the side of a road in a high-profile case in Australia, according to a federal search warrant obtained Tuesday, April 9. 2019. (New South Wales Police via AP) SYDNEY – Australian police on Sunday charged a man extradited from the United States with murder in the death of a Thai national, whose body was found bound and gagged on the side of a Sydney road. Alex Dion, 38, was charged with the 2018 murder of Wachira ""Mario"" Phetmang after he arrived in Sydney from California under police guard.
The arrest warrant for Dion was issued in September while he already was in custody on a domestic violence charge in San Diego.
Phetmang's body was discovered by a truck driver last June bound, gagged and wrapped in plastic, covered in a mattress protector. An autopsy of his body found he suffered more than 20 wounds to his head and had multiple skull fractures.
The 33-year-old former cafe and spa worker had been living in Australia for at least the last 10 years, and was a permanent resident at the time of his death. He was last seen alive on May 25 at a petrol station in the Sydney suburb of South Hurstville.
Dion, a U.S. national, is believed to have left Australia on May 27 — more than a week before the body was found and formal identification was made.
When Australian police held a news conference seeking the public's help in the case, Dion called them and tried to blame an associate for Phetmang's killing, while also acknowledging that he had Phetmang's credit cards and cellphones with him in San Diego, according to the search warrant.
Dion told police that he had met Phetmang at the gas station to buy meth but that he left when their associate showed up, a story police say is contradicted by surveillance footage.
Dion was refused bail and will appear at a court on Monday. Trending in World"
Tim Head: US benefits by Netanyahu’s apparent victory in Israel’s election,www.foxnews.com,Tim Head,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tim-head-us-benefits-by-netanyahus-apparent-victory-in-israels-election,"Nearly final results of Israel’s election last week show that Netanyahu’s Likud Party captured 36 seats in the nation’s 120-seat parliament, the Knesset. No party has ever won an outright majority in the Knesset, so parties must form coalitions with other parties to govern. Thanks to the support of other smaller conservative and Jewish religious parties, Netanyahu is expected to put together a coalition controlling 65 seats, keeping him in office. Netanyahu is a true friend of America, having lived here for many years. He and President Trump have established the strongest working relationship between leaders of our two nations since the creation of modern-day Israel in 1948, and America could not have a better ally.
President Trump is more popular in Israel than even in the United States, with a Pew poll late last year finding that 82 percent of Jewish Israelis have confidence in his handling of global affairs and 94 percent have a favorable view of the U.S.
At Netanyahu’s election victory party, many Israelis wore pro-Trump apparel and shouted pro-America chants in celebration of the Trump-Netanyahu relationship continuing.
In addition to cooperation with the U.S. on military and national security issues, Israel is a leader in innovations in technology, medicine, and many other fields, making discoveries and producing new products that benefit people in the U.S. and around the world. As the one true democracy in the Middle East, Israel shares important values with the American people.
Israel and the United States have served as strategic allies in the Middle East and across the globe since President Harry Truman first recognized the Jewish state 71 years ago.
The alliance has continued through defensive wars Israel has fought, through decades of terrorist attacks on the small nation, and through Israel’s show of solidarity with the United States after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Israel has shared valuable knowledge about dealing with terrorism with U.S. law enforcement agencies and our military, once again proving its value as a close ally.
President Trump is more popular in Israel than even in the United States, with a Pew poll late last year finding that 82 percent of Jewish Israelis have confidence in his handling of global affairs and 94 percent have a favorable view of the U.S.
The election of President Trump was a real game-changer that strengthened U.S.-Israel ties more than ever before.
Trump administration policies that have benefitted both the U.S. and Israel include: moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the Israel’s eternal capital of Jerusalem; withdrawing from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal; just recently recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in 1967 when it was attacked by Syria; and standing up to Iran and its global agenda of support for terrorism by branding the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization.
In addition, the Trump administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, which routinely demonizes Israel and passes resolution after resolution critical of the Jewish state – while ignoring far worse behavior by many other nations.
Recognizing Israel’s right to self-defense and to live in peace and security, President Trump has not pressured Israel to make dangerous concessions that would endanger its citizens. And Trump has strongly urged Palestinians to end terrorist attacks on Israel and negotiate a peaceful settlement with the Israelis to end decades of hostility. We all await the peace plan he will soon propose.
Domestically, President Trump has strongly condemned anti-Semitism in the U.S., which is often disguised today as opposition to Israel’s policies dealing with the Palestinians.
The Jewish homeland of Israel serves as the cradle of both Judaism and Christianity. This God-given biblical relationship between Christians and Jews drives Americans of faith to stand firm in their support of Israel to ensure the survival of the Jews and the existence of their state.
Americans of faith recognize Israel’s struggle for what it should be for all the world’s citizens –an effort to maintain free and open access to the holy sites of the world’s monotheistic faiths, and a struggle to build a beacon of democracy and hope in a region that has for too long known far too much bloodshed and hatred.
With Netanyahu now almost certain to stay in office for a fifth term, his partnership with President Trump can continue for the benefit of both nations. America has no better friend in the international community than Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Israel has no better friend among world leaders than President Trump.

Steve Hecht: Democrats are destabilizing Guatemala for political gain,www.foxnews.com,Steve Hecht,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hecht-democrats-guatemala,"Central American migrants march freely across the Guatemala-Mexico border Raw video: Fox News' Griff Jenkins encounters group of migrants crossing into Mexico and meeting no resistance at the border. Democratic presidential candidates have adopted a range of irresponsible positions on immigration. Party darlings Julian Castro and Beto O’Rourke want to decriminalize illegal border crossings. O’Rourke and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., also want to tear down the few existing barriers that protect border communities. Castro and Gillibrand believe ICE, which combats terrorism and transnational crime, should be abolished. This is no longer a fringe position in the Democratic Party, backed by candidates including Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., front-runner and socialist Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the struggling Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Nearly all the illegal immigrants from south of Mexico cross into Mexico via the land border with Guatemala. This is an unlocked backdoor into the United States kept open by Democrats and their State Department allies.
FACING ARREST WARRANT, CANDIDATE DELAYS RETURN TO GUATEMALA
By winning Guatemala's 2015 presidential election, conservative Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales denied Democrats a socialist ally backed by President Obama's State Department. Since then, Guatemala's leftist judiciary has sought to remove Morales from power, just as their comrades have done to President Trump.
Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., who was born in Guatemala, has introduced the Guatemala Rule of Law Accountability Act. She wants travel and financial sanctions on those who have allegedly ""undermined Guatemala’s justice system.” In reality, that should apply to Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and their former ambassadors. But for ideologically driven
Torres, it applies to Morales and his interior and foreign ministers.
To undermine Trump and keep illegal migration flowing, Democrats and State Department bureaucrats are supporting the theft of this year’s presidential election for the socialist candidate. It's hard to keep up with all the Democrats who have visited the region. One recent visit to the region was led by Jerry Nadler, the New York Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee.
Nadler accompanied Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Zoe Lofgren D-Calif., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y. From El Salvador, they released a joint statement: ""We will work with our colleagues in Congress to do everything in our power to push back on the president’s misguided approach to Central America.”
Trump is fighting the very socialism in the region that today's Democratic Party openly embraces.
Socialists believe government money can fix any problem. The Obama administration poured money into the region, which led to more instability. Judicial Watch has identified more than 12 entities that receive aid from the U.S. government and George Soros. Judicial Watch identifies Soros’ agenda as “open borders.”
In February, Democrats did acknowledge funding ""efforts alone are not sufficient."" After a trip to Guatemala, a delegation led by Sens. Tom Carper, D-Del., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., wrote that ""only the institutions in the Northern Triangle countries can fully restore the rule of law.”
There is just one problem: they want to control these institutions rather than allow them to be independent. Democrats have been openly meddling in Guatemala to help socialists for years. They support a criminal justice system that promotes the very illegal immigration they claim to want to fix. Democrats are refusing to cooperate in changing immigration and asylum laws, assuming the issue will favor them in 2020.
Socialists are well organized in Guatemala, as they are in much of Latin America — a result of Fidel Castro spreading Marxism across the region for decades. Castro's involvement is also the reason we see Venezuela in such turmoil today.
Trump is continuing to reverse Cuba policies changed by Obama, including Monday’s action that stopped U.S. money going to Cuba’s state-run baseball program. Obama’s embrace of the Castro regime departed from the policy of his 10 immediate predecessors.
Democrats should work with Trump to mitigate the immigration crisis. They should change the laws that release immigrants into the United States pending hearings. This is an open invitation for migrants to make the perilous journey. Yet Democrats are refusing to cooperate in changing immigration and asylum laws, assuming the issue will favor them in 2020.
Instead, Democrats attack Trump and work with leftist allies in Guatemala to smear Morales, a law-and-order president. They are supporting socialist candidates both at home and abroad, with the goal of worsening the crisis on the border.

The only prominent voice opposing Democrats and State Department employees is Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. In March, he tweeted: “Free and fair elections of a nation’s representatives, chosen by and for the people, is the foundation of republican government. Our friends in Guatemala should be able to exercise this right, free from foreign influence by the U.S. State Department.”

"Rebecca Friedrichs: Pro-life teachers, your union dues fund abortion",www.foxnews.com,Rebecca Friedrichs,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/friedrichs-teachers-abortion,"Teacher warns unions are working with far-left groups to push and fund their radical agenda Christian pro-life teacher Rebecca Friedrichs wants teachers unions out of schools. The miscarriage had just happened, and we were all devastated. I held my precious niece or nephew in the palm of my hand and marveled at the perfect little face, tiny lips, eyes, ears, arms, long legs, ten teeny fingers, ten adorable toes. This was the 1980s. Americans were being told babies in the womb were only “fetuses” and “lumps of tissue.” Common sense unmasked their propaganda but, to me, nothing defied Planned Parenthood’s lies more loudly than the human evidence in my hands. Life is precious. Babies in the womb, no matter their gestational stage or what abortionists claim, deserve life.
This is the truth Abby Johnson realized while working at Planned Parenthood. The recent movie “Unplanned” depicts her heart-wrenching experience working there. My family saw the film — none of us have slept well since. Murder is always bloody; abortion is no exception.
Years ago, as a California teacher, I was shocked to learn that state and national teachers’ unions collude with Planned Parenthood. They use teacher dues money and resources — behind our backs and against our wills — to bring the abortion industry into our schools. Many of our nation’s public schools require teachers to instruct children as young as 12 on how and where to obtain birth control — including the morning-after pill and abortions — without parental knowledge or permission. If teachers refuse to teach this, the law mandates “experts” like Planned Parenthood take over the classroom.
'UNPLANNED' ACTRESS ON TWITTER BACKLASH: 'I COULDN'T EVEN FOLLOW MY OWN MOVIE'
Throughout my 28-year career, I was forced to fund the California Teachers’ Association (CTA) and the National Education Association (NEA), and I personally witnessed their zealous devotion to abortion and the far-left sexual agenda. They even helped lead The Women’s March.
Unions also work with the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, GLSEN (Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network), SIECUS and many other far-left groups to push a radical sexual agenda onto our kids and to punish teachers, parents and students who dare to speak out against it.
For example, pro-life Christian teachers have been spit upon by NEA activists. When they dared to produce medically accurate evidence seeking balance in NEA sex education policies, union activist teachers told them, “There’s a special place in hell for people like you.”
Judy Bruns is a Christian teacher who was mocked and shunned by leaders of the Ohio Education Association and the NEA for daring to represent the voices of pro-life teachers. At her first NEA Representative Assembly meeting, she went up to the microphone in front of over 8,000 educators.
Wary that union leadership would twist her words, Bruns asked three specific questions, each carefully begun with the phrase, “Through the words ‘reproductive freedom’ in our resolutions document, does the NEA support: abortion in the first trimester? abortion up to viability (the point at which the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb with assistance)? the woman’s choice or decision to abort up to and including delivery, commonly termed by the media a partial birth abortion?”
The answer to all three of her questions was, “Yes,” but the last question received an additional response of, “We have no restrictions.” or “We have no limitations [on abortion].” Judy couldn’t remember if they said “restrictions” or “limitations,” but the stance unions take on behalf of millions of teachers is clear. The good news? Pro-life teachers no longer have to fund the unions’ greedy, heartless abortion agenda.
David Schmus, a former teacher and executive director of Christian Educators Association International (CEAI) did some detailed research showing nearly $800,000 of roughly $1 million in donations by the NEA to a 2014 PAC was directed to Planned Parenthood. Schmus rightly points out a hard truth, writing, “Union dues paid by teachers who love children are being funneled to an organization that not only violently ends their lives, but apparently makes a profit off their body parts.”
The good news? Pro-life teachers no longer have to fund the unions’ greedy, heartless abortion agenda. Thanks to a lawsuit ( Friedrichs v. CTA ) brought by 10 California teachers and CEAI, and another suit brought by an Illinois government employee named Mark Janus, we’ve convinced the U.S. Supreme Court that forced union dues are unconstitutional. You can now opt out and pay unions nothing.
As a teacher, the thought of leaving the unions might be terrifying. They’ll tell you you’ll lose your pay, pension and liability insurance if you reject them. They’re lying to you, just like they did about their support of abortion. Thankfully, there are great organizations (like CEAI) providing superior services without the union tentacles. You can learn more about opting out of union membership, connecting with CEAI and other loving teachers who share your values here.

I’ve always been pro-life, but holding the lifeless frame of my miscarried niece or nephew vividly reinforced that belief. The on-screen testimony of a Planned Parenthood clinic director-turned-pro-life-advocate confirmed what I already knew — abortion painfully, violently and permanently ends a baby’s life and scars even more. That’s one reason I sued the unions. So, pro-life teachers, abort your unwanted union membership. Our values and our children are at stake.

All of my other friends were busy with work and travel when I reached out. As a girl who grew up in a family of five kids then transitioned to living in a sorority house , it was safe to say this was the loneliest I had ever been . I had genuinely never spent an extended period of time without being surrounded by other people – a pretty ironic turn of events considering I was in the busiest city in the United States.

My go-to activities on weekends (and even some weeknights) had always involved friends. Since that was not an option, I decided to watch a video about loneliness posted by one of my favorite Christian authors. She described how she used her alone time to communicate more intimately with Jesus. She wrote Him letters about her dreams, asked Him questions about her future, and sat in silence with Him simply to experience His presence.
These were all foreign concepts to me. While I had gotten better about spending time at the beginning of my days to read devotionals and pray, I had never dedicated an entire day or night to just “hang out” with Jesus. Now, I had absolutely no excuse. No distractions, no one else to turn to.
Those two weeks turned out to be one of the most precious experiences in my life thus far. I gave thanks, asked Jesus questions about my future husband, my career path, and HIS plans for me. I told Him I needed His help to align my hopes and dreams with His will. I truly experienced a peace beyond understanding (Philippians 4:7).
A couple of days before my roommate got back, I decided to take a walk around my neighborhood. Out of nowhere, I noticed a girl on the street who had been in my sorority. I ran to her and said hello, asking what she was doing in New York. She was visiting a friend and was exploring the city.
I couldn’t believe it. What were the chances that this girl would be in my neighborhood, especially at the exact time I had decided to take a walk? I offered to show her around the area and we ended up having a great afternoon chatting and enjoying the summer weather.
Even though none of my close friends had been available for a full two weeks, God gave me a sweet and completely unexpected experience with someone I hadn’t seen in years. How cool is He? He not only comforted me in my loneliness; He reunited me with an old friend at the perfect time.
If you’re experiencing loneliness, remember you are never truly alone. God isn’t just sitting around watching you, He’s patiently waiting for you to talk to Him, to experience His glorious presence. I learned that loneliness can be one of the greatest blessings because it forces us outside of our own way and allows us to try new things.
Use your time alone to commune with the One who created you, who loves you like no other and who has an amazing plan for your future if you are willing to listen to Him. You won’t believe the surprises He has in store for you when you dedicate your time to Him.
“But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.” (Matthew 6:33)

"5G is a bigger deal and China is a bigger threat than you think, think tank says",www.foxnews.com,Brooke Crothers,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/5g-is-a-bigger-deal-and-china-is-a-bigger-threat-than-you-think-think-tank-says,"Published April 14 5G is a bigger deal and China is a bigger threat than you think, think tank says Email
China's national flag is seen in front of cranes on a construction site at a commercial district in Beijing, China, January 26, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The effect of 5G technology will be profound – and China could be setting itself up to lead, a conservative think-tank has found. “Think about going from a garden hose with a weak pump to a fire hose,” former House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI) said at discussion recently hosted by the Heritage Foundation, entitled “China, 5G Technology and Global Security.”
The promise of 5G is exponentially higher speeds than 4G. In the U.S., major carriers such as Verizon and AT&T are doing limited rollouts in select big cities but full-bore, widespread 5G won’t arrive until 2020.
For consumers, 5G will bring lots of advancements, including the potential to replace home Wi-Fi networks, smarter artificial intelligence on phones and self-driving cars, among other products. China’s potential to lead
Huawei, the world’s largest supplier of network equipment and one of the world's biggest phone makers, was front and center at the Heritage Foundation discussions.
“If I control the gear that builds the 5G build-out [that means] I can get access to data to anywhere in the world anytime I want,” Rogers said, adding that Australia has banned the Chinese telecom company from its core networks.
The potential to compute in the cloud via 5G is enormous – it could enable AI-enhanced apps on your phone that is “pretty much unthinkable right now,” Klon Kitchen, a senior research fellow Technology, National Security and Science Policy at Heritage, said during the panel discussion.
“So, 5G is not just a faster phone,” he added. “It’s an underlying capability that will enable a whole host of new innovations many of which we haven’t even begun to think about yet.""
Kitchen also discussed the ramifications of Huawei developing and deploying 5G wireless networks faster than the U.S. “Why are we talking about Huawei? Huawei is the only company on the face of the planet that can develop, field and run an entire 5G network.”
WE'RE ALREADY IN THE MIDDLE OF A MAJOR CYBER WAR, EXPERTS BELIEVE
Technological capabilities like Huawei’s matter because “because the currency of national power has now evolved,” Dean Cheng, Asian Studies Center Senior Research Fellow at Heritage, added. Cheng cited the “backbone” of the Internet and China’s increasing leverage.
“You don't actually get to pick and choose which pieces you transmit [data] over…if your country is a fundamental part of that backbone, and that backbone is itself vulnerable or contaminated, it's not at all clear how you would avoid that,” he said.
“So if you had chips, if you had servers and routers that were recording or introducing malware or otherwise contaminating the flow, it's not clear once you hit a tipping point… that you can even avoid being contaminated,” Cheng continued.
Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies like ZTE “pose an interesting challenge...the equivalent of an informational pandemic,” he said.
Rogers described Huawei as “a functioning subservient enterprise to Chinese intelligence and defense services… based on intelligence reports today,"" adding that “China has a law on its books that any Chinese company that has data, no matter where it was acquired, must turn it over to the state when requested.”
FBI director Christopher Wrey has warned about Huawei in the past. Speaking before Congress last year , Wrey said Chinese companies “that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside our telecommunications networks"" pose a risk.
Earlier this week, Secy. of State Mike Pompeo testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee and warned about the ""risk of having network systems co-located with Huawei systems."" Trending in Tech"

FILE - In this March 16, 2017, file photo, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti arrives for a meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania. The deep chill in U.S.-Russian relations is stirring concern in some quarters that Washington and Moscow are in danger of stumbling into an armed confrontation that, by mistake or miscalculation, could lead to nuclear war. “During the Cold War, we understood each other’s signals. We talked,” says Scaparrotti, who is about to retire. “I’m concerned that we don’t know them as well today.” (AP Photo/Mindaugas Kulbis, File) WASHINGTON – It has the makings of a new Cold War, or worse. The deep chill in U.S.-Russian relations is stirring concern in some quarters that Washington and Moscow are in danger of stumbling into an armed confrontation that, by mistake or miscalculation, could lead to nuclear war.
American and European analysts and current and former U.S. military officers say the nuclear superpowers need to talk more. A foundational arms control agreement is being abandoned and the last major limitation on strategic nuclear weapons could go away in less than two years. Unlike during the Cold War, when generations lived under threat of a nuclear Armageddon, the two militaries are barely on speaking terms.
""During the Cold War, we understood each other's signals. We talked,"" says the top NATO commander in Europe, U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, who is about to retire. ""I'm concerned that we don't know them as well today.""
Scaparrotti, in his role as Supreme Allied Commander Europe, has met only twice with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff, but has spoken to him by phone a number of other times.
""I personally think communication is a very important part of deterrence,"" Scaparrotti said, referring to the idea that adversaries who know each other's capabilities and intentions are less likely to fall into conflict. ""So, I think we should have more communication with Russia. It would ensure that we understand each other and why we are doing what we're doing.""
He added: ""It doesn't have to be a lot.""
The United States and Russia, which together control more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, say that in August they will leave the 1987 treaty that banned an entire class of nuclear weapons. And there appears to be little prospect of extending the 2010 New Start treaty that limits each side's strategic nuclear weapons.
After a period of post-Cold War cooperation on nuclear security and other defense issues, the relationship between Washington and Moscow took a nosedive, particularly after Russian forces entered the former Soviet republic of Georgia in 2008. Tensions spiked with Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and its military intervention in eastern Ukraine. In response, Congress in 2016 severely limited military cooperation with Russia.
The law prohibits ""military-to-military cooperation"" until the secretary of defense certifies that Russia ""has ceased its occupation of Ukrainian territory"" and ""aggressive activities."" The law was amended last year to state that it does not limit military talks aimed at ""reducing the risk of conflict.""
Relations frayed even further amid U.S. allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, although President Donald Trump has doubted Russian complicity in what U.S. intelligence agencies assert was an effort by Moscow to boost Trump's chances of winning the White House. After a Helsinki summit with Putin in July, Trump publicly accepted the Kremlin leader's denial of interference.
Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview Friday that Russian behavior is to blame for the strained relationship.
""It's very difficult for us to have normal relationships with a country that has not behaved normally over the last few years,"" Dunford said. ""There are major issues that affect our bilateral relationship that have to be addressed, to include where Russia has violated international laws, norms and standards.""
Dunford said he speaks regularly with Gerasimov, his Russian counterpart, and the two sides talk on other levels.
""I'm satisfied right now with our military-to-military communication to maintain a degree of transparency that mitigates the risk of miscalculation,"" he said. ""I think we have a framework within to manage a crisis, should one occur, at the senior military-to-military level.""
James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013, says the West must confront Russia where necessary, including on its interventions in Ukraine and Syria. But he believes there room for cooperation on multiple fronts, including the Arctic and arms control.
""We are in danger of stumbling backward into a Cold War that is to no one's advantage,"" he said in an email exchange. ""Without steady, political-level engagement between the defense establishments, the risk of a true new Cold War rises steadily.""
No one is predicting a deliberate Russian act of war in Europe, but the decline in regular talks is a worry to many.
Moscow says it is ready to talk.
""Russia remains open for interaction aimed at de-escalating tension, restoring mutual trust, preventing any misinterpretations of one another's intentions, and reducing the risk of dangerous incidents,"" the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement last week in response to NATO's 70th anniversary celebration.
Sam Nunn, who served in the Senate as a Democrat from Georgia from 1972 to 1997, argues that dialogue with Russia is too important to set aside, even if it carries domestic political risk.
""You can't call time out,"" he said in an interview. ""The nuclear issues go on, and they're getting more dangerous.""
Nunn co-wrote an opinion piece with former Secretary of State George Shultz and former Defense Secretary William Perry arguing that the U.S. and its allies and Russia are caught in a ""policy paralysis"" that could lead to a military confrontation and potentially the first use of nuclear weapons since the U.S. bombed Japan in August 1945.
""A bold policy shift is needed,"" they wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, ""to support a strategic re-engagement with Russia and walk back from this perilous precipice. Otherwise, our nations may soon be entrenched in a nuclear standoff more precarious, disorienting and economically costly than the Cold War.""
A group of U.S., Canadian, European and Russian security experts and former officials in February issued a call for talks with Russia on crisis management.
""The risks of mutual misunderstanding and unintended signals that stem from an absence of dialogue relating to crisis management ... are real,"" the Euro-Atlantic Security Leadership Group said in a statement.
It said this could lead to conventional war with Russia or, in a worst case scenario, ""the potential for nuclear threats, or even nuclear use, where millions could be killed in minutes."" Trending in US"

Politicians look to separate Chicago from Illinois to create 51st state,www.foxnews.com,Travis Fedschun,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/politicians-look-to-separate-chicago-from-illinois-to-create-51st-state,"Chicago's murder rate drops in 2018, but the city still has a long way to go The so-called ""Second City"" may eventually become the next state, after frustration regarding Chicago 's influence over politics in Illinois . A group of state Republican lawmakers recently signed on to legislation proposing the nation's third-largest city become the 51st state.
""It's more of a frustration of the policies than the true belief that Chicago and Illinois would be better off as separate states,"" Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer told the State Journal-Register. ""I don't believe that Chicago and the state of Illinois should be separated. Our relationship is mutually beneficial.""
CHICAGO IS MOST CORRUPT BIG CITY, ILLINOIS THIRD MOST CORRUPT STATE IN COUNTRY, STUDY FINDS
Davidsmeyer said he co-sponsored the legislation to spark a discussion about how the city's politics impact rural residents in downstate Illinois.
“The reality is the city of Chicago is competing with New York City and L.A. and San Francisco, and (downstate is) competing against rural Indiana and rural Missouri,” he told the State Journal-Register . “The policies that come down from Chicago are actually pushing our economic opportunity away.”
A central Illinois lawmaker is sponsoring legislation proposing the separation of Chicago from Illinois to spark discussion about the overarching influence of the city in state politics. (AP)
Forming a new state from a portion of a current state requires endorsement from Congress and the state legislature, according to the U.S. Constitution.
The bill, HR0101 , was introduced in February by state Rep. Brad Halbrook, who said he supports removing the city of 2.7 million people from Illinois because of differing views on issues such as abortion and gun rights.
“Our traditional family values seem to be under attack at every angle,” Halbrook told the Journal-Register. “We are trying to drive the discussion to get people at the table to say these are not our values down here.”
Part of the bill states that: “Numerous counties in the southern and central parts of Illinois are approving resolutions to become sanctuary counties for gun owners, while the City of Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country."" Cash-strapped Chicago proposes universal income program
Halbrook co-sponsored a similar resolution filed last year that failed. This year's attempt has even less of a chance of succeeding and getting out of the Rules Committee in the Democratic-controlled legislature as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and the leaders of the state House and Senate are all Democrats from Chicago.
""When you have a large population center that seems to control the agenda for the rest of the state, it just kind of creates some issues,"" he told the paper.
CHICAGO REDUCES MURDER RATE IN 2018, BUT LEVEL STILL OUTSTRIPS LA AND NY COMBINED
A report in February from the University of Illinois at Chicago found that Chicago was still the top in the ranking of the most corrupt big cities in the nation and Illinois the third most corrupt state in the nation.

The tension between urban and rural areas isn't exclusive to Illinois. The same has occurred in New York and California, according to a paper published last year by the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.

John Jackson, a visiting professor at the institute and co-author of the paper, told the Journal-Register it was odd that the resentment has persisted in Illinois, but many politicians from southern and central parts of the state often ""run against Chicago.""
""We ought to have leaders who get together and coalesce for the good of the state,"" he told the paper.
Davidsmeyer said since the resolution has been introduced, it's spurred a greater discussion about how big an influence Chicago politics has over Illinois.
“People say Chicago’s a huge economy, there’s no way you can survive without them, (but) I have people on the other side saying Chicago’s killing us with their policies, we need to separate,” he said. “I’m one of the people in the middle saying let’s see both sides of it.”

"Colorado enacts 'red flag' law to seize guns from those deemed dangerous, prompting",www.foxnews.com,Gregg Re,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sheriff-fires-back-after-colorado-enacts-red-flag-law-to-seize-guns-from-individuals-deemed-dangerous,"Weld County sheriff says Colorado's 'red flag' bill is government overreach Colorado became the 15th state on Friday to adopt a “red flag” gun law , allowing firearms to be seized from people determined to pose a danger -- just weeks after dozens of county sheriffs had vowed not to enforce the law, with some local leaders establishing what they called Second Amendment ""sanctuary counties."" The law didn't receive a single Republican vote in the state legislature, and has led to renewed efforts from gun-rights activists to recall Democrats who supported the measure. In a fiery and lengthy statement on Facebook on Friday, Eagle County, Colo., Sheriff James van Beek slammed the law as a well-intentioned but ""ludicrous"" throwback to the 2002 film ""Minority Report,"" and outlined a slew of objections from law enforcement.
Van Beek charged that the law treats accused gun owners like ""criminals,"" discourages individuals from seeking mental health treatment, and ignores the reality that ""a disturbed mind will not be deterred by the removal of their guns.""
Noting that cities with strict gun laws still experience high murder rates, van Beek asserted: ""By removing guns from someone intent on committing suicide or murder, we still have the danger of someone who may be unbalanced, now, angrier than before, and looking for another means … explosives, poisons, knives, car incidents of mowing down groups of unsuspecting innocent.""
Colorado’s law, approved by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, allows family, household members or law enforcement to petition a court to have guns seized or surrendered based on a showing that someone poses a danger under the ""preponderance of the evidence,"" a civil standard which means that the defendant is more likely than not to be a threat. Colorado sheriff would rather go to jail than enforce 'unconstitutional' gun law
""In other words, there is just over a 50/50 chance of accuracy,"" van Beek wrote, noting that someone's guns could be seized even without a mental health professional making a determination of any kind. ""Like the flip of a coin. Couldn’t that apply to just about anything a person does?""
A subsequent court hearing could extend a gun seizure up to 364 days, and gun owners can only retain their guns if they meet a burden of demonstrating by ""clear and convincing evidence"" -- a much higher standard -- that they are not in fact a threat. Gun owners, van Beek said, are ""guilty until proven innocent"" under this framework.
Minority Republicans in the legislature had unsuccessfully tried to shift the burden of proof to the petitioner.
The law's passage marked a personal victory for first-term Democratic Rep. Tom Sullivan, whose son, Alex, was gunned down in the 2012 Aurora theater massacre that killed 12 people and wounded 70 others. The bill is slated to take effect in January.
“Three hundred and fifty one Fridays since Alex was murdered,” Sullivan began, wearing his son’s leather bomber jacket at the signing ceremony for the bill he sponsored.
“Being the parent of a murdered child, everything is stunted,” Sullivan said, prompting knowing, tearful nods from several other shooting survivors standing behind him. “I am elated, believe me. It just can’t come out because there is just too much work in front of us to get done.”

Responding in part to Sullivan's remarks, van Beek emphasized his own county's work on establishing partnerships to combat mental illness, which he characterized as a practical solution. The Aurora theater shooter, James Holmes, long suffered from mental illness.
""The Red Flag Law can remind one, of the movie 'Minority Report'; regulating against what we think someone might do,"" van Beek wrote. ""It’s like regulating via clairvoyance, but in this case, we actually take away someone’s property and require them to go to court to prove their innocence of a crime that hasn’t been committed, yet they were punished because someone thought they might be thinking about it.""
The sheriff continued: ""I find no mental health programs associated with this law. Just a possible overreach of well-meaning citizens, with no infrastructure for addressing the primary intention of the law: mental health as it relates to public safety.""

Van Beek's post concluded by arguing that Colorado's law violated the Second Amendment. However, van Beek explicitly stopped short of declaring sanctuary county status, and suggested his office would enforce the law.
""Removing the guns in a constitutionally questionable manner, without notice, denying the accused the ability to defend charges, then requiring medical services that are not available, in order to reinstate private property rights, afterward, is like putting a Band-Aid on the probability of a wound, and not allowing its removal until an injury has occurred,"" he wrote. ""In other words, the entire process is ludicrous.""
Van Beek added: ""I stand with other Sheriffs in opposition to the Red Flag law on constitutional grounds as well as its failure to address the true issues, which are behavioral and mental health. In addition, it places fiscal hardships on county budgets, places law enforcement officials in imminent danger, violates citizen’s rights, and actually works against the mental health concerns that it was originally designed to aid."" ""The entire process is ludicrous."" — Eagle County, Colo. Sheriff James van Beek
Florida passed its own “extreme risk protection order” law after the 2018 Parkland school massacre. Others with versions of the law include California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state, as well as Washington, D.C.
“Colorado has endured more than our fair share of tragedies,” Polis said Friday. This law will not prevent every shooting, but it can be used in a targeted way to make sure that those who are suffering from a mental health crisis are able to temporarily have a court order in place that helps make sure they don’t harm themselves or others. Today we may be saving the life of your nephew, your niece, your grandchild.”
Gun rights activists pushed for Polis and some Democrats who supported the legislation to be recalled. Senate President Leroy Garcia, a Democrat, voted against the bill -- primarily, observers said , because his predecessor was recalled in 2013 for supporting the state's last major gun control push.
That 2013 legislation implemented background checks and ammunition magazine limits, following the Aurora and Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. In all, two Democratic lawmakers were recalled and another resigned for supporting those laws.
About half of Colorado’s 64 counties — most in rural areas — passed resolutions opposing the new bill and declared themselves “Second Amendment sanctuaries.”
Opposition from rural sheriffs elicited a warning last month from Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser , who has said those who won’t enforce the law should resign.
The law is named after Douglas County Sheriff’s Deputy Zackari Parrish III, a 29-year old husband and father who was killed on New Year’s Eve 2017 by a man who had exhibited increasingly erratic behavior.
Parrish’s boss, Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock, and Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle attended. Pelle’s son, a Douglas County sheriff’s deputy, was wounded in the shooting that killed Parrish.
Pelle said he was working with Spurlock and other law enforcement chiefs to develop protocols for executing protective orders safely.
Co-sponsor Alec Garnett, a Democrat and the House majority leader, noted that Colorado’s law stands out for providing legal representation for gun owners."
'Game of Thrones' star Lena Headey hates fan to nude scene,www.foxnews.com,Jessica Sager,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/game-of-thrones-star-lena-headey-hates-fan-backlash-to-nude-scene,"Headey told The Sun she was pregnant at the time of the shoot, so she used a body double for the scene, in which a cult forced her to walk through the streets naked. “Some people thought I was less of an actress [for using a body double],"" Headey recalled. ""It was a bit shocking. [The stand-in] found it very difficult, obviously. It’s not a natural thing to do.”
She embraced that vulnerability when filming as a way to cope with the pain of her divorce from her husband of six years, Peter Loughran, in 2013, explaining, “I tried to put into Cersei in a way that was cathartic for me, otherwise I would have had a meltdown.”
Headey says she&apos;s got little in common with Cersei in terms of her own personality, which makes the role a bit of a challenge, but that the character did help her cope with another trauma in her life: postpartum depression , which she suffered in the first season of the "" Game of Thrones .""
In this image released by HBO, Lena Headey appears in a scene from ""Game of Thrones."" (AP)
“It was horrendous — I had post-natal depression but I didn’t know it,"" she said . ""I saw a doctor for the medical check and I just burst into tears. I did the first year [of &apos;GoT&apos;] in that space, figuring out motherhood and going through a weird time personally. It was tricky.”
Headey says she&apos;ll miss the show, but there&apos;s one element of it which she&apos;s eager to strip herself of for good: Cersei&apos;s cropped wig, which Headey — who also said she only worked for 15 days per year — calls ""the itchy turnip.""
Video ""I hated that thing. I would have liked to burn it,"" she confessed. “Everyone keeps asking me if I took anything from the set — but I didn’t take anything.”
Playing Cersei was challenging at times for Headey, she says, because she&apos;s a self-described ""nerd"" who&apos;s shy and suffers from anxiety, but she&apos;ll miss the series and admitted to crying when "" GoT "" filming ended.
“I thought I wasn’t going to let myself get to that point because I had the last day to get through — and then, when I left and I got in the car, I broke down in tears and I was devastated,"" she said. “It’s been nine years and it’s been amazing, and I’m happy to go and find new things.”

"Madagascar measles epidemic kills over 1,200 people",www.foxnews.com,David Aaro,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/madagascar-measles-epidemic-kills-over-1200-people,"Only 58 percent of people on the main island have been vaccinated against the disease, a huge reason for its recent spread. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) reported the outbreak has impacted mostly children under the age of 15 since it began in September. AP says more than 1,200 people have died over the past seven months. “The epidemic unfortunately continues to expand in size, though at a slower pace than a month ago,"" Dr. Dossou Vincent Sodjinou, a WHO epidemiologist in Madagascar, told AP .
DR MARC SIEGEL: MEASLES OUTBREAKS ARE FAR WORSE THAN THE VACCINE THAT CAN PREVENT THEM
Measles is a contagious virus that spreads through the air via coughing and sneezing. Symptoms including a high fever, rash, stuffy nose, reddened eyes and the Mayo Clinic says it usually takes 10-14 days after exposure to see them.
Some waiting rooms have been full as volunteer nurses try to help out with the demand of sick patients. AP reported that 50 percent of children in Madagascar are malnourished due to economic reasons, a major reason for the epidemic. Many parents aren’t aware that vaccines are free because the area lacks health information.
“Malnutrition is the bed of measles,” Sodjinou exclaimed to AP.

Measles is one of the leading causes of death for children and the WHO says about 450 die each day worldwide due to the illness. Immunize.org says complications from measles are more common among children under five years.
Due to misinformation by anti-vaxxers, measles cases are rising in the United States. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency last week, requiring unvaccinated individuals living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to receive the measles vaccine. He said the city would issue violations and possibly fines of $1,000 for those who did not comply.
The disease was thought to be eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but there have been 19 states that have reported measles cases this year alone. Those states include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.
In 2016, the total number of measles cases in the U.S. was 86 according to the CDC . In just four months this year, the cases have grown to 465. This is the second greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since measles was eliminated in 2000. The first occurred in 2014 due to a single outbreak that 338 people were connected to. It&apos;s never been this widespread.
NEARLY 1,000 MADAGASCAR CHILDREN DEAD OF MEASLES SINCE OCTOBER: WHO
According to the CDC, 25 percent of all people who get measles will be hospitalized and two out of every 1,000 will die from the disease.
The CDC says two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective against the disease.
The WHO started a vaccination campaign in Madagascar last month with the plan of reaching 7.2 million children between the ages of 6 months to 9 years. Madagascar’s health ministry has sent free medications to areas that have been impacted most by the disease.

""Let&apos;s see if Cali can bring the ‘yee-haw’ to me,"" Musgraves called out. ""So when I say, &apos;Yee,&apos; you say, &apos;Haw.&apos;""
The Texas-born singer proceeded to yell out “yee,” to which the crowd correctly responded with, “haw.” She does it once more and the festival-goers follow along.
Warning: explicit language in video
But the third time wasn’t the charm.
The crowd screamed out “haw” even though Musgraves didn&apos;t say “yee.”
""I didn&apos;t say f---ing &apos;yee&apos;!"" Musgraves told the audience.
Musgraves posted a clip of the failed call-and-response on her Twitter on Saturday with the caption, “I didn’t say-.” The tweet received more than 50,000 retweets and nearly 260,000 likes by Sunday morning.

Musgraves performed during the first weekend of the music festival and brought out Baddie Winkle, a 90-year-old Internet star, when she sang her song “High Horse.” The country singer also performed several other songs from her “Golden Hour” album, including “Slow Burn” and “Butterflies.”

In this image made with a wide angle lens, debris is littered on the ground where a home once stood in Hamilton, Miss., after a deadly storm moved through the area Sunday, April 14, 2019. (AP Photo/Jim Lytle) Powerful storms that killed at least three people swept across the South on Sunday after spawning suspected tornadoes that left more than 20 people injured and multiple homes and businesses damaged or without power. One person was killed in northeastern Mississippi when a tree crashed onto his trailer, Monroe County Road Manager Sonny Clay said at a news conference, adding that a tornado had struck. Another 19 were taken to hospitals, including two who were in critical condition.
A tornado was reported in the area 140 miles (225 kilometers) southwest of Memphis, Tennessee, at the time.
National Weather Service meteorologist John Moore said a possible twister touched down Saturday in the Vicksburg, Mississippi, area. No injuries were reported there, but officials said several businesses and vehicles were damaged. Trees were down throughout the hilly city on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi.
The roof of a hotel in New Albany, Mississippi, was damaged, although the cause was unclear. Mississippi State University's 21,000 students huddled in basements and hallways as a tornado came near the school's campus in Starkville.
University spokesman Sid Salter said some debris, possibly carried by the tornado, was found on campus, but no injuries were reported and no buildings were damaged. Trees were down and at least some minor damage was reported in residential areas east of the campus.
Heavy rains and storms raked the Magnolia State into the night, then moved into Alabama. A possible tornado knocked out power and left damage in Troy, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Montgomery. A mobile home community was damaged, but no injuries were reported.
In East Texas, two children were killed when a pine tree fell onto the back of the car in which they were riding in a severe thunderstorm Saturday. The car was on a back country road in Pollok, Texas, about 150 miles (241 kilometers) southeast of Dallas.
The tree ""flattened the car like a pancake,"" said Capt. Alton Lenderman of the Angelina County Sheriff's Office. The children, ages 8 and 3, were dead at the scene, although both parents, who were in the front seat, escaped injury, he said.
The large storm system also knocked out power to thousands and caused flash floods. More than 140,000 customers lost power in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas as of late Saturday.
A tornado hit the small Central Texas city of Franklin, overturning mobile homes and damaging other residences, said Robertson County Sheriff Gerald Yezak. Franklin is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of Dallas.
The weather service said preliminary information showed an EF-3 tornado touched down with winds of 140 mph (225.3 kph). Crews were sent to survey the damage.
Two people were hospitalized for injuries not thought to be life-threatening, while others were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Yezak said. Some people had to be extricated from their homes.
Downed trees and damage to buildings and a transmission tower were reported, said meteorologist Monique Sellers.
Winds of up to 60 mph (96.56 kph) were reported in Cherokee County, Texas, damaging two homes in Alto, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) north of Houston, but no injuries were reported.
The forecast of severe weather forced officials at the Masters in Augusta, Georgia, to begin the tournament early Sunday, starting threesomes off the first and 10th tees on the day's final round in hopes of finishing in midafternoon before the winds and rains begin. Trending in US"
"Conway: House Democratic leaders frustrated with Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and other 'radical freshmen'",www.foxnews.com,Andrew O'Reilly,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conway-house-democratic-leaders-frustrated-with-ocasio-cortez-omar-and-other-radical-freshman,"Specifically referencing Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Conway said the crop of young, far-left lawmakers in Congress are causing ""trouble in (House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi paradise."" “There’s a great deal of frustration among rank-and-file members who represent more moderate districts and, frankly, who represent districts that Donald Trump won in 2016. They’re very frustrated,"" Conway said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press.”
Conway added: ""They’ve been to the White House. They talk to people like me, quietly, saying they wish the radical freshmen who get all the magazine covers and all the ink and airtime.”
Tlaib and Omar – along with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., -- have frequently made front page news since joining Congress in January for their controversial statements and policies, as well as for their vocal criticism of the Trump administration.
Video House Democrats set out an ambitious agenda with legislation on the kitchen table priorities that helped them win the majority — protecting the Affordable Care Act, imposing new ethics rules — while engaging in aggressive oversight of the Trump administration. Their investigations extend well beyond Special Counsel Robert Mueller&apos;s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election as they dig into the president&apos;s business dealings and push for Trump&apos;s tax returns.
But with the spotlight comes high-profile setbacks. Democrats splintered over Ocasio-Cortez&apos;s climate change proposal and exposed party divisions over Omar’s comments on Israel&apos;s treatment of Palestinians. Tlaib stunned some when, on Day One, she told supporters — using an expletive — that the new majority would impeach Trump.
Conway said Sunday that the “invitation is open” to any Democrat who wants to come to the White House to discuss divisive issues like immigration and border security.
“Let’s try to work together. But we have an unserious Congress that is not coming to the table. And the Republicans failed to do their job when they were in charge, no doubt. And Democrats now are failing to come together in the House,"" she said.

Man sues parents over his massive pornography collection,www.foxnews.com,David Aaro,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/man-sues-parents-after-they-destroy-his-pornography-collection,"In a lawsuit filed last week , the plaintiff who FOX 17 identifies as ""Charlie"" recently moved to Indiana after living with his parents in Michigan for 10 months. He had just gotten over a divorce, and was able to do work around his parents’ home in exchange for rent. A domestic situation forced him out in August 2017. A few months later, his parents drove to his home in Indiana to give him some belongings he left in their home, only one thing was missing: his gargantuan porn collection that consisted of more than 12 moving boxes full of adult films.
PORN STAR-TURNED-PASTOR SAYS SHE WANTS &apos;EVERYONE TO EXPERIENCE THE LOVE OF GOD&apos;
Charlie says his parents told him they destroyed his entire collection.
Upset, he called the Ottawa County Sheriff&apos;s Office, filing a police report that estimated the value of his collection at $28,940.72. The prosecutor&apos;s office decided against filing charges against his parents, but Charlie is still suing his parents for $86,822.16 in damages.
The collection was described by his parents in an email.
""We counted twelve moving boxes full of pornography plus two boxes of sex toys as you call them. We began that day the process of destroying them and it took quite a while to do so,"" his parents wrote.
A month after he filed the police report, Charlie scolded his father in an email. ""If you had a problem with my belongings, you should have stated that at the time and I would have gone elsewhere. Instead you choose to keep quiet and behave vindictively,"" he said.
According to the lawsuit, his father said he destroyed them for Charlie&apos;s own good. ""Believe it or not, one reason for why I destroyed your porn was for your own mental and emotional health, his father said. “I would have done the same if I had found a kilo of crack cocaine. Someday, I hope you will understand.”
According to his father, Charlie&apos;s addiction turned into a small porn business during his high school and college days
He was reportedly kicked out of high school and college for selling pornography to other students. His son was warned that if he ever found porn in his house again, he would destroy it.
Upset that no one wanted to take his case, the plaintiff reached out to investigators again, allegedly sending one officer 44 emails worth of porn movies he says were destroyed.
CHICAGO WOMAN ONCE ADDICTED TO PORN SAYS GOD HELPED CURE HER
Some, he says, are extremely valuable because those videos aren’t being distributed anymore.
""Not Just Out of Print,"" Charlie said about his valuable out-of-print films. ""But the entire studio making it dissolved, and that was 20 years ago.""
The prosecutor’s office decided against filing charges a second time.
FOX 17 reached out to the attorney representing the plaintiff, but they have no comment at the time.

“But as it turned out, the suspect did in fact approach him -- and him lying there helpless -- and shot him several more times in the chest area,” Dickerson said.
He said the vest stopped two bullets.

“That’s what, without any question, saved his life,” the sheriff said at a news conference. “No doubt in my mind and unequivocally had he not had that vest on he would have expired immediately.”
The sheriff said Randy Vaught, 33, was the person who shot Tatum during an incident that began when Tatum spotted Vaught and two friends leaving a drug house and pulled them over.
After the stop, Vaught sped off when he couldn’t produce a driver’s license and then drove to his mother’s home, WREG-TV reported. He ran into the home as his friends ran off. Later they told cops they had taken meth before Tatum stopped them.

Dickerson said Tatum was shot initially when he tried to follow Vaught into the home through the back door.
Other deputies arrived on the scene and rescued the wounded Tatum., who was transported to a Memphis hospital where he underwent surgery, the station reported. He faces more surgeries, Dickerson said.
The standoff began with Vaught barricading himself in the home.
As time passed and Dickersonn and deputies tried to convince him to surrender, Vaught posted apologies to his family on Facebook and told them he was going to surrender, according to the station.
The standoff ended around 10:30 p.m. when Vaught emerged, kneeled down and shot himself in the head, Dickerson said.

Man sues parents over his massive pornography collection,www.foxnews.com,David Aaro,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-sues-parents-after-they-destroy-his-pornography-collection,"Last Update 9 hours ago Man sues parents over his massive pornography collection Email
A man is suing his parents for destroying his porn collection he values at nearly $30,000 (iStock) A Michigan man is suing his parents after they destroyed his extremely valuable porn collection, according to FOX 17. In a lawsuit filed last week , the plaintiff who FOX 17 identifies as ""Charlie"" recently moved to Indiana after living with his parents in Michigan for 10 months. He had just gotten over a divorce, and was able to do work around his parents’ home in exchange for rent. A domestic situation forced him out in August 2017.
A few months later, his parents drove to his home in Indiana to give him some belongings he left in their home, only one thing was missing: his gargantuan porn collection that consisted of more than 12 moving boxes full of adult films.
PORN STAR-TURNED-PASTOR SAYS SHE WANTS 'EVERYONE TO EXPERIENCE THE LOVE OF GOD'
Charlie says his parents told him they destroyed his entire collection.
Upset, he called the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office, filing a police report that estimated the value of his collection at $28,940.72. The prosecutor's office decided against filing charges against his parents, but Charlie is still suing his parents for $86,822.16 in damages.
The collection was described by his parents in an email.
""We counted twelve moving boxes full of pornography plus two boxes of sex toys as you call them. We began that day the process of destroying them and it took quite a while to do so,"" his parents wrote.
A month after he filed the police report, Charlie scolded his father in an email. ""If you had a problem with my belongings, you should have stated that at the time and I would have gone elsewhere. Instead you choose to keep quiet and behave vindictively,"" he said.
According to the lawsuit, his father said he destroyed them for Charlie's own good. ""Believe it or not, one reason for why I destroyed your porn was for your own mental and emotional health, his father said. “I would have done the same if I had found a kilo of crack cocaine. Someday, I hope you will understand.”
According to his father, Charlie's addiction turned into a small porn business during his high school and college days
He was reportedly kicked out of high school and college for selling pornography to other students. His son was warned that if he ever found porn in his house again, he would destroy it.
Upset that no one wanted to take his case, the plaintiff reached out to investigators again, allegedly sending one officer 44 emails worth of porn movies he says were destroyed.

Some, he says, are extremely valuable because those videos aren’t being distributed anymore.
""Not Just Out of Print,"" Charlie said about his valuable out-of-print films. ""But the entire studio making it dissolved, and that was 20 years ago.""
The prosecutor’s office decided against filing charges a second time.

This photo shows an apartment where a U.S. servicemen and a Japanese woman found dead, in Chatan town, Okinawa, southwestern Japan Saturday, April 13, 2019. A U.S. serviceman has fatally stabbed a Japanese woman and then killed himself in Okinawa. ((Kyodo News via AP)) A U.S. Navy sailor allegedly stabbed a Japanese woman before taking his own life in an Okinawa apartment. The two were found dead Saturday morning inside a six-story apartment building in the Kuwae district of Chatan, according to an Okinawa Prefectural Police spokesman.
Authorities say the murder-suicide was carried out by the male sailor, 31, and both have died from stab wounds, according to the Washington Examiner. It's unknown why he went through with the attack, but Stars and Strips reported the two were in a relationship.
JAPAN SAYS US SERVICEMAN KILLS WOMAN, SELF IN OKINAWA
The woman, in her 40s, had a child in the apartment during the time of the stabbings, who is unharmed and now in government custody. The child called a relative for help, who eventually reached out to the police at 7:26 a.m.
Names have not been released, but the sailor was part of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division, based in Okinawa.
Although Okinawa makes up less than 1 percent of Japan's land space, AP said, it hosts about half of the 54,000 American troops stationed in Japan, and is home to 64 percent of the land used by U.S. bases in the country.
This attack comes in the wake of an NBC report highlighting resentment toward U.S. troops in Okinawa. ""There are so many American troops here. Of course, 99 percent of them are good people, but then there is that 1 percent who do evil things. It's hard for us,"" said Tomomichi Shimabukuro, who runs a seaside inn called Churaumi-kun.
GOVERNOR WANTS US, JAPAN, OKINAWA TALKS ON US BASE MOVE
The Washington Examiner says the Marine Corps is cooperating with police as they finish their investigation.
""This is an absolute tragedy and we are fully committed to supporting the investigation into the incident,"" the III Marine Expeditionary Force said in a statement. ""More information will be forthcoming as the investigation progresses.""
Take Akiba, Japan's vice minister of foreign affairs, told NBC News he ""lodged a strong complaint"" with U.S. Ambassador William Hagerty, requesting support for the investigation.

Students say gym teacher had black kids research slave games,www.foxnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/students-say-gym-teacher-had-black-kids-research-slave-games,"EDUCATION Published 1 day ago Students say gym teacher had black kids research slave games Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email SHOREWOOD, Wis. – A Wisconsin middle school gym teacher has been placed on indefinite leave while district officials look into claims that she separated students in one class by race and assigned the black children to research games that enslaved children played.
The Shorewood Intermediate School teacher was instructing seventh-graders about games from around the world on April 1 when she allegedly gave the assignment to the black students, Shorewood School District Superintendent Bryan Davis said in a Thursday letter to parents. He didn&apos;t name the teacher.
""We take these allegations extremely serious,"" Davis wrote. ""Throughout this situation, student safety and well-being have been our top priority.""
One of the black students, MaHailey Stephens, told WITI-TV that she and her classmates were separated into groups based on race and asked to research games from their cultures.
""I went to my mom, I&apos;m like, &apos;mom, what are slave games?&apos;"" she said.
Her mother, Reshunda Stephens, told the station that the same teacher asked her older daughter to be part of ""the colored club,"" last year.
""How many more times do people have to feel uncomfortable until change happens?"" she asked.
Davis said the district is ""committed to providing an environment of inclusion in our schools.""
""We will continue to assess the situation and ensure that we provide ongoing support to our students as we move forward,"" he wrote.
School officials including a counselor and a psychologist are providing support to affected students, according to Davis."
'Shazam!' slays 'Hellboy' reboot at the box office,www.foxnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shazam-slays-hellboy-reboot-at-the-box-office,"Lionsgate&apos;s ""Hellboy"" reboot, the animated Laika Studios release ""Missing Link,"" the college romance ""After"" and even the long-delayed ""Mary Magdalene,"" originally to be released by the Weinstein Co., all opened in theaters. But the strongest new release of them all was, predictably, the Will Packer-produced one: ""Little."" The body-swap comedy ""Little"" came in second with $15.5 million for Universal Pictures. Made for just $20 million, ""Little"" is just the most recent profit-maker for Packer, the ""Girls Trip"" producer.
The film, directed by Tina Gordon Chism, stars 14-year-old Marsai Martin as the child an abusive tech executive (Regina Hall) reverts to after a magical spell is cast on her. Martin, the ""black-ish"" star, also executive produced the film, the youngest ever so credited in Hollywood history.
""Little"" drew a largely female (65 and African American (43%) audience. Jim Orr, Universal Pictures distribution chief, credited the cast, Chism&apos;s direction and Packer&apos;s overall know-how.
""He&apos;s done it with different kinds of films. &apos;Breaking In&apos; was a thriller, &apos;Girls Trip&apos; was an R-rated comedy. &apos;Little&apos; is kind of an all-ages film, PG-13 rated,&apos;"" said Orr, whose studio signed a first-look deal with Packer in 2013. ""He&apos;s a brand. And he has a great idea of what is going to be successful at the box office.""
It was an out-of-body weekend at the box office. The body-swap comic-book adaptation ""Shazam!"" — about a teenage boy (Asher Angel) who can turn into an adult-sized superhero (Zachary Levi) with a simple command — held solidly in its second week. Capitalizing on good reviews and word-of-mouth, ""Shazam!"" is Warner Bros.&apos; New Line&apos;s latest DC Comics success. It has grossed $94.9 million through Sunday with a worldwide total of $258.8 million.
Lionsgate and Millennium&apos;s ""Hellboy"" had been expected by many to vie with ""Shazam!"" on the weekend. But on the heels of terrible reviews (just 15% ""fresh"" on Rotten Tomatoes), it flopped with $12 million against a $50 million budget.
That&apos;s significantly less than the 2004 original ($23 million opening) and the 2008 sequel ($34.5 million opening). Those films were directed by Guillermo de Toro and starred Ron Perlman; the new ""Hellboy"" stars David Harbour (""Stranger Things"") and is directed by Neil Marshall.
""Missing Link"" also missed. It opened with a disappointing $5.8 million, marking a new low for Laika, the maker of eccentric animated tales such as ""Coraline,"" &apos;&apos;ParaNorman"" and ""Kubo and the Two Strings."" &apos;&apos;Missing Link,"" distributed by United Artists Releasing, is about the discovery of a creature in the Pacific Northwest. Its voice cast includes Zach Galifianakis, Hugh Jackman and Zoe Saldana.
Expectations had varied widely for Aviron Pictures&apos; ""After,"" an adaption of Anna Todd&apos;s 2014 best-seller. The young-adult drama fared well with $6.2 million in 2,138 theatres.
And ""Mary Magdalene,"" starring Rooney Mara as Mary and Joaquin Phoenix as Jesus, finally opened, more than three years after production. Harvey Weinstein had once conceived of the film, directed by Garth Davis (""Lion"") as his next Oscar contender.
After the fallout of Weinstein and the bankruptcy of the Weinstein Co., IFC Films acquired the biblical biopic. Critics dismissed it (44% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences mostly did, too. It grossed about $62,000 on 62 screens.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.
1. ""Shazam!"" $25.1 million.
2. ""Little,"" $15.5 million.

Andy Puzder: Stephen Moore at the Fed has liberals terrified -- here’s why,www.foxnews.com,Andy Puzder,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andy-puzder-stephen-moore-at-the-fed-has-liberals-terrified-heres-why,"Since Moore’s nomination , The New York Times, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, HBO comedian John Oliver, and even a former Congressman from Missouri have all tried to delegitimize Moore’s outstanding record because of their hatred for President Trump. Who could have seen that coming? ""These are the people who have gotten it wrong for the past week or four years, who said that if Donald Trump is elected president, we would have a second Great Depression and the stock market would crash,"" Moore recently observed.
It was no exaggeration. Prior to the 2016 election, The New York Times predicted that “the stock market would fall precipitously” if Donald Trump won, and comedian John Oliver said that President Trump is “a disaster and we’re all going to die.” After Trump’s victory, Schumer made sure to distance himself from the President-elect before Hillary Clinton even had time to process the reality of her defeat.
Now, Moore’s latest detractor has gone so far as to accuse President Trump of treason based on the now-discredited Russia collusion hoax. Some people just can’t move on, the facts be damned. To put it mildly, Moore’s enemies are nothing more than embarrassed partisans who are attacking him as a proxy for the president.
Their embarrassment grows from the glaring mistake they made by failing to forecast the current economic surge. That miss has intensified their hatred of President Trump as the economy keeps on growing.
Contrary to their doom and gloom forecasts, the economy created more than 2.6 million jobs in 2018. Both the unemployment rate and initial claims for unemployment benefit are sitting near 50 year lows while year over year wage growth has been at or above 3 percent for eight consecutive months. When President Trump took office, there were nearly 2 million more people unemployed than there were job openings. There are now nearly 900,000 more job openings that people unemployed.
According to a recent poll released by CNN, more than 70 percent of Americans believe the economy is in “good shape,” the highest number to say so in over 18 years.
Moore is exactly the type of “growth hawk” President Trump and the American people need at the Federal Reserve
In fact, had it not been for the Federal Reserve’s ill-advised interest rates hikes last year, the economy would be even stronger than it is now — something Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to recognize when he reversed plans to raise rates even further in 2019. Moore wisely cautioned against rate hikes all along, suggesting that he’ll be a powerful voice within the central bank defending the interests of working Americans.
The Wall Street Journal praised Moore’s prescience on interest rates, saying he “has certainly been proven right in his warning last autumn that the Fed was tightening policy too fast.” The editorial also noted that Moore’s nomination “has triggered a remarkable cascade of derision and condescension from the political left and the poohbahs of the economics academy,” which the Journal’s editors interpreted as a strong indication that “he’s the right man for the job.” They’re right.
Moore is exactly the type of “growth hawk” President Trump and the American people need at the Federal Reserve — someone who “will try to make sure that America grows as fast as it can, and that wages rise and that we have a long period of prosperity through a sound monetary policy,” as Moore himself described his approach.
Liberal politicians, comedians, and media outlets are trying to derail Moore’s nomination, but their hysterical attacks are just further examples of the Trump Derangement Syndrome that has taken hold of the professional left. They will be even more humiliated when President Trump is proven right yet again. Moore is exactly the right man to guide the Fed toward a more reasonable policy that will secure the economic gains our country has made over the past two years, and that might just be what Democrats and their allies fear the most.

Dallas transgender woman brutally beaten in broad daylight,www.foxnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/dallas-transgender-woman-brutally-beaten-in-broad-daylight,"CRIME Published 6 hours ago Last Update 5 hours ago Dallas transgender woman brutally beaten in broad daylight Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email DALLAS – Police canvassed a Dallas neighborhood during the weekend in search of anyone who may have witnessed the brutal beating of a transgender woman in an attack that happened in broad daylight in front of a crowd of people and that was caught on cellphone video.
Detectives were seeking clues in hopes of identifying the woman&apos;s assailant or assailants, police said in a statement.
They said the woman reported the assault while receiving hospital treatment Friday night. She told officers the attack happened earlier Friday after she was involved in a minor traffic accident near an apartment complex in the southern part of Dallas, according to the police statement released Saturday.
A purported video of the attack posted on Facebook shows a man in a white shirt viciously beating the woman, apparently into unconsciousness, while the crowd looks on and homophobic slurs are shouted.
Several women eventually carried the victim&apos;s limp body to safety.
A Dallas police spokesman said the woman&apos;s identity and further information about the case would not be released Sunday.
Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said he is ""extremely angry about what appears to be mob violence against this woman"" and that those responsible do not represent how most residents feel about the city&apos;s ""thriving LGBTQ community.""
""I am in contact with (Police Chief U. Renee Hall) and she assured me that the Dallas Police Department is fully investigating, including the possibility that this was a hate crime,"" Rawlings, who has viewed the video, said in a statement Saturday.
Last November, the FBI reported that 7,175 hate crimes were committed in the United States in 2017, the most recent year for which the agency had compiled data. Of those, 1,130 were based on sexual orientation bias and 119 on gender identity bias. The data showed a 5% increase in hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation bias and a 4% decrease in hate crimes motivated by gender identity bias. Of crimes motivated by gender identity bias, 106 targeted transgender people, a 1% increase from 2016."
Student creates 'promposal' website for peers to avoid 'awkward situations' while looking for dates,www.foxnews.com,Fox News,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/student-creates-promposal-website-for-peers-to-avoid-awkward-situations-while-looking-for-dates,"Hannah Rogers, a senior at American Fork High School, designed a website that eases the stress for those looking for dates to prom . Rogers said she came up with the idea for the website – called Beenasked – after taking an entrepreneurship class that tasked students with finding a solution to a real-life problem, Fox 13 reported. While she was in the class, Rogers told Fox 13 it was Homecoming season and was “really chaotic” for students to navigate between who had and had not been asked to the school dance.
“So I came up with the idea of creating a website where you could see everyone’s names, who had and hadn’t been asked to a dance, so you didn’t accidentally ask someone that’s already been asked and get yourself out of that awkward situation,” she said.
For now, the website is only comprised of American Fork High School students who agreed to participate in a survey and have their names published.
“This is our list, everyone whose name is in gold has a date to prom, and anyone whose name is in black still hasn’t asked anyone or hasn’t been asked,” Rogers said to Fox 13, while scrolling through the list of students who opted into the survey.
In addition to the list of those who have been asked, and those still available, the teen&apos;s website includes “promposal” ideas and discounts on prom services such as clothing, activities, dinner and transportation.
The inclusion of the deals section, which features mostly local businesses, was after Rogers learned that many of her classmates wanted to attend school dances, but did not have the money.
“It’s too expensive, kids just can’t afford it, and they don’t know who to ask,” she explained.
Now the “one-stop-shop” as she calls it, provides everything students may need to set up their perfect prom night.
“That’s really the whole point, to support our local businesses and support our students. It’s really a win-win for everyone,” said Rogers.
Though she insists the site is “not a dating app,” it is “trying to help students meet other students to go on dates with.”
Hannah, who graduates this year, is hoping to eventually expand Beenasked to other schools and school districts.
