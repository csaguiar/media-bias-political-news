Tripoli, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The head of Libya 's UN-backed government Fayez al-Sarraj on Saturday accused his rival Khalifa Haftar of betraying him over a military offensive against the capital Tripoli which risks plunging the country into civil war.
Forces loyal to the Libyan commander have pressed on with their assault despite international calls to halt hostilities.
In a televised address, Sarraj warned of a ""war without a winner"".
""We have extended our hands towards peace but after the aggression that has taken place on the part of forces belonging to Haftar... he will find nothing but strength and firmness,"" he said.
Pro-Haftar fighters have been slowed in their advance by forces loyal to Sarraj's Government of National Accord (GNA), which is based in the capital.
For the first time, forces backing the GNA launched air strikes earlier Saturday on Haftar's self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA) -- which vowed to retaliate -- around 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Tripoli .
Pro-government forces in Tripoli confirmed they had targeted Haftar's men with ""intensive strikes"".
The air strikes came as fresh fighting flared Saturday south of Tripoli between the pro-government forces and Haftar's troops despite calls from the international community to halt the military offensive.
Several European foreign ministers warned Haftar not to countenance any further military action, with France 's Jean-Yves Le Drian warning ""there will be no military victory"".
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said there should be pressure on all the actors in Libya ""especially general Haftar"".
A similar stance was taken by the UN Security Council which, following a closed-door emergency meeting Friday, said those responsible for re-igniting the conflict will be held responsible.
- Residents stockpile - Libya has struggled to counter unrest since the 2011 overthrow of dictator Moamer Kadhafi, leaving dozens of militia to fill the void and ally with either the GNA or the rival administration in the east backed by Haftar.
At least one armed group from Misrata -- whose forces are mostly loyal to the UN-backed government -- arrived Saturday in eastern Tripoli to join the counter-offensive, according to an AFP photographer.
""We are waiting for orders to repel any advance by the enemy towards Tripoli ,"" said the group's spokesman Khaled Abu Jazia.
Dozens of armed vehicles mounted with anti-aircraft guns were gathered in Tajura, in the suburbs east of the capital.
Tripoli residents have expressed concern that large-scale fighting could break out and began stocking up on food and petrol .
On Saturday large queues formed at petrol stations and supermarkets, an AFP journalist said.
""We must store everything we need for the family , just in case, especially those with young children,"" said Farida, a mother pushing a full shopping cart.
""You never know how long it will last,"" she added.
Haftar's forces were driven back by a few kilometres on Friday evening after briefly seizing Tripoli 's international airport , which was destroyed in 2014.
They were also pushed back from a key checkpoint west of the capital, less than 24 hours after seizing it during their lightning offensive towards Tripoli .
- UN 'determined' for talks - The latest escalation in the conflict-wracked country comes just days ahead of a UN-backed conference intended to unite Libya 's rivals and pave the way for elections.
Russia's top diplomat on Saturday called for Libyans to ""decide their future themselves"" through ""inclusive"" dialogue.
""Without any sort of artificial dates that some are trying to force upon them from outside,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said during a visit to Cairo .
Despite the Tripoli flare-up, UN envoy Ghassan Salame insisted the April 14-16 talks in the Libyan city of Ghadames would go ahead.
""We are determined"" to hold the talks ""as scheduled "" unless prevented by serious obstacles, Salame told a press conference.
""We want to reassure Libyans that we will stay alongside the Libyan people to make the political process a success without resorting to escalation.""Libya's unity government was created at UN-backed talks in 2015 but it has struggled to assert control, while a number of international initiatives since have failed to unite the country.

Berlin, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus said his team need to take a long, hard look at themselves after their ""catastrophic"" 5-0 defeat to Bundesliga title rivals Bayern Munich on Saturday.
""We played catastrophically and I don't have any explanation for it,"" Reus told Sky.
""We can't turn up and play like that, Bayern are not a joke team. We need to be ruthless when we analyse our performance."" Hapless defending and poor build-up play saw Dortmund humiliated in a remarkable first half, as Bayern outplayed them all over the pitch and reclaimed top spot in the Bundesliga.
""We didn't leave Dortmund any space to breathe,"" said Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said that his team had been ""taught a lesson"", and admitted that his decision to play Reus up front instead of Mario Goetze had backfired.
Despite the thumping defeat, Dortmund are still just one point behind Bayern in the title race , and Favre said that his team must put a traumatic evening in Munich behind them.
""We have to concentrate on the next games. If we play like we did today, it will be hard to stay in the title race ,"" he added.
""We have to play football instead of just saying that we want to win."" With six games to go, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski warned that there was still ""difficult path ahead"" if Bayern were to win a seventh consecutive league title.
""If we win all our games, then we will do it, but it will be difficult. We have to show on the pitch that we want to be champions,"" said Lewandowski who scored twice against his former club on Saturday, taking his Bundelsiga career total to 200.
Bayern arguably have the harder run-in. They face a tough away trip to third-placed Leipzig before hosting fourth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt on the last day of the season.
Yet coach Niko Kovac was optimistic, saying that his team had stuck it their critics with Saturday's performance.
""It makes me particularly happy because there was a lot of harsh criticism directed at my team,"" he said."

Guardiola coy over quadruple bid after City reach FA Cup final,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/guardiola-coy-over-quadruple-bid-after-city-r-587883.html,"Guardiola Coy Over Quadruple Bid After City Reach FA Cup Final Muhammad Irfan 5 minutes ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 02:00 AM
London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Pep Guardiola claimed he still doesn't believe Manchester City can win the quadruple after his side reached the FA Cup final with a 1-0 win over Brighton on Saturday.
Guardiola's men were well below their best in the Wembley semi-final, but Gabriel Jesus's early goal got the job done.
City will play Watford or Wolves in the final on May 18, but before then they hope to have retained the Premier League title and reached the Champions League final.
Currently two points behind leaders Liverpool with a game in hand in the Premier League , City go to Tottenham for the first leg of the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday.
Having already won the League Cup, an unprecedented clean-sweep of all four major trophies is within touching distance, but City manager Guardiola refuses to talk up his team's chances.
""My opinion is that nobody has done it (won the quadruple), so why can we do it?,"" he said.
""It is almost impossible to achieve everything, that is the truth."" City laboured to kill off Premier League strugglers Brighton in a hard-fought semi-final lacking many thrills.
Guardiola praised Brighton 's resilience and admitted he was relieved to get the win.
""It was a semi-final, Brighton are an incredible defensive team, we knew that set-pieces were huge, massive. We conceded too many but only one dangerous situation. We are in the final, we are there,"" he said.
City defender Kyle Walker came off at half-time after suffering a first-half knock.
Walker was also fortunate to escape with a yellow card after a VAR review of a 32nd-minute incident when the England star reacted to a challenge from Alireza Jahanbakhsh by aiming his head at the Brighton player.
""I didn't see the Kyle Walker incident,"" Guardiola said.
""We are losing players every game but still we will try to do it.
""I am happy to be in the final. We extend our season by one more week and we are happy for that."" Brighton boss Chris Hughton was adamant Walker should have been sent off.
""I have seen it a few times and my opinion is it is a red card,"" he said.
""We ask for players to be honest and with Alireza, if he goes down clutching his head it would have been a different outcome. There is enough movement for it to be a red card."""

Berlin, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski became only the fifth player in history to score 200 Bundesliga goals during Saturday's emphatic 5-0 win over his former club Borussia Dortmund .
Lewandowski marked the milestone in style, chipping Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki and volleying into the open net to score Bayern 's second goal of the evening and reach his own double century .
He added another in the 89th minute, taking his tally to 201.
""I never thought I would score so many goals in the Bundesliga,"" the Polish striker told Sky.
""I still remember my first one very well."" Lewandowski's first Bundesliga goal came for Dortmund against Schalke back in 2010. His brace on Saturday means he is now the fifth most prolific player in German league history.
He is just 19 goals off former Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes, who is third in the all-time list.
""I'm not too far away from Jupp's mark,"" he told Sky with a grin."

Cairo, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) : Egypt is on track to end subsidies on most fuels by June 15 as part of a reform programme led by the International Monetary Fund, the Washington-based body said Saturday.
The economy of the Arab world 's most populous country has suffered from political instability and security threats since the 2011 uprising that ousted long-time leader Hosni Mubarak.
Cairo secured a $12 billion , three-year loan package from the IMF in 2016 .
Egyptian authorities ""remain committed"" to ending subsidies granted to limit prices at the pump, the IMF said in a new report.
The prices of liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) and fuels used in bakeries and for electricity generation would not be affected, it added.
Bread is a staple in Egypt and a price hike could spark further discontent in the face of continued economic woes.
The IMF said cutting the subsidies is ""critical to encourage more efficient energy use"" and to ""create fiscal space for high-priority spending on health and education "".
The IMF in February approved the next $2 billion loan payment to Cairo , citing ""substantial progress "" made by Egyptian authorities on reforms, which have boosted growth and cut unemployment.
But IMF chief Christine Lagarde at the time also urged Egypt ""to press ahead with structural reforms that facilitate private sector-led growth and job creation.""The latest instalment brought the total paid to Egypt to about $10 billion since the loan deal was signed in November 2016 .

For some reason, Democrats seem to think that if anyone criticizes Rep. Omar that they're suddenly advocating for violence against her. They seem to think Trump saying Omar doesn't like Israel is condemning what death threats she received on Friday. But it doesn't. Recommended The Democratic Field Is A Rainbow Of Sameness Derek Hunter
It is possible to slam Omar for her anti-Semitic tropes. It is possible to condone someone sending her death threats because they disagree with her policies.
Why is it so hard for Democrats to see that not everything is as black and white as they like to make it?"

Spartak started brightly but squandered several presentable chances and CSKA made them pay in the second half.
Teenage Iceland midfielder Arnor Sigurdsson scored twice within the space of nine minutes to give CSKA a crucial victory.
""Spartak started aggressively but we resisted their pressure,"" CSKA manager Viktor Gancharenko said. ""It's a very important win."" Second-placed Krasnodar snatched a 1-0 win over Samara to narrow the gap on Zenit to three points as Viktor Claesson scored an injury-time penalty.
Krasnodar have won three straight games, but Zenit can restore their six-point lead on Sunday when they visit reigning champions Lokomotiv Moscow .
The hosts dominated possession, but a combination of poor finishing and good goalkeeping by Sergei Ryzhikov left the 23,000 home crowd frustrated at half-time.
They suffered a serious blow with 19 minutes to play as wing-back Sergei Petrov was sent off.
The game looked to be heading towards a goalless conclusion, but Krasnodar defender Uros Spajic was brought down in the area and Sweden international Claesson netted a 'Panenka' spot kick.

Kean -- the victim of racist abuse last week in Cagliari -- came on as a substitute and fired in the winner after 84 minutes for his fifth goal in as many Serie A appearances.

Krzysztof Piatek had put visiting AC Milan ahead five minutes before the break with his 21st goal this season. Paulo Dybala pulled the hosts level from the spot after an hour.
The Turin giants were playing without injured striker Cristiano Ronaldo, recovering from a thigh injury, as they prepare for their Champions League quarter-final, first leg game against Ajax on Wednesday.
For Milan , the defeat further damages their Champions League ambitions with just one point from their last four Serie A games.
Gennaro Gattuso's side are fourth but can be overtaken by Atalanta, who are just a point behind and travel to third-placed Inter Milan on Sunday .
Roman sides Lazio and Roma are four points behind.
The visitors had come out firing .
Piatek missed a chance after two minutes heading wide from a nice cross by Spanish midfielder Suso. Franck Kessie was also off target early.
Sami Khedira came on for the first time since heart surgery a month ago, replacing fellow German Emre Can who went off early with an ankle injury.
Milan were denied a penalty when Alex Sandro handled intercepting Hakan Calhanoglu's cross. The referee deciding it was unintentional after a VAR viewing.
Minutes later Piatek broke through to beat fellow Pole Wojciech Szczesny following a blunder from former Milan defender Leonardo Bonucci, who had been under fire for comments he made over the Kean's racist abuse in Cagliari .
Tiemoue Bakayoko pounced on the sloppy pass to burst through for Piatek who finished off.
Mario Mandzukic almost grabbed the equaliser before the break but Pepe Reina, at full stretch, tipped clear the Croat's acrobatic bicycle kick.
A reckless Mateo Musacchio foul on fellow Argentine Dybala allowed the hosts pull level on the hour.
Kean came on after 65 minutes to replace Dybala and 20 minutes later the 19-year-old delivered the winner to the delight of the home crowd.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) UK Prime Minister Theresa May ruled out the option of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union with no deal on Saturday, saying that London would either get a divorce deal passed or remain in the bloc as the UK Parliament opposed a no-deal Brexit .
On Friday, the UK prime minister wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask for a Brexit extension until June 30.
""Because parliament has made clear it will stop the UK leaving without a deal, we now have a stark choice: leave the European Union with a deal or do not leave at all ,"" May said, as quoted by the Guardian newspaper.
Brexit delays increase the chance of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union , according to the prime minister .
""The longer this takes, the greater the risk of the UK never leaving at all . It would mean letting the Brexit that the British people voted for slip through our fingers. I will not stand for that. It is essential we deliver what people voted for, and to do that we need to get a deal over the line,"" May underlined.
Moreover, May would face pressure to step down from her fellow Conservative members of the UK parliament if Brexit delays force the United Kingdom to take part in the elections to the European Parliament , slated for next month, according to the media outlet.
""I and many other Conservatives would prefer leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms to any humiliating long extension that forces us to take part in the European elections,"" Nigel Evans, the executive secretary of the 1922 Committee, a parliamentary group consisting of all Conservative backbencher members of the UK lower house, said.
The UK government and Brussels reached a divorce deal late last year, but the UK parliament has refused to back the agreement and cannot agree on any alternative measures. The country was supposed to have left the bloc on March 29 but missed the deadline. The European Union gave London until April 12 to either come up with an alternative solution or leave without a deal on that day. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

""It's about knowing if finally we want to listen to the voice of science,"" high school student Jan Burckhardt told ATS.
""Save the climate please: it's the last time we ask politely,"" read one of the placards at the Lausanne demonstration, an AFP photographer saw.
The marches were organised by an alliance of activist groups in Switzerland , including Greenpeace, Swiss Youth for Climate and green groups.
""We don't want to stop our movement as long as our claims have not been heard, as long as we have not obtained concrete results ,"" said Laurane Conod, one of the organisers of a smaller march in Geneva .
The climate change protests in Switzerland were in part inspired by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who started weekly school strikes calling for policy change on the climate issue."

CARACAS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday strongly condemned Washington 's new round of sanctions targeting vessels and companies linked to Venezuela 's oil giant PDVSA.
On Friday, the United States sanctioned 34 vessels tied PDVSA, controlled by the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and two companies that allegedly transport oil from Venezuela to Cuba . Moreover, a senior official from the administration of US President Donald Trump said the latest round of sanctions was introduced at the request of the Venezuelan opposition-led National Assembly .
""#US imposed sanctions this Friday to vessels and companies engaged in oil shipments between #Cuba and #Venezuela, a lawful activity under commercial contracts. These measures are an act of extraterritoriality, interference and imperial arrogance,"" Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter .
The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry has also strongly condemned the US move and noted that Caracas would respond to these sanctions in an appropriate legal manner.
Venezuela has long been suffering from an acute economic crisis exacerbated by the US sanctions against the country. In January ,� opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president of Venezuela after disputing Maduro's re-election in May . Washington immediately endorsed Guaido and called on Maduro to step down.
Maduro has accused the United States of trying to orchestrate a coup in order to install Guaido as a US puppet. Russia , China , Cuba , Bolivia , Turkey and a number of other countries have voiced their support for Maduro as the only legitimate president of Venezuela . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

New Record: Obama Mentions Himself 467 Times During Berlin Townhall :: Grabien News,news.grabien.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://news.grabien.com/story-new-record-obama-mentions-himself-467-times-during-berlin-to,"""Myself""— 9
The former president's comments began on his favorite topic: himself.
""It’s been over ten years since I spoke to a slightly larger crowd in front of the Victory Column when I was running for president,"" Obama said to a notably quiet crowd. ""I had a little less gray hair then. And since then I’ve been back to Germany I think at least ten times. I’ve been to Europe countless times. But I’m as excited to be here with you as I have been ever when I’ve come to Europe.""
He continued in the same vein: “When I left office, or maybe a few months before I left office, I had to make some decisions about what I would do after the end of my presidency and I knew that I wanted to catch up on my sleep — I had to take Michelle on vacation. She deserveed it, putting up with me for that long. But we also knew that our service wasn’t yet done. I was one of the youngest presidents to be elected, which meant I was one of the young est ex-presidents. And I asked myself, ‘All right, what’s the next thing that I can do to make the biggest impact, the most difference?’ And there were a whole range of issues that I cared deeply about, many of which you work on.”
Obama frequently focused on trying to shore up his own legacy, taking credit for things such as the Paris Climate Accord.
“When I passed the Paris climate,"" Obama began at one point, before catching himself and continuing, ""Or, when I helped get the Paris agreement on climate accomplished, I was the first one to say what we’ve done here is not adequate to meet the demands of climate science.""
In another impressively self-referential section about his days as a community organizer, Obama used the ""I"" word six times in a single sentence: ""One of the challenges that I had when I was a young organizer was I wanted change now and I wanted 100 percent of what I wanted and then I suddenly confront some politician"" who would disagree.
At another point, Obama talked about meditation, and that led to a riff about ... Obama.
""I mean, I will tell you that I don’t have a regular meditation practice. But I have my own tools I guess to take me to a certain place. For example, you know, particularly when I was your age I did a lot of writing and that would serve as a similar process for me where I would still myself and if I was writing well, it would take me out of myself, right?""
Obama soon segued to his affinity for working out: “You know, I was — I was a pretty busy guy. I’ve got to say. But I worked out every morning. I mean, I was pretty religious about it. I was in the gym. And people knew, unless there was an actual literal emergency, that you had to block out that time in the morning when I was going to be working out. And if I did not have a workout, I was going to be cranky. But I knew that if I was going to be able to sustain the pace I was sustaining over the course of eight years, I needed to have at least that.”
And on and on and on it went. For more, check out the video above [a montage will be coming soon].

The Link Between Effective Fisheries Management and Ending Harmful Subsidies | The Pew Charitable Trusts,pew.org,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://pew.org/2uKy60C,"The Link Between Effective Fisheries Management and Ending Harmful Subsidies The Pew Charitable Trusts Overview
Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are negotiating an end to harmful fisheries subsidies that enable and encourage unsustainable fishing, and they are working to fulfill a 2017 commitment to deliver an agreement by the end of 2019. 1
Specifically, they must agree on rules to prohibit certain forms of government subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing and to eliminate those that encourage illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. A timely agreement would mark a big step towards achieving sustainability in global fisheries that would benefit all fishing nations.
Today, harmful subsidies provide economic incentives for fishers to increase catch beyond what fish populations can sustain over the long term. Too often, these subsidies—which typically offset costs such as fuel, gear, and vessel construction—fund destructive and expensive fishing practices that would not be economically viable without government support. They undermine good management and lead to too many fish being taken from the ocean. With the world’s governments spending over $20 billion on such subsidies annually, 2 these practices represent a recipe for the collapse of many fisheries.
Effective fisheries management both underpins and depends on successful subsidies reform, in part because some proposals now before the WTO would link allowable subsidies to fish stock health, and how well nations monitor their fleets.
Broadly, good fisheries management requires stock assessments based on the best available science to provide advice on appropriate catch controls. Fishing limits must be set in line with the science, as well as specific rules about use of certain fishing gears, to minimize harm to other species. Effective monitoring, control and surveillance are needed to ensure sufficient oversight of fishing vessels, and governments must have the enforcement capability and capacity necessary to deter IUU fishing and to apprehend violators.
Some nations have concerns about their ability to implement potential rules that make subsidies contingent on their management efforts, arguing that they do not have the capacity or resources to undertake full fish stock assessments or to conduct fleet monitoring and surveillance. These countries fear they could be left vulnerable to accusations that they have breached their WTO obligations.
These obstacles can be overcome. Scientists are developing new methodologies to help fishery managers assess the status of stocks with limited data, and emerging technologies make monitoring more comprehensive and affordable. This brief examines some of these tools and illustrates available options to improve the health of fisheries while ending harmful subsidies. Improving stock evaluations when data are limited
Scientists have developed innovative ways to manage fisheries sustainably even when data collection is limited. For example, managers can set fishing limits based on annual catch or landings if that is the only data available. They may be able to refine these limits using information about the biology of a fish species or expert estimates regarding its depletion. More sophisticated versions of data-limited evaluations might incorporate other information, such as fishing intensity and effort, biological sampling data or recent assessments of similar stocks. These methods may not provide the detail offered by a full stock assessment, but they can indicate when a stock is at high risk of overfishing.
Data-limited methodologies are being used all over the world, even in places with large government agencies dedicated to fishery science and management, such as the United States. In 2015, data-rich methods supported only 30 per cent of fisheries management decisions in U.S. waters; the remaining 70 per cent required use of data-limited or data-poor methodologies. 3 In the European Union, only 88 of 200 stocks were fully assessed as of 2012. That year, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea developed a data-limited methodology to provide quantitative advice on the remaining 112 stocks. 4 Tools for fisheries assessment
Fishery managers can use emerging tools to identify and apply the most appropriate data-limited assessments for their stocks.
Researchers at the University of British Columbia developed the Data-Limited Methods Toolkit (DLMtool) ( https://www.datalimitedtoolkit.org ), a software package that brings 85 different assessment methods together into one free, open-source platform. 5 The toolkit generates guidance for managers regarding catch limits and other measures that promote sustainability and keep fish populations at healthy levels. It also can help with longer-term efforts to identify priority stocks for assessment and critical data needs. Harmful subsidies typically go to large-scale industrial fleets and hurt small-scale fishers, ultimately threatening food security and negatively affecting the environment. Getty Images
The DLMtool website, which offers a demonstration and background materials, is designed to be user-friendly. Developers have provided trainings to fisheries managers around the globe, including a workshop series in collaboration with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization for managers of tuna stocks in the open ocean, the areas beyond national jurisdiction. Fisheries managers in the United States and Canada use the DLMtool to inform management decisions for some iconic and lucrative fisheries, including Atlantic mackerel, black sea bass, and yellowtail snapper, 6 despite having some of the best data collection regimes in the world for these species.
A similar initiative—the Adaptive Fisheries Assessment and Management (AFAM) Toolkit ( https://sfg-ucsb.github.io/afamGuidanceDocument )—was developed by the Sustainable Fisheries Group at the University of California, Santa Barbara; the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF); and Rare, a global conservation nonprofit. 7 The AFAM Toolkit also deploys a free, user-friendly dashboard, available online or for download. The program guides decision makers and fishing communities through the process of fishery management, from data compilation to adaptation of management based on new information and changing circumstances.
Still other tools perform similar functions: FishPath ( https://fishpath.org/Questionnaire ), developed by The Nature Conservancy, guides selection of fishery management strategies through a questionnaire that looks at the economic, ecological, governance and other characteristics of the fishery. 8 From EDF, The Framework for Integrated Stock and Habitat Evaluation (FISHE) ( http://fishe.edf.org ) from EDF guides fisheries managers through a step-by-step process towards more in-depth assessments.
Designers developed each of these tools to be used with different amounts and types of data and varying levels of technical capacity. Because they are free of charge, managers can experiment to determine which tool best suits their needs. Frontiers in fisheries monitoring
New tools and technologies have made fisheries data collection and monitoring easier and less expensive than ever before, allowing managers to more effectively regulate fishing in their waters. Here are examples of how these tools are being applied, including three efforts to improve data collection in small-scale fisheries and one to monitor large-scale vessels worldwide. Abalobi: Small-scale fishers in South Africa are using their smartphones to report catch and manage their stocks. A suite of apps called Abalobi ( http://abalobi.info/ )—which is the word for fisher in isiXhosa, one of the languages spoken in South Africa—does more than upload where, when and how a fish was caught. It also offers fishers a portal to sell their catch before returning to port; shares current market prices; allows consumers to trace fish through the supply chain; and provides data to University of Cape Town scientists, who monitor fish stocks. The app was developed as a partnership among local fishers, the University of Cape Town, the small-scale fisheries unit in the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and other funders. FAME: Futuristic Aviation and Maritime Enterprise Inc. (FAME), a company in the Philippines, has partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to equip small-scale fishers around Mindanao in the nation’s south with transmitters to track fisheries data and promote sustainability ( https://www.fameph.com/#maritime ). The devices use a mobile app interface to transmit information on catch while providing at-sea connectivity that increases fishing crew safety. The USAID Oceans and Fisheries Partnership and FAME are working to explore how this technology can benefit other fishers in Southeast Asia. OurFish: Rare, based in Arlington, Virginia, developed OurFish to help small-scale fishing communities collect and understand data on their catch and enable better management of their fisheries ( https://www.rare.org/stories/tracing-fish-and-finances ). The app, which works on Android devices, links to fisher registration cards so that catch and financial information can be connected with individual fishers in a cloud-based database. Aggregated information is then shared with the broader fishing community, including managers and researchers, so it can be used to inform the management of small-scale fisheries. As of 2018, OurFish had been deployed in Honduras, Belize, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Mozambique. Global Fishing Watch: In addition to local fisheries management, options are emerging to improve national-level marine domain awareness as well. Oceana, SkyTruth and Google established Global Fishing Watch (GFW) in 2018 to improve the transparency of fishing activity around the world ( https://globalfishingwatch.org/about-us/ ). GFW provides free access to near-real-time commercial fishing activity by large-scale vessels through data transmitted via automated identification systems, a standard safety feature on many large vessels. GFW has worked with national governments, such as Indonesia and Peru, to integrate other data into the platform to help managers better understand fishing activity in their waters. Getting support
These methods and applications are all designed to improve fisheries management while lowering costs. Still, each may require technical or financial support. Several governments, multilateral institutions and non-governmental organizations have sponsored programs to help improve fisheries management. Among those are the following: Coastal Fisheries Initiative is a partnership of six organizations (Conservation International, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Environment, the World Bank and the World Wildlife Federation) based around regionally focused capacity-building projects in Latin America, West Africa and Indonesia. The initiative incorporates an on-demand funding mechanism known as the Challenge Fund to mobilize private financing for sustainable management as well as a global knowledge-sharing platform. PROBLUE is a recently established trust fund, based at the World Bank, to support healthy and productive oceans, including effective fisheries management. Since September 2018, more than $100 million has been committed by donors such as Norway, Canada, Iceland, Germany, Sweden, Portugal, Denmark, France and the European Union. The Seafood Alliance for Legality and Traceability (SALT) is a global alliance for knowledge exchange and action to promote legal and sustainable fisheries through improved seafood supply chain transparency. FishWise, a nonprofit sustainable seafood consultancy based in Santa Cruz, California, is implementing the public-private partnership between USAID and the Walton Family, Packard and Moore Foundations. The Sustainable Ocean Fund , based at Athelia Funds, an investment management company in London, provides private debt investments in sustainable fisheries, supply chain improvement and marine conservation. The European Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank have provided capital, while Conservation International and EDF have offered technical expertise and project oversight. USAID has provided a $50 million loan guarantee for the fund’s work. F ish for Development was established by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation and is responsible for coordinating all development projects in fisheries and aquaculture supported by Norway. Under the program—which has focused on fisheries resources management, legislation, and illegal fishing and fisheries-related crime—Norwegian scientists and managers have provided trainings to counterparts around the world. PESCAO is a European Union-funded project to strengthen capacities for regional coordination in combating illegal fishing in West Africa. The EU has provided technical experts from the European Fisheries Control Agency to improve regional cooperation, and the project members have engaged in joint surveillance operations to identify and deter illegal fishing. Conclusion
Programs such as those highlighted in this brief can help fishing nations, especially those with limited resources, better manage their fisheries and uphold any future WTO obligations on fisheries subsidies. All nations’ fisheries benefit from eliminating subsidies that allow fishers to travel farther, for longer time periods, bringing in catches that are not sustainable over the long term.

That might be difficult to read on this page, but here are some excerpts:
A laser tag place opened geared toward teenagers and it got no business, we tried to enjoy it but when someone pointed a laser machine gun at me and I instinctively dropped behind the nearest wall and reached to turn off my phone and I cried, I wasn’t the only one.
…
Everyone cries during drills, even the toughest ranch kids. Every drill comes with a full day of teachers crying and telling us that they love us all so much and would die for us, and every kid in every class looking around wondering who would I die for? Who would die for me?
…
School shootings control us more than adults and non-Americans could possibly imagine and nobody moves to change anything unless we’re actively screaming for it. Have you considered we’re too scared?
Note the caveat: “even though they weren’t at your school?” We are traumatizing an entire generation of school children so that rural & suburban white guys don't have to give up their hobby. https://t.co/fKQCRNgpGB

First, a lot of urban black men also have made it a “hobby” to carry guns — maybe you’ve heard of Baltimore or Chicago or Detroit?
And second, he’s half-right: We are traumatizing an entire generation of school children. Ars Technica founder John Stokes had a thing or two to say about that: The original quote describes a scene that is totally unnecessary & infuriating. The ppl responsible for these drills, & the ppl like Roberts who act as if they're necessary because guns, are as innumerate and scientifically illiterate as the worst anti-vaxxers. https://t.co/yqIgVhF2nq
— Jon Stokes (@jonst0kes) April 6, 2019 There are over 100 million school kids in school in any given day. Actual active shooter incidents at school are passing rare. The kids are statistically in more danger in the car on the way to school than they are at school.

“It’s increasingly common for schools to imitate an actual shooting, even though American schools are as safe as they’ve ever been,” Vox reports. So no, @drvox , we are not traumatizing these kids because white guys like me ""don't have to give up their hobby."" We're traumatizing them because people like you can't count.

— Jon Stokes (@jonst0kes) April 6, 2019
Instead of looking at something like Parkland as the tragic outlier that it was, school administrators now assume every “suburban white guy” with a legally owned firearm is going to snap and shoot up a school. Might that have something to do with CNN whipping together a show trial just a week after a shooting and keeping it in the headlines for a year?
Maybe — just maybe — cool it with the active shooter drills and put the adults in charge of keeping schools safe on notice to do their jobs? As in, make the school feel like the safe place that it most probably is?

Plus the world powers told Israel and India that if they ever used those nuclear weapons they would cease to exist as a nation after the world got done with them. That threat just would not work with the insane Islamic countries. All they know is Allahu Akbar!"

WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump predicted a close race in Israel's elections and called both of the candidates ""good people,"" in a keynote speech at RJC's conference in Las Vegas on Saturday.The president made a brief comment on the upcoming elections, asking the crowd: ""How is the race going? Who's going to win the race?"" The audience yelled back ""Bibi,"" referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to which Trump, in a diplomatic answer, responded: ""I think it's going to be close. Two good people.""Trump thanked US Special Envoy to the Middle East Jason Greenblatt and ""a young man named Jared Kushner"" for their efforts to promote the peace process, assuring the audience, ""Peace in the Middle East: If they can't do it, nobody can.""At the beginning of his speech, a few protesters interrupted with chants: ""Jews are here to stay! Occupation is a plague!""The majority of the crowd replied with ""USA"" chants, and the president responded: ""He's going back to Mommy, he will be reprimanded.""When Trump mentioned his decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran, he referred to the protester: ""Maybe you explain for the young man what does it mean when a country shouts as they're signing the deal 'Death to Israel,' maybe you could explain that to him.""""We've now imposed the toughest-ever sanctions on the Iranian dictatorship, and it is not the same country,"" the president continued. ""Today folks, they have riots in the streets. They have very little money coming in. A lot of things have changed."" Trump also ""thanked"" Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, but then apologized: ""I forgot that she doesn't like Israel.""Speaking about past tensions between former president Barack Obama administration to Netanyahu's government, the president told the audience: ""Three years ago, US-Israel relations were probably in the lowest point. How the hell did you support president Obama? Now, three years later I am standing before you here as the president to report a very different situation. The incredible bond between the US and Israel has never been stronger than it is right now.""He mentioned his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, telling the audience: ""We got you something that you wanted."" He mentioned Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, who were sitting in the crowd, and added: ""I could tell you, Sheldon and Miriam, that is the most important thing. They love Israel.""Before the announcement on Jerusalem, the president said, his phone was ""ringing off the hook."" He told the crowd he received calls from ""presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, everybody,"" but didn't take the calls because he wanted to avoid the conversation before he made an official announcement. Speaking about his decision to recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights, Trump said he supported the move after a briefing on the strategic value of the area. ""I agree. You need it,"" he said. ""You need the height. You need the height."" ""Israel security - really so important to talk about security - it's always number one for me. They'd been trying to get that approved. As you know, for 52 years they wanted recognition from the United States on the Golan Heights."" He mentioned the relatively quiet response from the international community, and said: ""It was a big, big story for two days. Everyone's happy. No repercussions. No. And there won't be. I went there to protect Israel. We did the right thing. We did the right thing, and I want to congratulate Jared and Jason Greenblatt and [US Ambassador] David Friedman and all of the people they work with. ""And a big thing for me, and some of you won't like this maybe, but I would love to see peace in the Middle East. I would love to see peace in the Middle East. If those three can't do it, you'll never have it done.""

Of the 22 members of the Arab League, only 13 came to the yearly meeting of the organization in Tunis on March 30. Conspicuous by their absence were Sudanese President Omar el Bashir and Algerian President Abdel Aziz Bouteflika, both facing unrest at home. However, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi were there to give some luster to an otherwise dull reunion dwarfed by conflicts in the Arab world.In principle, all Arab states are members of the Arab League, created in 1945 by the British with a view to perpetuating their control of these states and their influence in the region under the guise of helping them develop their economies. Today Great Britain’s influence has waned. Arab countries did not find their way to democracy and the Middle East descended into military regimes and fratricide wars. There was no attempt to tackle problems or to establish a desperately needed economic collaboration. The much-touted union never coalesced and was further disrupted by the 2011 Arab Spring, which fizzled into civil wars in Syria, Libya and Yemen and a military regime in Egypt. Yearly Heads of States summits became less and less relevant, a mere occasion for discreet exchanges of views with occasional flare-ups, such as Saudi king Abdallah and Libyan president Muhammar Khadafi trading insults in 2009. Each summit ended in a joint declaration on current issues, usually carefully crafted compromises offending no one and lacking operative decisions.US President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty on the Golan, published a scant few days before the summit, shows what little regard he has for the meeting of Arab heads of state.IN TUNIS, Arab leaders once again demonstrated that their national interests take precedence over unity or addressing burning issues. The Emir of Qatar, embroiled in a conflict with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, surprised everyone by coming, but left without making his scheduled speech at the opening session, apparently in protest after the League Secretary General condemned explicitly Iran and Turkey’s intervention in Arab countries, and went on mentioning and condemning the security zone that Turkey wants to establish in Syria along its border with that country. The Emir, who unlike most Arab countries, is a close ally of Turkey and enjoys good relations with Iran, took it as a personal insult.As to the Saudi King, he made a point of leaving the assembly before the speeches of UN secretary Antonio Gutierrez and EU foreign minister Federica Mogherini, who were going to point out the responsibility of his kingdom and of the Emirates for the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.The summit was over in a matter of hours. Most heads of states had waited until the morning to arrive, fearing that a sudden crisis would prevent their coming, but the Saudi King, though well aware of the risks, came to the Tunisian capital two days early for a state visit, taking the opportunity to review the meeting’s agenda with the Tunisian president to ensure that his country’s interests would not be harmed. He may also have helped persuade the Egyptian president to attend in spite of his fear of demonstrations against him by human rights organizations. Abdel Fattah al Sisi did come and spoke of the need to unite in the fight against terror. The King of Morocco decided to stay at home because of the crisis between his country and Saudi Arabia since his decision to leave the Saudi-led Arab coalition against Yemen; furthermore, Riyadh had publicly condemned Morocco’s stand on Western Sahara. None of these subjects were discussed; the conflict between Qatar and Saudi Arabia was not on the agenda; nor was the re-admission of Syria, whose membership had been frozen following the civil war. Its seat remained empty. THE TRADITIONAL final declaration was comprised of 19 articles, starting with a lengthy condemnation of Israel’s many crimes as well as a rebuke to the United States; the recognition of Israeli sovereignty on the Golan forcefully condemned and declared null and void. The centrality of the Palestinian problem for the Arab nation was emphasized; so was achieving regional peace, presented as a strategic Arab goal, on the basis of the Arab/Saudi initiative, including the creation of an independent Palestinian state within the pre-1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israeli steps in the West Bank were also declared null and void, especially measures taken to “Judaize” East Jerusalem and deny its “Arabic identity,” including on the Temple Mount and recent clashes at Gate of Mercy. Recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel by America was roundly denounced.Altogether, the lengthy developments on the Palestinian issue appeared to have been intended to counter commentaries in Israel and in the West, to the effect that it has lost its centrality in the Arab world – while letting leaders concentrate on their problems at home in the aftermath of the 2011 revolts.Iran took second place to the Palestinian issue and was accused of meddling in the internal affairs of Arab states and endangering them; of religious incitement of Shia against Sunni Muslims; of arming militias and de facto terror organizations active in a number of Arab countries. All activities, according the final declaration, contrary to good neighborhood and international law; it is demanded of Iran that it withdraws its militias. There is also a special condemnation for the firing of missiles manufactured by Iran on Saudi Arabia (a reference to missiles fired by Houthis).Then there are articles devoted to other matters: the three Gulf islands belonging to the Emirates taken over by Iran; the need to find a solution for Libya and Syria; to preserve the integrity of Iraq, where large tracks of its northern region were conquered by Turkey. Concern was also expressed for the integrity of Lebanon, since the Shebaa Farms area is still held by Israel. Somalia, a failed state, is mentioned as well.Emphasis was put on the fact that Islam is a religion of peace that should not be associated with terror. As for economic cooperation between the states, an important element in past summits, it got only a brief mention this time, with no attempt to advance this complex issue.Altogether, the final declaration was nothing but a short catalogue of some of the issues Arab countries are dealing with, with no effort to deal with them.One is left wondering how to interpret the harsh condemnations of Israel and the lengthy considerations on the Palestinian conflict in view of the fact that Israel has relations at various levels with most Arab countries: peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, close security relations with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, visits of sport delegations and ministers in Abu Dhabi; visit of the Israeli prime minister in Oman; tourist links with Morocco and Tunisia. Isn’t time for a reevaluation of the relationship between Israel and Arab states?The Emirates foreign minister dared raise the subject in his interview to the Gulf News Agency two days before the summit – but no other statesman took up the gauntlet.All participants hastened to go back to their countries. Arab media mentioned the summit briefly on the day it happened – and the following day it was as if it had not taken place. The distinguished members had not even been able to fix a date and a place for their next yearly meeting.

The people and the U.S. are with the Golan - Opinion - Jerusalem Post,www.jpost.com,Gal Perl Finkel,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/The-people-and-the-US-are-with-the-Golan-585968,"The people and the U.S. are with the Golan During the tour in the North, the four referred to threats by Hezbollah and Syria. CLOUDS OVER a village on the Golan Heights. (photo credit: REUTERS)
Recently, Hezbollah leader Sheikh Nasrallah delivered a speech in which he responded to US President Donald Trump’s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. “The only option for the Syrians to return the Golan Heights, and the Lebanese to return the Shebaa Farms and Ghajar, and the only option for the Palestinians to accept their legitimate rights is resistance, resistance and resistance,” Nasrallah said.Beyond the border, in Syria and Lebanon, it is hard to believe that there will be tolerance for international recognition of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the Six-Day War (and managed to keep in its hands in 1973 and thereafter) as an Israeli sovereign territory. This could constitute a precedent for the possibility that additional areas will be recognized as such. Given that Hezbollah and other Shiite militias have established an operational infrastructure on the Syrian side of the border, as the IDF revealed last month (in a cognitive operation), Nasrallah’s declaration is a clear threat.Last month, leaders of the Blue and White Party visited the northern part of Israel. Even though the four, Benny Gantz, Moshe Ya’alon, Gabi Ashkenazi and Yair Lapid were mainly focused in trying to recruit votes and supporters, its likely that the north is connected mainly to their experiences from the military service. The former chiefs of staff fought for many years across the border, some against the Syrians, all of them in Lebanon, in the raids of the Paratroopers (Ya’alon and Gantz) and Golani (Ashkenazi) brigades, and operations. Even Lapid, who was a military correspondent in Bamahane, spent (though not as a fighter) a considerable amount of time in his service in the outposts in Lebanon.During the tour in the North, the four referred to threats by Hezbollah and Syria. In his press conference, Ganz stressed that there is an “Iranian front that sits on the border of the State of Israel, and we will know how to deal with any threat in any arena, as much as necessary.” Lapid, for his part, pledged on behalf of the four, “We will never return the Golan Heights.”The person who took care of Lapid’s commitment was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who in the past was among those who negotiated with the Syrians, in which he was asked to give up control of the Golan Heights. During Netanyahu’s visit to Washington last week, President Trump signed a presidential proclamation recognizing the Golan Heights as part of the State of Israel. For Netanyahu, too, the North is connected to his personal military service as a soldier and commander in the Sayeret Matkal IDF elite unit. IN HIS book Autobiography, Maj.-Gen. (Ret.) Giora Eiland referred to the negotiations that Prime Minister Ehud Barak held in 1999 with then-Syrian president Hafez al-Assad and argued that Israel should not agree to a peace arrangement with Syria in which it relinquishes its control over the Golan Heights. Eiland, who like Gantz, Ya’alon and Ashkenazi, participated in raids in Lebanon (in one of them, as a paratrooper battalion commander, he took with him a stubborn platoon leader named Ofer Shelah, now number eight in Blue and White’s list), admitted that he had formulated his insights after his retirement. He noted that he had hoped that the negotiations between Israel and Syria would not grow into a peace agreement in which Israel would relinquish the territory.In his view, Prime Minister Barak relied on wrong assumptions. First, if the Syrian army moved forces to the Golan Heights, Israel would know about this in real time, which is not necessarily true. Second, it is not at all certain that Israel would understand and correctly interpret the movement of Syrian forces aimed toward war (in 1973, for example, Israel did not understand this). Third, because of the time required for such a decision, the Syrians would be the first to arrive to the battlefield and gain the upper hand.Another assumption is that an international monitoring mechanism that would enforce the agreement might indeed monitor tanks and cannons, but it would be less effective in detecting sophisticated surface-to-surface missiles with long range and accuracy, and anti-tank missiles, which are relatively easy to conceal but whose impact on the battle is significant.It is hard to counter Eiland’s arguments – and since the outbreak of the civil war in Syria that undermined the stability of Bashar Assad’s regime, it became clear that other troubling scenarios might also materialize. Iran was allowed to establish military infrastructures in Syria and to act against Israel, which for its part is conducting a long and largely secret campaign to prevent it. As part of that campaign, according to foreign publications, the IAF recently attacked Iranian weapons depots near Aleppo WHY DO we need all this noise now? The Golan has been under Israeli control for more than 50 years and no state entity can take control of it without Israeli consent. Moreover, Trump’s statement, which appears to be a finger in the eye of the international community, has only motivated Western Europe, Russia, the Arab countries, Iran and Syria to act against it. The Syrians and their allies from Iran may also decide to “use terror and guerrilla attacks” from the Syrian side of the border, just as Nasrallah declared in his speech.In the eyes of Israeli prime ministers, only one member of the international community is a heavyweight – the United States. This perception has not changed, and with good reason. American backing, even now, is a powerful credit. In an article on the subject in Israel Hayom, Maj.-Gen. (Ret.) Israel Ziv, who like Eiland served as a paratrooper officer and as the head of the Agaf HaMivtza’im (Operations Directorate), wrote that “Israel will be required to conduct an uncompromising legitimization battle, while increasing efforts to prevent Iranian entrenchment on the other side of the border. The American declaration on the Golan Heights will no doubt help these efforts.”Recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan is important, but the way it was done – not through the UN Security Council and without the broad consensus of the international community – is damaging. It is not certain that the tacit agreement to Israeli control over the Golan Heights, which was the American policy until now, would not have been more effective at this time.The writer is founder and operator of the blog “In the Crosshairs” on military, security, strategy vision and practice.

This provocation is harmful to Israeli, Palestinian, and American interests. Supporting Israel does not have to mean agreeing with Netanyahu‘s politics. I don’t.
