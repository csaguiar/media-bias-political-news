The Great Barrier Reef in Qld is unfortunate to be in a Labor state where land clearing is allowed at ludicrous rates and where the ALP pushed for mines like Adani. The federal Labor had opportunities to stop Adani when Qld Labor first initiated it. But no that now apparently is all the LNPs fault.

Recent droughts and floods are a foretaste but it will mean the death of entire ecosystems, failure of agriculture on a world-starving scale, populations of billions migrating to avoid starvation or the drowning of their homes thorugh rising sea levels. Worrying about slowing economic growth by a percent or so is nothing to the cost of not fixing it.
All sorts of worrying indications are happening already. Things that seem trivial but are actually momentous, such as the massive dying out of insect populations, which will affect pollination of plants including food crops. Oceans are getting warmer and more acidic which not only affects things like the reef but will also massively affect the available fish stocks.
Then there are irreversible events such as the explosions of methane out of thawing permafrost which will acelerate the process, thawing of polar and glacial ice that has taken many millenia to build up and so on.
No arguing about petty things like the price of regulating carbon emissions, however it is done, or the cost of transitioning to electric and hydrogen powered vehicles is ridiculous in the face of the cost of not doing all of these things."

I guess the other force here are the voters, and it is still surprising that in any sample of newspaper readers comments, there are still many people, despite the polls, that continue think anthropogenic climate change is fake. Hard to believe but true, and it is not just fossil fuel industry shills. I saw one yesterday where the writer who seemed to think he was clever, still said: ""if they can't predict the weather, they must be joking with climate change."" Hard to believe but true. Someone who sees themselves as an expert but unable to understand the basic difference between climate and the evidence collected so far, and weather prediction.
As we saw in 2013, after the carbon tax was introduced it only took Abbott to say that everyone would be around $600 worse off and Joyce to talk about $100 roasts and it got both of them elected.
No doubt 6 years later more evidence has actually been experienced by Australians with heatwaves, widespread record temperatures, persistent drought, monumental floods and extreme and unstable weather events, and the GBR bleaching, but I'm still not certain at what point voters would do anything to mitigate climate change if it costs them a dollar, or they accept the continued fear campaigns from Morrison that it will.
As we get further away from this last Summer when everyone sweltered, the strength of voters concern for climate change will also diminish. I think we are on the cusp of change and I remain positive, but this change is new found.
So often voters are not seen as part of the problem, only governments, but the facts are that if everyone was really genuine about affecting action on environment and CO2 emissions, then The Greens would be attracting a far greater slice of the vote, and not 10-13%.
In my opinion Labor are offering far more than the Liberals who offer only more exploitation of fossil fuel resources and even nuclear. The latter is now clearly on the IPA's list of directives for the government. No doubt the Greens have always had the most genuine and effective policies around on action on climate change, but no government is going to get elected unless they have Australian voters on board, and they are still difficult to gauge with any surety on climate action."

"Australian election: Shorten focuses on Easter pay hits, Morrison on healthcare | Australia news | The Guardian",www.theguardian.com,Luke Henriques-Gomes,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/20/australian-election-shorten-focuses-on-easter-pay-hits-morrison-on-healthcare,"Labor leader says low-paid workers are losing hundreds in penalty rates during the 10 days from good Friday. Bill Shorten has used the Easter public holidays to highlight that low-paid workers are losing hundreds of dollars from cuts to penalty rates, and that they will face further hits to their income if the Coalition is re-elected.
As both leaders hit the trail again on Saturday after the Good Friday break, Labor focussed on the penalty rates debate while the Coalition was set to announce $100m to fund clinical trials in remote and regional areas.
The Labor leader took his federal election campaign to St Kilda on Saturday, speaking to Luna Park workers before they opened the gates to the amusement park.
In his industrial relations rallying cry to the dozen employees, Shorten acknowledged the fact that their bosses and union had agreed to preserve public holiday rates.
“But hundreds of thousands of people have had their penalty rates cut,” he told the workers.
“Everything is going up in Australia except people’s wages, and the rot stops when we reverse the cuts to penalty rates,” Shorten said.
Labor released estimates on Saturday showing that workers in the the retail, fast food, hospitality and pharmacy industries would lose between $220 and $360 in the 10 days from Good Friday.
Shorten has promised to reverse the Fair Work Commission (FWC) decision on penalty rates. The FWC reduced public holiday penalties for retail and hospitality workers from double-time and one-half to double-time and one-quarter.

Because the changes have been staggered by the commission, with additional changes set for July this year and next in some industries, Labor argued that further wage cuts are coming under the Coalition.
“When everything is going up except people’s wages, the last thing that workers need is another cut to their take-home pay packet,” Shorten said on Saturday.
“Our position is not taken lightly. We respect the independent umpire, but they got this one wrong,” he said.
The Coalition has said it respects the decision of the FWC and has accused Labor of interfering with its independence by legislating to reverse the decision.
Morrison started the day in Sydney, zeroing in on and health, and will announce a $100m package to fund clinical trials for medicines and treatment in rural and remote Australia and $65m to help researchers find a cure for cystic fibrosis.
“Rural patients with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses often have it twice as hard, spending much of their life on the road to get the treatment they need and deserve,” he said.
“This funding brings the trials to them but it also means more time can be spent at home with loved ones.”
Morrison’s campaigning on health follows Labor’s announcement last week about cutting healthcare costs for cancer patients. After stumbles over superannuation and climate change, the opposition leader is now looking to reset the ledger with a focus on industrial relations, widely considered a key Labor strength.

Labor figures show the cuts to penalty rates would cost fast food workers $220 over the Easter holidays, while hospitality workers would face a $280 hit to their pay. For retail, there was a $276 cut and pharmacy workers stood to lose almost $370.
The opposition has promised to reverse the cuts within 100 days if it wins the 18 May election and says it will legislate so penalties “can’t be cut for anyone again”. The Australian reported on Saturday that Labor would seek to pass its legislation before 30 June so it can deal with the existing Senate .
Shorten spent Good Friday serving the homeless at a soup kitchen in Melbourne, after he and Morrison agreed not to campaign, out of respect for the holy day.
The pair are hitting the campaign trail today, before taking a break again on Easter Sunday.

Lets see: Open borders, quadrupling debt, Manus and Nauru, a carbon tax, an actual cut to health spending (the only government to cut spending in the last 40 years).
I live the way Shorten has trained for the last 3 years; he's got so good and probably more importantly showed that if he doesn't want to answer a question he will steam roll the questioner.
What we can expect from Bills entourage :
Kristina Keneally -got caught out lying during the Bennelong by election and was in charge during the Obeid and MacDonald saga.
Chris Bowen the treasurer heir apparent who keeps fluffing his lines and always looked like a rabbit in the headlights everytime he announced another boat arrival or yet another budget deficit.
Penny Wong, what has she done but block everything and everything. A CFMEU cronny who has never said anything against the illegal work of the Union.
It is incredible how the ALP voted against SSM (2013) and then blocked the plebiscite the LNP took to an election, however tried to claim victory for the legislation.
Bill Shorten and Labor have put forward nothing new, they have a history of promising everything from bigger surpluses, bigger tax cuts, more spending in health and education and company tax cuts. In the end they do nothing but add more deficit and leave behind a disaster of more debt.
Obviously the MSM forgot all the mistakes Shorten made last week from electric car recharging to his own superannuation policies. But then that goes against the narrative of telling the truth and being seen as anti Labor.
The idea that Bill is preaching at town hall rallies is flawed as he is preaching to the converted.
As we saw in the byelections brought about when the ALP pushed so hard against the coalition on the citizenship debacle, where the ALP was beyond reproach another dose of Labor lies.
The by elections were interesting in so far as the ALP lost ground in New England and Wentworth(although the LNP did take a 20% swing, Labor took a 9% sing) couldn't win in Bennelong, and then held seats the LNP didn't contest.
No doubt people have already made up their minds so it will be interesting to see if all the pundits and pollsters have got it right. If the Essential poll could get the NSW result so wrong anything is possible."

Is he a late arrival who hasn't got the memo that the Kill Bill campaign didn't work and is over and done with. Nor does he seem to realise that with regard to climate change action, the Australian voting public are so concerned now that they might just be prepared to pay the cost of an effective policy and plan of action - even if they don't really understand how carbon credits work."

He also didn't/doesn't resort to lying, kicking his opponents when they are down, smearing his opponents for some cheap political points as his predecessors (and continued by Morrison).
Bill Shorten has led a united team for over 5 years, has announced more costed policies than any previous opposition, and doesn't resort to stunts, as if running the country was some sort of popularity contest.
What Shorten DOESN'T have, is the luxury of an unbiased media. Even since he was made LOTO, the media has been hell-bent on painting him in the worst possible light, with Labor's policies forensically examined/denounced as if they were some kind of dire threat to this country's future. Nothing could be further from the truth.
And since Shorten dared to snub Rupert Murdoch, who has been gifted FAR too much control of our media by successive Coalition governments, the negativity has ramped up.
But Shorten's not foolish enough to wait until after Easter/Anzac Day to muscle up. It's been very much in evidence during his last couple of media conferences. And judging by Shorten's performances on the floor of the House, he'll have it all over Morrison, whether it be his repetitive scare campaign, his tedious answers stacked with 'facts and figures' which never stack up under scrutiny, or playing 'Mr Blokey Bloke' at the footy, or at the pub!

They are in power simply to foster and protect WEALTH AND PRIVILEGE.
Of ordinary Australians, they know little and care even less.
1. In 2008, VicRoads compulsorily acquired from Scotch College a sliver of its land, 2.8m wide and 400m long, as CityLink road-widening.
The State's Valuer-General valued the land at $1.06m.
The Brumby Labor govt offered Scotch this amount, along with a yearly fee of $86,400 for occupation of other school land during construction.
Scotch College refused both offers, taking action in the Supreme Court.
Nothing more was heard of the case.
Then a report in The Age of Nov 17, 2014 revealed that in Oct 2013, the Napthine Liberal govt, after an approach from Scotch old boy and IPA/Liberal Party Big Knob David Kemp, had settled with his school for a whopping $5.4m of Victorian taxpayer's money.
2. In July 2012, Matthew Guy, then Planning Minister in the Napthine govt, rezoned 250 hectares of low-rise industrial South Melbourne and Port Melbourne, effectively doubling Melbourne's CBD.
Land values soared, some as high as 500%.
In a staggering coincidence, it turns out the main financial beneficiaries of the rezoning were Liberal Party affiliates and big donors.
So that's how it works.

The Daily Telegraph is prepared to run at a financial loss as it gives its pro L/NP propaganda rags away for free, and dumps them on people's front lawns without the courtesy of asking for permission to do so.
Sometimes the ABC chips in with a snide fake news comment or two to help Morrison. For instance, this morning one of the ABC 24 hosts opined that both sides of politics are as bad as one another when it comes to spending on health. Now we all know that he was engaging in fake news. Another ABC chucklehead opined that the Coalition have always been better economic managers. Again repeating another well worn and false L/NP mantra.
I also watch for the optics of the contenders. On Thursday night Morrison was in a Western Sydney stadium when his team won. Like some football hooligan he went over the top in jumping up and cheering his victorious team in front of many spectators who were supporting the losing team. One would have expected him to be more gracious in victory given the massive audience he had. I reckon he lost a lot of votes right there and then."

"Chris Lilley's Lunatics review: unfunny, boring and problematic | Television & radio | The Guardian",www.theguardian.com,Luke Buckmaster,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/20/chris-lilleys-lunatics-review-unfunny-boring-and-utterly-unrelenting,"It’s a disaster from the director, whose painful shtick remains as juvenile as ever. T he comedian Hannah Gadsby discussed the pathetic contrarianism of Barry Humphries in a 2018 tweet , commenting that the veteran joke-maker and professional buffoon “has completely lost the ability to read the room”.
If Humphries can no longer read the room, what do we make of Chris Lilley ? Perhaps the only way of rationalising the controversial comedian’s shtick is to assume that he cannot read full stop. Can’t read a room, can’t read a book, can’t read a giant billboard spelling out that people no longer consider the comedy he trades in to be funny anymore: a relic from an older, more primitive time.
And when I say “older” and “more primitive” – cripes, it’s strange to think how recent much of this stuff is. A lot has been written about S.mouse, the African American rapper Lilley played in blackface in 2011’s Angry Boys, and Jonah from Tonga, the potty-mouthed miscreant he played in brownface, most recently in ABC TV’s 2014 series .
But not many people seem to remember what went down at the 2006 Logies: the kind of cringe-inducing incident that feels like it could only have transpired centuries ago. Lilley unveiled a matryoshka doll of racist stunts. He performed a musical number called “Indigeridoo” in character as the Chinese-Australian Ricky Wong (yellowface), who was impersonating an Indigenous Australian in traditional garb (full body blackface). The lyrics included “Aborigine me / Aborigine you / We’re not just the people who eat kangaroo.”
Jonah from Tonga was withdrawn for good reason: it’s Chris Lilley’s satire at its worst | Morgan Godfery Read more
Just when it appeared no TV network in Australia would work with him again, along came Netflix (talk about not reading the room) with a new 10 part series created, written, starring, co-produced and entirely directed by Lilley. There are no brown, black or yellow faces in Lunatics, despite a trailer appearing to show the comedian in brownface (this character, the “pet psychic” Jana Melhoopen-Jonks, as it turns out, is a white South African with a tan).
That is, as they say, progress of a kind. But one of the underlying problems in Lilley’s humour still remains: he continues to punch down, making fun of people who have not been afforded the same privileges as he. There’s also the fact that his now very familiar shtick hasn’t matured since his breakthrough in 2005’s We Could Be Heroes. In fact it’s more juvenile than ever.

One the characters Lilley plays in Lunatics is Keith Dick, a fashionista working in a cut-rate clothes store in Canberra who, like the drama teacher Mr G in Summer Heights High, has delusions of grandeur. His big moment arrives in episode four, when he renames the store “My Dick,” so Lilley can deliver dialogue such as “today is the grand opening of My Dick”.
Gavin McGregor is an obese 12-year-old bully who Lilley plays in a fat suit. In the first episode he pelts fruit at a school girl, telling her to “come here if you want a berry up your vagina”. Then there’s Quentin Cook, a vain realtor with a huge bottom. He is over the moon when he manages to urinate in his own mouth in episode three, and late in the series (this review encompasses all 10 godforsaken episodes) launches a musical career as “DJ Cunt”.
Continuing the horror show, Becky Douglas is a dorky, 7 foot 3 inches tall (Lilley must have been on stilts) college student teased by her freshman peers. Joyce Jefferies (are we done yet?) is an ageing former porn star. Then there’s Jana the pet psychic, who Lilley uses to ridicule the transgender community (she is convinced that her female dog wants to be male and sends her off to have a sex change operation).

A fat suit? Stilts? A fake butt? Lilley seems more desperate than ever. His approach has never felt as laboured, or as formulaic, or as devoid of ideas. The thoughtless faux documentary / faux reality TV structure of the show means nothing in Lunatics is remotely interesting on a visual level. The dialogue feels improvised in the worst possible way – with no wit, no flair, no pulse. As for the story: there is none, really, just a series of vaguely connected vignettes with no beginning, no end, and very little sense of progress.
One might like to think that, through characters such as Ja’mie King, Lilley is lampooning society – in the case of his famous bitchy private school student, sending up a world that rewards ignorance, grotesque narcissism and the shameless pursuit of self-interest. His point-and-laugh body of work makes it clear however that he has no point; no ideological purpose; no motivation beyond the crudest of pantomime. He ridicules everybody, including (sometimes especially) the downtrodden.
Lunatics is a disaster: not just unfunny and problematic, but boring and utterly unrelenting: a parade of annoying characters doing meaningless and gratuitous things. Lilley’s career lives to die another day – but if he continues to exhibit no desire to evolve his shtick, his days, surely, are numbered.

I've sometimes managed it for a few months in a row and always feel better for when I get in the groove. But mainly I've just struggled over several decades to do it consistently and I've lived with a consequent background feeling of failing a lot of the time. Its the same with regular exercise. And then recently a friend (wise) advised me to let it all go. He Quote: d the first few lines of Mary Oliver's Wild Geese poem to me, which helped .... a bit.
You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.

When I worked for a living, I was very (too) conscientious and drove myself hard to meet the needs of a business. Like some others here, I seem to respond with alacrity to externally set demands. When it comes to self motivated discipline, I'm finally coming to the conclusion I'm just a bit lazy and like taking it easy. Aaaahhh"

It’s absolutely ridiculous that there is still a stigma attached to it. It should be as common and without stigma as the MMR vaccine.
It should also be given free to boys and men.
About one in three cancers caused by HPV is in a man and men are four times more likely to have an oral cancer caused by HPV than women.
It took the threat of a lawsuit where I live before government provided it to boys.
It’s just plan sexist not to give it to boys."

I do wish you would try not to feel shame or even anger about this. HPV viruses are almost like the common cold, they are everywhere. 30% of the UK population tests positive for it, and 90% will run across it in their lifetimes (some people do not become infected).
https://www.analcancerfoundation.org/about-hpv/hpv-facts-and-figures /
Would you feel them same about a cold sore that you had near your mouth? It is all the same family of virus.
You probably can't know where you got the virus. It could have been from your husband via his mistress or a liaison he had before you were married. It could have been from either of your previous partners. It is remotely possible that you got this in a health office.
It was a wonderful day when scientists discovered that some strains of HPV cause cervical cancers, and a host of others in men and women as well. That allowed them to develop vaccines, that if given to kids before they become sexually active give them a pretty good chance of avoiding the disease and avoiding the cancers that it can cause.
It is possible to eradicate cervical cancer which has destroyed and ended so many women's lives by having all girls vaccinated.
Boys should be as well. Women give the virus to men too (men are not the 'carriers'), and boys can develop horrible cancers that will kill them as well.
As the pool of vaccinated women grows the chance of a boy contracting and spreading the disease will lessen.
This will not work for men who have sex with other men of course. That is why all boys, as well as all the girls, should receive this vaccine as well.
This vaccine is a life saver that millions of women and men would have prayed for in times gone past.
Some parents are refusing to protect their children because they think it will encourage them to have sex. This is nuts of of course.
My best wishes to you. You may never develop a cancer, and it sounds like you are in a good screening program.
The whole thing has been very embarrassing. I’ve felt judged – even by the doctors and nurses who’ve treated me – and too ashamed to tell friends. I don’t feel sexual or sexy; I feel ugly – and stupid for never having heard about HPV before this.
You needn't be embarrassed, and that any health professional made you feel that way is horrible. You are still the same woman you were before you knew you had contracted a contagious disease, just as beautiful and just as sexy. Why should you be embarrased?
I hope you will talk to someone about this. There are groups for people who are HPV + where you could talk about some of the practical things and some of the emotional things."

It is quite possible for a person to be HPV+ and be asymptomatic. A lot of men are.
This is a communicable disease like any other. Because it is sexually transmissible everyone gets all hot and bothered, particularly parents who don't get their kids vaccinated, and people, like yourself who have feelings about how partners should treat each other.
I am completely sympathetic to your bad feelings about men who cheat on their wives, and by the by may give them an STD. Don't let it make you mean here though."
