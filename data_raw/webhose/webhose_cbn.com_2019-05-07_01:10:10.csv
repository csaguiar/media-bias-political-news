Kushner: Israeli-Palestinian Peace Plan Will Be Revealed After Ramadan,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/kushner-israeli-palestinian-peace-plan-will-be-revealed-after-ramadan,"White House senior adviser Jared Kushner told a group of ambassadors Wednesday that President Donald Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan will be unveiled sometime after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends June 5.
By that time, Israel's newly appointed government should be established and sworn in.
Reuters reports that Kushner told the diplomats to keep an ""open mind"" about the proposal.
""We will all have to look for reasonable compromises that will make peace achievable,"" Kushner said, according to a source close to Reuters.
Kushner also reportedly said the deal will require compromises on both sides but won't jeopardize Israel's security.

Not much is known about the proposal but Palestinian leaders have already rejected it.
New Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told The Associated Press Tuesday the plan will be ""born dead.""
""There are no partners in Palestine for Trump. There are no Arab partners for Trump and there are no European partners for Trump,"" Shtayyeh said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN's Jake Tapper last Friday that the peace plan will ""represent a significant change from the model that's been used.""
Pompeo also refused to publicly endorse the two-state solution, which guarantees a state for Israelis and another state for Palestinians.
""I would argue that millions of man-hours have been spent to try and build out a two-state solution. It hasn't worked to date,"" he said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week.
Meanwhile, an American Evangelical leader and Israeli settler leader are urging President Donald Trump not to give up Jewish land for peace in his upcoming peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians.
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins and Samaria Regional Council Mayor Yossi Dagan voiced their concerns Tuesday in a joint piece published in The Washington Times.
""The Trump administration should stay the course, continuing to avoid the 'land for peace' proposals, and the policies that have prevented Israelis from building in Judea and Samaria, which have repeatedly failed to work,"" Dagan and Perkins said in the editorial.

Jews Will Hold Passover Sedar in Warsaw Ghetto 76 Years After Holocaust,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/jews-will-hold-passover-sedar-in-warsaw-ghetto-76-years-after-holocaust,"Jews Will Hold Passover Seder in Warsaw Ghetto 76 Years After Holocaust 04-18-2019 Source: Wiki Commons
For the first time in 76 years, Jews will hold a Passover Seder in the Warsaw Ghetto.
The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of all Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe during World War II. For thousands of Jews, it was the last place they ever saw before being shipped off to Nazi concentration and death camps.
On April 19, 1943, the eve of Passover, Jewish rebels living in the Warsaw ghetto rose up against their Nazi tormentors. At least 56,065 Jews were killed on the spot or deported.
This year, April 19th will have a new meaning for the families of Holocaust survivors. One hundred Jewish families will celebrate Passover, the holiday of redemption, together in what is left of the Warsaw ghetto.
Rabbi Shalom Ber Stambler, Chief Rabbi of Chabad-Poland, is hosting a special Passover Seder that will families from Israel, Europe, and the US.
According to Arutz Sheva , Sharon Ben-Shem will travel from Israel to remember her aunt and other relatives who perished in the ghetto.
""Child prodigy Josima Feldschuh, the celebrated young pianist of the Warsaw Ghetto, was my aunt,"" Ben Shem said. ""She perished on April 21, 1943 shortly before her fourteenth birthday, while in hiding. Her very last meal took place the prior evening—the seder night of 1943! This year, we will be joining the seder in Poland together with her family—her brother (my father) and sister (my aunt) and I (her niece). We will be in Warsaw, in the seder night, in her city, precisely on the day that she passed away.""
""Warsaw was also home to my grandmother's immediate and extended family. It is deeply meaningful to us to be celebrating this festival of Passover together as free Jews in a place where so many, including our own family, perished tragically.""
The seder dinner will be broken up into three groups led in three different languages—Polish, Hebrew and English. Toward the end of the night, the three groups will merge and conclude the seder as one.
Rabbi Shalom Ber Stambler views the seder as a symbol of Jews' victory over anti-Semitism.
""It is very significant for us to be celebrating Jewish holidays, and particularly the seder night, which symbolizes Jewish freedom and the day that we united as a nation, in a place that not long ago others sought to destroy us,"" he said. ""Throughout the ages, the Jewish people have been oppressed by many nations, yet we have always emerged triumphant!"""
'We've Got to Get Back to God...What's Best for Our Nation': Dem Blasts His Party's Obsession with Mueller,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/weve-got-to-get-back-to-god-whats-best-for-our-nation-dem-blasts-his-partys-obsession-with-mueller,"Democrats in Washington and members of the establishment media are voicing widespread outrage against US Attorney General William Barr for holding a press conference Thursday about the Mueller report.
Barr is releasing a redacted version of the report and explaining his decision to the nation. But Democrat leaders and liberal journalists say Barr is acting as a ""shill"" for President Trump.
On the local level, there's a different response though. One Louisiana state senator - Democrat John Milkovich - says the Mueller report reveals there was no campaign collusion or obstruction of justice on the part of Donald Trump.
Democrat committee leaders in Congress have launched numerous investigations against Trump, saying the Mueller report didn't go far enough. But Milkovich says it's time for his party to end its investigations of the president.
""Is it my personal opinion that it is a waste of time? Yes. Do they have the constitutional authority to do it? Yes. Is it going to help them? Absolutely no. I think the American people - many of them feel betrayed,"" he says.
""We've got to get back to God, we've got to get back to Bible principles, we've got to get back to the Constitution, we've got to get back to doing what's best for our nation. We've got to get back to bringing, uniting people.""

Muslim Syrians Converting To Christianity After Defeating ISIS | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/muslim-syrians-converting-to-christianity-after-defeating-isis,"Years after the Islamic State laid siege to the Syrian town of Kobani, some of its Muslim residents are leaving behind Islam and turning to Christianity.
In 2015, Kobani was the epicenter in the battle against ISIS. It was also here that US-led forces beat back ISIS terrorists and liberated the city before finally ending the group's hold over Iraq and Syria last month.
Many of the new converts to Christ say the violence ISIS brought to their region left them disillusioned with Islam.
While many Muslims became agnostic or atheist, others turned to Jesus and opened up Kobani's first church in decades called ""Church of the Brethren."" It is the only evangelical church in Kobani.
""After the war with Islamic State people were looking for the right path, and distancing themselves from Islam,"" church founder Omar Firas told Reuters . ""People were scared and felt lost.""
Firas said approximately 80 to 100 people in Kobani now worship at the evangelical church.
""We meet on Tuesdays and hold a service on Fridays. It is open to anyone who wants to join,"" he said.
CBN News met with Firas in February. He founded the church while a new representative form of government in northeast Syria called the ""Self Administration of Syria"" (SANES) was emerging.
The SANES controls a third of Syria between the Tigris and Euphrates River and guarantees freedom of religion to all of the 4 million people within its borders.
Firas told CBN News his church would never have been allowed under ISIS.
""We can express our rituals with complete freedom,"" he said.
Church of the Brethren's existence is a sign of true religious freedom under SANES.
""Because this project is democratic and for the first time it has recognized we as a Syriac Christians and recognized our language, culture and even our religion,"" SANES Executive Council VP Elizabeth Kourie told CBN News .
The leaders say their hope is to spread this new democracy throughout Syria rather than form another country.

Attorney General Barr's Full Remarks on the Release of the Mueller Report,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/attorney-general-barrs-full-remarks-on-the-release-of-the-mueller-report,"Attorney General Barr's Full Remarks on the Release of the Mueller Report 04-18-2019 William Barr (Photo: AP Images)
Good Morning. Thank you all for being here today.
On March 22, 2019, Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation of matters related to Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and submitted his confidential report to me pursuant to Department of Justice regulations.
As I said during my Senate confirmation hearing and since, I am committed to ensuring the greatest possible degree of transparency concerning the Special Counsel's investigation, consistent with the law.
At 11:00 this morning, I will transmit copies of a public version of the Special Counsel's report to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The Department of Justice will also make the report available to the American public by posting it on the Department's website after it has been delivered to Congress.
I would like to offer a few comments today on the report.
But before I do that, I want to thank Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for joining me here today and for his assistance and counsel throughout this process. Rod has served the Department of Justice for many years with dedication and distinction, and it has been a great privilege and pleasure to work with him since my confirmation. He had well-deserved plans to step back from public service that I interrupted by asking him to help in my transition. Rod has been an invaluable partner, and I am grateful that he was willing to help me and has been able to see the Special Counsel's investigation to its conclusion. Thank you, Rod.
I would also like to thank Special Counsel Mueller for his service and the thoroughness of his investigation, particularly his work exposing the nature of Russia's attempts to interfere in our electoral process.
As you know, one of the primary purposes of the Special Counsel's investigation was to determine whether members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, or any individuals associated with that campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election. Volume I of the Special Counsel's report describes the results of that investigation. As you will see, the Special Counsel's report states that his ""investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.""
I am sure that all Americans share my concerns about the efforts of the Russian government to interfere in our presidential election. As the Special Counsel's report makes clear, the Russian government sought to interfere in our election. But thanks to the Special Counsel's thorough investigation, we now know that the Russian operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump or the Trump campaign – or the knowing assistance of any other Americans for that matter. That is something that all Americans can and should be grateful to have confirmed.
The Special Counsel's report outlines two main efforts by the Russian government to influence the 2016 election:
First, the report details efforts by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company with close ties to the Russian government, to sow social discord among American voters through disinformation and social media operations. Following a thorough investigation of this disinformation campaign, the Special Counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian nationals and entities for their respective roles in this scheme. Those charges remain pending, and the individual defendants remain at large.
But the Special Counsel found no evidence that any Americans – including anyone associated with the Trump campaign – conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in carrying out this illegal scheme. Indeed, as the report states, ""he investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA's interference operation."" Put another way, the Special Counsel found no ""collusion"" by any Americans in the IRA's illegal activity.
Second, the report details efforts by Russian military officials associated with the GRU to hack into computers and steal documents and emails from individuals affiliated with the Democratic Party and the presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton for the purpose of eventually publicizing those emails. Obtaining such unauthorized access into computers is a federal crime. Following a thorough investigation of these hacking operations, the Special Counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian military officers for their respective roles in these illegal hacking activities. Those charges are still pending and the defendants remain at large.
But again, the Special Counsel's report did not find any evidence that members of the Trump campaign or anyone associated with the campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its hacking operations. In other words, there was no evidence of Trump campaign ""collusion"" with the Russian government's hacking.
The Special Counsel's investigation also examined Russian efforts to publish stolen emails and documents on the internet. The Special Counsel found that, after the GRU disseminated some of the stolen materials through its own controlled entities, DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the GRU transferred some of the stolen materials to Wikileaks for publication. Wikileaks then made a series of document dumps. The Special Counsel also investigated whether any member or affiliate of the Trump campaign encouraged or otherwise played a role in these dissemination efforts. Under applicable law, publication of these types of materials would not be criminal unless the publisher also participated in the underlying hacking conspiracy. Here too, the Special Counsel's report did not find that any person associated with the Trump campaign illegally participated in the dissemination of the materials.
Finally, the Special Counsel investigated a number of ""links"" or ""contacts"" between Trump Campaign officials and individuals connected with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign. After reviewing those contacts, the Special Counsel did not find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign.
So that is the bottom line. After nearly two years of investigation, thousands of subpoenas, and hundreds of warrants and witness interviews, the Special Counsel confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes.
After finding no underlying collusion with Russia, the Special Counsel's report goes on to consider whether certain actions of the President could amount to obstruction of the Special Counsel's investigation. As I addressed in my March 24th letter, the Special Counsel did not make a traditional prosecutorial judgment regarding this allegation. Instead, the report recounts ten episodes involving the President and discusses potential legal theories for connecting these actions to elements of an obstruction offense.
After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.
Although the Deputy Attorney General and I disagreed with some of the Special Counsel's legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we did not rely solely on that in making our decision. Instead, we accepted the Special Counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the Special Counsel in reaching our conclusion.
In assessing the President's actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President's personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion. And as the Special Counsel's report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.
Now, before I take questions, I want to address a few aspects of the process for producing the public report that I am releasing today. As I said several times, the report contains limited redactions relating to four categories of information. To ensure as much transparency as possible, these redactions have been clearly labelled and color-coded so that readers can tell which redactions correspond to which categories.
As you will see, most of the redactions were compelled by the need to prevent harm to ongoing matters and to comply with court orders prohibiting the public disclosure of information bearing upon ongoing investigations and criminal cases, such as the IRA case and the Roger Stone case.
These redactions were applied by Department of Justice attorneys working closely together with attorneys from the Special Counsel's Office, as well as with the intelligence community, and prosecutors who are handling ongoing cases. The redactions are their work product.
Consistent with long-standing Executive Branch practice, the decision whether to assert Executive privilege over any portion of the report rested with the President of the United States. Because the White House voluntarily cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation, significant portions of the report contain material over which the President could have asserted privilege. And he would have been well within his rights to do so. Following my March 29th letter, the Office of the White House Counsel requested the opportunity to review the redacted version of the report in order to advise the President on the potential invocation of privilege, which is consistent with long-standing practice. Following that review, the President confirmed that, in the interests of transparency and full disclosure to the American people, he would not assert privilege over the Special Counsel's report. Accordingly, the public report I am releasing today contains redactions only for the four categories that I previously outlined, and no material has been redacted based on executive privilege.
In addition, earlier this week, the President's personal counsel requested and were given the opportunity to read a final version of the redacted report before it was publicly released. That request was consistent with the practice followed under the Ethics in Government Act, which permitted individuals named in a report prepared by an Independent Counsel the opportunity to read the report before publication. The President's personal lawyers were not permitted to make, and did not request, any redactions.
In addition to making the redacted report public, we are also committed to working with Congress to accommodate their legitimate oversight interests with respect to the Special Counsel's investigation. We have been consulting with Chairman Graham and Chairman Nadler throughout this process, and we will continue to do so.
Given the limited nature of the redactions, I believe that the publicly released report will allow every American to understand the results of the Special Counsel's investigation. Nevertheless, in an effort to accommodate congressional requests, we will make available to a bipartisan group of leaders from several Congressional committees a version of the report with all redactions removed except those relating to grand-jury information. Thus, these members of Congress will be able to see all of the redacted material for themselves – with the limited exception of that which, by law, cannot be shared.
I believe that this accommodation, together with my upcoming testimony before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, will satisfy any need Congress has for information regarding the Special Counsel's investigation.
Once again, I would like to thank you all for being here today. I now have a few minutes for questions."

In Qaraqosh, Iraq's largest Christian town, hundreds of people chanted 'Hosanna' and waved palm and olive branches on Palm Sunday.
In 2014, Qaraqosh, like so many other Christian communities across northern Iraq, was overrun by ISIS militants, forcing hundreds of thousands of Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities to flee.
Since the defeat of ISIS, some Christian families are beginning to move back.
But Carl Anderson, CEO of the Knights of Columbus , tells CBN News that with the fall of ISIS, a different menace is now taking its place in Iraq's Christian towns.
""Iranian-backed militias are occupying many of the formerly Christian towns and making it virtually impossible for Christians to come back in,"" Anderson, who just returned from northern Iraq, told CBN News . ""What ISIS failed to accomplish, that is to have a religious cleansing of Christians in the area, Iran, through their surrogates, may accomplish still.""

Franklin Graham Weighs in on Pete Buttigieg’s Sexuality and Faith,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/franklin-graham-weighs-in-on-pete-buttigieg-rsquo-s-sexuality-and-faith,"Franklin Graham Weighs in on Pete Buttigieg’s Sexuality and Faith 04-18-2019
Emily Thomes: Buttigieg Is ‘Not Following the God of the Bible
Graham, who adheres to a traditional reading of the Bible that argues the practice of homosexuality to be objectively sinful, warned in a post on Facebook that true followers of Jesus must have a faith in God’s word “that transforms our lives.”
Citing one example of scripture, Old Testament passage Leviticus 20:13: “If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination,” Franklin added “That’s what God says and that settles it for me. I stand with the Word of God. I care enough about people to tell them the truth and to warn them about the judgment to come for all sin.”
Responding to a number of protestors who recently, in a rather unpleasant manner, implored Buttigieg to turn away from his homosexuality, the Mayor of South Bend simply responded that, “the condition of my soul is in the hands of God …”
That, Graham said, is absolutely the case—for all of us. “Mayor Buttigieg is absolutely right—His soul is in the hands of God, so is everyone’s,” Graham wrote, noting that, as Christians, we should be sure to follow the commands of the Bible and live in accordance with God’s will.
“Jesus said, ‘If you love me, you will keep my commandments’ (John 14:15),” Graham added. “The Bible makes it very clear that homosexuality is a sin.” What has Pete Buttigieg said about his sexuality and faith?
Buttigieg, a professed Christian, has been open about his sexuality and recent marriage to school teacher, Chasten Glezman. Speaking at a recent LGBT event, Buttigieg insisted that his gay marriage had “brought him closer to God.”
He has, however, also spoken candidly of his own struggles with his sexuality—admitting that it took him some time to get it squared away with his faith.
“It’s hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife,” Buttigieg said in a speech at the LGBT Victory Fund April 7. “If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would’ve swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water.”
However, now living as an openly gay man, and with a husband, Buttigieg said he strongly believes God made him this way.
In a recent CNN interview, Buttigieg called himself “liturgically conservative” who feels at home in the Episcopal Church.
“If there’s going to be music, I want an organ, not a guitar,” Buttigieg said of his church style preferences, noting that he has “always struggled with prayer as a concept.”
He added: “Granted, in a literal sense, [prayer is] asking for things, but that’s problematic, too, as though we encounter God, and he hasn’t already figured out what we need. So I guess in that sense I do find that ritual organized prayer makes sense because it is a way to tune my own heart to what is right.”"
"'We Were Part of the Con, and We Knew It': Ex Southern Poverty Law Center Employees Reveal 'Racial Slurs,' 'Hypocrisy'",www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/we-were-part-of-the-con-and-we-knew-it-ex-southern-poverty-law-center-employees-reveal-racial-slurs-hypocrisy,"CBNNews.com 'We Were Part of the Con, and We Knew It': Ex SPLC Employees Reveal 'Racial Slurs,''Hypocrisy' 04-18-2019 Christian Ellis Southern Poverty Law Center (Photo: SPLC Logo)
The Family Research Council went public Wednesday with a new campaign in the Wall Street Journal exposing the ""hypocrisy"" of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Using testimonials of former employees, the organization, alongside the American Family Association and SPLCexposed.com, the effort calls on major companies like Spotify, MSNBC, CNN, YouTube, Amazon, and PayPal to stop their partnerships with the progressive SPLC.
The SPLC has been known for their skewed labeling of Christian organizations. CBN News recently reported of a partnership between PayPal and the leftist organization to decide who should be blacklisted from their company. Using ""company corporate values"" as their defense, PayPal took intentional steps to deny access to conservatives based on the SPLC's request.
In 2018, The SPLC had to pay $3.375 million in a settlement for their efforts to condemn conservatives. The organization was faulted for including former Islamic radical turned conservative Maajiid Nawaz in its ""Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists.""
Now, the FRC says it has found more proof of the SPLC's hypocritical efforts as former employees have shared of their experiences.
In the ad, statements from former employees include SPLC using racial rhetoric and hate to make millions of dollars. Below are some of the quotes:
""There was not a single black employee with whom I spoke who was happy to be working there,"" stated Christine Lee, a Harvard Law School graduate and 1989 SPLC legal intern. ""The organization had a way of talking about black people that hasn't - I don't think -been done in 30 or 40 years.""
Former SPLC attorney Gloria Browne agreed, stating, ""I was surprised at some of the things I saw, because it was a civil rights organization...I've heard racial slurs in the place.""
""You will never step foot in a more contradictory place as long as you live,"" shared a former employee to The New Yorker.
Another person stated, ""It could be racial, sexual, financial - that place was a virtual buffet of injustices.""
Former SPLC writer Bob Moser admitted, ""We were part of the con, and we knew it.""
""Sometimes the press will describe us as monitoring hate groups,"" stated Former SPLC senior fellow Mark Potok. ""I want to say plainly that our aim in life is to destroy these groups, completely destroy them.""
Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council, stated, ""Now that employees of SPLC have pulled back the curtain on the organization's hypocrisy, what will members of the media and big tech who aligned themselves with SPLC do? To continue to use SPLC's politically-driven labeling will be an endorsement of SPLC's blatant racism and bigotry."""
Ben Shapiro: Judeo-Christian Values 'Made the West Great',www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/ben-shapiro-judeo-christian-values-made-the-west-great,"WASHINGTON – Ben Shapiro is making quite a name for himself as a young conservative known for his sharp and to-the-point style and in his new book, The Right Side of History , he takes a deep dive into what made the Western world great. Faith, he points out, is paramount.
Shapiro knows what it's like to draw a crowd and even angry protests on some of the college campuses he visits, but he doesn't let that stop him from sharing his conservative views, and often running intellectual circles around those he goes up against.
Attempts to Undermine Shapiro
""I think there's a willing attempt to undermine the very basis of what I stand for,"" Shapiro told CBN News. ""People deliberately lie about what it is that I am saying. People will suggest that, for example, that I'm a white supremacist when I'm militantly anti-white supremacist.""
In fact, the 35-year-old Harvard educated lawyer is devout in his Jewish faith.
""The attempt to paint me as some sort of racist, the attempt to paint me as some sort of bigot or somebody who wants to hurt other people, I'm some sort of Fascist, those lies are the way the Left avoids the debate, unfortunately, the hard Left avoids the debate anyway,"" said Shapiro.
'The Right Side of History'
The debate is something he doesn't shy away from and in The Right Side of History , he makes the case for the Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law that made the Western world great.
Shapiro argues that we're living in the ""most prosperous time in human history,"" yet our society is becoming more angry and divided.
He says we have to investigate the roots of our civilization to explain this conundrum.
Shapiro contends those roots lie in Judeo-Christian ethics and Greek teleology, the idea that we can apply reason to the universe and come up with good moral and scientific answers.
Fighting Against the Chaos Undermining Western Civilization
""That combination, the push and pull between human reason and Divine revelation, that push and pull created the West,"" said Shapiro. ""We have tried forcibly in many cases to undermine both of those basis for Western civilization, then we're surprised when we return to the chaos that proceeded them.""
It's that chaos he's trying to fight against on his radio and podcast show, cable news programs and columns he writes for ""The Daily Wire,"" which he founded.
As for why Christians should be especially interested in his new book, he says the answer is simple.
""It gives a rationale for why Judeo-Christian values lie at the root of Western civilization,"" explained Shapiro. ""Because what we're hearing from all our relatives is that you're an idiot if you believe in revelation at Sinai or the Sermon on the Mount, that you're a fool if you believe the tenants of Judeo-Christianity, that if you believe any of those values that you're basically a dunce and that we could come to all of these values on our own.""
He says this book is a rebuke of that notion.
""You do need to make certain fundamental assumptions about the nature of the universe that are rooted in a God-based orderly universe if you actually want to have a Western civilization worth fighting for and preserving,"" he said.

Citing one example of scripture, Old Testament passage Leviticus 20:13: “If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination,” Franklin added “That’s what God says and that settles it for me. I stand with the Word of God. I care enough about people to tell them the truth and to warn them about the judgment to come for all sin.”
Responding to a number of protestors who recently, in a rather unpleasant manner, implored Buttigieg to turn away from his homosexuality, the Mayor of South Bend simply responded that, “the condition of my soul is in the hands of God …”
That, Graham said, is absolutely the case—for all of us. “Mayor Buttigieg is absolutely right—His soul is in the hands of God, so is everyone’s,” Graham wrote, noting that, as Christians, we should be sure to follow the commands of the Bible and live in accordance with God’s will.
“Jesus said, ‘If you love me, you will keep my commandments’ (John 14:15),” Graham added. “The Bible makes it very clear that homosexuality is a sin.”
What has Pete Buttigieg said about his sexuality and faith? Buttigieg, a professed Christian, has been open about his sexuality and recent marriage to school teacher, Chasten Glezman. Speaking at a recent LGBT event, Buttigieg insisted that his gay marriage had “brought him closer to God.”
He has, however, also spoken candidly of his own struggles with his sexuality—admitting that it took him some time to get it squared away with his faith.
“It’s hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife,” Buttigieg said in a speech at the LGBT Victory Fund April 7. “If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would’ve swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water.”
However, now living as an openly gay man, and with a husband, Buttigieg said he strongly believes God made him this way.
In a recent CNN interview, Buttigieg called himself “liturgically conservative” who feels at home in the Episcopal Church.
“If there’s going to be music, I want an organ, not a guitar,” Buttigieg said of his church style preferences, noting that he has “always struggled with prayer as a concept.”
He added: “Granted, in a literal sense, [prayer is] asking for things, but that’s problematic, too, as though we encounter God, and he hasn’t already figured out what we need. So I guess in that sense I do find that ritual organized prayer makes sense because it is a way to tune my own heart to what is right.”"
'We've Got to Get Back to God...What's Best for Our Nation': Dem Blasts His Party's Obsession with Mueller,www.cbn.com,Benjamin Gill,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/weve-got-to-get-back-to-god-whats-best-for-our-nation-dem-blasts-his-partys-obsession-with-mueller,"Democrats in Washington and members of the establishment media are voicing widespread outrage against US Attorney General William Barr for holding a press conference Thursday about the Mueller report.
Barr is releasing a redacted version of the report and explaining his decision to the nation. But Democrat leaders and liberal journalists say Barr is acting as a ""shill"" for President Trump.
On the local level, there's a different response though. One Louisiana state senator - Democrat John Milkovich - says the Mueller report reveals there was no campaign collusion or obstruction of justice on the part of Donald Trump.
Democrat committee leaders in Congress have launched numerous investigations against Trump, saying the Mueller report didn't go far enough. But Milkovich says it's time for his party to end its investigations of the president.
""Is it my personal opinion that it is a waste of time? Yes. Do they have the constitutional authority to do it? Yes. Is it going to help them? Absolutely no. I think the American people - many of them feel betrayed,"" he says.
""We've got to get back to God, we've got to get back to Bible principles, we've got to get back to the Constitution, we've got to get back to doing what's best for our nation. We've got to get back to bringing, uniting people.""
You can see more of Milkovich on ""The Global Lane "", tonight on the CBN News Channel at 9:30 Eastern."
"'We Were Part of the Con, and We Knew It': Ex Southern Poverty Law Center Employees Reveal 'Racial Slurs,' 'Hypocrisy'",www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/we-were-part-of-the-con-and-we-knew-it-ex-southern-poverty-law-center-employees-reveal-racial-slurs-hypocrisy,"The Family Research Council went public Wednesday with a new campaign in the Wall Street Journal exposing the ""hypocrisy"" of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Using testimonials of former employees, the organization, alongside the American Family Association and SPLCexposed.com, the effort calls on major companies like Spotify, MSNBC, CNN, YouTube, Amazon, and PayPal to stop their partnerships with the progressive SPLC.
The SPLC has been known for their skewed labeling of Christian organizations. CBN News recently reported of a partnership between PayPal and the leftist organization to decide who should be blacklisted from their company. Using ""company corporate values"" as their defense, PayPal took intentional steps to deny access to conservatives based on the SPLC's request.
In 2018, The SPLC had to pay $3.375 million in a settlement for their efforts to condemn conservatives. The organization was faulted for including former Islamic radical turned conservative Maajiid Nawaz in its ""Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists.""
Now, the FRC says it has found more proof of the SPLC's hypocritical efforts as former employees have shared of their experiences.
In the ad, statements from former employees include SPLC using racial rhetoric and hate to make millions of dollars. Below are some of the Quote: s:
""There was not a single black employee with whom I spoke who was happy to be working there,"" stated Christine Lee, a Harvard Law School graduate and 1989 SPLC legal intern. ""The organization had a way of talking about black people that hasn't - I don't think -been done in 30 or 40 years.""
Former SPLC attorney Gloria Browne agreed, stating, ""I was surprised at some of the things I saw, because it was a civil rights organization...I've heard racial slurs in the place.""
""You will never step foot in a more contradictory place as long as you live,"" shared a former employee to The New Yorker.
Another person stated, ""It could be racial, sexual, financial - that place was a virtual buffet of injustices.""
Former SPLC writer Bob Moser admitted, ""We were part of the con, and we knew it.""
""Sometimes the press will describe us as monitoring hate groups,"" stated Former SPLC senior fellow Mark Potok. ""I want to say plainly that our aim in life is to destroy these groups, completely destroy them.""
Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council, stated, ""Now that employees of SPLC have pulled back the curtain on the organization's hypocrisy, what will members of the media and big tech who aligned themselves with SPLC do? To continue to use SPLC's politically-driven labeling will be an endorsement of SPLC's blatant racism and bigotry."""
Attorney General Barr's Full Remarks on the Release of the Mueller Report,www.cbn.com,cbn.com,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/attorney-general-barrs-full-remarks-on-the-release-of-the-mueller-report,"Good Morning. Thank you all for being here today.
On March 22, 2019, Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation of matters related to Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and submitted his confidential report to me pursuant to Department of Justice regulations.
As I said during my Senate confirmation hearing and since, I am committed to ensuring the greatest possible degree of transparency concerning the Special Counsel's investigation, consistent with the law.
At 11:00 this morning, I will transmit copies of a public version of the Special Counsel's report to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The Department of Justice will also make the report available to the American public by posting it on the Department's website after it has been delivered to Congress.
I would like to offer a few comments today on the report.
But before I do that, I want to thank Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for joining me here today and for his assistance and counsel throughout this process. Rod has served the Department of Justice for many years with dedication and distinction, and it has been a great privilege and pleasure to work with him since my confirmation. He had well-deserved plans to step back from public service that I interrupted by asking him to help in my transition. Rod has been an invaluable partner, and I am grateful that he was willing to help me and has been able to see the Special Counsel's investigation to its conclusion. Thank you, Rod.
I would also like to thank Special Counsel Mueller for his service and the thoroughness of his investigation, particularly his work exposing the nature of Russia's attempts to interfere in our electoral process.
As you know, one of the primary purposes of the Special Counsel's investigation was to determine whether members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, or any individuals associated with that campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election. Volume I of the Special Counsel's report describes the results of that investigation. As you will see, the Special Counsel's report states that his ""investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.""
I am sure that all Americans share my concerns about the efforts of the Russian government to interfere in our presidential election. As the Special Counsel's report makes clear, the Russian government sought to interfere in our election. But thanks to the Special Counsel's thorough investigation, we now know that the Russian operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump or the Trump campaign – or the knowing assistance of any other Americans for that matter. That is something that all Americans can and should be grateful to have confirmed.
The Special Counsel's report outlines two main efforts by the Russian government to influence the 2016 election:
First, the report details efforts by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company with close ties to the Russian government, to sow social discord among American voters through disinformation and social media operations. Following a thorough investigation of this disinformation campaign, the Special Counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian nationals and entities for their respective roles in this scheme. Those charges remain pending, and the individual defendants remain at large.
But the Special Counsel found no evidence that any Americans – including anyone associated with the Trump campaign – conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in carrying out this illegal scheme. Indeed, as the report states, ""he investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA's interference operation."" Put another way, the Special Counsel found no ""collusion"" by any Americans in the IRA's illegal activity.
Second, the report details efforts by Russian military officials associated with the GRU to hack into computers and steal documents and emails from individuals affiliated with the Democratic Party and the presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton for the purpose of eventually publicizing those emails. Obtaining such unauthorized access into computers is a federal crime. Following a thorough investigation of these hacking operations, the Special Counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian military officers for their respective roles in these illegal hacking activities. Those charges are still pending and the defendants remain at large.
But again, the Special Counsel's report did not find any evidence that members of the Trump campaign or anyone associated with the campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its hacking operations. In other words, there was no evidence of Trump campaign ""collusion"" with the Russian government's hacking.
The Special Counsel's investigation also examined Russian efforts to publish stolen emails and documents on the internet. The Special Counsel found that, after the GRU disseminated some of the stolen materials through its own controlled entities, DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the GRU transferred some of the stolen materials to Wikileaks for publication. Wikileaks then made a series of document dumps. The Special Counsel also investigated whether any member or affiliate of the Trump campaign encouraged or otherwise played a role in these dissemination efforts. Under applicable law, publication of these types of materials would not be criminal unless the publisher also participated in the underlying hacking conspiracy. Here too, the Special Counsel's report did not find that any person associated with the Trump campaign illegally participated in the dissemination of the materials.
Finally, the Special Counsel investigated a number of ""links"" or ""contacts"" between Trump Campaign officials and individuals connected with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign. After reviewing those contacts, the Special Counsel did not find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign.
So that is the bottom line. After nearly two years of investigation, thousands of subpoenas, and hundreds of warrants and witness interviews, the Special Counsel confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes.
After finding no underlying collusion with Russia, the Special Counsel's report goes on to consider whether certain actions of the President could amount to obstruction of the Special Counsel's investigation. As I addressed in my March 24th letter, the Special Counsel did not make a traditional prosecutorial judgment regarding this allegation. Instead, the report recounts ten episodes involving the President and discusses potential legal theories for connecting these actions to elements of an obstruction offense.
After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.
Although the Deputy Attorney General and I disagreed with some of the Special Counsel's legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we did not rely solely on that in making our decision. Instead, we accepted the Special Counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the Special Counsel in reaching our conclusion.
In assessing the President's actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President's personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion. And as the Special Counsel's report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.
Now, before I take questions, I want to address a few aspects of the process for producing the public report that I am releasing today. As I said several times, the report contains limited redactions relating to four categories of information. To ensure as much transparency as possible, these redactions have been clearly labelled and color-coded so that readers can tell which redactions correspond to which categories.
As you will see, most of the redactions were compelled by the need to prevent harm to ongoing matters and to comply with court orders prohibiting the public disclosure of information bearing upon ongoing investigations and criminal cases, such as the IRA case and the Roger Stone case.
These redactions were applied by Department of Justice attorneys working closely together with attorneys from the Special Counsel's Office, as well as with the intelligence community, and prosecutors who are handling ongoing cases. The redactions are their work product.
Consistent with long-standing Executive Branch practice, the decision whether to assert Executive privilege over any portion of the report rested with the President of the United States. Because the White House voluntarily cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation, significant portions of the report contain material over which the President could have asserted privilege. And he would have been well within his rights to do so. Following my March 29th letter, the Office of the White House Counsel requested the opportunity to review the redacted version of the report in order to advise the President on the potential invocation of privilege, which is consistent with long-standing practice. Following that review, the President confirmed that, in the interests of transparency and full disclosure to the American people, he would not assert privilege over the Special Counsel's report. Accordingly, the public report I am releasing today contains redactions only for the four categories that I previously outlined, and no material has been redacted based on executive privilege.
In addition, earlier this week, the President's personal counsel requested and were given the opportunity to read a final version of the redacted report before it was publicly released. That request was consistent with the practice followed under the Ethics in Government Act, which permitted individuals named in a report prepared by an Independent Counsel the opportunity to read the report before publication. The President's personal lawyers were not permitted to make, and did not request, any redactions.
In addition to making the redacted report public, we are also committed to working with Congress to accommodate their legitimate oversight interests with respect to the Special Counsel's investigation. We have been consulting with Chairman Graham and Chairman Nadler throughout this process, and we will continue to do so.
Given the limited nature of the redactions, I believe that the publicly released report will allow every American to understand the results of the Special Counsel's investigation. Nevertheless, in an effort to accommodate congressional requests, we will make available to a bipartisan group of leaders from several Congressional committees a version of the report with all redactions removed except those relating to grand-jury information. Thus, these members of Congress will be able to see all of the redacted material for themselves – with the limited exception of that which, by law, cannot be shared.
I believe that this accommodation, together with my upcoming testimony before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, will satisfy any need Congress has for information regarding the Special Counsel's investigation.
Once again, I would like to thank you all for being here today. I now have a few minutes for questions."
Ben Shapiro: Judeo-Christian Values 'Made the West Great',www.cbn.com,Jenna Browder,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/ben-shapiro-judeo-christian-values-made-the-west-great,"WASHINGTON – Ben Shapiro is making quite a name for himself as a young conservative known for his sharp and to-the-point style and in his new book, The Right Side of History , he takes a deep dive into what made the Western world great. Faith, he points out, is paramount.
Shapiro knows what it's like to draw a crowd and even angry protests on some of the college campuses he visits, but he doesn't let that stop him from sharing his conservative views, and often running intellectual circles around those he goes up against.
Attempts to Undermine Shapiro
""I think there's a willing attempt to undermine the very basis of what I stand for,"" Shapiro told CBN News. ""People deliberately lie about what it is that I am saying. People will suggest that, for example, that I'm a white supremacist when I'm militantly anti-white supremacist.""
In fact, the 35-year-old Harvard educated lawyer is devout in his Jewish faith.
""The attempt to paint me as some sort of racist, the attempt to paint me as some sort of bigot or somebody who wants to hurt other people, I'm some sort of Fascist, those lies are the way the Left avoids the debate, unfortunately, the hard Left avoids the debate anyway,"" said Shapiro.
'The Right Side of History'
The debate is something he doesn't shy away from and in The Right Side of History , he makes the case for the Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law that made the Western world great.
Shapiro argues that we're living in the ""most prosperous time in human history,"" yet our society is becoming more angry and divided.
He says we have to investigate the roots of our civilization to explain this conundrum.
Shapiro contends those roots lie in Judeo-Christian ethics and Greek teleology, the idea that we can apply reason to the universe and come up with good moral and scientific answers.
Fighting Against the Chaos Undermining Western Civilization
""That combination, the push and pull between human reason and Divine revelation, that push and pull created the West,"" said Shapiro. ""We have tried forcibly in many cases to undermine both of those basis for Western civilization, then we're surprised when we return to the chaos that proceeded them.""
It's that chaos he's trying to fight against on his radio and podcast show, cable news programs and columns he writes for ""The Daily Wire,"" which he founded.
As for why Christians should be especially interested in his new book, he says the answer is simple.
""It gives a rationale for why Judeo-Christian values lie at the root of Western civilization,"" explained Shapiro. ""Because what we're hearing from all our relatives is that you're an idiot if you believe in revelation at Sinai or the Sermon on the Mount, that you're a fool if you believe the tenants of Judeo-Christianity, that if you believe any of those values that you're basically a dunce and that we could come to all of these values on our own.""
He says this book is a rebuke of that notion.
""You do need to make certain fundamental assumptions about the nature of the universe that are rooted in a God-based orderly universe if you actually want to have a Western civilization worth fighting for and preserving,"" he said."
"Iranian-Backed Militias Pick Up Where ISIS Left Off, Terrorizing Iraq's Christians",www.cbn.com,George Thomas,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/iranian-backed-militias-pick-up-where-isis-left-off-terrorizing-iraqs-christians,"This week, across many towns of Iraq, Christians are preparing to celebrate Easter.
In Qaraqosh, Iraq's largest Christian town, hundreds of people chanted 'Hosanna' and waved palm and olive branches on Palm Sunday.
In 2014, Qaraqosh, like so many other Christian communities across northern Iraq, was overrun by ISIS militants, forcing hundreds of thousands of Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities to flee.
Since the defeat of ISIS, some Christian families are beginning to move back.
But Carl Anderson, CEO of the Knights of Columbus , tells CBN News that with the fall of ISIS, a different menace is now taking its place in Iraq's Christian towns.
""Iranian-backed militias are occupying many of the formerly Christian towns and making it virtually impossible for Christians to come back in,"" Anderson, who just returned from northern Iraq, told CBN News . ""What ISIS failed to accomplish, that is to have a religious cleansing of Christians in the area, Iran, through their surrogates, may accomplish still.""

‘I Feel Like I’m Birthed Again’ : Thousands Flock to Jordan River to Remember Christ During Holy Week,www.cbn.com,Chris Mitchell,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/lsquo-i-feel-like-i-rsquo-m-birthed-again-rsquo-thousands-flock-to-jordan-river-to-remember-christ-during-holy-week,"QASR EL JEHUD - Christians from all over the world come to Israel during holy week. One of the main sites they visit is an area where many believe John the Baptist baptized Jesus Christ.
For Christians being baptized in the Jordan River is a profound spiritual experience.
“This is my dream and Jesus was baptized here and I think and I believe that this river is blessed,” Eyerusalem Ayakew told CBN News .
“I’m feeling like rivers. I feel like I’m birthed again because Jesus was baptized here,” Andinet Ayakew added.
The site is called Qasr el Yahud, ***on the border with Jordan near the north end of the Dead Sea.***. Israel developed this site for Christian pilgrims and now about three-quarters of a million people visit here each year. While there’s no proof this is the exact location of the baptism of Jesus, it remains a special place.
“I read the Bible. I preach the Bible and for us to be here and actually experience it first hand, it sort of underscores and affirms what they hear week after week as we present God’s Word to the people,” said Pastor Steve McCraken from Grace Pointe Community Chapel.
This area is also believed to be the place where Elijah the prophet ascended into heaven in a fiery chariot and where the children of Israel crossed over into the Promised Land.
Tour guide Ben David Katriel gave two reasons why this might be the area Joshua brought the Israelites on their way to Jericho.
“There are passages in the Jordan, places that are easier to pass. That never changes, that’s topography. But except that we have Jericho there is no argument about the location of Jericho,” he explained.
Ret. Gen. Uzi Dayan says the Jewish people returned here from Egypt more than three thousand years ago. Three millennia later, Jews are still returning to the land of Israel, where you can see biblical prophecies come to life.
“Actually, this is the first Aliya that took place,” he said. This is a combination where the Bible or the stories of the Bible meet.”
Pastor McCraken encourages other Christians to visit the Jordan river.
“Come. Make this part of your plans because this will enrich your faith and deepen your devotion to Jesus, which is what it’s all about.”
For many, it’s especially meaningful just before the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ."
Kushner: Israeli-Palestinian Peace Plan Will Be Revealed After Ramadan,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/kushner-israeli-palestinian-peace-plan-will-be-revealed-after-ramadan,"White House senior adviser Jared Kushner told a group of ambassadors Wednesday that President Donald Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan will be unveiled sometime after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends June 5.
By that time, Israel's newly appointed government should be established and sworn in.
Reuters reports that Kushner told the diplomats to keep an ""open mind"" about the proposal.
""We will all have to look for reasonable compromises that will make peace achievable,"" Kushner said, according to a source close to Reuters.
Kushner also reportedly said the deal will require compromises on both sides but won't jeopardize Israel's security.

Not much is known about the proposal but Palestinian leaders have already rejected it.
New Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told The Associated Press Tuesday the plan will be ""born dead.""
""There are no partners in Palestine for Trump. There are no Arab partners for Trump and there are no European partners for Trump,"" Shtayyeh said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN's Jake Tapper last Friday that the peace plan will ""represent a significant change from the model that's been used.""
Pompeo also refused to publicly endorse the two-state solution, which guarantees a state for Israelis and another state for Palestinians.
""I would argue that millions of man-hours have been spent to try and build out a two-state solution. It hasn't worked to date,"" he said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week.
Meanwhile, an American Evangelical leader and Israeli settler leader are urging President Donald Trump not to give up Jewish land for peace in his upcoming peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians.
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins and Samaria Regional Council Mayor Yossi Dagan voiced their concerns Tuesday in a joint piece published in The Washington Times.
""The Trump administration should stay the course, continuing to avoid the 'land for peace' proposals, and the policies that have prevented Israelis from building in Judea and Samaria, which have repeatedly failed to work,"" Dagan and Perkins said in the editorial."
Muslim Syrians Converting To Christianity After Defeating ISIS,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/muslim-syrians-converting-to-christianity-after-defeating-isis,"Years after the Islamic State laid siege to the Syrian town of Kobani, some of its Muslim residents are leaving behind Islam and turning to Christianity.
In 2015, Kobani was the epicenter in the battle against ISIS. It was also here that US-led forces beat back ISIS terrorists and liberated the city before finally ending the group's hold over Iraq and Syria last month.
Many of the new converts to Christ say the violence ISIS brought to their region left them disillusioned with Islam.
While many Muslims became agnostic or atheist, others turned to Jesus and opened up Kobani's first church in decades called ""Church of the Brethren."" It is the only evangelical church in Kobani.
""After the war with Islamic State people were looking for the right path, and distancing themselves from Islam,"" church founder Omar Firas told Reuters . ""People were scared and felt lost.""
Firas said approximately 80 to 100 people in Kobani now worship at the evangelical church.
""We meet on Tuesdays and hold a service on Fridays. It is open to anyone who wants to join,"" he said.
CBN News met with Firas in February. He founded the church while a new representative form of government in northeast Syria called the ""Self Administration of Syria"" (SANES) was emerging.
The SANES controls a third of Syria between the Tigris and Euphrates River and guarantees freedom of religion to all of the 4 million people within its borders.
Firas told CBN News his church would never have been allowed under ISIS.
""We can express our rituals with complete freedom,"" he said.
Church of the Brethren's existence is a sign of true religious freedom under SANES.
""Because this project is democratic and for the first time it has recognized we as a Syriac Christians and recognized our language, culture and even our religion,"" SANES Executive Council VP Elizabeth Kourie told CBN News .
The leaders say their hope is to spread this new democracy throughout Syria rather than form another country."
Jews Will Hold Passover Seder in Warsaw Ghetto 76 Years After Holocaust,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/jews-will-hold-passover-sedar-in-warsaw-ghetto-76-years-after-holocaust,"For the first time in 76 years, Jews will hold a Passover Seder in the Warsaw Ghetto.
The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of all Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe during World War II. For thousands of Jews, it was the last place they ever saw before being shipped off to Nazi concentration and death camps.
On April 19, 1943, the eve of Passover, Jewish rebels living in the Warsaw ghetto rose up against their Nazi tormentors. At least 56,065 Jews were killed on the spot or deported.
This year, April 19th will have a new meaning for the families of Holocaust survivors. One hundred Jewish families will celebrate Passover, the holiday of redemption, together in what is left of the Warsaw ghetto.
Rabbi Shalom Ber Stambler, Chief Rabbi of Chabad-Poland, is hosting a special Passover Seder that will families from Israel, Europe, and the US.
According to Arutz Sheva , Sharon Ben-Shem will travel from Israel to remember her aunt and other relatives who perished in the ghetto.
""Child prodigy Josima Feldschuh, the celebrated young pianist of the Warsaw Ghetto, was my aunt,"" Ben Shem said. ""She perished on April 21, 1943 shortly before her fourteenth birthday, while in hiding. Her very last meal took place the prior evening—the seder night of 1943! This year, we will be joining the seder in Poland together with her family—her brother (my father) and sister (my aunt) and I (her niece). We will be in Warsaw, in the seder night, in her city, precisely on the day that she passed away.""
""Warsaw was also home to my grandmother's immediate and extended family. It is deeply meaningful to us to be celebrating this festival of Passover together as free Jews in a place where so many, including our own family, perished tragically.""
The seder dinner will be broken up into three groups led in three different languages—Polish, Hebrew and English. Toward the end of the night, the three groups will merge and conclude the seder as one.
Rabbi Shalom Ber Stambler views the seder as a symbol of Jews' victory over anti-Semitism.
""It is very significant for us to be celebrating Jewish holidays, and particularly the seder night, which symbolizes Jewish freedom and the day that we united as a nation, in a place that not long ago others sought to destroy us,"" he said. ""Throughout the ages, the Jewish people have been oppressed by many nations, yet we have always emerged triumphant!"""
The Hospital Built on Faith: 'Proof to Me That God is Real',www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/the-hospital-built-on-faith-proof-to-me-that-god-is-real,"Click on the interview above to hear how ‘desperate prayers’ brought about miracles from God.
All his life Klaus-Dieter John has struggled with faith in God.
“I must say that faith has always been very difficult to me,” the missionary doctor told CBN News. “It has been the deepest desire of my heart to see whether God is true… I mean the Bible says you can pray and He will respond. I wanted to know if this was the case, so my whole life you can say has been an experiment with God, praying out of desperation.”
His life of experimental faith not only confirms that he serves a miracle-working God, but it’s bringing a miracle to some of the neediest people in Peru in the form of a hospital that provides them with first-rate healthcare.
The hospital is called Diopsi Suyana, an Inca word that means ‘we trust in God.” In 11 years, it’s served about 330,000 patients and delivered the Gospel message to more than half-a-million Peruvians.
Most of the patients are Quecha people, descendants of the Incas, who live in dire poverty with no running water and no electricity, but thanks to Klaus and his wife’s faith and perseverance they are served by a hospital as well-equipped as any in the U.S.
It includes operating rooms, intensive care, dental and optical health, and a pharmacy where 35 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals volunteer their services.
Patients are expected to pay for their health care, but the amount is based on their income and they often receive assistance from the hospital’s charitable foundation.
Not Just Healthcare, but Soulcare
Those patients often bring family and friends, giving the hospital pastors an opportunity to share the Gospel message with many more.
“We start every morning with a church service, so we have celebrated 3,000 church services and half a million Peruvians have listened to the story of the cross of Christ, the empty tomb, hope for eternal life,” Klaus said.
One of the hospital’s pastors follows up with the converts, ensuring that ministry doesn’t stop at the hospital.
“He drove through the south of the country in Peru to visit people who converted at our hospital and he helped them get in touch with local churches. It’s a neat follow-up program and we know that 50 percent of the people who raise their hand at the service, they end up in a local church where they are,” said Klaus.
A Series of Miracles
The challenges of bringing his dream to reality tested Klaus’s faith on a daily basis, forcing him to pray with greater intensity.
“It’s a miracle story, a long line of special events that are even convincing to agnostics and atheists,” he said.
He went through just a few of those ‘special events’ that proved God’s faithfulness.
When he needed a construction engineer – a professional with years of experience who would VOLUNTEER his time to oversee the building of the hospital -- Klaus’s lawyer passed on a name. Klaus called him up, made an appointment and later that day made his presentation.
When Klaus finished speaking, the engineer’s wife told him a remarkable story.
“Three days ago we started praying to God about a special purpose for our life and this morning we were sitting in our kitchen for three hours saying ‘What could it be?’ And then we prayed and as we said ‘Amen’ the phone rang, and it was you.”
They came to Peru in 2006 and never looked back. The engineer has overseen construction of the hospital, a school for local children and missionary kids, and a media center. All for free.
Then there’s the time a customs officials confiscated the projector Klaus used for his presentations and he was forced to go buy another. That led to a chance encounter with the head of a telecommunications company who donated $250,000 in satellite equipment and Internet connections to the hospital.
Once, when they ran short of cement during construction, a truck mysteriously showed up with 600 sacks. The $5,000 donation came from out of the blue because the company’s owner read about their work in the local newspaper.
The same company later donated another $70,000 to finish the roof and install ceiling tiles.
Those are just the ‘big’ miracles: More than 50,000 individual donors have given millions to help build and sustain the hospital.
The Fight for Faith
Klaus says the trying journey to build and expand Diospi Suyana has only strengthened his faith and confirmed his belief in God.
He even titled his book about his experience, “I Have Seen God,” and he often turns to his book when he faces new challenges.
“ It is for me a great encouragement to see that God has been faithful, 20 years ago – 10 years ago – and then I find the courage to believe that He be faithful tomorrow, as well. For me, faith has never been ‘Hallelujah, praise the Lord’ – always struggling, struggling, clinging to the cross of Christ out of desperation.”
He’s not discouraged or embittered by the constant struggle, because he believes that serving God is about moving beyond worldly pursuits and enduring hardship to see the Kingdom of God established.
“I say Christianity is not easy. It means you have to give everything – your life, your money, your time – you have to sweat, you’re in tears, but eventually you’ll see that God will take you through.”"
"Mueller Report in a Nutshell: Russia Interference Was 'Sweeping', but Trump Camp Wasn't Part of It",www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/mueller-report-in-a-nutshell-russia-interference-was-sweeping-but-trump-camp-wasnt-part-of-it,"President Trump's Attorney Jay Sekulow Talks to CBN News' Faith Nation as Mueller Report Released
ABOVE: President Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow talks to CBN News' Faith Nation about the release of the Mueller report.
The Justice Department released a partially redacted version of the report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Thursday. It says right off the top, ""The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion,"" but the Trump campaign wasn't part of that effort.
""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,"" the report clearly states.
The Mueller report is more than 400 pages and now it's in the hands of Congress and the public. Just ahead of the release, Attorney General William Barr held a press conference highlighting his conclusions and explaining why the president isn't facing criminal charges.
As the investigation dragged on and Trump objected, repeatedly blasting it as a ""witch hunt"" on Twitter, Democrats accused him obstructing justice. Barr said the report is clear that Mueller was concerned about that as well, examining 10 different episodes in which Trump was accused of possible obstruction. But none of those led to actionable charges against the president.
Trump followed Barr's announcement with a press conference of his own, stating what he's maintained all along: ""No collusion, no obstruction.""
""We do have to get to the bottom of these things, I will say,"" Trump said. ""I say it in front of my friends, this
Vice President Mike Pence said, ""After two years of investigation, conducted with the full cooperation of this Administration, that involved hundreds of witness interviews and millions of pages of documents, the American people can see for themselves: no collusion, no obstruction.""
President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he's read the full unredacted report and it doesn't contain a ""single surprise."" And the Trump team wants to know how the whole idea to wiretap Trump's campaign even began, Giuliani saying it ""sounds like a counterintelligence trap.""
Democrats are angry over how the release of the report was handled, objecting to the fact that the White House was given an early preview and to Barr's press conference ahead of the report going public.
But Barr says a second version of the report - with most of revealed - would be given to the top-ranking House and Senate lawmakers from both parties since they're allowed to view sensitive classified information.
The House Judiciary Committee is now requesting Mueller speak for himself about his work, in a public congressional hearing by May 23."
Dave Adamson: The Price of Christian Free Speech,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/dave-adamson-the-price-of-christian-free-speech,"Dave Adamson: The Price of Christian Free Speech 04-18-2019
COMMENTARY
This op-ed originally published on Fox News, republished here by permission from the author.
I am a Christian who is all for free speech—but freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.
After my last op-ed for Fox News, which was about the future of the church, I received thousands of negative comments from other Christians. People even tracked down my email address so they could personally inbox their animosity. One follower of Jesus emailed to tell me I was personally responsible for an increase in school shootings. Another said my ""way of thinking is what makes people kill themselves.""
And this is just one, small example of how Christians are so quick to turn on other Christians online. As soon as there's a difference of opinion, Christians undo Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane that we would be one as God and Jesus are one, by piling on unmerited personal insults.
While Jesus said we should love one another, treat others kindly, and pray for people regularly, it seems his followers prefer to troll one another, tweet about others maliciously, and prey on people. And when Christians take to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to attack each other with irresponsible, non-empathetic vitriol, it's our faith that suffers.
While First Century followers of Jesus were known for their love and compassion, 21st-century followers of Jesus are renowned for our vitriol and animosity. How did our reputation devolve to this place?
I've watched Christians routinely justify their criticism with Jesus' words in Matthew 18:15-20, telling ourselves that we have the religious duty to confront fellow believers with their ""sin"". But in doing so, we deliberately step over the application of this passage, which comes when Jesus tells us to treat people who refuse our correction as a ""Gentile and a tax collector"" (verse 17). Do you remember how Jesus treated Gentiles and tax collectors? He visited their homes. He ate with them. He had compassion for them. He served them. He loved them.
What do Jesus' followers do in the age of social media? We vilify them in the comments section.
Instead of using scripture to start conversations like Jesus so often did, we use scripture to end conversations. But as author Bob Goff says; ""Jesus told the people he was with that it's not enough to just look like you love God. He said we'd know the extent of our love for God by how well we loved people.""
And which people should we love? That's easy right: those with the same theology, lifestyle, financial status, political views, skin color, nationality, family background, traditions, customs, and overall approach to life, right?
Well, when Jesus was asked who we should love by a religious expert, he said we should love everyone—including those we are most different from. Jesus answered this question by telling a story we know as The Good Samaritan. Nowadays, we use this story to represent the importance of roadside assistance—but that wasn't the point when Jesus told the parable. To the Jews listening to Jesus, the Samaritans were the most despised of people groups. To them, there was no such thing as a ""good"" Samaritan because they believed there was not an ounce of good in Samaritans! It would be like saying someone was a ""good white supremacist.""
But by making the morally inferior, theologically incorrect, racially despised Samaritan the hero of the story, Jesus was saying we should love ALL of our neighbors—even those we disagree with, who frustrate us, who have a completely opposite world view, who vote differently, and even those people who have hurt us.
This is, of course, easier said than done, but it starts by asking who the ""Samaritan"" is in your life. Who is the person, or people group, you most despise?
For me, it's the uncle who sexually abused me from the age of six until I was 11. This man caused me to grow up feeling scared, worthless, rejected, and ashamed—am I supposed to treat him kindly Jesus? Am I supposed to pray for him?
According to Jesus, yes. Simple to say, extremely hard to do. Now, that doesn't mean I should have him in my life, and if you've been abused by someone, they don't have to be part of yours. But Jesus didn't call us to respond with malice and vindictiveness to people who mistreat, disrespect, hurt, or offend us—even when it is justified. He called us to the exact opposite—to love.
The world says revenge, retribution and retaliation are justified—but if Christians are going to make a difference in the world, we have to be different from the world. As pastor Andy Stanley says; ""Imagine a world where unbelievers were skeptical of what we believed, but envious of how we treated one another.""
I'm sure some reading this are already winding up to lob unkind words, trolling comments and angry emails my way … I just hope and pray the Christians reading this will see that the world is changed by our example, not our angry opinions—and we are changed by the example of Jesus.

"50 Millennial Women Preachers Get Real: #MeToo, Social Media-Depression, and Women's Role in the Church",www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/50-millennial-women-preachers-get-real-metoo-social-media-depression-and-womens-role-in-the-church,"50 Millennial Women Preachers Get Real: #MeToo, Social Media-Depression, and Women's Role in the Church 04-18-2019 Charlene Aaron
The Word Network hosted a panel of 50 predominately African-American female preachers this week during a special broadcast called, ""Young Preacher Ladies Night Edition.""
The nearly two-hour broadcast, which was also streamed on the network's Facebook page, was hosted by Bishop Greg Davis.
Panelists included women pastors, preachers, evangelists, and business leaders such as Nona Jones, Head of Faith Based Partnerships for Facebook, Dr. Kellie Lane-Agueze of Warrior Nation Ministries, Dr. Irishea Hilliard, Senior Pastor of New Light Church in Houston Texas, Evangelist LaTrice Ryan and many more.
The first topic of the night was about how this generation of women preachers differ from previous generations of female ministers.
""According to George Barna Research group, it's tripled, I would say since 1994, women pastors, women in ministry,"" said Evangelist Tiffany Morriar, founder of GLAM Empowerment Network. ""I think that's because there is a correlation now with female empowerment. Previous generations did not incorporate female empowerment. So, now we're giving voice to issues that haven't been addressed in previous generations.""
Dr. Hilliard said, ""We stand on the shoulders of the generation before us. We would not be here and where we are had they not paved the way. So yes, our style may be different. Our approach may be different. But the ministry is still the same. And I think you've got women leading in all areas, which makes it a little easier for us to lead in this area.""
Several women commented on the importance of the #MeToo Movement and sexual harassment and abuse within the church.
Karri Turner of Atlanta said, ""I think it's interesting in terms of the MeToo Movement and what has happened in the entertainment industry. We know it has happened in church year after year, day after day, unfortunately.""
""A part of the challenge is women having to navigate places that are safe for us,"" added Turner.
Jones suggested, ""We need to stop covering for people because that's how people get hurt. I have had that happen. I had a very prominent pastor send me a picture of his crotch because he thought that I liked him. And I had to politely tell him no sir I am married and there's no platform that you can give me that is worth what you are asking me.""
Panelists also tackled the issue of women breaking through the so-called 'glass ceiling' in ministry.
""I've been on a pastoral team in three different states, three different denominations,"" said Jennifer Carner of Atlanta. ""And one thing that I've noticed is that women are often tolerated instead of being accepted. I think it's important if we're going to continue to crack and break this glass ceiling that we accept women for their gifts, credentials and all they bring to the kingdom.""
Kellie Lane-Agueze had a different take on the subject. ""I feel like God is positioning women now to where it doesn't matter if anyone lets you in,"" she explained. ""I feel like God is doing something so amazing, like so many power houses in the room that there's so much fruit that at this point, we cannot be denied. And because we cannot be denied, it doesn't matter whether someone accepts us or not because when God calls you.""
The ministers also weighed in on the issue of equal pay for women preachers.
""I think there is a difference between the way men's honorariums are treated to women's, and black women especially,"" said one panelist.
Davis said he witnessed inequality regarding female preachers first hand. ""I was married for twenty years to Pastor Kim Davis, she preached at the same church that I preach at,"" he said. ""My check would be one thing; same amount of work. And I was offended by it.""
As the evening went on, pitfalls and addiction to social media also came up.
""When it does promote you, more than it does God,"" shared one panelist. ""I think of course social media is a wonderful platform. But when we are so consumed with filters and how we look and pushing, us, us, us, I think it becomes dangerous. So, we have to have a balance between it.""
Nona Jones commented, ""One thing that we know in the research is that when it comes to social media, it's the passive consumption of content that leads to feelings of isolation and depression. It's community that leads to feelings of belonging and well-being and so don't go back and forth with people. Just celebrate each other.""
Dr. Nycole Lyles-Belton from Atlantic City, NJ said, ""I think when social media gets to a place where it's infecting your life and not being a positive effect in anyone else's life, you need to get off. We noticed when there was a moment when Instagram wasn't working, and Facebook was down that many people were losing their minds. If we lost Facebook and we lost Instagram, would your life still be valid?""
Meanwhile, more than 70,000 people viewed the broadcast on Facebook."
"'Blatant, Illegal Religious Discrimination'?: For a Second Time, San Antonio Says No to Chick-fil-A",www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/blatant-illegal-religious-discrimination-for-a-second-time-san-antonio-says-no-to-chick-fil-a-nbsp,"San Antonio Accused of 'Blatant, Illegal Religious Discrimination', Says No to Chick-fil-A a Second Time 04-18-2019 Heather Sells
A San Antonio city councilman running for mayor tried again Thursday to persuade the city council to consider including Chick-fil-A in its airport concessions contract.
""I consider this opportunity today to be a defining moment for this council,"" Councilman Greg Brockhouse said in introducing the proposal, according to the San Antonio Express-News .
But the council narrowly rejected Brockhouse's move to reconsider the issue at its next meeting, voting 6-5 against the measure.
Brockhouse told CBN News Wednesday that the fate of the chicken restaurant in the city's airport has become ""the number one issue"" in the mayoral election, scheduled for Saturday, May 4th.
And Brockhouse said the faith community is paying attention. ""I think it's awoken a sweeping bloc of people here,"" he said, ""where I'm at it's always a topic.""
In March, Councilman Roberto Trevino led the charge for a vote to remove Chick-fil-A from the concessions contract, citing its history of giving to organizations he categorized as anti-LGBTQ.
Chick-fil-A has been open about its charitable giving. A recent report explained its donations to local groups in Atlanta as well as national organizations such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Salvation Army, Junior Achievement and the Paul Anderson Youth Homes.
Brockhouse's opponent in the May 4th election, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, has cited business reasons for his opposition to Chick-fil-A, saying he would prefer a local company at the airport and one that was open on Sundays.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told the mayor and council after its first vote on Chick-fil-A that he had ""serious concerns"" about religious liberty. Paxton said he's starting an investigation to determine if the vote violates state law and has asked the federal Department of Transportation to review it as well.
The Dallas-based religious liberty law firm First Liberty is also investigating, requesting documents from San Antonio city officials on the vote.
""The city's decision to ban Chick-fil-A was blatant, illegal religious discrimination,"" said Hiram Sasser, First Liberty's general counsel. ""We want to know just how deep the religious animosity runs within San Antonio's city government.""
First Liberty attorney Keisha Russell told CBN News that the recent Supreme Court decision involving Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece cake shop in Denver, might influence how investigators view what's happening in San Antonio.
""The city council members are demonstrating hostility which is one of the things that the court said in Masterpiece is blatantly unconstitutional,"" she said.
Chick-fil-A is running into opposition at two other airports as well. The Buffalo Niagara International airport disinvited the company from opening a new restaurant in its food court.
And in San Jose, the city council has voted to allow a Chick-fil-A restaurant at the airport but also to hang LGBTQ flags nearby."
Churches Desecrated in Ongoing Attacks Across Europe | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/churches-desecrated-in-ongoing-attacks-across-europe,"Churches Desecrated in Ongoing Attacks Across Europe 04-16-2019 Christian Ellis French church desecrated (Image courtesy Cardinal R.

Across Europe, there has been a growing rise in attacks on churches. Countries like France and Germany have seen a spike in violent vandalism, desecrating cherished churches and Christian symbols in recent months and years.
According to the German news site PI-News, every day in France, two churches are desecrated. They report 1,063 attacks on Christian churches or symbols like crucifixes, icons, and statues in France in 2018, marking a 17 percent increase from the year before.
The Middle East Forum reports that attacks on Catholic churches in France since the start of the year have included smashed statues, broken crosses, and demolished tabernacles.
Recently, the historic Church of St. Sulpice in Paris was set on fire after a midday service on Sunday. March, an illegal Muslim immigrant tried to burn down the organ of the Saint-Denis basilica (another jewel) and destroyed stained glass ( https://t.co/vYpFpZtO8K

It was the second attack in a month after the St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Houilles found their statue of the Virgin Mary destroyed and the altar cross on the ground.

In February, at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur, congregants found their altar cloth burned and the church's crosses and statues of saints broken. And in the city of Nimes, individuals vandalized the church of Notre-Dame des Enfants (Our Lady of the Children) and smeared a cross with human excrement according to Newsweek.

In a statement to a local paper, The Tablet, Bishop Robert Wattebled of Nimes said, ""This greatly affects our diocesan community. The sign of the cross and the Blessed Sacrament have been the subject of serious injurious actions.""
""This act of profanation hurts us all in our deepest convictions,"" he continued.

According to The Tablet, a record 47 documented attacks on churches and religious sites were reported in February alone.
""I think there is a rising hostility in France against the church and its symbols,"" stated Ellen Fantini, executive director of Observatory of Intolerance and Discrimination Against Christians in Europe. ""It seems to be more against Christianity and the symbols of Christianity.""
""These attacks are on symbols that are really sacred to parishioners, to Catholics."" she added. ""Desecration of consecrated hosts is a very personal attack on Catholicism and Christianity, more than spray-painting a slogan on the outside wall of a church.""
The German media reports the growing anti-Christian sentiment is believed to be a result of increased Muslim migration. In 2016, after the arrival of close to a million Muslims in Germany, a local newspaper reported ""not a day goes by"" that attacks on religious statues did not happen in the town of Dülmen.
And in France studies show the attacks on churches have increased as the number of Muslim migrants has increased. A January 2017 study stated , ""Islamist extremist attacks on Christians"" in France rose by 38 percent, going from 273 attacks in 2015 to 376 in 2016; the majority occurred during Christmas season and ""many of the attacks took place in churches and other places of worship.""
In 2016, CBN News reported on three ""radicalized"" women who were plotting to bomb Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Police found a car loaded with at least six gas canisters near the church. One of the females was found guilty of encouraging other potential jihadists to perform attacks in Syria and France as well. "
"God's Resurrection Power Shines in ""Breakthrough""",feeds.cbn.com,Hannah.Goodwyn,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/movies/gods-resurrection-power-shines-breakthrough-movie,"Hannah Goodwyn - Senior Producer
God's power didn't cease to move on this earth once Jesus ascended to heaven. Miracles, even resurrections, still happen.
Just ask Joyce Smith and she'll tell you her story.
On January 19, 2015, Joyce's 14-year-old son, John Smith , died for 45 minutes. His doctors and nurses couldn't save him, so they sent Joyce in to say her goodbyes. What happened next, as Joyce stood over her son's lifeless body, is a modern-day miracle.
In that ER room, Joyce cried out to God. And, her desperate prayer brought John back to life.
Fascinated by this present-day resurrection, Hollywood producer DeVon Franklin ( Miracles from Heaven ) jumped at the chance to help bring the Smiths' miraculous story to the big screen.
"" Breakthrough brings hope. Breakthrough brings the power of prayer to life. And, it's truly one of the most unforgettable stories I've ever come across,"" Franklin says. ""Patient dead. Mother prayed. Patient came back to life.""
""The moment I heard that I was like, 'OK, I've got to bring this to the big screen. I've got to tell this story. I've never heard that before. How did that happen? What were the circumstances surrounding it?'"", he says. ""It captivated me the moment I heard it and still captivates me today.""
Based on Joyce's book, The Impossible: The Miraculous True Story of a Mother's Faith and Her Child's Resurrection , Breakthrough details what happened to John, and his family, that cold January day in 2015 after he was trapped in icy water for 15 minutes .
Faith is at the core of this Twentieth Century Fox film. Breakthrough declares the power and goodness of God. Scenes centered on speaking life instead of death and the purposes and love God has for us are encouraging.
""Sometimes we don't speak life because we are so focused on the outcome,"" Franklin says. ""We're afraid if we speak life and then life doesn't happen, then we get discouraged. What Joyce did, it's a model for all of us. She spoke life and left the result to God. If she didn't speak life, John would be dead.""
The alive and well John Smith initially had some questions when talk of making a movie started ramping up. His concerns eased after conversations with his parents.
""Mom's thing from the beginning is that the story needs to be shouted from the mountaintops because it inspires so many people,"" John says. ""It just gives God all the glory and it proves to people that God is not dead. I really trusted mom with this and I said, 'OK, if this is something that'll give glory to God and it will honor Him, then let's do it.""
A graduating senior, John plans to go to college next year to become a pastor. Full-time ministry wasn't really one of John's aspirations, but this incredible journey has taken him down roads he never thought he'd travel.
""It's been a journey for him, really,"" John's pastor Jason Noble says. ""I mean, the two years after the accident were probably more profound for him then even the accident itself.""
""I wasn't saved before,"" John explains.
At the time of John's resurrection, he was not a believer. His mom's faith and God's grace brought him through it all. Some years later, after a basketball game, John made a decision to follow Jesus Christ.
""I got on my knees and I said, 'OK God, you have it all. I'm giving my life to you. You take complete control.'"", John recalls. ""I can remember kind of like a shift in my life. That was really a turning point where God was just having complete control… It's amazing.""
It's an unbelievable story with an unbelievable ending, the salvation of its lead character. And to top it all off, news is that Tommy Shine, the first responder who rescued John from the icy lake, just got saved as well.
""To be able to see him turn his life to the Lord is awesome because that's what it's all about,"" Pastor Noble says. ""The whole thing is all about reaching people who are far from God.""

Barr said the report is clear that Mueller was concerned about that as well, examining 10 different episodes in which Trump was accused of possible obstruction. But none of those led to actionable charges against the president.
Trump followed Barr's announcement with a press conference of his own, stating what he's maintained all along: ""No collusion, no obstruction.""
""We do have to get to the bottom of these things, I will say,"" Trump said. ""I say it in front of my friends, this should never happen to another president again, this hoax.""

Vice President Mike Pence said, ""After two years of investigation, conducted with the full cooperation of this Administration, that involved hundreds of witness interviews and millions of pages of documents, the American people can see for themselves: no collusion, no obstruction.""
President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he's read the full unredacted report and it doesn't contain a ""single surprise."" And the Trump team wants to know how the whole idea to wiretap Trump's campaign even began, Giuliani saying it ""sounds like a counterintelligence trap.""
Democrats are angry over how the release of the report was handled, objecting to the fact that the White House was given an early preview and to Barr's press conference ahead of the report going public.
But Barr says a second version of the report - with most of the redacted material revealed - would be given to the top-ranking House and Senate lawmakers from both parties since they're allowed to view sensitive classified information.
The House Judiciary Committee is now requesting Mueller speak for himself about his work, in a public congressional hearing by May 23."
"'Blatant, Illegal Religious Discrimination'?: For a Second Time, San Antonio Says No to Chick-fil-A",www.cbn.com,Heather Sells,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/blatant-illegal-religious-discrimination-for-a-second-time-san-antonio-says-no-to-chick-fil-a-nbsp,"A San Antonio city councilman running for mayor tried again Thursday to persuade the city council to consider including Chick-fil-A in its airport concessions contract.
""I consider this opportunity today to be a defining moment for this council,"" Councilman Greg Brockhouse said in introducing the proposal, according to the San Antonio Express-News .
But the council narrowly rejected Brockhouse's move to reconsider the issue at its next meeting, voting 6-5 against the measure.
Brockhouse told CBN News Wednesday that the fate of the chicken restaurant in the city's airport has become ""the number one issue"" in the mayoral election, scheduled for Saturday, May 4th.
And Brockhouse said the faith community is paying attention. ""I think it's awoken a sweeping bloc of people here,"" he said, ""where I'm at it's always a topic.""
In March, Councilman Roberto Trevino led the charge for a vote to remove Chick-fil-A from the concessions contract, citing its history of giving to organizations he categorized as anti-LGBTQ.
Chick-fil-A has been open about its charitable giving. A recent report explained its donations to local groups in Atlanta as well as national organizations such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Salvation Army, Junior Achievement and the Paul Anderson Youth Homes.
Brockhouse's opponent in the May 4th election, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, has cited business reasons for his opposition to Chick-fil-A, saying he would prefer a local company at the airport and one that was open on Sundays.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told the mayor and council after its first vote on Chick-fil-A that he had ""serious concerns"" about religious liberty. Paxton said he's starting an investigation to determine if the vote violates state law and has asked the federal Department of Transportation to review it as well.
The Dallas-based religious liberty law firm First Liberty is also investigating, requesting documents from San Antonio city officials on the vote.
""The city's decision to ban Chick-fil-A was blatant, illegal religious discrimination,"" said Hiram Sasser, First Liberty's general counsel. ""We want to know just how deep the religious animosity runs within San Antonio's city government.""
First Liberty attorney Keisha Russell told CBN News that the recent Supreme Court decision involving Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece cake shop in Denver, might influence how investigators view what's happening in San Antonio.
""The city council members are demonstrating hostility which is one of the things that the court said in Masterpiece is blatantly unconstitutional,"" she said.
Chick-fil-A is running into opposition at two other airports as well. The Buffalo Niagara International airport disinvited the company from opening a new restaurant in its food court.
And in San Jose, the city council has voted to allow a Chick-fil-A restaurant at the airport but also to hang LGBTQ flags nearby."
"50 Millennial Women Preachers Get Real: #MeToo, Social Media-Depression, and Women's Role in the Church",www.cbn.com,Charlene Aaron,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/50-millennial-women-preachers-get-real-metoo-social-media-depression-and-womens-role-in-the-church,"The Word Network hosted a panel of 50 predominately African-American female preachers this week during a special broadcast called, ""Young Preacher Ladies Night Edition.""
The nearly two-hour broadcast, which was also streamed on the network's Facebook page, was hosted by Bishop Greg Davis.
Panelists included women pastors, preachers, evangelists, and business leaders such as Nona Jones, Head of Faith Based Partnerships for Facebook, Dr. Kellie Lane-Agueze of Warrior Nation Ministries, Dr. Irishea Hilliard, Senior Pastor of New Light Church in Houston Texas, Evangelist LaTrice Ryan and many more.
The first topic of the night was about how this generation of women preachers differ from previous generations of female ministers.
""According to George Barna Research group, it's tripled, I would say since 1994, women pastors, women in ministry,"" said Evangelist Tiffany Morriar, founder of GLAM Empowerment Network. ""I think that's because there is a correlation now with female empowerment. Previous generations did not incorporate female empowerment. So, now we're giving voice to issues that haven't been addressed in previous generations.""
Dr. Hilliard said, ""We stand on the shoulders of the generation before us. We would not be here and where we are had they not paved the way. So yes, our style may be different. Our approach may be different. But the ministry is still the same. And I think you've got women leading in all areas, which makes it a little easier for us to lead in this area.""
Several women commented on the importance of the #MeToo Movement and sexual harassment and abuse within the church.
Karri Turner of Atlanta said, ""I think it's interesting in terms of the MeToo Movement and what has happened in the entertainment industry. We know it has happened in church year after year, day after day, unfortunately.""
""A part of the challenge is women having to navigate places that are safe for us,"" added Turner.
Jones suggested, ""We need to stop covering for people because that's how people get hurt. I have had that happen. I had a very prominent pastor send me a picture of his crotch because he thought that I liked him. And I had to politely tell him no sir I am married and there's no platform that you can give me that is worth what you are asking me.""
Panelists also tackled the issue of women breaking through the so-called 'glass ceiling' in ministry.
""I've been on a pastoral team in three different states, three different denominations,"" said Jennifer Carner of Atlanta. ""And one thing that I've noticed is that women are often tolerated instead of being accepted. I think it's important if we're going to continue to crack and break this glass ceiling that we accept women for their gifts, credentials and all they bring to the kingdom.""
Kellie Lane-Agueze had a different take on the subject. ""I feel like God is positioning women now to where it doesn't matter if anyone lets you in,"" she explained. ""I feel like God is doing something so amazing, like so many power houses in the room that there's so much fruit that at this point, we cannot be denied. And because we cannot be denied, it doesn't matter whether someone accepts us or not because when God calls you.""
The ministers also weighed in on the issue of equal pay for women preachers.
""I think there is a difference between the way men's honorariums are treated to women's, and black women especially,"" said one panelist.
Davis said he witnessed inequality regarding female preachers first hand. ""I was married for twenty years to Pastor Kim Davis, she preached at the same church that I preach at,"" he said. ""My check would be one thing; same amount of work. And I was offended by it.""
As the evening went on, pitfalls and addiction to social media also came up.
""When it does promote you, more than it does God,"" shared one panelist. ""I think of course social media is a wonderful platform. But when we are so consumed with filters and how we look and pushing, us, us, us, I think it becomes dangerous. So, we have to have a balance between it.""
Nona Jones commented, ""One thing that we know in the research is that when it comes to social media, it's the passive consumption of content that leads to feelings of isolation and depression. It's community that leads to feelings of belonging and well-being and so don't go back and forth with people. Just celebrate each other.""
Dr. Nycole Lyles-Belton from Atlantic City, NJ said, ""I think when social media gets to a place where it's infecting your life and not being a positive effect in anyone else's life, you need to get off. We noticed when there was a moment when Instagram wasn't working, and Facebook was down that many people were losing their minds. If we lost Facebook and we lost Instagram, would your life still be valid?""
Meanwhile, more than 70,000 people viewed the broadcast on Facebook."
Dave Adamson: The Price of Christian Free Speech,www.cbn.com,Dave Adamson,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/dave-adamson-the-price-of-christian-free-speech,"COMMENTARY
This op-ed originally published on Fox News, republished here by permission from the author.
I am a Christian who is all for free speech—but freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.
After my last op-ed for Fox News, which was about the future of the church, I received thousands of negative comments from other Christians. People even tracked down my email address so they could personally inbox their animosity. One follower of Jesus emailed to tell me I was personally responsible for an increase in school shootings. Another said my ""way of thinking is what makes people kill themselves.""
And this is just one, small example of how Christians are so quick to turn on other Christians online. As soon as there's a difference of opinion, Christians undo Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane that we would be one as God and Jesus are one, by piling on unmerited personal insults.
While Jesus said we should love one another, treat others kindly, and pray for people regularly, it seems his followers prefer to troll one another, tweet about others maliciously, and prey on people. And when Christians take to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to attack each other with irresponsible, non-empathetic vitriol, it's our faith that suffers.
While First Century followers of Jesus were known for their love and compassion, 21st-century followers of Jesus are renowned for our vitriol and animosity. How did our reputation devolve to this place?
I've watched Christians routinely justify their criticism with Jesus' words in Matthew 18:15-20, telling ourselves that we have the religious duty to confront fellow believers with their ""sin"". But in doing so, we deliberately step over the application of this passage, which comes when Jesus tells us to treat people who refuse our correction as a ""Gentile and a tax collector"" (verse 17). Do you remember how Jesus treated Gentiles and tax collectors? He visited their homes. He ate with them. He had compassion for them. He served them. He loved them.
What do Jesus' followers do in the age of social media? We vilify them in the comments section.
Instead of using scripture to start conversations like Jesus so often did, we use scripture to end conversations. But as author Bob Goff says; ""Jesus told the people he was with that it's not enough to just look like you love God. He said we'd know the extent of our love for God by how well we loved people.""
And which people should we love? That's easy right: those with the same theology, lifestyle, financial status, political views, skin color, nationality, family background, traditions, customs, and overall approach to life, right?
Well, when Jesus was asked who we should love by a religious expert, he said we should love everyone—including those we are most different from. Jesus answered this question by telling a story we know as The Good Samaritan. Nowadays, we use this story to represent the importance of roadside assistance—but that wasn't the point when Jesus told the parable. To the Jews listening to Jesus, the Samaritans were the most despised of people groups. To them, there was no such thing as a ""good"" Samaritan because they believed there was not an ounce of good in Samaritans! It would be like saying someone was a ""good white supremacist.""
But by making the morally inferior, theologically incorrect, racially despised Samaritan the hero of the story, Jesus was saying we should love ALL of our neighbors—even those we disagree with, who frustrate us, who have a completely opposite world view, who vote differently, and even those people who have hurt us.
This is, of course, easier said than done, but it starts by asking who the ""Samaritan"" is in your life. Who is the person, or people group, you most despise?
For me, it's the uncle who sexually abused me from the age of six until I was 11. This man caused me to grow up feeling scared, worthless, rejected, and ashamed—am I supposed to treat him kindly Jesus? Am I supposed to pray for him?
According to Jesus, yes. Simple to say, extremely hard to do. Now, that doesn't mean I should have him in my life, and if you've been abused by someone, they don't have to be part of yours. But Jesus didn't call us to respond with malice and vindictiveness to people who mistreat, disrespect, hurt, or offend us—even when it is justified. He called us to the exact opposite—to love.
The world says revenge, retribution and retaliation are justified—but if Christians are going to make a difference in the world, we have to be different from the world. As pastor Andy Stanley says; ""Imagine a world where unbelievers were skeptical of what we believed, but envious of how we treated one another.""
I'm sure some reading this are already winding up to lob unkind words, trolling comments and angry emails my way … I just hope and pray the Christians reading this will see that the world is changed by our example, not our angry opinions—and we are changed by the example of Jesus.

The Hospital Built on Faith: 'Proof to Me That God is Real',www.cbn.com,Stephen Little,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/the-hospital-built-on-faith-proof-to-me-that-god-is-real,"Click on the interview above to hear how ‘desperate prayers’ brought about miracles from God.
All his life Klaus-Dieter John has struggled with faith in God.
“I must say that faith has always been very difficult to me,” the missionary doctor told CBN News. “It has been the deepest desire of my heart to see whether God is true… I mean the Bible says you can pray and He will respond. I wanted to know if this was the case, so my whole life you can say has been an experiment with God, praying out of desperation.”
His life of experimental faith not only confirms that he serves a miracle-working God, but it’s bringing a miracle to some of the neediest people in Peru in the form of a hospital that provides them with first-rate healthcare.
The hospital is called Diopsi Suyana, an Inca word that means ‘we trust in God.” In 11 years, it’s served about 330,000 patients and delivered the Gospel message to more than half-a-million Peruvians.
Most of the patients are Quecha people, descendants of the Incas, who live in dire poverty with no running water and no electricity, but thanks to Klaus and his wife’s faith and perseverance they are served by a hospital as well-equipped as any in the U.S.
It includes operating rooms, intensive care, dental and optical health, and a pharmacy where 35 doctors, nurses and other health care professionals volunteer their services.
Patients are expected to pay for their health care, but the amount is based on their income and they often receive assistance from the hospital’s charitable foundation.
Not Just Healthcare, but Soulcare
Those patients often bring family and friends, giving the hospital pastors an opportunity to share the Gospel message with many more.
“We start every morning with a church service, so we have celebrated 3,000 church services and half a million Peruvians have listened to the story of the cross of Christ, the empty tomb, hope for eternal life,” Klaus said.
One of the hospital’s pastors follows up with the converts, ensuring that ministry doesn’t stop at the hospital.
“He drove through the south of the country in Peru to visit people who converted at our hospital and he helped them get in touch with local churches. It’s a neat follow-up program and we know that 50 percent of the people who raise their hand at the service, they end up in a local church where they are,” said Klaus.
A Series of Miracles
The challenges of bringing his dream to reality tested Klaus’s faith on a daily basis, forcing him to pray with greater intensity.
“It’s a miracle story, a long line of special events that are even convincing to agnostics and atheists,” he said.
He went through just a few of those ‘special events’ that proved God’s faithfulness.
When he needed a construction engineer – a professional with years of experience who would VOLUNTEER his time to oversee the building of the hospital -- Klaus’s lawyer passed on a name. Klaus called him up, made an appointment and later that day made his presentation.
When Klaus finished speaking, the engineer’s wife told him a remarkable story.
“Three days ago we started praying to God about a special purpose for our life and this morning we were sitting in our kitchen for three hours saying ‘What could it be?’ And then we prayed and as we said ‘Amen’ the phone rang, and it was you.”
They came to Peru in 2006 and never looked back. The engineer has overseen construction of the hospital, a school for local children and missionary kids, and a media center. All for free.
Then there’s the time a customs officials confiscated the projector Klaus used for his presentations and he was forced to go buy another. That led to a chance encounter with the head of a telecommunications company who donated $250,000 in satellite equipment and Internet connections to the hospital.
Once, when they ran short of cement during construction, a truck mysteriously showed up with 600 sacks. The $5,000 donation came from out of the blue because the company’s owner read about their work in the local newspaper.
The same company later donated another $70,000 to finish the roof and install ceiling tiles.
Those are just the ‘big’ miracles: More than 50,000 individual donors have given millions to help build and sustain the hospital.
The Fight for Faith
Klaus says the trying journey to build and expand Diospi Suyana has only strengthened his faith and confirmed his belief in God.
He even titled his book about his experience, “I Have Seen God,” and he often turns to his book when he faces new challenges.
“ It is for me a great encouragement to see that God has been faithful, 20 years ago – 10 years ago – and then I find the courage to believe that He be faithful tomorrow, as well. For me, faith has never been ‘Hallelujah, praise the Lord’ – always struggling, struggling, clinging to the cross of Christ out of desperation.”
He’s not discouraged or embittered by the constant struggle, because he believes that serving God is about moving beyond worldly pursuits and enduring hardship to see the Kingdom of God established.
“I say Christianity is not easy. It means you have to give everything – your life, your money, your time – you have to sweat, you’re in tears, but eventually you’ll see that God will take you through.”"

The severe weather that rumbled across North Texas, the Texas Panhandle, Mississippi and southeastern Kansas mid-week now moves through the Deep South.
Over 4 inches of rain, with hail, is possible in Birmingham, Alabama; Jackson, Mississippi; and Atlanta through Saturday and Sunday. Forecasters say to expect damaging winds, heavy rain, and threats of tornadoes, particularly in parts of Florida, the Carolinas and Virginia.
Folks in central Arkansas have already been feeling effects of the storm system after record-breaking rain in just a short amount of time led to flooding and creeks overflowing.
Earlier in the week, a Texas couple got the shock of their life, when a massive tree that used to provide shade for their home, fell in the middle of the night.
""It really scared us, it really scared us,"" said Ana Kiroga, a resident of Houston.
The tree, narrowly missing their home and their neighbor's, just as severe storms ripped through the Houston area Wednesday.
""We're Christians at this house and this is prayers right here – we just remodeled this house right here – we're remodeling and not even a broken window,"" said Michael Martinez. All this is happening days after dozens of tornadoes swept from East Texas to Georgia last weekend leaving at least eight dead."
"Here's What You Need to Know About the Mueller Report, and Why More Drama Is on the Way",www.cbn.com,Jennifer Wishon,04-19-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-mueller-report-and-why-more-drama-is-on-the-way,"WHITE HOUSE – Here's the 400-page Mueller report in a nutshell: 10 instances of *potential* obstruction were investigated, and no collusion was discovered with Russia. Attorney General Bill Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein both concluded the president did not commit any crimes.
The White House is describing the special counsel's report as a total victory for the president. They say it's the exoneration they've predicted from the start. ""It's called no collusion, no obstruction,"" Trump said.
But Democrats were already pushing back before the full report was even released. And now they see the report as a treasure trove to help launch future congressional investigations.
On Friday, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler issued a subpoena demanding to see the full Mueller report without any redactions. President Trump retweeted contradictory statements by Nadler over the years, comparing his past protection of Bill Clinton to his behavior in the Trump investigation.

Speaking at a wounded warriors event, the president said, ""This should never happen to another president again, this hoax.""
Now on offense, the president's legal team calls the investigation politically motivated ""abuse"" launched by former FBI Director James Comey.
Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said on CBN News' Faith Nation, ""It'll be very interesting to see what happens in the days ahead, but I think we played by the law and the law is clear and we are going to insist on the law being followed and that means whether it's at the House or the Senate and in any case if there's an issue that we think is worthy to litigate, we will litigate it.""
The Mueller report states that it ""…does not conclude the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" But Sekulow pointed out that special counsels do not have the power convict or exonerate anyone in the first place.
Still, Barr was forthcoming about the investigation, explaining, ""The report recounts 10 episodes involving the president and discusses potential legal theories for connecting those activities to the elements of an obstruction offense.""
Those ten episodes – recounted in the partially redacted release – range from President Trump's perceived efforts to seize control of the Russia investigation to the president's endeavors to force the special counsel's removal, which were ""mostly unsuccessful… because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders.""
Barr said, ""President Trump faced an unprecedented situation.""
The weight of that unprecedented cloud was revealed in the release, with the president cursing, stating ""this is the end of my presidency"" when he learned about the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
""The president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency,"" Barr said.
Detailed in the report – the Russian intelligence hacking campaign and Russian effort to sow social discord through disinformation and social media operations.
Barr said it's clear that ""the Russian government sought to interfere in our election process.""
But any links between the Trump campaign and Russia were deemed insufficient evidence to bring charges. While Russians did try to contact and influence the Trump team, the report found no evidence of success.
""The Russian operatives who participated in these schemes did not have the cooperation of the Trump campaign,"" Barr explained.
The redacted report was shared directly with the White House attorneys before its release since their client was the subject of the report.
""No one outside the department has seen the unredacted report with the exception of certain sections that were made available to IC, the Intel Committee for their advice on protecting intel sources and methods,"" Barr explained.
The White House did not choose to use executive privilege to issue any further redactions than what had already been removed from the report by the DOJ.
Barr said, ""Given the limited nature of the redactions, I believe that the publicly released report will allow every American to understand the results.""
Some lawmakers with security clearances will get an expanded version without as many redactions. ""These members of Congress will be able to see all of the redacted material for themselves with a limited exception,"" Barr said.
Capping off the DOJ's release, an answer from Barr reveals more drama still ahead. ""I have no objection to Bob Mueller personally testifying,"" Barr told reporters. With congressional Democrats unsatisfied with the release of the report, that Mueller testimony seems quite likely.
Here at the White House, officials feel confident. After two years, hundreds of interviews, subpoenas and search warrants, officials say it's highly unlikely Congress could uncover something the special counsel did not."

Christian Business Woman Imprisoned in Kuwait Hopes She'll See Freedom on Easter Sunday | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-19-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/christian-business-woman-imprisoned-in-kuwait-hopes-shell-see-freedom-on-easter-sunday,"Christian Business Woman Imprisoned in Kuwait Hopes She'll See Freedom on Easter Sunday 04-19-2019 Emily Jones Christian Businesswoman Marsha Lazareva
A very influential Christian businesswoman in the Middle East is fighting for her freedom from a prison cell in Kuwait.
Marsha Lazareva, a Russian national whose five-year-old son is an American citizen, says she was wrongly convicted in 2018 for allegedly misusing public funds in Kuwait while serving as the chief executive and vice-chairman of the private equity group KGL Investment (KGLI). She was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor.
Lazareva has a chance at redemption this Easter Sunday. She has an appeal hearing Sunday to determine if she will stay behind bars or walk free with her son, who is still living in Kuwait without his mother.
Several political heavy-hitters have rallied behind Lazareva to demand her release, including former Republican California Rep. Ed Royce, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, and Neil Bush, the son of former US president George H.W. Bush.
Lazareva told Forbes that the judge who presided over her case discriminated against her for being a woman and would not allow her to bring a proper defense.
""In spite of numerous requests by my lawyers, the judge denied me full access to all accusatory documents and also denied my calling of all my witnesses,"" she said.

""The last thing we want is for Kuwait to have a blemish on their otherwise good standing. … The company that's being harassed, to put it mildly, has provided great service to the US Defense Department over many years.""
Freeh told the news organization the witnesses who testified against Lazareva have recanted. The $496 million that Kuwait authorities accused Lazareva of embezzling were actually frozen while passing through a bank in Dubai. Even though the money was released in February, Lazareva is still behind bars.
""It's awful. The evidence wouldn't stand up (in the US legal system),"" Freeh said. ""We have legal processes that at least give the defendant the opportunity to call a witness or cross-examine a government witness, so they were really denied all of that here.""
Lazareva and her team are hoping for a second chance on Easter Sunday. Freeh will be serving as one of her attorneys and expert witnesses during the appeal.
In the meantime, Freeh says the emotional stress from the case is weighing heavily on the Lazareva. "

WHITE HOUSE – Here's the 400-page Mueller report in a nutshell: 10 instances of *potential* obstruction were investigated, and no collusion was discovered with Russia. Attorney General Bill Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein both concluded the president did not commit any crimes.
The White House is describing the special counsel's report as a total victory for the president. They say it's the exoneration they've predicted from the start. ""It's called no collusion, no obstruction,"" Trump said.
But Democrats were already pushing back before the full report was even released. And now they see the report as a treasure trove to help launch future congressional investigations.
On Friday, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler issued a subpoena demanding to see the full Mueller report without any redactions. President Trump retweeted contradictory statements by Nadler over the years, comparing his past protection of Bill Clinton to his behavior in the Trump investigation.

Christian Business Woman Imprisoned in Kuwait Hopes She'll See Freedom on Easter Sunday,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-19-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/christian-business-woman-imprisoned-in-kuwait-hopes-shell-see-freedom-on-easter-sunday,"A very influential Christian businesswoman in the Middle East is fighting for her freedom from a prison cell in Kuwait.
Marsha Lazareva, a Russian national whose five-year-old son is an American citizen, says she was wrongly convicted in 2018 for allegedly misusing public funds in Kuwait while serving as the chief executive and vice-chairman of the private equity group KGL Investment (KGLI). She was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor.
Lazareva has a chance at redemption this Easter Sunday. She has an appeal hearing Sunday to determine if she will stay behind bars or walk free with her son, who is still living in Kuwait without his mother.
Several political heavy-hitters have rallied behind Lazareva to demand her release, including former Republican California Rep. Ed Royce, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, and Neil Bush, the son of former US president George H.W. Bush.
Lazareva told Forbes that the judge who presided over her case discriminated against her for being a woman and would not allow her to bring a proper defense.
""In spite of numerous requests by my lawyers, the judge denied me full access to all accusatory documents and also denied my calling of all my witnesses,"" she said. ""All my human and civil rights were completely violated during the court hearings. The judge made many racist comments toward me during the case and singled me out as a woman.""
Lazareva posted $33 million in joint bail with another business executive involved in the case but is still sitting in prison.
Neil Bush told The Daily Caller news foundation her case is a ""human rights issue.""
""My dad, who organized the coalition to liberate Kuwait, was proud till his last day that Kuwait was an honorable, respected member of a group of civilized nations,"" Bush said. ""The last thing we want is for Kuwait to have a blemish on their otherwise good standing. … The company that's being harassed, to put it mildly, has provided great service to the US Defense Department over many years.""

The $496 million that Kuwait authorities accused Lazareva of embezzling were actually frozen while passing through a bank in Dubai. Even though the money was released in February, Lazareva is still behind bars.

'State of the Bible': Study Shows Deeper Relationship with God's Word Leads to More Meaningful Life,www1.cbn.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/state-of-the-bible-study-shows-deeper-relationship-with-gods-word-leads-to-more-meaningful-life,"'State of the Bible': Study Shows Deeper Relationship with God's Word Leads to More Meaningful Life 04-20-2019
The American Bible Society 's annual "" State of the Bible "" study conducted by Barna Group, has affirmed that a deeper relationship with the word of God is the pathway to a more meaningful life.
Other results also found by Barna Group researchers include:
• 21 million new people are looking to the Bible for wisdom and guidance this year. • 14.9 million people who were disengaged in 2018 have chosen to return and interact with the Bible. • 9.9 million ""Bible-centered"" adults have decreased their level of engagement with the Bible since last year.
Taken together, these changes have led to a swelling in the ranks of the so-called ""moveable middle"" to 41.6 million adults, those people who interact with the Bible looking for practical advice for their modern lives.
The study shows that Bible-engaged people are more financially generous than those who are unengaged. Volunteerism also increases with Bible engagement. Beyond financial contributions, Bible-engaged people are more generous with their time: 57 percent of Bible-centered adults are inclined to be more generous with their time, compared to just 2 percent of the Bible-friendly and 3 percent of the Bible-neutral.
According to the study, almost 60 percent of Americans say the message of the Bible has transformed their lives. Specifically, Bible users feel peaceful, encouraged and hopeful and have a sense of direction. Results also show that Bible engagement has a positive influence on behaviors including:
• How they treat people of a different race than themselves • Their support for refugees • Their decisions at work or school ""Our research shows that when people engage with the Word, their lives are bettered,"" Roy Peterson, president, and CEO of American Bible Society said in a press release. ""They find wisdom, hope, and healing. In today's sometimes turbulent times, the Bible can provide welcome answers.""

Presidential Writer’s Amazing ‘God’ Story: From Homelessness and Abuse to Victory,www1.cbn.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/presidential-writer-rsquo-s-amazing-lsquo-god-rsquo-story-from-homelessness-and-abuse-to-victory,"Presidential Writer’s Amazing ‘God’ Story: From Homelessness and Abuse to Victory 04-20-2019 (Image credit: PureFlix Insider)
Douglas MacKinnon has had a fascinating life and career. A writer for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, a former Pentagon official and an author and columnist, MacKinnon’s career has been robust and impactful — but it’s his faith journey that has perhaps been the most transformative and uplifting.
MacKinnon, who wrote the Easter book The Forty Days: A Vision of Christ's Lost Weeks has a personal story of overcoming the odds that is quite powerful.
“Our parents were severe dysfunctional alcoholics,” he told, “The Pure Flix Podcast” of his abusive upbringing. “They didn’t care about the three children they had.”
READ ALSO: 4 Dangers of Misplacing Our Purpose and Identity — and the Fix
By the time MacKinnon was 17 years old, he had been evicted from 34 homes, sometimes being booted out of three or four houses per year.
“We ended up homeless many, many times as children,” he said, noting that his family lived in cars, tents, and parks.
Somehow, though, he overcame, found success and made his way to Washington, D.C. MacKinnon said that faith was a sustaining force early on in his life, recalling the importance of a plastic nativity that he saw in his school when he was just 5 years old.
Listen to his amazing story:
“I became … enamored with this little plastic nativity scene,” he said. “I saw the little smiling [baby Jesus] face … smiling back at me and I have no explanation for it ... I was instantly struck.”
Years later, MacKinnon’s love for his faith only intensified. In recent decades, he felt himself being called to write a story, with mysterious promptings urging him along the way.
“Once or twice a year in the middle of doing something I’d have this literal flash in my head for a second or two and it was always ‘The Forty Days — there’s a great story there. Tell it,’” he explained. “I’d ignore it.”
READ ALSO: The Powerful Lessons the ‘Thief on the Cross’ Teaches Us All
But those promptings kept coming. Eventually, he wrote the words “The Forty Days” on a yellow Post-It note in his office and his wife questioned what it was referencing. He told her he didn’t know but continued feeling called toward this mysterious story.
Then, about three years ago, something incredible happened.
“I was sitting at my desk in my home office working on an entirely different project [and] out of nowhere … this entire story about ‘The Forty Days’ just flooded into my head in a few minutes,” MacKinnon said. “I sat at that desk for the next 10 hours straight and wrote down the story exactly as it came into my mind that day.”
MacKinnon said he had no idea what was happening, but that he felt compelled to write it all down, with names, storylines and more. The experience was so surreal that he called ministers and priests the next day to ask for their advice on what he should do with the finished product.
“They said, ‘Well, Doug, this is something, no matter how it came to you, we believe it’s your obligation to tell that story,” he said.
So, MacKinnon published The Forty Days: A Vision of Christ's Lost Weeks and the novel has been impacting lives with a stunning retelling of the gospel story of Christ’s death . The novel’s description offers up a powerful narrative:
Seventy years after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, in a poor, one room home built from stone, mud, and straw located just outside of Jerusalem, a frail old man tells his granddaughter and her husband of an amazing and miraculous secret. A secret that, because of fear, he kept to himself for decades. When he was an orphaned 9-year-old street urchin on a street in Jerusalem, he had an encounter with a “bloody and beaten” man who was being forced to drag a heavy timber cross for His own crucifixion. The old man tells of what he witnessed first-hand of the lost 40 days Jesus walked the earth.
READ ALSO: 5 Powerful Bible Verses About Jesus’ Resurrection and Easter
MacKinnon, who donates proceeds from the book to charity, has spent the past two years trying to share the story with as many people as possible.
“Every single person who has read this story has been deeply touched and deeply moved,” he said, adding that he simply wants to remind people of what Jesus was preaching. Looking for more on the Easter story? Check out these amazing shows and movies .

'The Violent Type of People': Drug Cartels Taking Advantage of Migrant Tidal Wave Distraction | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/the-violent-type-of-people-drug-cartels-taking-advantage-of-migrant-tidal-wave-distraction,"Drugs seized at the US-Mexico border (Photo: screen capture) 6023927888001 'The Violent Type of People': Drug Cartels Taking Advantage of Migrant Tidal Wave Distraction
NEW MEXICO'S SOUTHERN BORDER - US Customs and Border Protection shut down a border crossing Saturday between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas, saying the crisis of migrants crossing illegally requires the agency to deploy its agents along the unguarded border fence.
But in nearby New Mexico, the risks to America go even beyond the flood of illegal immigration.
As the tidal wave of migrants at the southern border dominates the attention of authorities, cartels are using the distraction to ship record amounts of drugs into the US. So far this fiscal year, seizures of cocaine along the border are on pace to triple last year's totals.
The Johnson family has been ranching 160,000 acres of the New Mexico desert for four generations.
Joe Johnson tells CBN News, ""Well my grandfather came here in 1918, and we've been here 101 years this year.""
He's seen the makeup of illegal border crossers change over the years. ""I think what we have coming through us is the violent type of people... More drug traffic.""
""This right here is what the border patrol calls nineteen canyon. And we've been told many times we ought to stay out of here because of the danger. But we can't. We have to keep an eye on our border.""
And here that's nothing more than a barbed wire fence, built by these ranchers more than 40 years ago. But drug runners cut the fence and drive in with thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, and other dangerous drugs.
That's not the only problem facing the Johnsons. From theft to disease, their cattle and livelihood are being put at risk.
Joe says, ""This is all that's keeping us apart right now. And we've had people coming out of Mexico and stealing our cattle.""
Joe's son Russell says not having a border barrier costs them plenty. ""We experience a lot of sickness from all these groups coming through running cattle off the water, sending the cow one way and the calf the other way....and they were breaking out into pasturella pneumonia which is a stress-induced disease that, if not caught within 24-48 hours, they are dead,"" Russell says.
And these risks extend to the entire US food chain. The United States hasn't had an outbreak of Hoof and Mouth disease since the 1920s. But it's still common here in Central and South America.
""These people coming from way south could be carrying hoof and mouth on their feet. And we're told that can last a couple of weeks I believe on someone's feet,"" Joe says.
A government report last month exposed the significant threat. It shows the US would be unable to quickly handle an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease, as there's not enough vaccine to treat all the American cattle and swine at risk. That could cost more than $19 billion in lost exports alone.
""I think the only way things are going to get better is to build a wall on this border,"" Joe says.

United Methodists Edge Toward Breakup Over LGBT Policies | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/united-methodists-edge-toward-breakup-over-lgbt-policies,"United Methodists Edge Toward Breakup Over LGBT Policies 04-20-2019 Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) — There’s at least one area of agreement among conservative, centrist and liberal leaders in the United Methodist Church: America’s largest mainline Protestant denomination is on a path toward likely breakup over differences on same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBT pastors.
The differences have simmered for years and came to a head in February at a conference in St. Louis where delegates voted 438-384 for a proposal called the Traditional Plan, which strengthens bans on LGBT-inclusive practices. A majority of U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan and favored LGBT-friendly options, but they were outvoted by U.S. conservatives teamed with most of the delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines.
Many believe the vote will prompt an exodus from the church by liberal congregations that are already expressing their dissatisfaction over the move.
Some churches have raised rainbow flags in a show of LGBT solidarity. Some pastors have vowed to defy the strict rules and continue to allow gay weddings in Methodist churches. Churches are withholding dues payments to the main office in protest, and the UMC’s receipts were down 20 percent in March, according to financial reports posted online.
“It’s time for some kind of separation, some kind of amicable divorce,” said James Howell, pastor of Myers Park United Methodist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, who posted a video assailing the proposal for its “real meanness.”
The UMC’s nine-member Judicial Council convenes a four-day meeting in Evanston, Illinois, on Tuesday to consider legal challenges to the Traditional Plan. If the plan is upheld, it would take effect for U.S. churches on Jan. 1. If parts of it are struck down, that would likely trigger new debate at the UMC’s next general conference in May 2020.
The UMC’s largest church — the 22,000-member Church of the Resurrection with four locations in the Kansas City area — is among those applying financial pressure. Its lead pastor, Adam Hamilton, says his church is temporarily withholding half of the $2.5 million that it normally would have paid to the UMC’s head office at this stage of the year.
“We’ll ultimately pay it,” Hamilton said. “But we want to show that this is the impact if our churches leave.”
Hamilton is among the opponents of the Traditional Plan leading an initiative dubbed UMC-Next that seeks the best path forward for those who share their views. Clergy and activists in the alliance have met in Texas and Georgia, and a bigger meeting is planned for May 20-22 at Hamilton’s megachurch.
Hamilton, in a telephone interview, said two main options are under consideration.
Under one scenario, many centrists and liberals would leave en masse to form a new denomination — a potentially complex endeavor given likely disputes over the dissolution process.
Under the other option, opponents of the Traditional Plan would stay in the UMC and resist from within, insisting on LGBT-inclusive policies and eventually convincing the conservatives that they should be the faction that leaves under what’s envisioned as a financially smooth “gracious exit.”
“There’s a sense that some conservatives have been wanting to leave for a long time,” Hamilton said. “They’re tired of fighting about it.”
Formed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist Church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the United States.
While other mainline Protestant denominations have embraced gay-friendly practices, the UMC still bans them, though acts of defiance by pro-LGBT clergy have multiplied. Many have performed same-sex weddings; others have come out as gay or lesbian from the pulpit.
Enforcement of the bans has been inconsistent; the Traditional Plan aspires to beef up discipline against those engaged in defiance.
Traditional Plan supporter Mark Tooley, who heads a conservative Christian think tank, predicts that the UMC will split into three denominations — one for centrists, another oriented toward liberal activists and a third representing the global alliance of U.S. conservatives and their allies overseas.
“It’s a question of how long it takes for that to unfold — and of who and how many go into each denomination,” Tooley said. “A lot of churches will be irreparably harmed as they divide.”
Scott Jones, bishop of the UMC’s Houston-based Texas conference, says churchgoers in his region are divided in their views, but a majority supports the Traditional Plan’s concepts.
“I have urged all of us to love each other, listen to each other and respect each other, even if we disagree,” said Jones, who holds out hope that the UMC’s disparate factions can preserve some form of unity.
Ann Craig of Newburgh, New York — a lesbian activist who has advocated for greater LGBT inclusion in the UMC — thinks a breakup can be avoided, though she’s unsure what lies ahead.
“We expect something new to happen, but what that change should be or will be has not jelled yet,” she said. “I don’t think we’re going to break up — it’s so cumbersome to figure out a way to divorce.”
The crisis is being followed closely at Methodist-affiliated theology schools based at universities with LGBT-inclusive policies. There are 13 UMC-connected theology schools around the country.
“There’s a lot of turmoil and distress,” said Mary Elizabeth Moore, dean of Boston University School of Theology. “We’re trying to find a future that will be less destructive than where we are now.”

United Methodists Edge Toward Breakup Over LGBT Policies,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/united-methodists-edge-toward-breakup-over-lgbt-policies,"NEW YORK (AP) — There’s at least one area of agreement among conservative, centrist and liberal leaders in the United Methodist Church: America’s largest mainline Protestant denomination is on a path toward likely breakup over differences on same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBT pastors.
The differences have simmered for years and came to a head in February at a conference in St. Louis where delegates voted 438-384 for a proposal called the Traditional Plan, which strengthens bans on LGBT-inclusive practices. A majority of U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan and favored LGBT-friendly options, but they were outvoted by U.S. conservatives teamed with most of the delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines.
Many believe the vote will prompt an exodus from the church by liberal congregations that are already expressing their dissatisfaction over the move.
Some churches have raised rainbow flags in a show of LGBT solidarity. Some pastors have vowed to defy the strict rules and continue to allow gay weddings in Methodist churches. Churches are withholding dues payments to the main office in protest, and the UMC’s receipts were down 20 percent in March, according to financial reports posted online.
“It’s time for some kind of separation, some kind of amicable divorce,” said James Howell, pastor of Myers Park United Methodist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, who posted a video assailing the proposal for its “real meanness.”
The UMC’s nine-member Judicial Council convenes a four-day meeting in Evanston, Illinois, on Tuesday to consider legal challenges to the Traditional Plan. If the plan is upheld, it would take effect for U.S. churches on Jan. 1. If parts of it are struck down, that would likely trigger new debate at the UMC’s next general conference in May 2020.
The UMC’s largest church — the 22,000-member Church of the Resurrection with four locations in the Kansas City area — is among those applying financial pressure. Its lead pastor, Adam Hamilton, says his church is temporarily withholding half of the $2.5 million that it normally would have paid to the UMC’s head office at this stage of the year.
“We’ll ultimately pay it,” Hamilton said. “But we want to show that this is the impact if our churches leave.”
Hamilton is among the opponents of the Traditional Plan leading an initiative dubbed UMC-Next that seeks the best path forward for those who share their views. Clergy and activists in the alliance have met in Texas and Georgia, and a bigger meeting is planned for May 20-22 at Hamilton’s megachurch.
Hamilton, in a telephone interview, said two main options are under consideration.
Under one scenario, many centrists and liberals would leave en masse to form a new denomination — a potentially complex endeavor given likely disputes over the dissolution process.
Under the other option, opponents of the Traditional Plan would stay in the UMC and resist from within, insisting on LGBT-inclusive policies and eventually convincing the conservatives that they should be the faction that leaves under what’s envisioned as a financially smooth “gracious exit.”
“There’s a sense that some conservatives have been wanting to leave for a long time,” Hamilton said. “They’re tired of fighting about it.”
Formed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist Church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the United States.
While other mainline Protestant denominations have embraced gay-friendly practices, the UMC still bans them, though acts of defiance by pro-LGBT clergy have multiplied. Many have performed same-sex weddings; others have come out as gay or lesbian from the pulpit.

Presidential Writer’s Amazing ‘God’ Story: From Homelessness and Abuse to Victory,www.cbn.com,"Billy Hallowell, Pureflix.com",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/presidential-writer-rsquo-s-amazing-lsquo-god-rsquo-story-from-homelessness-and-abuse-to-victory,"Douglas MacKinnon has had a fascinating life and career. A writer for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, a former Pentagon official and an author and columnist, MacKinnon’s career has been robust and impactful — but it’s his faith journey that has perhaps been the most transformative and uplifting.
MacKinnon, who wrote the Easter book The Forty Days: A Vision of Christ's Lost Weeks has a personal story of overcoming the odds that is quite powerful.
“Our parents were severe dysfunctional alcoholics,” he told, “The Pure Flix Podcast” of his abusive upbringing. “They didn’t care about the three children they had.”

By the time MacKinnon was 17 years old, he had been evicted from 34 homes, sometimes being booted out of three or four houses per year.
“We ended up homeless many, many times as children,” he said, noting that his family lived in cars, tents, and parks.
Somehow, though, he overcame, found success and made his way to Washington, D.C. MacKinnon said that faith was a sustaining force early on in his life, recalling the importance of a plastic nativity that he saw in his school when he was just 5 years old.
Listen to his amazing story:
“I became … enamored with this little plastic nativity scene,” he said. “I saw the little smiling [baby Jesus] face … smiling back at me and I have no explanation for it ... I was instantly struck.”
Years later, MacKinnon’s love for his faith only intensified. In recent decades, he felt himself being called to write a story, with mysterious promptings urging him along the way.
“Once or twice a year in the middle of doing something I’d have this literal flash in my head for a second or two and it was always ‘The Forty Days — there’s a great story there. Tell it,’” he explained. “I’d ignore it.”

But those promptings kept coming. Eventually, he wrote the words “The Forty Days” on a yellow Post-It note in his office and his wife questioned what it was referencing. He told her he didn’t know but continued feeling called toward this mysterious story.
Then, about three years ago, something incredible happened.
“I was sitting at my desk in my home office working on an entirely different project [and] out of nowhere … this entire story about ‘The Forty Days’ just flooded into my head in a few minutes,” MacKinnon said. “I sat at that desk for the next 10 hours straight and wrote down the story exactly as it came into my mind that day.”
MacKinnon said he had no idea what was happening, but that he felt compelled to write it all down, with names, storylines and more. The experience was so surreal that he called ministers and priests the next day to ask for their advice on what he should do with the finished product.
“They said, ‘Well, Doug, this is something, no matter how it came to you, we believe it’s your obligation to tell that story,” he said.
So, MacKinnon published The Forty Days: A Vision of Christ's Lost Weeks and the novel has been impacting lives with a stunning retelling of the gospel story of Christ’s death . The novel’s description offers up a powerful narrative:
Seventy years after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, in a poor, one room home built from stone, mud, and straw located just outside of Jerusalem, a frail old man tells his granddaughter and her husband of an amazing and miraculous secret. A secret that, because of fear, he kept to himself for decades. When he was an orphaned 9-year-old street urchin on a street in Jerusalem, he had an encounter with a “bloody and beaten” man who was being forced to drag a heavy timber cross for His own crucifixion. The old man tells of what he witnessed first-hand of the lost 40 days Jesus walked the earth.

MacKinnon, who donates proceeds from the book to charity, has spent the past two years trying to share the story with as many people as possible.
“Every single person who has read this story has been deeply touched and deeply moved,” he said, adding that he simply wants to remind people of what Jesus was preaching. Looking for more on the Easter story? Check out these amazing shows and movies .

Explosions Hit 2 Churches in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-21-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/explosions-hit-2-churches-in-sri-lanka-on-easter-sunday,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Two explosions hit two churches in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, wounding at least 50 people, witnesses said.
The first blast ripped through St. Anthony’s Shrine in Colombo.
Alex Agileson, who was in the vicinity, said buildings in the surrounding area shook with the blast. He said a number of injured were carried in ambulances.
A second explosion was reported at St. Sebastian’s Church in Negombo, a Catholic majority town north of Colombo. The church has appealed for help on its Facebook page.
Sri Lankan security officials said they were checking for details. Police immediately rushed to both areas and sealed off the churches.
Local media reported some 50 people with different injuries had so far been admitted in Colombo’s main hospital.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — At least 138 people were killed and hundreds more injured in near-simultaneous blasts that rocked three churches and three luxury hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, a security official said, in the worst spout of violence in the South Asian country since its civil war ended a decade ago.
Two of the blasts were suspected to have been carried out by suicide bombers, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with reporters. Worshippers and hotel guests were among the dead, the official said.
The magnitude of the bloodshed recalled Sri Lanka’s decades-long civil war, when separatist Tamil Tigers and other rebel groups targeted the Central Bank, a shopping mall, a Buddhist temple and hotels popular with tourists.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for Sunday’s blasts.
Sri Lanka has long faced a bitter ethnic divide between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils, fueling the civil war as Tamil militants tried to carve out their own homeland.
But in the years since the war ended in 2009, a religious divide has grown, with the rise of Buddhist nationalist groups that stoke anger against the minority Muslims, saying they are stealing from Buddhist temples or desecrating them, or forcing people to convert to Islam. Muslims also own many of Sri Lanka’s small shops, and many Muslims suspect small-town jealousy has led to some attacks.
Sinhalese are overwhelmingly Buddhists, while Tamils are mostly Hindu, Muslim and Christian.
St. Anthony’s Shrine and the three hotels where Sunday’s blasts took place are in Colombo, the capital, and are frequented by foreign tourists. A National Hospital spokesman, Dr. Samindi Samarakoon, told The Associated Press that they received 47 dead there, including nine foreigners, and were treating more than 200 wounded.
Local TV showed damage at the Cinnamon Grand, Shangri-La and Kingsbury hotels.
The Shangri-La’s second-floor restaurant was gutted in the blast, with the ceiling and windows blown out. Loose wires hung and tables were overturned in the blackened space.
A police magistrate was at the hotel to inspect the bodies recovered from the restaurant. From outside the police cordon, three bodies could be seen covered in white sheets.
Alex Agieleson, who was near the shrine, said buildings shook with the blast, and that a number of injured people were carried away in ambulances.
Other blasts were reported at St. Sebastian’s Church in Negombo, a majority Catholic town north of Colombo, and at Zion Church in the eastern town of Batticaloa. St. Sebastian’s appealed for help on its Facebook page.
The explosion ripped off the roof and knocked out doors and windows at St. Sebastian’s, where people carried the wounded away from blood-stained pews, TV footage showed.
Sri Lankan security officials said they were investigating. Police immediately sealed off the areas.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe convened Sri Lanka’s top military officials at an emergency meeting of the National Security Council following the blasts. Wickremesinghe tweeted that “the government is taking immediate steps to contain the situation.”
The Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, called on Sri Lanka’s government to launch a “very impartial strong inquiry” and to punish those found responsible “mercilessly because only animals can behave like that.”
There was an outpouring of condemnation from around the world following the attacks.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the blasts “an assault on all of humanity,” while Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced them as “cruel and cynical.”
British Prime Minister Teresa May said on Twitter, “We must stand together to make sure that no one should ever have to (practice) their faith in fear.”
Sri Lankan security forces in 2009 defeated Tamil Tiger rebels who had fought to create an independent homeland for the country’s ethnic minority Tamils. The U.N. initially estimated the death toll from 26 years of fighting to be about 100,000 but a U.N. experts’ panel later said some 45,000 ethnic Tamils may have been killed in the last months of the fighting alone.
Government troops and the Tamil Tigers were both accused of grave human rights violations, which prompted local and international calls for investigations.

Sri Lankan officials failed to heed warnings from intelligence agencies about the threat of an attack by a domestic radical Muslim group that officials blame for Easter Sunday bombings that killed almost 300 people.
Six near-simultaneous attacks on three Catholic churches and three hotels around the city of Colombo were carried out by seven suicide bombers.
Inside the churches, it was utter devastation. The blasts hit during Sunday mass. Church pews were left shattered, debris was strewn everywhere, and in one church blood was splattered on a statue of Jesus.
A total of nine bombings killed at least 290 people. About 500 others were wounded.
Monday morning a van was discovered with bombs inside, parked near one of the churches. It exploded, but no one was hurt.
The archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Ranjith, is demanding justice for the massacre of Christian worshippers.
""Find out who was responsible behind this act. And also to punish them mercilessly because only animals can behave like that,"" Rangith said.
A government official says a local Muslim terrorist group called National Thowfeek Jamaath is responsible.
Because of political dysfunction within the government, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Cabinet were kept in the dark about the intelligence until after the attacks, according to Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne. The mayor of Colombo, Rosy Senanayake, called the attack ""very cowardly...at a time when, you know, innocent people would be worshipping God on an auspicious day such as Easter Sunday. They go seeking the Lord and at a time like this for somebody to come and, you know, destroy humanity, human lives is a very cowardly attack.""
At least 39 foreigners were killed in the deadly blasts, including several Americans.
President Trump sent his condolences through Twitter, writing ""we stand ready to help!""
Officials said 24 suspects were in custody for questioning.
Also on Monday, officials say police found 87 detonators near Colombo's main bus depot. It's not known if they are linked to Sunday's attacks."

MANILA, Philippines (AP) - A strong earthquake has shaken the area around the Philippine capital, prompting thousands of people to flee to safety. There were no immediate reports of injuries or widespread damage. The U.S. Geological Survey says the magnitude 6.3 quake struck northwest of Manila on Monday afternoon. It says the quake was centered near the town of Gutad on Luzon island. Philippine Institute of Seismology and Volcanology chief Renato Solidum says the quake, which was caused by movement of a local fault, was not strong enough to trigger a tsunami or cause widespread damage. However, some officials reported damage to a church in northern Pampanga province and said boulders rolled down a mountain, blocking a highway. Thousands of residents and office workers dashed out of buildings in Manila.

"Iran Supreme Leader Appoints New Military Commander Who Vows to Wage War Against Israel, US",www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/iran-supreme-leader-appoints-new-military-commander-who-vows-to-wage-war-against-israel-us,"Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei appointed a new commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Sunday (IRGC) to replace Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, who led the military since 2007.
Brig. Gen Hossein Salami is the new Major General of Iran's military force and he has already vowed to ""cleanse the planet"" of Israel and America.
In a speech aired Feb. 19 on Iran's IRINN TV, Salami said Iran's sword has been ""drawn out of its sheath"" and the Islamic regime is preparing to fight Israel, America, and their allies.
""We will break our enemy. We have decided to do so. We have a plan. We are organized and motivated. We have faith. We have martyrdom. We have Jihad. Our nation's sword has been drawn out of its sheath. Our enemies should know that we will never let them be,"" he said.
Salami also said Iran is preparing to fight its enemies ""on the global level, not just in one spot. Our war is not a local war. We have plans to defeat the world powers.""
Khamenei's decision to promote Salami to the head of Iran's military comes weeks after US President Donald Trump designated the IRGC as a ""foreign terrorist organization.""
""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" President Trump said in a statement.
The designation is the first time the United States has labeled another country's military a terrorist group.
Iranian leaders promptly responded with anger and chants of ""Death to America.""
""You think if you speak against the Revolutionary Guard you can trigger a difference in Iran?"" asked Iran's President Hassan Rouhani. ""You think the guards' popularity will decrease? Be aware that, from today, the popularity of the guards in the hearts of the Iranian nation and in the region will be more than ever.""
Iran's Revolutionary Guard has hundreds of thousands of members and oversees the country’s ballistic missiles and nuclear programs. It is also an extremely powerful economic entity with influence in Iran's banking, shipping, and oil industries.
The US's designation of Iran's military as a terror organization could make businesses, individuals, and NGO's who provide material support to the IRGC subject to US sanctions.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has granted exceptions to foreign governments, firms, and NGOs so that they do not automatically face sanctions.
A State Department spokesman told Reuters that officials from countries like Iraq who have dealings with the IRGC will not necessarily be denied visas to the US.
Exceptions are also granted to foreign executives who do business in Iran and humanitarian groups in northern Syria, Iraq, and Yemen."
GMU Will Allow Brett Kavanaugh to Teach Despite Backlash from Student Protesters,www1.cbn.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/gmu-will-allow-brett-kavanaugh-to-teach-despite-backlash-from-student-protesters,"GMU Will Allow Brett Kavanaugh to Teach Despite Backlash from Student Protesters 04-22-2019 Emily Jones
Despite protests from thousands of students, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will continue to teach a summer law course at a George Mason University campus at the Antonin Scalia Law School in the United Kingdom.
The university's decision came after students held a town hall last week and presented more than 10,000 signatures petitioning school administrators to fire Kavanaugh over the sexual assault allegations leveled against him last year by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
""Even if the outcome is painful, what's at stake is very, very important for the integrity of the university,"" university president Angel Cabrera told students during Tuesday's town hall, according to Huffpost.
Provost S. David Wu said the law school decided to hire Kavanaugh, and he saw ""no reason for university administrators to override"" that choice.
Students reacted with groans and sighs of disbelief. Many students accused the school of disregarding their mental health.
""In hiring Kavanaugh, to what extent did you consider the mental health of the survivors on campus and how that might affect them and their education?"" asked one student as others snapped their fingers in support.
Another protestor said the university is disregarding sexual assault survivors. ""A blatantly obvious response by GMU (would be one) that states that first they do not believe Dr. Blasey Ford's testimony and second do not care about the safety of their students.""
But Cabrera held his ground.
""Even if in this particular case the outcome is one that you deeply disagree with, the process by which these decisions are made and the reason why we are so firm in defending them is actually essential to the way a university like ours operates,"" Cabrera said.
Kavanaugh is contracted to teach a single class at GMU's campus in the United Kingdom for the next three summers.
He has served half a term as a Supreme Court Justice after being confirmed last fall.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations against him and an FBI investigation did not find evidence to substantiate Blasey Ford's claims. "

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei appointed a new commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Sunday (IRGC) to replace Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, who led the military since 2007.
Brig. Gen Hossein Salami is the new Major General of Iran's military force and he has already vowed to ""cleanse the planet"" of Israel and America.
In a speech aired Feb. 19 on Iran's IRINN TV, Salami said Iran's sword has been ""drawn out of its sheath"" and the Islamic regime is preparing to fight Israel, America, and their allies.
""We will break our enemy. We have decided to do so. We have a plan. We are organized and motivated. We have faith. We have martyrdom. We have Jihad. Our nation's sword has been drawn out of its sheath. Our enemies should know that we will never let them be,"" he said.
Salami also said Iran is preparing to fight its enemies ""on the global level, not just in one spot. Our war is not a local war. We have plans to defeat the world powers.""
Khamenei's decision to promote Salami to the head of Iran's military comes weeks after US President Donald Trump designated the IRGC as a ""foreign terrorist organization.""
""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" President Trump said in a statement.
The designation is the first time the United States has labeled another country's military a terrorist group.
Iranian leaders promptly responded with anger and chants of ""Death to America.""
""You think if you speak against the Revolutionary Guard you can trigger a difference in Iran?"" asked Iran's President Hassan Rouhani. ""You think the guards' popularity will decrease? Be aware that, from today, the popularity of the guards in the hearts of the Iranian nation and in the region will be more than ever.""
Iran's Revolutionary Guard has hundreds of thousands of members and oversees the country’s ballistic missiles and nuclear programs. It is also an extremely powerful economic entity with influence in Iran's banking, shipping, and oil industries.
The US's designation of Iran's military as a terror organization could make businesses, individuals, and NGO's who provide material support to the IRGC subject to US sanctions.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has granted exceptions to foreign governments, firms, and NGOs so that they do not automatically face sanctions.
A State Department spokesman told Reuters that officials from countries like Iraq who have dealings with the IRGC will not necessarily be denied visas to the US.
Exceptions are also granted to foreign executives who do business in Iran and humanitarian groups in northern Syria, Iraq, and Yemen."

Colombian citizens and Venezuelan refugees gathered at a soccer stadium in Cúcuta, Colombia, at the border of Venezuela, to hear Franklin Graham share the message of salvation over two nights this Easter weekend.
More than 400 local churches in Cúcuta joined Graham in inviting refugees and local families. The first night, a crowd of 52,000 people filled the city's fútbol stadium.
Graham told CBN News on Monday that he believes God is using the physical needs of the refugees from Venezuela to open their hearts spiritually.
He said what happened at the services amazed him. ""It was more than I ever expected,"" he said, ""We had about 116,000 people come to 3 meetings. We had 7,000 or so make decisions for Jesus Christ. The hunger was incredible.""
On Facebook Graham shared ""We praise God for each one who made the most important decision of their lives—to repent of their sins and trust Jesus Christ as their Savior.""
""It was Good Friday, and I shared the reason that Jesus came to earth. We are all sinners, and the price of sin is death,"" he added. ""We all deserve to die, but He took our place. He went to the cross for us where He died, was buried, and rose again on the third day. The Bible says, 'But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us' (Romans 5:8).""
The second night, a crowd of 42,500 filled the stadium.
""The stadium in Cúcuta was filled again tonight with an incredible crowd of 42,500!"" he wrote. ""Cúcuta, Colombia, sits right on the border with Venezuela, and people were there from both Colombia and Venezuela. We praise God for each one who came and for every heart that was changed for eternity by the power of the Gospel.""
""The Bible says, 'that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved' (Romans 10:9). That's what we celebrate this Easter! Jesus Christ didn't stay in the grave. He rose from the dead and He's alive today,"" he continued. ""He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is willing to come into any heart that will repent of their sins and put their faith and trust in Him.""
""I'm deeply grateful to the Festival of Hope committee here in Cúcuta, the churches and pastors, and all of the volunteers, who prayed and worked so hard to make this weekend possible. Join me in praying for all those who made decisions for Christ this weekend and for the churches who will be reaching out to them,"" he added.
The weekend also included a mission event for children to hear the gospel where over 20,000 refugees and local families came out.
Graham's charity, Samaritan's Purse, also held one of the largest US-based and faith-based humanitarian missions for Venezuelan refugees since the country started collapsing. Crews gave overnight shelter, food, hygiene kits, primary medical care and more to Venezuelan refugees in multiple locations."
"Next Step, Impeachment? Democrats Divided",www1.cbn.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/next-step-impeachment-democrats-divided,"Next Step, Impeachment? Democrats Divided
WASHINGTON, DC - Democrats are wrestling over the impeachment question as they move forward with plans to investigate key parts of the Mueller report.
""If proven, some of this would be impeachable, yes. Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) told Meet the Press.
The 448-page Mueller report lays out 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice from the president — indicating Mr. Trump was thwarted by aides, like White House counsel Don McGahn who refused to follow his directives.
""Do you believe Don McGahn when he says the president tried to get him to fire Bob Mueller?"" ABC News' Martha Raddatz asked Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway.
""I believe the president was frustrated about the investigation from the very beginning and knew it was ill-conceived,"" Conway said.
One of Trump's personal attorneys Rudy Giuliani says regardless, there is no case for obstruction.
""He is the president of the United States, Mueller is not an independent counsel, Mueller works for the Justice Department. Mueller could've been fired at any moment,"" Giuliani told Meet the Press.
He also says it's okay to accept information from the Russians, although he would've advised against it.
""There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians. It depends on where it came from. It depends on where it came from. You're assuming that the giving of information is a campaign contribution,"" he said to CNN's State of the Union.
In the meantime, House Democrats are marching forward with investigations, subpoenaing US Attorney General William Barr for the unredacted report and saying that's only the beginning.
""We have to hear from Barr, we have to hear from Mueller, we have to hear from other people like Don McGahn who we are going to call. We have to get the entire report including the redacted material so we can evaluate it,"" Nadler said.
And while Democratic presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro are calling for impeachment, some congressional Democrats aren't ready to take that step.
""I'm not there yet, but I can foresee that possibly coming,"" said House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD).
""We have to be very careful here. The American people, a lot of them, clearly still don't believe President Trump is doing things to destroy our democracy,"" he continued.
Still, he maintained it wasn't completely off the table.
""Even if we did not win, possibly, if there were not impeachment, I think history would smile upon us for standing up for the Constitution,"" said Cummings.
Republicans say they do so at their own peril.
""Politically speaking it would be a mistake for them to do it,"" advised Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT).
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is holding a conference call with caucus members Monday to discuss the path forward. As for the president, his team originally planned to release a counter report to address the obstruction accusations but say so far they don't think it's necessary."
Incredible Proof for Why You Should Have Faith in the Bible | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,Paul Strand,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2016/march/incredible-proof-for-why-you-should-have-faith-in-the-bible,"WASHINGTON -- These days, many Christians, especially college-age students, face having their faith in God and the Bible questioned if not downright assaulted.
Dr. Jonathan Morrow teaches Christian students how to defend their faith at the Impact 360 Institute in Pine Mountain, Georgia.
He knows how tough it is for Christians at secular institutions.
""Sometimes they're going to have a professor that's going to outright challenge why they believe what they believe and say, 'Look, what you believe is actually a fairytale,'"" Morrow said.
Check below this story for eight extra videos of lively conversation and teaching on why you can trust the Bible. Bible experts also explore how Christianity rests on a deep and substantial bedrock of fact.
But Morrow and two more of the world's top biblical experts told CBN News there's good reason for believers to have faith in your faith.
Dr. Darrell Bock teaches at the Dallas Theological Seminary and co-wrote Truth Matters .
""The faith is very, very defendable,"" Bock said. ""That's why it's lasted 2,000 years.""
Overwhelming Evidence
Josh McDowell wrote one of the most authoritative defenses of the Bible with Evidence That Demands a Verdict and its sequel The New Evidence That Demands a Verdict .
He pointed to how even respected ""non-believers"" wrote about Jesus.
""There are 16 total historians apart from Scripture that reference Christ,"" he said. ""Almost everything about Christ we can find without ever going to the New Testament.""
McDowell writes extensively about this in his newest books God-Breathed and 77 FAQs About God and the Bible .
Morrow points out in his book Questioning the Bible there's more evidence that Jesus lived than Julius Caesar, yet no one doubts Caesar existed.
""When you're doing history, you want early and you want eyewitnesses. And the gospel writers give you both,"" Morrow explained.
""They investigated everything carefully. They have the ring of truth to them. They include embarrassing details,"" he continued.
One supposition of scholars is the closer in time a writer was to events, the more likely his account is accurate.
Morrow pointed out respected biblical writers Paul and Luke interviewed the apostles and knew many others who witnessed Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.
And the writers Peter, John, and James actually lived with Jesus.
""John said, 'What our eyes have seen, what our ears have heard, what our hands have handled is what we're declaring to you,'"" McDowell said. ""In other words, 'We're eyewitnesses.'""
More Accurate than Any Other Document
McDowell explained another understanding among scholars.
""The closer the manuscript to the original, the less chance of error or miscopy,"" he said.
Current surviving Bible manuscripts get closer to the original work than any other manuscripts from the ancient world.
""We've got manuscripts and fragments that show up within 35 or 40 years of the time when they were written,"" Morrow said of these biblical survivors.
""Why does that matter? It means there's not enough time for error and mythology to corrupt the message of what's going on there,"" he said.
But doubters scoff at those while readily accepting manuscripts of Greek and Roman histories that were created hundreds of years after the originals.
""When you look at Greek and Roman historians like Herodotus and Tacitus and Livy, those (oldest surviving manuscripts) are hundreds of years later - 500, 600, 700 years after the fact,"" Morrow said.
McDowell pointed out a second rule among scholars of ancient works.
""The more manuscripts you have, the easier it is to reconstruct the original,"" he said.
When it comes to the Bible, the surviving ancient copies or pieces of it way outnumber all other ancient works.
McDowell said there are ""66,420 some manuscripts and scrolls"" for the Bible.
Second place goes to Homer's The Illiad , with just 1,827. Most ancient works have far few intact remnants.
""We do trust Homer. How much more should we trust the New Testament documents?"" Morrow asked.
Really 400,000 Mistakes?
With so many more copies produced by thousands of scribes across the centuries, it's no surprise there'd be occasional errors.
But critics claim there are some 400,000 mistakes or ""variants"" in the Bible.
Such a claim steams Bock, McDowell, and Morrow.
""Ninety-nine percent of those 400,000 or so number evaporate as simple spelling errors, word order,"" Morrow said.
""Like 'honor' spelled h-o-n-o-r -or 'honour' spelled h-o-n-o-u-r,"" McDowell explained.
""But none of those, those texts that are in question, affect any central teaching of Christian doctrine or practice,"" Morrow insisted.
Bock explained many of the so-called contradictions in the Bible are just different ways of telling the same story.
""And difference does not equal contradiction. It's just difference,"" Bock said. ""One text may be more precise than another, but they'll both be accurate.""
For instance, one Gospel talks about Jesus and His disciples coming upon two demoniacs in a graveyard, but another Gospel speaks of one demoniac there.
A simple explanation is one writer shared the raw fact two demoniacs were present. The other writer only mentioned the one demoniac because he wanted to concentrate on that one for a particular reason.
Another example: one Gospel says Judas hanged himself while another says he fell to the ground and his insides spilled out.
A look at the area where it's thought Judas died has trees above and on rocky cliffs with jagged rocks below. Judas could have hanged himself and then the branch broke or the rope came unknotted and his body crashed to the rocks, splitting open.
Meticulous Copy Process
Doubters have a hard time believing that the Bibles we read today could accurately reflect the actual words written by the authors so many centuries ago.
But McDowell explained how for Jewish scribes, copying books like Genesis and Exodus was holy work and strictly controlled.
""Four-thousand regulations the scribe had to follow to guarantee accuracy,"" he said.
McDowell brought to CBN News a massive scroll from the Middle Ages owned by a Jewish village in Europe.
In producing such a scroll, the scribes would have needed about three years to carefully ink its 300,000-plus letters. Then a man known as a ""counter"" would come check their lettering meticulously.
""They knew what the center was, in Leviticus 11,"" McDowell explained. ""And they would count 159,402, hoping the next one, 403, was a center letter. If it wasn't, they couldn't use it.""
Monks had tight rules for copying as well.
Archaeology: The Bible's Best Friend
Another reason to trust the Bible: archaeology and related research have time and again shown the Bible is true and the skeptics to be wrong.
""Archaeology has probably cleared up already over half of all what appeared to be alleged discrepancies in the Scriptures,"" McDowell said.
Skeptics used say there's no record of a Nazareth, so the New Testament can't be true. They'd point out there was no proof of the oft-mentioned Hittites, so the Old Testament can't be true.
Archaeology and associated research have since shown both existed.
""Now you can go to Harvard or anywhere else and study the Hittite language,"" McDowell said.
Finally there's the proof of logic. After Jesus' death, the apostles kept pointing to the shared knowledge everyone around them had, even their opponents.
McDowell paraphrased the logic, ""You know what I'm talking about. You were there.""
A Truth Worth Dying For
McDowell pointed out that dying for the Gospel would have been a crazy thing to do if you were making the whole story of Jesus' miracles and resurrection up.
""They appeal to their opponents for the facts of which they talk about. To me, that's one of the best tests of truth historically,"" McDowell stated.
Finally, Bock asked what better proof the earliest disciples weren't making it all up than the fact they almost all were martyred for it?
""You don't die knowingly for something that you know you made up,"" he said.
Watch more evidence below.
Josh McDowell's Startling Evidence for the Bible
Leading Bible expert Josh McDowell shows us some of the oldest remnants of the New Testament in existence. He explains why such old fragments are leading us to the most accurate Bibles in almost 2,000 years. He also shares painful personal testimony about horrible abuse in his younger years and how the Bible helped him recover.
Josh McDowell: Nowhere Near 400,000 Manuscript Mistakes
Biblical expert McDowell explains why there are nowhere close to 400,000 mistakes in the Bible like critics allege. And he shares how a ""tsunami of manuscripts"" just being discovered is clearing up what few mistakes there actually are.
J osh McDowell: Apparent Contradictions, Discrepancies Disappearing
Biblical expert Joshua McDowell says modern research and archaeology are steadily shrinking the list of alleged contradictions and discrepancies that fueled Bible doubters for centuries.
Josh McDowell: Outsiders Back Up the Bible
Biblical expert Joshua McDowell says outsiders and eyewitnesses back up the Bible. But he points out if you aren't willing to seek truth, you'll likely never see it. And he uses his own son as an example.
Jonathan Morrow: Proof for What's in the Bible
Biblical expert Jonathan Morrow tells why if you're willing to trust any facts of ancient history (like there was a Julius Caesar), you should know there's more proof for what's in the Bible. And he explains away most all those alleged errors skeptics claim undermine the Bible's authority.
Jonathan Morrow: Son of God or Nothing
Biblical Expert Jonathan Morrow talks about the astounding stack of verifiable facts in the Bible and the huge amount of real people talked about and eyewitnesses Quote: : d. Then he shows how Jesus Himself decimated the idea He can just be accepted as a great and wise teacher. With Him, it's Son of God or nothing.
Jonathan Morrow: Why God's Not a Genocidal Maniac
Biblical expert Jonathan Morrow tackles the very tough issue of why the God of the Old Testament is not really a genocidal bully.
Jonathan Morrow: Why Is There Suffering?
Doubters often use the fact that there's suffering in the world as a reason to reject God. Biblical expert Jonathan Morrow reframes how to look at evil and suffering, and points out how God Himself took on the pain of suffering and death to set us free.

Elizabeth Warren's Free Public College Tuition: What Might the Real Cost Be for Students and Taxpayers?,www1.cbn.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-elizabeth-warrens-free-public-college-tuition-what-might-the-real-cost-be-for-students-and-taxpayers-nbsp,"Elizabeth Warren's Free Public College Tuition: What Might the Real Cost Be for Students and Taxpayers? 04-22-2019 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) (AP Photo)
Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is pushing for free public college tuition.
Warren unveiled her new higher education plan on Monday. It would cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt owed by 42 million Americans.
Warren's plan would also make two and four-year public college tuition-free. The Massachusetts senator says her plan would be paid for by imposing a two-percent tax on ultra millionaires.
Mary Clare Amselem, a policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation , argues, ""free college proposals will simply hasten the deterioration of quality education. It is a common observation that graduate school is the new college, and college is the new high school. This pattern is bad news for American taxpayers and students alike.""
In several commentaries concerning California's effort for a free community college plan, she noted the most glaring problem is the cost.
Amselem also believes tuition hurts not only students but taxpayers as well.
""The education system once successfully equipped students with the skills necessary to enter the workforce, and particularly gifted or those interested in an academic track continued on to college,"" she writes. ""However, now that college attendance has become more commonplace—even expected—high schools no longer make workforce preparation their top priority.""
""More than one-third of college freshmen must now take remedial courses,"" Amselem noted. ""Policymakers should focus their efforts on reforming the K-12 system to prepare students for college and make higher education truly 'higher.' Offering additional years of taxpayer-funded schooling will likely only worsen the problem of credential inflation.""
Amselem suggests state and federal lawmakers should address the high cost of college tuition rather than trying to drown the problem with even more taxpayer money. ""Overwhelming evidence suggests that the federal government's takeover of student lending is doing more harm than good,"" she wrote. ""Unfettered access to federal aid discourages universities from keeping prices low and competitive.""
Instead of offering students free tuition, Amselem believes states and the federal government should consider restoring the private lending market. This would encourage universities to compete for students, provide a high-quality product and keep tuition affordable.
""Simply obtaining a degree—assuming students graduate—does not necessarily translate to increased job preparedness,"" she wrote . ""It can, however, directly translate to more public debt."""

Societal Odd Couple: TD Jakes and Top CEO Team Up to Offer Second Chances to Ex-Prisoners,www.cbn.com,John Jessup,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/societal-odd-couple-td-jakes-and-top-ceo-team-up-to-offer-second-chances-to-ex-prisoners,"DALLAS – Criminal justice reform appears to be one of the few topics on which people can find consensus in today's increasingly polarized climate.
It even brought together one of America's leading pastors and the chief executive of one of the country's largest companies with a shared goal of encouraging businesses to hire rehabilitated men and women coming out of prison.
On the surface, communications giant AT&T and the Dallas-based Potter's House megachurch don't seem to have much in common, besides sharing a home base in Texas's third most-populous city.
But a recent meeting hosted by a Potter's House ministry placed church pastors right alongside corporate CEOs with a challenge to transform communities and change lives.
""When the floods came in Houston, we were there. In Haiti, we were there. In South America, we were there,"" said Potter's House pastor, Bishop T.D. Jakes concerning recent humanitarian responses. ""You'd be surprised what a bunch of church folk can do.""
Jakes made his remarks at a luncheon to support the Texas Offenders Reentry Initiative, a church program to help former inmates.
Since its founding in 2005, TORI has assisted more than 20,000 people with housing, employment, and helping them reintegrate back into society.
When Jakes met AT&T's Randall Stephenson two years ago, he pressed the executive to find solutions to commonplace obstacles ex-offenders encounter upon release. AT&T responded with a pilot program to help qualified, formerly incarcerated prisoners find employment at one of their Dallas-area call centers.
Ultimately, these types of pilot programs benefit people like Chantell Traylor, who went through the TORI program and eventually found employment with health care and retirement benefits.
""A lot of people believe that once you make a mistake, that's it,"" Traylor explained. ""But to know that somebody knew that that was just what it was: a mistake. And to say, 'Ok, I'm going to give you another chance to get it right.' And here I am, again, today saying I am a success story. I made it.""
Although AT&T works closely with Jakes' initiative to find eligible job candidates, the pastor voiced frustration over what he deems as a general feeling of religious discrimination from the business world. He noted companies seem willing to partner with every community except for communities of faith.
""Why would you get to the faith community and act like there is something so dreadful about my faith that I don't deserve to be treated equally, especially when my results of my program are better?"" Jakes asked, pointing to TORI's impressive 11% recidivism rate when compared to 50% nationally.
Stephenson agreed.
""I would like to see many of my peers and leaders in the business community, that here in this room, walk out of here and go 'You know what? It shouldn't be taboo to interact with the faith-based community and figure out how we can make a difference in our communities by working together,"" he said.
About 900 people attended the TORI luncheon which featured the fireside chat between Stephenson and Jakes. Their goal was to encourage business, government, community, and faith leaders to be the bridge to offer second chances and to replicate this program across the country."
Supreme Court to Decide Definition of 'Sex' After Unelected Officials Change Gender Identity Rules for Businesses,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/supreme-court-to-decide-definition-of-sex-after-unelected-officials-change-gender-identity-rules-for-businesses,"Jim Campbell, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) appeared on Monday's CBN Newswatch program to discuss the case involving the Michigan funeral home. The ADF represents the funeral home that is defending its refusal to employ a male who identified as a woman and wanted to dress in woman's clothing while at work.
The US Supreme Court decided Monday that it will wade into the thorny issue of discrimination in the workplace.
It will hear a trio of cases involving people who say they were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
At issue is whether the 1964 federal Civil Rights law that prohibits employment discrimination based on race and religion also applies to sexual orientation and gender identity.
Some states have laws specifically designed to protect homosexual and transgender workers. In the past, federal courts have split in their decisions on whether those who identify as LGBTQ are also provided protection under existing law.
One case involves a gay skydiving instructor who challenged his dismissal and a second case that pertains to a social worker who said he was fired because of his sexual orientation.
Another of the cases involves a male Michigan funeral home employee who dressed as a woman.
However, the funeral home said its priority is for families to focus on their loss and their grief. That's why the business set sex-specific dress code to emphasize professionalism and so employees would blend into the background.
The funeral home fired the employee on the decision to not follow the dress code. It was then that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a lawsuit against the funeral home.
The US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit agreed with the EEOC. In their appeal, the Alliance Defending Freedom is asking the Supreme Court to answer the question: Who has the authority to rewrite federal law?
The ADF argues that this should have been an open-and-shut case. Small businesses are allowed under the law to differentiate between men and women in their dress codes. Even the EEOC's own employee manual states that a ""dress code may require male employees to wear neckties at all times and female employees to wear skirts or dresses at all times.""
In a blog post , the ADF noted, ""In order to achieve its own political goals through the courts, the EEOC decided that the definition of 'sex' in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act – which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin – should mean 'gender identity'.""
""But businesses have the right to rely on what the law is – not what government agencies want it to be – when they create and enforce employment policies,"" the blog continued.
""These are important issues that you and I have the right to decide through our elected officials. Unelected officials – whether bureaucrats or judges – don't have the power to make these choices for us,"" the ADF concluded."
Christ-Following Football Hopefuls Prep for NFL Draft: 'I Passionately Pursue a Relationship with Jesus',www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/christ-following-football-hopefuls-prep-for-nfl-draft-i-passionately-pursue-a-relationship-with-jesus,"NFL and collegiate football fans are anticipating the 2019 NFL Draft on April 25-27. Among those waiting are college football standouts hoping to be drafted, including a number of faith-driven players. The Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) Magazine just featured seven of the hopefuls who have been open about their faith.
For eight years, FCA has published annual college football issues, sharing about hundreds of players who are open about their faith. In its latest issue, the seven college standouts shared about their relationship with Christ. Here are a few highlights from FCA:
David Blough (QB - Purdue) —""I passionately pursue a relationship with Christ because of His sacrifice on the cross. Serving a King who paid the ultimate price of death, bearing the weight of the world on His shoulders, for me to have a relationship with Him ... everything I do ought to be to serve Him!"" Blough also said one of the most influential people in his life while at Purdue was FCA Campus Director Marty Dittmar. ""Through discipleship, mission trips and weekly FCA Huddles, the ministry of FCA has helped mold me into the man I am today.""
Rodney Anderson (RB - Oklahoma) —""I pursue God by getting connected to a church and constantly surrounding myself with like-minded godly believers. I feel like it's important to stay around believers because sin lurks around every corner.""
Alec Eberle (OL - Florida State)—""I choose to follow Christ and have a relationship with Him because with Him anything is possible, and I firmly believe He gives me the opportunities He does for a reason.""
Gary Jennings (WR - West Virginia) —""I passionately pursue a relationship with Jesus because without Him I am nothing.""
Jojo Mcintosh (DB - Washington) —""I grew up in faith and love for Jesus Christ. I have felt His everlasting love and grace. Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice for us; it is only right I give him praise and glory. God is great! All the time!""
Hunter Renfrow (WR - Clemson) —""I pursue a relationship with Christ by surrounding myself with the godly leadership and players around the team. They are constantly pointing me to Christ, and it allows me to play free and without pressure."" Renfrow also commented that FCA ""has always been a large part of my life and has allowed me to become who I am today. Growing up, my parents were a part of FCA in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and it gave me an avenue to grow in my faith while meeting athletes who were constantly pursuing Christ.""
Brett Rypien (QB - Boise State) —""I pursue a relationship with Jesus Christ because I know He has a plan for my life, and, throughout any ups and downs, He will always be there for me.""
""These young players live out their faith on the field as followers of Jesus Christ, and He directs their playbook for life,"" said FCA President and CEO Shane Williamson. ""We wish them all the best in this week's draft—just the beginning of a journey we hope will be guided by God for years to come, either in the NFL or along another path.""
Previous cover stars have been drafted over the years, including:
Mason Rudolph (QB) - featured on the 2017 magazine cover and drafted in 2018 by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the third round.
Evan Engram (TE) - was part of the 2015 FCA Magazine cover and drafted by the New York Giants as the 23rd pick in the first round in 2017.
Matt Barkley (QB) - appeared on the 2012 cover and drafted in the fourth round of the 2013 draft by the Philadelphia Eagles and today plays with the Buffalo Bills.
Coverage of the NFL Draft begins at 8 p.m. ET Thursday on ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network."
GMU Will Allow Brett Kavanaugh to Teach Despite Backlash from Student Protesters,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/gmu-will-allow-brett-kavanaugh-to-teach-despite-backlash-from-student-protesters,"Despite protests from thousands of students, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will continue to teach a summer law course at a George Mason University campus at the Antonin Scalia Law School in the United Kingdom.
The university's decision came after students held a town hall last week and presented more than 10,000 signatures petitioning school administrators to fire Kavanaugh over the sexual assault allegations leveled against him last year by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
""Even if the outcome is painful, what's at stake is very, very important for the integrity of the university,"" university president Angel Cabrera told students during Tuesday's town hall, according to Huffpost.
Provost S. David Wu said the law school decided to hire Kavanaugh, and he saw ""no reason for university administrators to override"" that choice.
Students reacted with groans and sighs of disbelief. Many students accused the school of disregarding their mental health.
""In hiring Kavanaugh, to what extent did you consider the mental health of the survivors on campus and how that might affect them and their education?"" asked one student as others snapped their fingers in support.
Another protestor said the university is disregarding sexual assault survivors.
""A blatantly obvious response by GMU (would be one) that states that first they do not believe Dr. Blasey Ford's testimony and second do not care about the safety of their students.""
But Cabrera held his ground.
""Even if in this particular case the outcome is one that you deeply disagree with, the process by which these decisions are made and the reason why we are so firm in defending them is actually essential to the way a university like ours operates,"" Cabrera said.
Kavanaugh is contracted to teach a single class at GMU's campus in the United Kingdom for the next three summers.
He has served half a term as a Supreme Court Justice after being confirmed last fall.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations against him and an FBI investigation did not find evidence to substantiate Blasey Ford's claims."

More than 400 local churches in Cúcuta joined Graham in inviting refugees and local families. The first night, a crowd of 52,000 people filled the city's fútbol stadium.
Graham told CBN News on Monday that he believes God is using the physical needs of the refugees from Venezuela to open their hearts spiritually.
He said what happened at the services amazed him. ""It was more than I ever expected,"" he said, ""We had about 116,000 people come to 3 meetings. We had 7,000 or so make decisions for Jesus Christ. The hunger was incredible.""
On Facebook Graham shared ""We praise God for each one who made the most important decision of their lives—to repent of their sins and trust Jesus Christ as their Savior.""
""It was Good Friday, and I shared the reason that Jesus came to earth. We are all sinners, and the price of sin is death,"" he added. ""We all deserve to die, but He took our place. He went to the cross for us where He died, was buried, and rose again on the third day. The Bible says, 'But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us' (Romans 5:8).""
The second night, a crowd of 42,500 filled the stadium.
""The stadium in Cúcuta was filled again tonight with an incredible crowd of 42,500!"" he wrote. ""Cúcuta, Colombia, sits right on the border with Venezuela, and people were there from both Colombia and Venezuela. We praise God for each one who came and for every heart that was changed for eternity by the power of the Gospel.""
""The Bible says, 'that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved' (Romans 10:9). That's what we celebrate this Easter! Jesus Christ didn't stay in the grave. He rose from the dead and He's alive today,"" he continued. ""He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is willing to come into any heart that will repent of their sins and put their faith and trust in Him.""
""I'm deeply grateful to the Festival of Hope committee here in Cúcuta, the churches and pastors, and all of the volunteers, who prayed and worked so hard to make this weekend possible. Join me in praying for all those who made decisions for Christ this weekend and for the churches who will be reaching out to them,"" he added.
The weekend also included a mission event for children to hear the gospel where over 20,000 refugees and local families came out.
Graham's charity, Samaritan's Purse, also held one of the largest US-based and faith-based humanitarian missions for Venezuelan refugees since the country started collapsing. Crews gave overnight shelter, food, hygiene kits, primary medical care and more to Venezuelan refugees in multiple locations."
Bangladeshi Girl Burned to Death After Accusing Islamic School Headmaster of Sexual Harassment,www1.cbn.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/bangladeshi-girl-burned-to-death-after-accusing-islamic-school-headmaster-of-sexual-harassment,"Bangladesh has erupted into fury over the burning death of a young woman who courageously reported an incident of sexual harassment to the local authorities and suffered the ultimate consequence.
What Is The Background?
Nusrat Jahan Rafi, 19, from a small town 100 miles (160 km) south of Dhaka, was attending a madrassa, or Islamic school when the sexual assault took place. Rafi recounted that her headmaster summoned her to his office before touching her inappropriately. Realizing the seriousness of her situation, Rafi did the right thing — fled the room and went to the authorities.
Unfortunately, in an extremely conservative Muslim religious society, matters of sexual harassment and assault remain rather taboo subjects. To her bemusement, Rafi found herself being filmed when making a statement to the police. Understanding the danger she would be in if the footage were released, she attempted to cover her face.
The police officer can be heard telling her that it is “no big deal” and repeatedly asks her to stop hiding.
But as soon as her identity was revealed, it was too late — the mobile phone footage was leaked to the local press and the brave young woman immediately found herself in grave peril.
What Happened Next?
With most cases of sexual assault and harassment going unreported, Rafi became a prime target for those who disapproved of her attempted legal action. Then, after police decided to arrest the headmaster, things got even worse.
Before long, the mob had gathered momentum, and a group of people were protesting outside the police station, demanding the headmaster’s release. According to the BBC , the protest had been arranged by two male students and “local politicians were allegedly in attendance.”
Still, the courageous teen kept attending school, working hard and attempting to complete her studies.
Then, on April 6, the worst-case scenario became a stark reality. As Rafi’s brother walked his sister to her exams, he was stopped and she was asked to follow a female student to the rooftop.
“I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn’t allowed to enter,” said Rafi’s brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman.
Informed that one of her friends was getting beaten up, Rafi dutifully followed the girl, only to find an aggressive group burqa-wearing students who demanded that she immediately withdraw her allegations. When she refused, they doused her with gasoline and lit a match.
Police Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder noted that the killers wanted “to make it look like a suicide.” But Rafi, determined as ever, managed to survive after her cowardly attackers fled. Barely alive, she had suffered burns that covered some 80 percent of her body.
Before she succumbed to her devastating injuries, she had one final message of defiance.
“The teacher touched me — I will fight this crime till my last breath,” she said in the ambulance.
On April 10, Nusrat Jahan Rafi died.
What Has The Reaction Been Like?
Police have since arrested 15 people, seven of whom they say were directly involved in the murder. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met Rafi’s family in Dhaka and insisted that “none of the culprits will be spared from legal action.”
Widespread street protests have also erupted, as the country attempts to unshackle itself from the culture of fear, shame and isolation that surrounds incidents of sexual violence.

“When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from the police to properly investigate the allegations,” said Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers’ Association, according to the BBC .
“It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice,” she added. “Ultimately the criminals don’t get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don’t fear to do the same because of such examples.”
Along with these utterly barbaric responses to sexual harassment and assault, the oppressive Islamic society is also to blame for widespread persecution of the country’s 800,000+ Christians.
Open Doors USA estimates that Bangladesh is home to an increasing number of Christians who have converted from Islam — this alone poses great risks to personal safety.
“The government increasingly gives in to the demands of local Islamic groups that monitor minorities, especially converts,” reads a fact sheet at the persecution watchdog’s website.
“These groups are instilling fear, and many are inspired by international Islamic groups like Islamic State (IS). Fatwas — specific interpretations of Islamic law — dictate daily life all over the country, especially in rural areas,” it notes.
Please pray for this heroic girl’s family as they come to terms with her untimely death, and ask that God would uphold all those who face religious persecution in this troubled nation.

US to Sanction Allies Who Keep Importing Oil from Terrorist Regime in Iran,www1.cbn.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/us-to-sanction-allies-who-keep-importing-oil-from-terrorist-regime-in-iran,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Photo: Mario Gonzalez/CBN News) 6029015004001 US to Sanction Allies Who Keep Importing Oil from Terrorist Regime in Iran
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that the United States will not renew sanction waivers for five countries that receive oil from Iran, according to the Washington Post.
“Today I am announcing that we will no longer grant any exemptions. We're going to zero, going to zero across the board,"" Pompeo said.
Those five countries include allies like Japan, South Korea, India, and Turkey, as well as China. The US had issued waivers to these nations, but they expire May 2. At that time, those nations will no longer be exempt from US sanctions if they're still importing oil from Iran.
""The decision is intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying its principal source of revenue,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.
It's not immediately clear if any of the five nations will be given extra time to wind down their purchases, or if they will be subject to US sanctions on May 3.
CNBC reports oil prices shot up more than 3 percent after following reports about the impending announcement. Brent crude futures increased more than 3 percent to over $74 per barrel, while US crude futures rose about 2.33 percent to $65.49 per barrel.
Brent prices have surged by more than a third this year, while US crude has risen by more than 40 percent.
However, US officials say they do not expect a significant reduction in oil supply because other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, have increased their oil production to fill the gap.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) applauded the end of oil waivers for Iran. ""This decision will deprive the ayatollahs of billions of dollars that they would have spent undermining the security of the United States and our allies, building up Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and financing global terrorism,"" he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the decision.
""President Trump and the American government's decision to intensify the sanctions against Iran is a decision of very great importance. This is the way to deal with Iranian aggression and this is the way to stop it.""
Turkey warned of the consequences to the Middle East.
""Politically it is not right. Ethically it is not right. In terms of commerce, it is definitely not right. And it is also against international laws of commerce, against World Trade Organisation laws and it is risky for the region's stability,"" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
The move is the latest effort to increase pressure on the radical Islamic regime of Iran.
Earlier this month, President Donald Trump designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terror organization. It was the first time the United States has labeled another country's military a terrorist group.
""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" President Trump said in a statement."
Federal Court Punishes Philly Faith-Based Foster Care Agency Over Biblical Views on Marriage,www1.cbn.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/federal-court-punishes-philly-faith-based-foster-care-agency-over-biblical-views-on-marriage,"Federal Court Punishes Philly Faith-Based Foster Care Agency Over Biblical Views on Marriage 04-22-2019 Steve Warren
A federal appeals court has upheld a new Philadelphia city policy that forbids Catholic Social Services from placing foster children with families due to the agency's longstanding religious beliefs about marriage.
As CBN News reported, Catholic Social Services has partnered with the city for over 50 years in placing foster children with families. Last year, the city threatened to close the agency because it disagreed with the agency's biblical belief that marriage is between one man and one woman -- even though not one LGBTQ couple had applied with the agency.
Represented by Becket , a non-profit public-interest law firm, Sharonell Fulton, a single mother who has fostered more than 40 children in 26 years, joined other foster parents licensed through Catholic Social Services to file a lawsuit against the city.
""As a single mom and woman of color, I've known a thing or two about discrimination over the years,"" Fulton said in a press release. ""But I have never known vindictive religious discrimination like this, and I feel the fresh sting of bias watching my faith publicly derided by Philadelphia's politicians. Today's court ruling lets Philadelphia continue that religious discrimination.""
According to Becket, there are 6,000 foster children in the City of Philadelphia. The need to find those children homes is so dire that earlier this year the city put out an urgent call for 300 new families to become foster parents. But shortly after this call for help, the city inexplicably prohibited Catholic Social Services from placing any more children with the families it has certified—solely because of the agency's religious beliefs.
There are dozens of families licensed to foster through Catholic Social Services who are willing to take in children, but because of the city's actions, their beds have remained empty for close to a year.
""This ruling is devastating to the hundreds of foster children who have been waiting for a family and to the dozens of parents working with Catholic Social Services who have been waiting to foster a child,"" Lori Windham, Becket senior counsel, said in a press release. ""We're disappointed that the court decided to let the city place politics above the needs of kids and the rights of parents, but we will continue this fight."""

Societal Odd Couple: TD Jakes and Top CEO Team Up to Offer Second Chances to Ex-Prisoners,www1.cbn.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/societal-odd-couple-td-jakes-and-top-ceo-team-up-to-offer-second-chances-to-ex-prisoners,"CBNNEWSWATCH042219CC_HD1080_321.966_422 6028785997001 Societal Odd Couple: TD Jakes and AT&T CEO Team Up to Offer Second Chances to Ex-Prisoners
DALLAS – Criminal justice reform appears to be one of the few topics on which people can find consensus in today's increasingly polarized climate.
It even brought together one of America's leading pastors and the chief executive of one of the country's largest companies with a shared goal of encouraging businesses to hire rehabilitated men and women coming out of prison.
On the surface, communications giant AT&T and the Dallas-based Potter's House megachurch don't seem to have much in common, besides sharing a home base in Texas's third most-populous city.
But a recent meeting hosted by a Potter's House ministry placed church pastors right alongside corporate CEOs with a challenge to transform communities and change lives.
""When the floods came in Houston, we were there. In Haiti, we were there. In South America, we were there,"" said Potter's House pastor, Bishop T.D. Jakes concerning recent humanitarian responses. ""You'd be surprised what a bunch of church folk can do.""
Jakes made his remarks at a luncheon to support the Texas Offenders Reentry Initiative, a church program to help former inmates.
Since its founding in 2005, TORI has assisted more than 20,000 people with housing, employment, and helping them reintegrate back into society.
When Jakes met AT&T's Randall Stephenson two years ago, he pressed the executive to find solutions to commonplace obstacles ex-offenders encounter upon release. AT&T responded with a pilot program to help qualified, formerly incarcerated prisoners find employment at one of their Dallas-area call centers.
Ultimately, these types of pilot programs benefit people like Chantell Traylor, who went through the TORI program and eventually found employment with health care and retirement benefits.
""A lot of people believe that once you make a mistake, that's it,"" Traylor explained. ""But to know that somebody knew that that was just what it was: a mistake. And to say, 'Ok, I'm going to give you another chance to get it right.' And here I am, again, today saying I am a success story. I made it.""
Although AT&T works closely with Jakes' initiative to find eligible job candidates, the pastor voiced frustration over what he deems as a general feeling of religious discrimination from the business world. He noted companies seem willing to partner with every community except for communities of faith.
""Why would you get to the faith community and act like there is something so dreadful about my faith that I don't deserve to be treated equally, especially when my results of my program are better?"" Jakes asked, pointing to TORI's impressive 11% recidivism rate when compared to 50% nationally.
Stephenson agreed.
""I would like to see many of my peers and leaders in the business community, that here in this room, walk out of here and go 'You know what? It shouldn't be taboo to interact with the faith-based community and figure out how we can make a difference in our communities by working together,"" he said.
About 900 people attended the TORI luncheon which featured the fireside chat between Stephenson and Jakes. Their goal was to encourage business, government, community, and faith leaders to be the bridge to offer second chances and to replicate this program across the country."

They are constantly pointing me to Christ, and it allows me to play free and without pressure."" Renfrow also commented that FCA ""has always been a large part of my life and has allowed me to become who I am today.

Brett Rypien (QB - Boise State) —""I pursue a relationship with Jesus Christ because I know He has a plan for my life, and, throughout any ups and downs, He will always be there for me.""
""These young players live out their faith on the field as followers of Jesus Christ, and He directs their playbook for life,"" said FCA President and CEO Shane Williamson.

Lindsey Burke, the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, appeared on Monday's CBN News' Faith Nation program to talk about Warren's tuition plan.
Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is pushing for free public college tuition.
Warren unveiled her new higher education plan on Monday. It would cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt owed by 42 million Americans.
Warren's plan would also make two and four-year public college tuition-free. The Massachusetts senator says her plan would be paid for by imposing a two-percent tax on ultra millionaires.
Mary Clare Amselem, a policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation , argues, ""free college proposals will simply hasten the deterioration of quality education. It is a common observation that graduate school is the new college, and college is the new high school. This pattern is bad news for American taxpayers and students alike.""
In several commentaries concerning California's effort for a free community college plan, she noted the most glaring problem is the cost.
Amselem also believes tuition hurts not only students but taxpayers as well.
""The education system once successfully equipped students with the skills necessary to enter the workforce, and particularly gifted or those interested in an academic track continued on to college,"" she writes. ""However, now that college attendance has become more commonplace—even expected—high schools no longer make workforce preparation their top priority.""
""More than one-third of college freshmen must now take remedial courses,"" Amselem noted. ""Policymakers should focus their efforts on reforming the K-12 system to prepare students for college and make higher education truly 'higher.' Offering additional years of taxpayer-funded schooling will likely only worsen the problem of credential inflation.""
Amselem suggests state and federal lawmakers should address the high cost of college tuition rather than trying to drown the problem with even more taxpayer money. ""Overwhelming evidence suggests that the federal government's takeover of student lending is doing more harm than good,"" she wrote. ""Unfettered access to federal aid discourages universities from keeping prices low and competitive.""
Instead of offering students free tuition, Amselem believes states and the federal government should consider restoring the private lending market. This would encourage universities to compete for students, provide a high-quality product and keep tuition affordable.
""Simply obtaining a degree—assuming students graduate—does not necessarily translate to increased job preparedness,"" she wrote . ""It can, however, directly translate to more public debt."""
"Medicare, Social Security Face Shaky Fiscal Futures",www1.cbn.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/medicare-social-security-face-shaky-fiscal-futures,"Medicare, Social Security Face Shaky Fiscal Futures 04-22-2019 Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — The financial condition of the government’s bedrock retirement programs for middle- and working-class Americans remains shaky, with Medicare pointed toward insolvency by 2026, according to a report Monday by the government’s overseers of Medicare and Social Security.
It paints a sobering picture of the programs, though it’s relatively unchanged from last year’s update. Social Security would become insolvent in 2035, one year later than previously estimated.
Both programs will need to eventually be addressed to avert automatic cuts should their trust funds run dry. Neither President Donald Trump nor Capitol Hill’s warring factions has put political perilous cost curbs on their to-do list.
The report is the latest update of the government’s troubled fiscal picture. It lands in a capital that has proven chronically unable to address it. Trump has declared benefit cuts to the nation’s signature retirement programs off limits and many Democratic presidential candidates are calling for expanding Medicare benefits rather than addressing the program’s worsening finances.
Many on both sides actually agree that it would be better for Washington to act sooner rather than later to shore up the programs rather than wait until they are on the brink of insolvency and have to weigh more drastic steps.
Limiting her comments to Medicare, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the report highlights the need for “serious-minded” lawmakers to work with the administration on bipartisan changes to lower costs, eliminate fraud and abuse, and preserve the program for future generations.
Sanders also took the opportunity to criticize Democrats’ calls to expand Medicare. She claimed such a step would amount to a “total government takeover of health care” that would cut out private-sector options, endanger access to health care for seniors and further strain the federal budget.
But potential cuts such as curbing inflationary increases for Social Security, hiking payroll taxes or raising the Medicare retirement age are so politically freighted and toxic that Washington’s power players are mostly ignoring the problem.
Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack, the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee, urged action, saying the financial condition of both programs is driving up federal spending, increasing budget deficits and crowing out other priorities.
“We cannot afford to ignore this reality any longer,” Womack said.
Later this year, Social Security is expected to declare a 1.8% cost-of-living increase for 2020 based on current trends, program officials say.
Monday’s report by three Cabinet heads and Social Security’s acting commissioner, urges lawmakers to “take action sooner rather than later to address these shortfalls, so that a broader range of solutions can be considered and more time will be available to phase in changes while giving the public adequate time to prepare.”
If Congress doesn’t act, both programs would eventually be unable to cover the full cost of promised benefits. With Social Security that could mean automatic benefit cuts for most retirees, many of whom depend on the program to cover basic living costs.
For Medicare, it could mean that hospitals, nursing homes, and other medical providers would be paid only part of their agreed-upon fees.
In a glimmer of good news, Social Security’s disability program is now estimated to remain solvent for an additional 20 years, through 2052. Overall, however, Social Security would run out of reserves by 2035, one year later than projected in last year’s report.
“We remain committed to further bolstering the programs’ finances, which will benefit from the long-term growth we will see as a result of the Administration’s economic policies,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
As an indication of Medicare’s woes, it would take a payroll tax increase of 0.91 percentage points to fully address its shortfall or a 19% cut in spending. Medicare’s problems are considered more difficult to solve, as health care costs regularly outpace inflation and economic growth.
Social Security is the government’s largest program, costing $853 billion last year, with another $147 billion for disability benefits. Medicare’s hospital, outpatient care, and prescription drug benefits totaled about $740 billion.
Taken together, the two programs combined for 45% of the federal budget, excluding interest payments on the national debt.

Dangerous Tactic: Democrat Lawmakers 'Weaponize' Religion,www.cbn.com,Caitlin Burke,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/dangerous-tactic-democrat-lawmakers-weaponize-religion,"WASHINGTON – There's a dangerous tactic resurfacing in politics, mostly among lawmakers on the far left. It involves a new line of questioning coming from Democrat senators during confirmation hearings, and it has Church leaders warning lawmakers to tread carefully.
Biblical beliefs are being referred to far too often as a disqualifier for public office. In the last few years, it's happened to Trump nominees like Mike Pompeo , Amy Coney Barrett , Russell Vought , and Neomi Rao.
""The weaponization of religion means: the use and exploitation of faith for partisan political ends, in terms of political warfare,"" said Rev. Eugene Rivers, founder and director of the Seymour Institute for Black Church and Policy Studies.
Anti-Catholic Bigotry Hints at a Larger Problem
In December, Democrat Senators Kamala Harris, now a presidential candidate, and Hawaii's Mazie Hirono questioned a federal judicial nominee about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, the well-known Catholic service organization.
They asked Brian Buescher whether he shared the groups ""extremist"" values and if he would be able to judge certain cases fairly.
""They were taking shots at Catholics. It doesn't have to be the Knights of Columbus. They were taking shots at Catholics regarding pro-life and their views on marriage, OK that's the bottom line,"" Rev. Rivers said.
""This was a case of clear ideological bigotry, it was unfair and it is part of a larger problem that exists in this society,"" he continued.
Rivers says members of all faiths should defend religious liberty.
""I should be free to believe in my God or to believe in no God. But in either case, I should not be subjected to some ideological test that is used as the criteria or the basis for assessing my right to engage in public life,"" he said.
Faith in Politics
In 1960 democrat John F. Kennedy worked to convince Americans that he could be both a good Catholic and a good public servant.
""If this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being president on the day they were baptized then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history and in the eyes of our own people,"" Kennedy said during a speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association.
Rev. Rivers says if certain senators refuse to see the good contributions from people of faith, they should at least commit to upholding the Constitution.
US Constitution: No Religious Tests
Article 6 states: ""No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.""
The Senate passed a resolution at the beginning of the year saying it would be unconstitutional to consider membership in the Knights of Columbus disqualifying criteria for public office. It passed unanimously.
""In this, we are simply reaffirming with President Kennedy, and with countless other Americans across 230 years, Protestant and Catholic, Jew and Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist, Agnostic, Atheist, and more. We are simply reaffirming the idea that America is big enough for disagreements,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE).
In 1960, then-candidate Kennedy responded to bigotry with a warning that Rev. Rivers echoes today.
""For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been, and may someday be again, a Jew, or a Quaker, or a Unitarian, or a Baptist,"" Kennedy said in his Houston speech.
""Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril,"" he continued."
Federal Court Punishes Philly Faith-Based Foster Care Agency Over Biblical Views on Marriage,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/federal-court-punishes-philly-faith-based-foster-care-agency-over-biblical-views-on-marriage,"A federal appeals court has upheld a new Philadelphia city policy that forbids Catholic Social Services from placing foster children with families due to the agency's longstanding religious beliefs about marriage.
As CBN News reported, Catholic Social Services has partnered with the city for over 50 years in placing foster children with families. Last year, the city threatened to close the agency because it disagreed with the agency's biblical belief that marriage is between one man and one woman -- even though not one LGBTQ couple had applied with the agency.
Represented by Becket , a non-profit public-interest law firm, Sharonell Fulton, a single mother who has fostered more than 40 children in 26 years, joined other foster parents licensed through Catholic Social Services to file a lawsuit against the city.
""As a single mom and woman of color, I've known a thing or two about discrimination over the years,"" Fulton said in a press release. ""But I have never known vindictive religious discrimination like this, and I feel the fresh sting of bias watching my faith publicly derided by Philadelphia's politicians. Today's court ruling lets Philadelphia continue that religious discrimination.""
According to Becket, there are 6,000 foster children in the City of Philadelphia. The need to find those children homes is so dire that earlier this year the city put out an urgent call for 300 new families to become foster parents. But shortly after this call for help, the city inexplicably prohibited Catholic Social Services from placing any more children with the families it has certified—solely because of the agency's religious beliefs.
There are dozens of families licensed to foster through Catholic Social Services who are willing to take in children, but because of the city's actions, their beds have remained empty for close to a year.
""This ruling is devastating to the hundreds of foster children who have been waiting for a family and to the dozens of parents working with Catholic Social Services who have been waiting to foster a child,"" Lori Windham, Becket senior counsel, said in a press release. ""We're disappointed that the court decided to let the city place politics above the needs of kids and the rights of parents, but we will continue this fight."""
Bangladeshi Girl Burned to Death After Accusing Islamic School Headmaster of Sexual Harassment,www.cbn.com,"Will Maule, Faithwire",04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/bangladeshi-girl-burned-to-death-after-accusing-islamic-school-headmaster-of-sexual-harassment,"Bangladesh has erupted into fury over the burning death of a young woman who courageously reported an incident of sexual harassment to the local authorities and suffered the ultimate consequence.
What Is The Background?
Nusrat Jahan Rafi, 19, from a small town 100 miles (160 km) south of Dhaka, was attending a madrassa, or Islamic school when the sexual assault took place. Rafi recounted that her headmaster summoned her to his office before touching her inappropriately. Realizing the seriousness of her situation, Rafi did the right thing — fled the room and went to the authorities.
Unfortunately, in an extremely conservative Muslim religious society, matters of sexual harassment and assault remain rather taboo subjects. To her bemusement, Rafi found herself being filmed when making a statement to the police. Understanding the danger she would be in if the footage were released, she attempted to cover her face.
The police officer can be heard telling her that it is “no big deal” and repeatedly asks her to stop hiding.
But as soon as her identity was revealed, it was too late — the mobile phone footage was leaked to the local press and the brave young woman immediately found herself in grave peril.
What Happened Next?
With most cases of sexual assault and harassment going unreported, Rafi became a prime target for those who disapproved of her attempted legal action. Then, after police decided to arrest the headmaster, things got even worse.
Before long, the mob had gathered momentum, and a group of people were protesting outside the police station, demanding the headmaster’s release. According to the BBC , the protest had been arranged by two male students and “local politicians were allegedly in attendance.”
Still, the courageous teen kept attending school, working hard and attempting to complete her studies.
Then, on April 6, the worst-case scenario became a stark reality. As Rafi’s brother walked his sister to her exams, he was stopped and she was asked to follow a female student to the rooftop.
“I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn’t allowed to enter,” said Rafi’s brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman.
Informed that one of her friends was getting beaten up, Rafi dutifully followed the girl, only to find an aggressive group burqa-wearing students who demanded that she immediately withdraw her allegations. When she refused, they doused her with gasoline and lit a match.
Police Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder noted that the killers wanted “to make it look like a suicide.” But Rafi, determined as ever, managed to survive after her cowardly attackers fled. Barely alive, she had suffered burns that covered some 80 percent of her body.
Before she succumbed to her devastating injuries, she had one final message of defiance.
“The teacher touched me — I will fight this crime till my last breath,” she said in the ambulance.
On April 10, Nusrat Jahan Rafi died.
What Has The Reaction Been Like?
Police have since arrested 15 people, seven of whom they say were directly involved in the murder. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met Rafi’s family in Dhaka and insisted that “none of the culprits will be spared from legal action.”
Widespread street protests have also erupted, as the country attempts to unshackle itself from the culture of fear, shame and isolation that surrounds incidents of sexual violence.

“When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from the police to properly investigate the allegations,” said Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers’ Association, according to the BBC .
“It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice,” she added. “Ultimately the criminals don’t get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don’t fear to do the same because of such examples.”
Along with these utterly barbaric responses to sexual harassment and assault, the oppressive Islamic society is also to blame for widespread persecution of the country’s 800,000+ Christians.
Open Doors USA estimates that Bangladesh is home to an increasing number of Christians who have converted from Islam — this alone poses great risks to personal safety.
“The government increasingly gives in to the demands of local Islamic groups that monitor minorities, especially converts,” reads a fact sheet at the persecution watchdog’s website.
“These groups are instilling fear, and many are inspired by international Islamic groups like Islamic State (IS). Fatwas — specific interpretations of Islamic law — dictate daily life all over the country, especially in rural areas,” it notes.
Please pray for this heroic girl’s family as they come to terms with her untimely death, and ask that God would uphold all those who face religious persecution in this troubled nation."

Small Plane Crash in Texas Kills 6,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/small-plane-crash-in-texas-kills-6,"KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) - A man regularly volunteered to fly sick people in remote parts of the country to hospitals in Houston and Dallas was at the controls of a twin-engine airplane that crashed Monday in the Hill Country of central Texas, killing all six aboard.
Jeffrey C. Weiss, 65, was a senior vice president for investments at Raymond James and Associates in Houston. The Texas Department of Public Safety said Weiss, who co-owned the Beechcraft BE58, was at the controls when the aircraft went down just before 9 a.m. Monday while approaching Kerrville Municipal Airport, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio.
Also killed were Stuart Roben Kensinger, 55; Angela Webb Kensinger, 54; Mark Damien Scioneaux, 58; Scott Reagan Miller, 55; and Marc Tellepsen, 45, all of Houston, said DPS Sgt. Orlando Moreno.
The aircraft went down just before 9 a.m. as it approached an airport in Kerrville, a city about 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Lynn Lunsford. State law enforcement officials secured the crash site ahead of FAA and National Transportation Safety Board investigators' arrival Monday.
The aircraft had taken from an airport outside Houston earlier Monday and crashed about 6 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of Kerrville Municipal Airport, Lunsford said. The flight was not a scheduled commercial route, he said.
The downed plane was manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft in 1999 and was co-owned by Weiss and Charles Morina of Dallas, according to FAA records.
Weiss loved to fly and the pair volunteered their time transporting sick people from remote regions to Texas hospitals for Angel Flight, Morina said.
""We flew people from all over the country to Dallas and Houston"" for medical treatment, he told The Associated Press.
The cause of the crash hasn't been determined. However, witnesses heard the plane struggling and sputtering moments before it crashed.
""It was making a sput-sput sputtering sound, like the engines were cutting out,"" Treva Hardeman, who was working at home about a quarter mile from where the aircraft crashed, told the San Antonio Express-News . ""It was just a few seconds later that I heard the boom.""
Construction worker Rodney Simmons said he heard a plane ""struggle against the wind.""
""I looked over and watched him drop down out of the clouds,"" Simmons told the Express-News. ""The rear end of the plane was real low, like he was trying to stay in the air. It was like he was dragging the tail end of that plane. Like he had a lot of weight in the back or something.""
The plane flew southward into the wind, Simmons said, then ""banked to the right, real hard, and just flipped on over, upside down, and nose-dived to the ground.""
The family of one of the six people killed in the crash of a twin-engine aircraft in the Texas Hill Country said the purpose of the flight was to survey some property.
In a statement to KTRK-TV of Houston, the family of Houston landscape architect Marc Teppesen said he and associate Mark Scioneaux were on the scouting trip when Houston architect Scott Reagan Miller, Houston real estate investor Stuart Kensinger and his wife Angela Kensinger, and Houston investment banker Jeffrey Weiss died in the Monday plane crash.
Weiss was a philanthropist who not only flew the sick to hospitals but was active in charities supporting children with special needs or who suffered abuse, said friend Bob Fuller. He told KPRC-TV of Houston that Weiss helped him conduct his Keels and Wheels charity event in Seabrook each year to aid abused children, giving both his time and money.
""I loved the man, I'll tell you that. He was generous to a fault. He wanted to support our charity any way he can and one of those was if I wanted to fly to Detroit to talk to General Motors, 'Call me first,'"" Fuller said.

US to Sanction Allies Who Keep Importing Oil from Terrorist Regime in Iran,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/us-to-sanction-allies-who-keep-importing-oil-from-terrorist-regime-in-iran,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that the United States will not renew sanction waivers for five countries that receive oil from Iran, according to the Washington Post.
“Today I am announcing that we will no longer grant any exemptions. We're going to zero, going to zero across the board,"" Pompeo said.
Those five countries include allies like Japan, South Korea, India, and Turkey, as well as China. The US had issued waivers to these nations, but they expire May 2. At that time, those nations will no longer be exempt from US sanctions if they're still importing oil from Iran.
""The decision is intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying its principal source of revenue,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.
It's not immediately clear if any of the five nations will be given extra time to wind down their purchases, or if they will be subject to US sanctions on May 3.
CNBC reports oil prices shot up more than 3 percent after following reports about the impending announcement. Brent crude futures increased more than 3 percent to over $74 per barrel, while US crude futures rose about 2.33 percent to $65.49 per barrel.
Brent prices have surged by more than a third this year, while US crude has risen by more than 40 percent.
However, US officials say they do not expect a significant reduction in oil supply because other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, have increased their oil production to fill the gap.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) applauded the end of oil waivers for Iran.
""This decision will deprive the ayatollahs of billions of dollars that they would have spent undermining the security of the United States and our allies, building up Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and financing global terrorism,"" he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the decision.
""President Trump and the American government's decision to intensify the sanctions against Iran is a decision of very great importance. This is the way to deal with Iranian aggression and this is the way to stop it.""
Turkey warned of the consequences to the Middle East.
""Politically it is not right. Ethically it is not right. In terms of commerce, it is definitely not right. And it is also against international laws of commerce, against World Trade Organisation laws and it is risky for the region's stability,"" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
The move is the latest effort to increase pressure on the radical Islamic regime of Iran.
Earlier this month, President Donald Trump designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terror organization. It was the first time the United States has labeled another country's military a terrorist group.
""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" President Trump said in a statement."

Many knew him as the ultimate bridge builder. Rabbi Eckstein started IFCJ in 1983. Since then, the humanitarian organization has generated more than $1.5 billion to help Jews in Israel, the former Soviet Union, and more than 58 other countries.
Today, Eckstein's daughter Yael is carrying on that legacy.
In a video message tape shortly before his death, Eckstein charged his daughter Yael with the mantle of his ministry.
""I miss my father. I still can't comprehend and internalize I'm never going to see him again or get a hug from him. But I also feel a lot of light. I feel a lot of peace. I see a lot of God's hand within the tragedy,"" Eckstein told CBN News .
Yael says her dad left a rich and prophetic work for her to lead.
""Everywhere I look it's prophetic,"" she explained. ""Suddenly, we have Christians bringing from the Biblical land of the north, Jewish people on wings of eagles home to Israel. That's prophecy. That's what Isaiah and Jeremiah -- this is what they saw 2,000 years ago. They were having the visions of us sitting here in Jerusalem.""

Rabbi Eckstein pursued three goals: build bridges between Christians and Jews, deepen Christian understanding of the Jewish roots of their faith, and develop a practical way to help the Jewish people and Israel.
Yael believes that effort is more important than ever with the alarming rise in anti-Semitism.
""It's in the American government. It's no longer fringe,"" she said. ""There's always been a fringe of anti-Semitism in America. You've always had the KKK, but they were taboo.

""The circumstances under which the PLO Central Council is meeting are very difficult, especially in wake of the upcoming 'deal of the century,'"" said Fatah Central Committee member Jamal Muhessein.

The group will also discuss security cooperation between the PA and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Last year, the PCC urged the PA to stop coordinating with Israel on security matters and refuse to recognize Israel as a state until a Palestinian state has been created.
Abbas' speech before Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo Sunday hinted at a potential breakdown in relations between Israel and the PA.
Abbas suggested that the PA was considering revoking all signed agreements with Israel. The PA president accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of not wanting peace with Palestinians and said Israel has failed to implement its agreements with the Palestinians.

Dangerous Tactic: Democrat Lawmakers 'Weaponize' Religion,www1.cbn.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/dangerous-tactic-democrat-lawmakers-weaponize-religion,"Dangerous Tactic: Democrat Lawmakers 'Weaponize' Religion
WASHINGTON – There's a dangerous tactic resurfacing in politics, mostly among lawmakers on the far left. It involves a new line of questioning coming from Democrat senators during confirmation hearings, and it has Church leaders warning lawmakers to tread carefully.
Biblical beliefs are being referred to far too often as a disqualifier for public office. In the last few years, it's happened to Trump nominees like Mike Pompeo , Amy Coney Barrett , Russell Vought , and Neomi Rao.
""The weaponization of religion means: the use and exploitation of faith for partisan political ends, in terms of political warfare,"" said Rev. Eugene Rivers, founder and director of the Seymour Institute for Black Church and Policy Studies.
Anti-Catholic Bigotry Hints at a Larger Problem
In December, Democrat Senators Kamala Harris, now a presidential candidate, and Hawaii's Mazie Hirono questioned a federal judicial nominee about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, the well-known Catholic service organization.
They asked Brian Buescher whether he shared the groups ""extremist"" values and if he would be able to judge certain cases fairly.
""They were taking shots at Catholics. It doesn't have to be the Knights of Columbus. They were taking shots at Catholics regarding pro-life and their views on marriage, OK that's the bottom line,"" Rev. Rivers said.
""This was a case of clear ideological bigotry, it was unfair and it is part of a larger problem that exists in this society,"" he continued.
Rivers says members of all faiths should defend religious liberty.
""I should be free to believe in my God or to believe in no God. But in either case, I should not be subjected to some ideological test that is used as the criteria or the basis for assessing my right to engage in public life,"" he said.
Faith in Politics
In 1960 democrat John F. Kennedy worked to convince Americans that he could be both a good Catholic and a good public servant.
""If this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being president on the day they were baptized then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history and in the eyes of our own people,"" Kennedy said during a speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association.
Rev. Rivers says if certain senators refuse to see the good contributions from people of faith, they should at least commit to upholding the Constitution.
US Constitution: No Religious Tests
Article 6 states: ""No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.""
The Senate passed a resolution at the beginning of the year saying it would be unconstitutional to consider membership in the Knights of Columbus disqualifying criteria for public office. It passed unanimously.
""In this, we are simply reaffirming with President Kennedy, and with countless other Americans across 230 years, Protestant and Catholic, Jew and Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist, Agnostic, Atheist, and more. We are simply reaffirming the idea that America is big enough for disagreements,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE).
In 1960, then-candidate Kennedy responded to bigotry with a warning that Rev. Rivers echoes today.
""For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been, and may someday be again, a Jew, or a Quaker, or a Unitarian, or a Baptist,"" Kennedy said in his Houston speech.
""Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril,"" he continued."
US Offers $10M Award for Information on Hezbollah's Terror Money Network,www1.cbn.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/us-offers-10m-award-for-information-on-hezbollahs-terror-money-network,"US Offers $10M Award for Information on Hezbollah's Terror Money Network 04-23-2019 Emily Jones
The United States is offering up to $10 million to anyone who can provide ""information leading to the disruption of financial activities that support the global terrorist organization Lebanese Hezbollah,"" Assistant Secretary of Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff announced Monday.
The State Department's initiative is called ""Rewards for Justice"" and seeks to curtail Hezbollah's terror activities in the Middle East by targeting the group's finances.
Evanoff pointed out Hezbollah's key source of income – Iran.
""The Lebanese-based terrorist organization, which the State Department designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in October 1997, receives weapons, training, funding from Iran. The Secretary of State designated Iran as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1984,"" Evanoff said during a press conference about the program.
""In previous years, Hezbollah has generated about $1 billion annually through direct financial support from Iran, international businesses and investments, donor networks, and money-laundering activities. The group uses these funds to support its malign activities throughout the world, which includes the development of militia to Syria in the support of Assad dictatorship; and to Yemen in support of the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels; surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations in the American homeland; and enhanced military capabilities, including its claim to possess precision-guided missiles,"" he added.
The US intends to stem Hezbollah's continuous flow of money through the reward offer, along with sanctions and other tools.
The State Department urges anyone with information on Hezbollah's financial networks to contact the Rewards for Justice Program through its website, rewardsforjustice.net or via email at [email protected] .
Individuals outside the United States may also contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. All information submitted will be kept strictly confidential.
The State Department also highlighted three key individuals as Hezbollah financiers or leaders, including Adham Tabaja, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi and Ali Youssef Charara.
""We will pay for bank records, customs forms, real estate transactions, and anything evidencing money laundering or cash smuggling,"" Evanoff said. ""The United States government is prepared to pay for this information, and we will award up to $10 million for leads that result in financial disruption. Whether by US law enforcement sanctions or other enforcement actions.""
This is not the first time the US has offered money in exchange for information on terrorists.
The United States Government has paid more than $150 million to over a hundred people who have provided critical information that resulted in the imprisonment of terrorists or prevents them from participating in acts of international terrorism.
""I'm confident that the (reward) that we are offering today, will provide incentives for people to come forward with information that will help us take down Hezbollah's financial networks,"" said Evanoff."

KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) - A man regularly volunteered to fly sick people in remote parts of the country to hospitals in Houston and Dallas was at the controls of a twin-engine airplane that crashed Monday in the Hill Country of central Texas, killing all six aboard. Jeffrey C. Weiss, 65, was a senior vice president for investments at Raymond James and Associates in Houston. The Texas Department of Public Safety said Weiss, who co-owned the Beechcraft BE58, was at the controls when the aircraft went down just before 9 a.m. Monday while approaching Kerrville Municipal Airport, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio. Also killed were Stuart Roben Kensinger, 55; Angela Webb Kensinger, 54; Mark Damien Scioneaux, 58; Scott Reagan Miller, 55; and Marc Tellepsen, 45, all of Houston, said DPS Sgt. Orlando Moreno. The aircraft went down just before 9 a.m. as it approached an airport in Kerrville, a city about 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Lynn Lunsford. State law enforcement officials secured the crash site ahead of FAA and National Transportation Safety Board investigators' arrival Monday. The aircraft had taken from an airport outside Houston earlier Monday and crashed about 6 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of Kerrville Municipal Airport, Lunsford said. The flight was not a scheduled commercial route, he said. The downed plane was manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft in 1999 and was co-owned by Weiss and Charles Morina of Dallas, according to FAA records. Weiss loved to fly and the pair volunteered their time transporting sick people from remote regions to Texas hospitals for Angel Flight, Morina said. ""We flew people from all over the country to Dallas and Houston"" for medical treatment, he told The Associated Press. The cause of the crash hasn't been determined. However, witnesses heard the plane struggling and sputtering moments before it crashed. ""It was making a sput-sput sputtering sound, like the engines were cutting out,"" Treva Hardeman, who was working at home about a quarter mile from where the aircraft crashed, told the San Antonio Express-News . ""It was just a few seconds later that I heard the boom."" Construction worker Rodney Simmons said he heard a plane ""struggle against the wind."" ""I looked over and watched him drop down out of the clouds,"" Simmons told the Express-News. ""The rear end of the plane was real low, like he was trying to stay in the air. It was like he was dragging the tail end of that plane. Like he had a lot of weight in the back or something."" The plane flew southward into the wind, Simmons said, then ""banked to the right, real hard, and just flipped on over, upside down, and nose-dived to the ground."" The family of one of the six people killed in the crash of a twin-engine aircraft in the Texas Hill Country said the purpose of the flight was to survey some property. In a statement to KTRK-TV of Houston, the family of Houston landscape architect Marc Teppesen said he and associate Mark Scioneaux were on the scouting trip when Houston architect Scott Reagan Miller, Houston real estate investor Stuart Kensinger and his wife Angela Kensinger, and Houston investment banker Jeffrey Weiss died in the Monday plane crash. Weiss was a philanthropist who not only flew the sick to hospitals but was active in charities supporting children with special needs or who suffered abuse, said friend Bob Fuller. He told KPRC-TV of Houston that Weiss helped him conduct his Keels and Wheels charity event in Seabrook each year to aid abused children, giving both his time and money. ""I loved the man, I'll tell you that. He was generous to a fault. He wanted to support our charity any way he can and one of those was if I wanted to fly to Detroit to talk to General Motors, 'Call me first,'"" Fuller said.

'Impeachment Lite': Democrats Walking Fine Line on Trump Removal,www1.cbn.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/impeachment-lite-democrats-walking-fine-line-on-trump-removal,"Regent University Law Dean Mark Martin Debunks Obstruction Charges Against Trump
Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership are walking a fine line. In a conference call Monday, members said they are ready to move forward with investigations, but not impeachment. Although the Mueller report found no evidence of collusion with the Russians, they’re focusing on at least 10 potential incidents of obstruction of justice listed in the report.
The special counsel made no determination on obstruction, but Democrats have two points of concern.
One was the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. The Mueller report says the president took that action because Comey would not state publicly that the president was not under investigation.
The second has to do with Robert Mueller himself. The special counsel's report says the president asked former White House Counsel Don McGhan to fire Mueller.
Appearing on Fox News, former Trump attorney John Dowd says he briefed the president every day about the Mueller investigation.
""At no time did the president ever say, 'You know John I'm going to get rid of him, John it's not going to do it. It was just the opposite,"" Dowd recalled. ""Here's the message the president had for Bob Mueller for me, to carry: 'One. You tell him I respect what he is doing. Number two. You tell him he's got my full cooperation.'""
Regardless, Democrats in the House are moving forward with their investigations. The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed McGhan to testify.
And battling for the votes from the party's left wing, some Democratic candidates for president are calling for Trump's impeachment.
Among them? Kamala Harris who said, ""This president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice. I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.""
And Elizabeth Warren said, ""This is about principle and that's why I've asked the House to start impeachment proceedings.""
At this point the Democratic leadership feels impeachment may hurt the party. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is advising against it.
Appearing on the CBN News program Faith Nation, ABC News Political Director Rick Klein said he expects what he calls, ""impeachment lite.""
""It's going to look like impeachment, but I don't think they're going to go as far as to say these are impeachment proceedings..."" Klein explained.
At the White House Monday, President Trump appeared confident that he'll be able to ride this one out. A reporter asked, ""Are you worried about impeachment, Mr. President?"" Trump responded, ""Not even a little bit.""
The president isn't worried because the Mueller report cleared him of colluding with the Russians. And Trump's defenders say because he wasn't guilty of that, then he's not guilty of obstruction because there was no crime for the president to obstruct."

Box office success for ""Unplanned"" continues to grow after total sales hit $17.2 million this weekend. With only a $6 million budget, Pureflix's pro-life movie started making a profit on its opening weekend, after debuting with $6.1 million.
But box office success isn't the only goal for the film's supporters. It's about changing hearts and lives. So one group is even planning to air the film on the public sidewalk right in front of the Planned Parenthood abortion clinic in Washington, DC at 1225 4th St. NE.
Their original plan to show it on Good Friday was delayed by weather, but they're still planning to show it at that location. More here.
""Our hope is to launch a nationwide campaign to eventually show 'Unplanned' in front of Planned Parenthood abortion clinics across America,"" explained Rev. Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition which is sponsoring this special viewing.
The film's success comes despite roadblocks from the entertainment industry.
""'Unplanned' has been censored and discriminated against by social media giants, television networks and other outlets,"" Mahoney says. He says it has faced an unprecedented blockade from Google and Twitter, with ads also being blocked by TV networks like Hallmark, Bravo, The Food Network, and Lifetime.
The movie is based on the pro-life transformation of a former Planned Parenthood abortion clinic director named Abby Johnson.
CBN News recently reported close to 100 abortion clinic workers have left their jobs since seeing the film.
During his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Chuck Konzelman, director of ""Unplanned"", said 94 clinic workers have approached Abby Johnson's nonprofit, And Then There Were None , about leaving the abortion industry, according to Pure Flix Insider.
In a recent interview with Fox News, Ashley Bratcher, the actress who portrays Abby Johnson, shared her response to the impact the movie has made on many lives.
""The response had been incredibly positive. I mean, through it all – this has been the most rewarding and fulfilling role I've ever had in my entire career,"" Bratcher told 'Fox & Friends'. ""To be able to hear someone come up to you and say, 'I was so affected by your work that I decided instead of having an abortion, that I'm now going to have my child' – I don't know how to really explain the way that feels to know that you could have potentially just saved a life.""
""There's not a lot of actors who get to say that, and I am so honored to be able to have a part of this,"" she added.
Abby Johnson recently joined senior pastor of megachurch Free Chapel Church, Jentezen Franklin, for his 'Life Is Beautiful' Conference. More than 4,000 people were encouraged to speak out against abortion at the event.
Franklin encouraged grace for those who had an abortion or worked in abortion industry.
""With just as much passion and just as much fervency, we are going to extend grace and compassion to anyone who has experienced an abortion, been anyway involved in it, we're not mad at you. Jesus loves you and we love you. And we're here to walk through life. We're all flawed people. We need God's grace,"" he said. ""We can make our world a place that values life because life is beautiful."""

The Islamic State terrorist group is claiming responsibility for the terror attacks that killed more than 300 people in Sri Lanka Easter Sunday. And Sri Lanka's defense minister says the bombings were carried out in retaliation for the attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March.
Those shootings at two New Zealand mosques last month left at least 50 people dead. While the defense minister made the claim before Sri Lanka's parliament, he didn't provide evidence to back up the statement or give a source for his information.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed the public that certain officials had previously received intelligence that potential attacks could happen.
""By now it has been established that the intelligence units were aware of this attack and a group of responsible people were informed about the impending attack,"" he said . ""However, this information had been circulated among only a few officials.""
AP reports two other government ministers were aware of the advance knowledge.
Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando tweeted: ""Some intelligence officers were aware of this incidence. Therefore there was a delay in action. Serious action needs to be taken as to why this warning was ignored.""
The Catholic Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, is demanding justice for the massacre of Christian worshippers, stating the attacks could have been prevented.
""We placed our hands on our heads when we came to know that these deaths could have been avoided. Why this was not prevented?"" he said.
The new information comes after three unexploded bombs blew up Monday inside a van parked near one of the three churches as police were trying to defuse them.
The bombs follow Sunday's bombings at three churches and three luxury hotels in Sri Lanka's deadliest violence since a civil war ended in 2009. The death toll has soared to 321 with another 500 injured.
Now, the government has shut down social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, granted the military heightened powers, and established a curfew.
The prime minister fears the massacre could cause instability, vowing to ""vest all necessary powers with the defense forces"" to act against those responsible.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Washington that he spoke to the prime minister and offered assistance, and now the FBI is helping with the investigation. Several Americans were killed in the church bombings. ""This is America's fight, too,"" Pompeo said. ""We also stand with millions of Sri Lankans who support the freedom of their fellow citizens to worship as they please. We take confidence in knowing that not even atrocities like this one will deter them from respecting religious freedom."""

Odd timing for an anti-Christian attack I’m not sure of Mr. West’s alleged experience with Christian missionaries, but it does strike me as extremely distasteful, if not fundamentally bizarre, that he would choose to launch into a tirade of personal grievances about missiology off the back of one of the most bloody atrocities committed against the Christian community in recent memory.
In addition, West makes no attempt to substantiate his claims that missionaries prey mercilessly on the poor and swindle some sort of “food for conversion” operation that would put even the most heinous fraudster to shame.
Missionaries are incredible My personal experience with missionaries, whether it is the hard-working, compassionate and sacrificial workers sent out from my small local church, or those commissioned by larger organizations, is that they are some of the most wonderfully Jesus-like people on the planet.
In addition, there are thousands of Spirit-filled mission workers who sacrifice their personal income and comfortable lives to live in various impoverished and disease-ridden corners of the earth — and why? For the love of their neighbor. Nothing more, nothing less.
In his tirade, West argued that missionaries are known to “press one religion onto another by brainwashing desperate children,” calling this “a Western tradition that only leads to misery.”
Most - though not all - of those ""good Christian soldiers"" thought they were doing God's good work. Perhaps we should forgive people their delusions but trying to press one religion onto another by brainwashing desperate children is a Western tradition that only leads to misery.

Again, I don’t know what his sources are, but I can tell you that from my own encounters with those engaging in foreign mission, this is unequivocally untrue.
“Love each other as I have loved you” See, many ministry organizations, while Christian, do not actively “evangelize” those who they have been called to serve. Instead, they love them unconditionally, as this is the type of unfathomable affection that God has shown to them through Christ Jesus.
That, Mr. West, is a wonderful and glorious thing that should never be unfairly criticized or smeared.
In fact, many of the world’s leading charitable organizations have religious origins, though they are not overtly religious or evangelistic in their activities. World Vision is a great example. Very, very few groups with any sort of global-reaching influence adhere to a sort of militant or “no-nonsense” evangelism that neglects the holistic call to love and care for the other.
So, though West’s raging against those who do their good works in the name of Jesus might be unfair, ill-advised and frankly unpleasant, let us not respond in anger. Let us instead pray for all those who have given up so much to become the hands and feet of Christ to those in need.

"Study Shows Millennials Love 'Free' Government Programs, Then They Find out 'Free' Doesn't Mean 'Free'",www1.cbn.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/new-study-shows-millennials-love-free-government-programs-until-they-find-out-free-doesnt-mean-free,"Study Shows Millennials Love 'Free' Government Programs, Then They Find out 'Free' Doesn't Mean 'Free' 04-23-2019 Christian Ellis
A new survey by the Harvard Institute of Politics shows 18-to-29-year-old voters will play a vital role in the Democratic campaigns for the 2020 presidential election, making up more than a third of eligible voters. The reason for the overwhelming support: ""free"" programs.
In the latest example of government aid for millennials, Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced her plan Monday to erase college debt. She's just one of the many Democratic 2020 candidates, some of whom have increasingly played upon the stresses of millennials, declaring their policies will ""ease"" the burdens they're facing.
""It is no secret that social media has exacerbated the stress and anxiety that is already so prevalent in the late-teen and early-adulthood years of young Americans. However, for the first time, we now have evidence that the state of our politics is contributing to the mental health challenges millions of young Americans already face,"" said John Della Volpe, director of polling for the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School.
""To empower young voters, to persuade them to vote requires candidates willing to share and align their values with this emerging generation -- and understanding the stress inherent in our politics today is a critical first step,"" he added.
However, the survey indicates the support of young people lowers once they find out the programs are not really ""free.""
Interviewing more than 3,000 young people, the survey shows the percentage for the two biggest campaign promises to young people drops after they find out the truth.
Support for White House hopeful Bernie Sander's elimination of private health insurance in favor of a single government plan falls from 55% to below 47% when young people were told the program would cost $2.5 trillion a year.
""Health care is a human right, not a privilege,"" Sanders told supporters at a recent campaign rally.
""Medicare for All is a dream, but the dream comes at a price,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).
The number also decreased from 56% to 51% when young people were told ""free"" college would cost $47 billion a year. Certain Democrat hopefuls like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand have pushed the notion for ""free"" college for ""students for families that make up to $125,000 per year,"" and all community colleges free for ""all income levels."""
'Impeachment Lite': Democrats Walking Fine Line on Trump Removal,www.cbn.com,Gary Lane,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/impeachment-lite-democrats-walking-fine-line-on-trump-removal,"Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership are walking a fine line. In a conference call Monday, members said they are ready to move forward with investigations, but not impeachment. Although the Mueller report found no evidence of collusion with the Russians, they’re focusing on at least 10 potential incidents of obstruction of justice listed in the report.
The special counsel made no determination on obstruction, but Democrats have two points of concern.
One was the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. The Mueller report says the president took that action because Comey would not state publicly that the president was not under investigation.
The second has to do with Robert Mueller himself. The special counsel's report says the president asked former White House Counsel Don McGhan to fire Mueller.
Appearing on Fox News, former Trump attorney John Dowd says he briefed the president every day about the Mueller investigation.
""At no time did the president ever say, 'You know John I'm going to get rid of him, John it's not going to do it. It was just the opposite,"" Dowd recalled. ""Here's the message the president had for Bob Mueller for me, to carry: 'One. You tell him I respect what he is doing. Number two. You tell him he's got my full cooperation.'""
Regardless, Democrats in the House are moving forward with their investigations. The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed McGhan to testify.
And battling for the votes from the party's left wing, some Democratic candidates for president are calling for Trump's impeachment.
Among them? Kamala Harris who said, ""This president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice. I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.""
And Elizabeth Warren said, ""This is about principle and that's why I've asked the House to start impeachment proceedings.""
At this point the Democratic leadership feels impeachment may hurt the party. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is advising against it.
Appearing on the CBN News program Faith Nation, ABC News Political Director Rick Klein said he expects what he calls, ""impeachment lite.""
""It's going to look like impeachment, but I don't think they're going to go as far as to say these are impeachment proceedings..."" Klein explained.
At the White House Monday, President Trump appeared confident that he'll be able to ride this one out. A reporter asked, ""Are you worried about impeachment, Mr. President?""
Trump responded, ""Not even a little bit.""
The president isn't worried because the Mueller report cleared him of colluding with the Russians. And Trump's defenders say because he wasn't guilty of that, then he's not guilty of obstruction because there was no crime for the president to obstruct."

"As ISIS Claims Responsibility for Sri Lanka Church Bombings, Official Claims Retaliation for NZ Mosque Massacre",www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-23-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/as-isis-claims-responsibility-for-sri-lanka-church-bombings-official-claims-retaliation-for-nz-mosque-massacre,"The Islamic State terrorist group is claiming responsibility for the terror attacks that killed more than 300 people in Sri Lanka Easter Sunday. And Sri Lanka's defense minister says the bombings were carried out in retaliation for the attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March.
Those shootings at two New Zealand mosques last month left at least 50 people dead. While the defense minister made the claim before Sri Lanka's parliament, he didn't provide evidence to back up the statement or give a source for his information.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed the public that certain officials had previously received intelligence that potential attacks could happen.
""By now it has been established that the intelligence units were aware of this attack and a group of responsible people were informed about the impending attack,"" he said . ""However, this information had been circulated among only a few officials.""
AP reports two other government ministers were aware of the advance knowledge.
Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando tweeted: ""Some intelligence officers were aware of this incidence. Therefore there was a delay in action. Serious action needs to be taken as to why this warning was ignored.""
The Catholic Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, is demanding justice for the massacre of Christian worshippers, stating the attacks could have been prevented.
""We placed our hands on our heads when we came to know that these deaths could have been avoided. Why this was not prevented?"" he said.
The new information comes after three unexploded bombs blew up Monday inside a van parked near one of the three churches as police were trying to defuse them.
The bombs follow Sunday's bombings at three churches and three luxury hotels in Sri Lanka's deadliest violence since a civil war ended in 2009. The death toll has soared to 321 with another 500 injured.
Now, the government has shut down social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, granted the military heightened powers, and established a curfew.
The prime minister fears the massacre could cause instability, vowing to ""vest all necessary powers with the defense forces"" to act against those responsible.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Washington that he spoke to the prime minister and offered assistance, and now the FBI is helping with the investigation. Several Americans were killed in the church bombings.
""This is America's fight, too,"" Pompeo said. ""We also stand with millions of Sri Lankans who support the freedom of their fellow citizens to worship as they please. We take confidence in knowing that not even atrocities like this one will deter them from respecting religious freedom."""
